TIP! Photography in light that is too low is a challenge you need to master, because the low light can turn out blurry pictures. To reduce blurring, be certain that your hands refrain from shaking.
Laptops are great to use for a lot of different reasons. You can use your laptop to assist you with work, school, gaming and other experiences. Current laptop owners do a lot of things with them, but you don’t get to be one of them if you buy the wrong one. This article will go over some simple and important tips to help you buy the best one.
If you’re thinking of getting a tablet along with a laptop, you may think over getting a convertible laptop. Convertible laptops work both as a laptop and as a laptop. You just connect the keyboard when you want a laptop.
You can often find great laptop deals from home shopping networks. These sites let you pay in installments without a credit check. Just for about a hundred a month you can probably get yourself a good laptop that you’ve been wanting.
Before you buy your laptop, do an online search for coupons or discounts that you can use. There could be none out there, but you should still search for them. You don’t want to pay full price and then find out that there was a discount you could have used.
Know how much you’re going to spend on your new computer before you go shopping. When figuring out your budget, consider what kind of laptop you want. Do you want a Mac or a PC? Macs have great graphics and are good for those that work in this type of environment.
Your laptop computer will last longer and run better if you keep it from overheating with a laptop cooling pad. If your laptop computer gets too hot, it could malfunction. You can purchase a cooling pad for your laptop for around $20 to keep it alive longer.
Make sure you think about how heavy a laptop you want. You should choose a lightweight laptop if you’ll be carrying it frequently. A heavy one can cause stiffness, soreness and even back injury. Lighter doesn’t always mean more expensive. But battery life will not be as high.
Before you plop down your hard earned money for a new computer, take the model that interests you for a spin. Most folks ignore the concept of ergonomics when computer shopping, focusing on battery life and memory instead. Yet, you can negatively influence your physical comfort and health if you get a laptop with bad ergonomics, so be mindful of this when shopping.
When purchasing a laptop online, do not buy extra word processing software that will be installed in advance. Usually, if you do that, you pay full price for those productivity and word proceessing programs. It’s better to purchase this software separately from a discount online vendor. You can save 20-30% or more.
Remember to consider battery life as you shop for your laptop. Even if you are not planning on traveling with it, you don’t want to worry about recharging it all the time. You should be able to use your battery power for at least four hours.
Look at online retailers for your laptop. Often, you will find better deals there than at your local electronics store. You can increase your savings by locating an online coupon. Look online before buying one in the store.
Before you buy a laptop, think about how long it will be until your computer is obsolete. New technology can make your new laptop seem like a dinosaur. Upgrading one step up can mean that you get a laptop that last for several years, rather than only one year.
Check to see if the RAM and the computer’s hard drive can be upgraded before purchasing a computer. It may not be necessary now, but could help you out later. Should this be necessary, you can upgrade instead of a costly laptop replacement. Think about this prior to making your final purchase decision.
Think about whether you want to have a Windows or Mac laptop for your next laptop purchase. Usually it costs you less to get a laptop with Windows on it, but there are people that swear by Macs. Take some time to check out both thoroughly when doing your shopping. Then you can look online for reviews of the models you’re considering.
Remember to include accessories in your laptop budget. For example, you may need a backpack or computer case, a wireless mouse and any number of other accessories. You’ll want to have money set aside for that. Look online to get an estimate of the price of each and build it into your budget one by one.
Get a laptop that has a number of USB ports. USB ports are easily overlooked but remain quite important. You may want to connect a laptop, mouse, memory card and other things that need a USB port at the same time. Four would be perfect, but the more you have, the more flexibility you achieve.
Be gentle with your laptop when you are traveling with it. Get a firm sturdy bag so that it is not swinging and banging against you while you walk. Over time this consistent banging may damage the components of your laptop.
Think about a protection plan as you purchase a laptop if you intend to move it around a lot, since laptops like this run a higher risk of damage or accident. Protection plans often yield major savings if the computer gets dropped or harmed in some way. Read the coverage details carefully before buying.
Because laptops travel around a lot with their owners, the risk of having an accident can be high. Consider getting an extended plan that provides some protection when you purchase a laptop. If your laptop is dropped or damaged somehow, a protection plan might save your money. You should know the coverage details before buying.
Consider getting an extended warranty on your laptop. Getting your laptop repaired is going to cost you money, and so will getting the whole thing replaced. Purchasing an extended warranty can save you a lot of money.
Do not only purchase based on the brand name. Brand name products are generally more expensive. Understand the way the laptop is built since this will help you determine if you find something similar for a cheaper price. Under the radar brands can offer comparable products at lower prices.
Look at the ports on the laptop before buying it. You will need several ports in order to use a printer, a mouse and a external hard drive. Make sure you know the ports that you need and that they are available.
If you have a laptop that you can’t afford because it’s just too much extra, think over getting a model that has been refurbished. The price can look good, and if there’s a good warranty, there isn’t much risk. Most work just great and provide massive value on terrific machines.
To control the power on your laptop, try tweaking its power usage settings. There is a Power Options link on the Control Panel. This will help you with the settings. How bright your laptop is and how long it takes to put your laptop into hibernation mode will be two things you really want to think about carefully.
When choosing a laptop, the biggest factor should be what you are going to use it for most. Some computers are built for gaming, while others are more appropriate for work. Look for a computer that is geared toward what you primarily use a computer for.
After buying your laptop, make sure you continue to test it thoroughly. There is often a return policy set around 30 days. Try every feature out to ensure you will be happy. Use this time to ensure that your laptop is going to be a great match for you and your needs.
Take the laptop’s mouse into consideration. There are many built-in designs out there. No matter if you like a button mouse, track pad or ball mouse, it is important to know your needs and desires. It’s always best to begin with the one that you’re interested in the most to start. If you need to make a change later on, you can.
When it comes to laptops, brand only matters regarding its reputation. Look at other’s views on certain brands. You may be surprised to see that they all seem to be quite similar, so brand may not be particularly important.
Consider saving some money on your laptop by opting for models with less storage space. For most purposes, a terabyte of memory is not necessary. Try getting something that has less space so that you save money. Get a better processor with your savings.
If shopping for a laptop online, be sure to deal only with sites that offer free shipping. You can save a lot of money by finding free shipping.
Only ship your laptop in the proper shipping box. Most shipping places offer kits that can be used to ship laptops safely. Think about buying one even if you decide to use another carrier for shipping.
Laptops are ideal for people who enjoy gaming. The best laptop brands make devices with gaming in mind. If you decide on a different route, you must research those features by yourself.
Checking user reviews for the laptop that you are considering is a great way to get a true idea of the good and bad things about it. In fact, you may learn a thing or two prior to the arrival of your laptop by looking for expert insight online.
Think twice before purchasing an extended warranty with your laptop. The store makes money from these, but they aren’t worth the cost. Many of the problems you can encounter with electronics happen early, and are covered by standard manufacturer warranties. If you would like a warranty that is longer, buy a laptop from an online company that offers lengthy warranties with each purchase.
When buying a new laptop, always go for the fastest processor that will fit within your budget. There are lots of computers that have large processors now. It would be bad if your cheaper processor was obsolete in a short period of time. Plan ahead and purchase the biggest and fastest one you have the money for today.
Purchase a multi-core processor with as much memory as you can afford. With large processors becoming more available, designers and programmers are using this speed and space quickly. Take care to choose a processor that will not soon be obsolete. It’s smarter to invest in a laptop that will serve you well into the future with ample storage and power.
Know the needed specifications for your system. To play cutting edge video games, you want the latest processor and graphics card. If you will be using your computer for documents, you can save money by buying a laptop that offers fewer features.
If you purchase your new laptop from an Internet merchant, make sure you don’t throw away the box it arrived in. That is going to help if you have to ship it someday. It will also come in handy for travel or moving.
Deciding between a PC or a Mac for your laptop is easy when you focus on how you will use the computer. If you are using it at work, it should have the same OS as all the other computers used by the company. If you have multiple computers at home, they too should have the same operating system.
When choosing whether to purchase a Mac or a PC, you should carefully consider several things. If you’re using it for work, it ought to use the same OS that your work computers use. If it’s for home use, networking can be simpler using the same OS, as well.
When you checking out laptops, pay attention to the keyboard and the touchpad. Tough keys and sensitive keypads can make using the laptop difficult. Some brands are said to have better keyboards, but it is best to test it for yourself at the store.
There are a number of things that need to be gone over prior to getting the laptop of your choice. Use this information to make sure your laptop does what you want it to. Your computer should not be less than what you want.
To make sure the laptop you are buying works with your style, look at the mouse. Different makers of laptops all have different mice, and it is likely that you naturally gravitate toward one at the expense of another. You must check a laptop fully before you buy it.

Thanks! Great information. As an advanced novice worker, I finally decided to build my first bench a couple years ago. After reading several of your blogs knowing full well mortised dove tale leg joinery is yet beyond my capability, I elected to build Robert Lang’s “21st Century Workbench”. I also chose his VERITAS Twin Screw Vise in the face vise position. Used an old Craftsman face vise in the tail vise position. Constructed of laminated 9/4 x 31/2″ Pecan and 60″ long because of my small crowed shop. Super happy to this point. As I mature in woodworking I may live to construct one of a different choice at a latter date, but I’m 73 so we’ll see. Thanks again for the advise.
At the age of 9, Mark’s interest in woodworking began, which led him to begin an apprenticeship with Homestead Heritage Furniture at the age of 17. In his own shop he has built many pieces of furniture from small dovetail boxes to large 10′ round conference tables. Most of his work has been for clients who have ordered custom pieces for their homes and offices. Mark has been building custom furniture for the last 20 years and is now the manager of the Heritage Furniture business. Mark enjoys making hand tools and jigs that can simplify the building process. He has taught children how to shape simple utensils like wooden spoons and cutting boards as well as other larger projects. “Seeing the young grow to maturity in their craft is what I appreciate.”
Learn basic principles of working with wood while making your own carved wooden spoon. Topics covered include different types of wood, grain direction, carving, shaping, and food safe finishes. Through short demonstrations and lectures, we will use a combination of power and hand tools, exploring the material for its functionality as a creative medium. At the end of the workshop, students leave with a unique spoon, ready to use! All materials included.
Timberframing is a traditional technique for building large and small structures using only wooden joinery. Prized for its structural integrity and beauty, as well as reliance on hand skills, timberframing is regaining popularity in modern applications. We will start with an overview of the different styles and aesthetics involved, and move into the specific tools that are used to lay out and cut the strong joints. Each student gets guided practice time making sample joints. We will all work together to make a small structure that can be raised on the final day of class.
1. You mention doing other hobbies which I assume means stuff scattered around for various projects. (Don't tell me you do one at a time or are a neat freak!!!) How tall are the side walls to the shed? How high do you shuffle stuff around, i.e. flipping things over, moving wood around, etc? I can't imagine trying to do that in my shed, even if it were 2 ft higher than it's 7 ft center height. If you could build a platform in front it may help, especially if you can put removable cover over it (to please HOA).
It is one of the easiest woodwork projects we are going to discuss today. Although it looks very easy to make, I still could not find any good tutorial on the internet that explains how to build this one. So I am here sharing an article link that gets the closest. The article explains how to make different kinds of DIY candle holders and what items you may need for the project.
As I was handling the 2x4's, during the routing, I realized that I really wouldn't be happy with the look of the bench, if it were made from these unfinished boards. They had stamps, pencil marks, and more importantly, incipient splinters left by the saw, none of which I wanted. And I was remembering what other shop furniture made from unfinished pine had looked like, after a few years in the grime of a shop.
A woodworking school teaching furniture making techniques located in Pennsylvania. Beginner through advanced students will learn solid wood furniture construction using traditional and modern techniques. The classes emphasize wood movement, practical methods, efficiency (with machines and hand tools), design, milling, joinery, finishing, and safety. Woodworking and furniture making courses are offered to aspiring crafts men and women throughout the country.
You are absolutely right on your advise. When I was agonizing over how to build a workbench my good friend turned me on to your book on workbenches. I was planning on having an overhang until I read your advise about building a workbench and not a table. So the entire front and rear surfaces; top, legs and bottom shelf are all in the same plane to clamp my work to. The addition of a sliding dead man was also something that I would have never thought of on my own. Thanks again for your advise.
I agree that I might quickly outgrow a 12x8 shed. Lowes also offers a 12x10 Rancher (same style, but more room), but the 12x10 is 9 feet, 4 inches high, and my community only allows a maximum height of 9 feet. The 12x8 is exactly 9 feet high. I'm afraid of getting "out of spec" if I exceed the height limit and then getting in trouble with the Home Owner's Association. Having said that, 12x10 would be about the biggest size I could get for the available area in my back yard, so even if I hire a shed contractor to do this, the shed would have to be 12x10 or smaller.

I thought my first wood working bench was great.A heavy c channel metal frame with a recycled maple floor top with a guick release 7 in vice on the side.It is about 40in by 54in and can hold a hemi no problem. I waxed the top till it was nice and resistant to whatever was dripped on it. Only problem is I was thinking like a gear head not a wood worked.Work piece would slide and no decent clamping on the sides. I figured if I wanted to get somewhat serious about this woodworking thing I needed a real bench not a table with a vice. I read the books and with so many choices I chose a Roubo split top from Benchcrafted it would let me use it for both power and hand tools. I just finished it a week ago and it is nice not to have to chase my work across the bench. I couldn’t find a clear answer for a top coat for the bench I chose to leave the soft maple nude. So I guess I have a bench tbat has a lack of modesty.
TOH has showed you how to make a toy chest with your kids before, but if you don't feel like cutting the wood yourself, opt for a kit like the one for this beautiful cherry chest. The kit comes with pre-cut pieces and all the hardware you need. Like many toy chests out there, the closed lid can also function as a bench seat, and the hinges are designed to prevent little fingers from getting caught. This model is available in three different finishes.
While $115 may seem expensive, try accurately boring a grid of 20mm holes on 96mm centers in 3/4 MDF. I have for a table for our retirement community shop - - its a pita. Plus the MFT material seems denser and more water resistant than garden-variety MDF. And the single-thickness has proven sufficient the last several years on my original 1080s. Still dead flat.
Even with all of those faults my only regret is that it is too ugly. I didn’t take the time to make it more visually attractive as I was eager to get right into making beautiful furniture instead. Twenty years later the furniture is still beautiful (or not) but I go out to the shop and look at a drab uninspiring workplace. Yeah, nothing wrong with having a visually inspiring workplace in my opinion. All that shop furniture I slapped together years ago with no concern about aesthetics is getting replaced bit by bit. Why should my shop be downright ugly when it is one of my favorite places in the world to spend my time? I see no reason for that, but that’s just my opinion and as we all know everyone has their own one of those… Sadly, no one pays nor reveres me when I offer mine. bummer, I could be a rich egotistical maniac if they did coz I sure offer it enough. 😉
I mocked up the two scenarios, and determined that with the plate inside the stretcher the vise would have a reach of 8 inches, and with it outside the stretcher it would have a reach of 9 inches. I decided that 8 inches was enough, and that the extra inch wasn't worth the extra effort. With the end vise mounted like this, the right edge of the top would have no overhang.

Out of all the shed books I have read, this book stays by my side while I hammer in the yard. The book is well written by what appears to be a non professional book writer (A Good Thing). It reads as if you are getting advise in laymans terms from your neighbor "The Craftsman", a welcome change from the DIY books, that assume a level of expertese. The level of detail is high and discusses gotcha's, advise, and trade "secrets" that could have only come from years of personal experience building sheds.

So of course, I had to look up Ripley, OH where The Rebel’s Touch is supposed to be located. They don’t have a specific Ripley map form 1860 – 1865, but they do have a map of Ohio and Indiana linked, which is pretty freaking awesome. And! A map of Kentucky and Tennessee (because Tempest is actually from Kentucky).
Now that the competition preparations are over, I have more time to read and write. I am dipping my toes into The Rebel’s Touch again, trying not to feel like a total loser for not writing for three months and for feeling completely stuck at where I did stop.
Rather than picking up the story right where I left it, last night I let my mind wander and wrote a scene that would happen a couple chapters after the current written point. The scene is internal, Tempest thinking about Daniel and how her feelings might be starting to change but she has no idea how he would react…
Not gonna lie, writing the scene almost made me cry. Sometimes there is nothing worse than the not-knowing, the wondering, the too-scared-to-ask-and-ruin-a-good-thing. Happens all the time in real life, happens in fiction, too. Heartbreak via silence is a tough thing to handle. Not sure if you have experienced it, but believe me, it’s no fun. But boy is it a great thing to draw inspiration from to write about!

Our mission is to reduce the number of homeless cats & dogs by paying for needed medical treatment and assisting with the permanent placement of these animals through our partnerships with local rescue groups.
2/16/18 – Dakota (on the left) found himself at a local municipal shelter, heart worm positive. As I’ve said many times, municipal shelters are not funded to care for animal’s medical needs, especially something as serious as heart worm. Consequently, Dakota was scheduled to be euthanized. But, before that happened, 313 K9 and Kitty Rescue contacted us to see if we could cover Dakota’s heart worm treatment. If yes, they could pull Dakota. And, because of the generosity of our supporters,the answer was ‘yes’. Dakota started his treatment yesterday. Let’s pray his treatment goes well and he goes on to living a healthy, loved life. ~ diana

We interview Curt Cloninger, author of "Fresh Styles for Web Designers" which we reviewed last Thursday. Curt's book documents top underground Web designers in an attempt to shake up the corporate world of cookie cutter Web sites.
>CC: I'm Curt Cloninger, a 32-year old guy living in Mobile, Alabama. I design Web sites; I write; and I make Net art. I do other things too, but they're not necessarily pertinent in this context.
>CC: In the "Fresh Styles" book I was mainly trying to be an apologist for creative Web design. So in order to do that, I had to explain how and why certain styles were commercially appropriate. And in order to do that, I had to dissect and analyze the styles.
When I first got into the underground Web design community, I was blown away and overwhelmed at the diversity and innovation. Then I started noticing similarities and patterns. So in order to learn better myself, I began classifying, dissecting, analyzing. "Fresh Styles" sort of grew out of that process.
The book can be read in a lot of different ways. I figured commercial designers would read it for the technical hacks, and creative directors would read it to get new visual ideas.
But I also hoped some people might read it just as an interesting introduction into experimental Web design for its own sake. So you likening me to a design/art historian is encouraging.
>WR: As you design sites how do you resolve the dual nature of the Internet? In other words, how do you resolve the fact that great sites are both aesthetically pleasing and functional?
>CC: Such resolution is indeed the goal. Obviously any site I build has to be functional. That's the difference between "pure art" and design. With pure art, I don't necessarily have to keep my "user" in mind. But with design, I'm actually making something for a user to "use," so it has to be functional by definition. Still, a good designer can't just leave aesthetics out of it.
Personally, I use Google instead of Altavista, mostly because of aesthetic considerations. The overall approach of Google says, "Come on. No BS. Get on in here and we'll find it for you." That vibe is not only conveyed by the functionality of the site (indeed, most search engines function pretty much the same), but by the humorous/non-threatening logo, the minimalistic layout, the lack of immediately visible extraneous options, etc. So in a very real sense, aesthetics improve a site's functionality, because the people using a site are not robots, but humans, susceptible to beauty. Their overall experience is affected (at least in part) by aesthetics.
>WR: There's a tension between the left and right brains, the engineers/programmers and designers/artists of the Web. How do you deal with that?
>CC: I deal with it by learning as much about both camps as I can. I think programmers and engineers do appreciate beauty. Get a reserved programmer talking about clean, efficient code, and suddenly he grows animated and passionate. Many coders actually appreciate the look of raw code on a page elegantly formatted/ indented/commented, apart from what the code even does. That's a bit extreme for me, but I do understand the fascination.
It's important that each side see the "art" in the work of the other side. The three guys at K10K are an excellent example of both camps working together. Toke and Michael are the front end/ concept designer guys. They are the rock stars. But they defer to and promote Per, their back end programmer guy, because they appreciate the magic he works. Here's a picture of the K10K crew at the Prix Ars Electronica festival in Austria (the programmer is in the middle). I'm probably oversimplifying, but to me this image is a visual representation of the way such partnerships are supposed to work.
I'm working on a customer service extranet right now with a sharp SQL/dynascript programmer who knows very little about DHTML. He values what I do because he knows it's necessary and he can't do it. I value what he does for the same reasons. Working with him on this project has been a pleasure. I watch my static design magically become dynamically populated. He watches his cryptic database magically become structured and elegant. It's a beautiful thing.
>WR: As the Web is constantly changing, do you plan on following up with a second edition/sequel to document the new styles that emerge? What other styles have you seen that you like?
>CC: If enough new styles emerge, I'd be game for a sequel. My favorite hip style these days is this sort of bubble sweet icon thing. Minimalistic vector drawings, bright colors, negative space, Flash interfaces, rollover audio, always ironic:
>CC: By no means. To say so would be to stoop to Nielsen's own overgeneralizing, bombastic level. I like Jakob. He's an engaging speaker with a dry sense of humor. Apart from his incurable propensity to overgeneralize, Nielsen's main faults stem from the way in which he sees the Web. He's coming at the Web from a GUI background, so he sees the Web as a big piece of database software that needs a front end. To me, the Web is best understood as a communications medium. Yes, the Web runs on software, but so does digital video these days. Nielsen's approach to front end Web design was ideal in 1995, and many of his tenets are still applicable today. But he's not nearly as "across-the-board" right as he seems to think.
Still, any graphic designer who dismisses Nielsen in toto is probably just reacting to his dismissing them in toto.
>WR: What sites do you like? Who are you influenced by, past and present? What corporate sites do you like? (all not mentioned in the book)
As far as influences, there are a lot, mostly cross-discipline. For instance, Brian Eno is a musician/producer whose theoretical writing influences my art. Walter Anderson is a Mississippi folk artist whose modular approach to representing nature influences my design.
Some past influences: Peter Max (unapologetic psychedelia) Odilon Redon (color as epiphany) Marshall McLuhan (prophetic theory as allegory) King David (transparent passion)
>CC: As a Net artist, I'm probably pixelated punk rock http://www.playdamage.org >. As a commercial designer, I try to stay open and let the project dictate the approach. A lot of my commercial work does wind up being more minimalistic, but that's probably due the nature of the projects I've worked on so far.
>WR: You mention your interest in an environmental approach to design, or making an environment that people can explore, where their choices modify the nature of your environment. Tell us more about that, and EmoSoft (TM).
>CC: There is a movement among Net artists these days toward certain types of "art software." A lot has been made of the "exciting" non-linear/interactive possibilities of hypertext literature; but in the end, the reader/user of hypertext lit isn't really "writing" his own story. He's merely choosing from a set of pre-defined modules and then stringing those modules together to make a story.
Compare Myst/Riven (hypermedia narratives) to something like Quake (an immersive environment). In Myst you click from frame to frame, like in a hypercard presentation. In Quake, you're in a dynamic virtual environment created by a much more complex software engine.
So when I say immersive environment, it doesn't necessarily mean "virtual reality" or some sort of Gibsonian cyberspace a la "Neuromancer." It just means software that responds more subtly and instantaneously to user input. The designer/programmer creates certain parameters within which lots of previously undefined events become possible. Some examples of this type of "art software" may be found at:
With EmoSoft (TM), I hope to construct an interactive environment that acts like a personality test. People input how they are feeling, and the software generates an abstract audio/visual representation of their feelings in real time. It will be like a kind of psychedelic emotional feedback machine - a mood ring on steroids.
I'm about to start work on this collaborative CD-ROM with a bunch of Net art freaks - sort of a faux-commercial, stream-of- consciousness, alice-in-wonderland giveaway thing. I'm giving a talk in November on the Web as a communications medium, so I'm researching that. I'm tech editing Joe Clark's book called "Building Accessible Web Sites." http://www.joeclark.org/book/ > I'm recording my next CD of lo-fi pop tunes (slowly but surely). And last but not least, I'm designing commercial Web sites for various clients.

If XML is the technology that gives Java something to do, then Perl is the language that will make XML do something useful. After all, it's the language that makes hard things easy, and the impossible, possible. It's also the best text processing language I've ever worked with.
The development of XML modules for Perl has been progressing nicely over the past year. There are now several useful modules available at the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. A good information reference on Perl in general can be found at http://www.perl.com. A Perl-XML mailing list is also available. To join, send an email to Lyris@ActiveState.com with the message: SUBSCRIBE Perl-XML.
Because XML requires strict adherence to its specification, we will not be using any of the XML modules for Perl in this article. We can, however, use Perl regular expressions to extract information from the tags.
You will also need write access to a Web server directory that allows CGI scripts to be executed. To run the scripts on your Web server:
Modify the first line of the script so that the path points to the location of Perl on your system (*nix only), i.e. #!/usr/bin/perl
Small business owners are constantly searching for new ways to increase the productivity and efficiency of their company. When productivity increases, the company is able to sell more of their products or services to the public and thus have a higher profitability potential than they previously enjoyed. By using tools designed to help improve productivity, small companies can work toward growth and development.
Accounting is a requirement of any business, regardless of size. Small businesses that might not have the funds available to hire a separate accounting division or even a single accountant can cut back on valuable time in keeping track of funds by adding accounting software to the business computer.
Accounting software increases productivity by helping the owner easily keep track of finances. By cutting back on the time spent in organizing information to add to the business books and maintaining the data through an computerized source, the owner is able to spend more time on other tasks. This results in improved productivity as the owner puts more time into creating efficient systems or working on managing the employees.
Online systems designed to keep track of payroll information are not only convenient for paying employees through direct deposit options; they help the company keep track of how much to pay in taxes for each worker, how much the company owes for taxes and deductions the company might be eligible to obtain.
Online payroll systems like payroo.com are ideal when trying to work out tax information. This not only avoids accidental mistakes when working with the IRS; it can help ensure the information is easily maintained throughout the year so tax season runs smoothly.
The iPhone application ReQall is a convenient tool for any small business owner who is constantly on the go or out with clients. This mobile app is a task management tool that helps a business owner maintain their schedule, keep information updated, take notes on their phone while away from the company computer and acts as an assistant.
The iPhone application is easy to use, convenient and does not cost anything to download as use. This makes it ideal for small companies who have limited resources available and might not have the funds to hire an assistant. The application will even convert spoken notes into a written form for the convenience of the business owner who cannot take the time to type out the message through the keyboard.
The Microsoft Office software or similar software options are key productivity tools for almost any business. With the basic tools every company needs like word processing, spreadsheets, presentation software and more, the system is a complete package that provides a small business with some of the most important organization tools.
Every company needs a minimum of office software to make notes, write reports, keep track of information and maintain organization within the business files. Even the presentation software is needed to help keep the business growing while taking to clients or even simply applying for a new loan or funding opportunity.
Business computers should always have updated security software. This is particularly true of a company that is primarily working online and has customers buy products or services through an online server. The security software keeps important information safe from viruses, Trojans and other spyware that might infect the computer. Furthermore, it will help encrypt customer information when working with online payments so that the clients are able to feel comfortable buying services or goods.
Using the appropriate tools is a necessary part of owning a business. Tools range from having the appropriate equipment like a phone and computer to keeping updated software to ensure improved productivity of the business.

In 17 years under Kim Jong Il, North Korea grabbed the world’s attention with several missile tests, a pair of nuclear detonations and a big helping of threats. Kim’s youngest son and successor has hit all those highlights of North Korean-style leadership in just over a year at the helm. And while these acts and the rhetoric that surround them sound familiar, their tempo has clearly quickened, particularly this past week as the Pyongyang regime responds to the latest round of U.N. Security Council sanctions in response to its Feb. 12 nuclear test.
In recent days North Korea has said it will drop its recognition of the armistice that ended hostilities in the 1950-53 Korean War and threatened to carry out a preemptive nuclear strike against U.S. “aggressors.” On Friday North Korea warned it was pulling out of all non-aggression pacts with the South. Pyongyang has said it might ignore the 1953 cease-fire several times before, but the nuclear threat is a new level of escalation. While North Korea doesn’t possess the sort of reliable long-range missiles or miniaturized nuclear devices that would allow it to hit the U.S., its capabilities are improving, as shown by its successful satellite launch in December.
“One has to take what any government says seriously,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said Thursday. “It’s for that reason that I repeat here that we are fully capable of defending the United States. But I would also say that this kind of extreme rhetoric has not been unusual for this regime, unfortunately.” In South Korea, new president Park Geun-hye was far less sanguine about the North Korean threat. “Our current security situation is very grave,” Park warned Friday at a commissioning ceremony for graduating military cadets, the Yonhap News Agency reported. South Korea’s military has responded in kind to the North’s rhetoric, warning that a nuclear attack would lead to the North’s destruction.
The sanctions unanimously approved Thursday by the U.N. Security Council ban transactions that might help North Korean nuclear proliferation and require governments to inspect shipments to or from the North that might contain prohibited weapons or related materials. The measures also block the sale to North Korea of some luxury items like yachts and luxury cars and call for increased monitoring of North Korean diplomats to prevent them from aiding their country’s weapons programs. International relations expert Marcus Noland writes on the Peterson Institute for International Economics’ North Korea: Witness to Transition blog that while the sanctions do offer new powers to control North Korean proliferation, there’s also plenty of wiggle room:
The problem with these latest steps is that each has a kind of “credible information” clause. A government that does not want to enforce them can say that they lack credible information, or that the information that they were provided did not meet the standard of “reasonable grounds.” On the other hand, the resolution also provides cover for a campaign to intensify financial restraints on the country on the grounds that virtually all of its external transactions ultimately feed back into a central pot from which the country’s excessive military expenditure is drawn. Expect continuing diplomacy from the US and its allies to secure support for an expansive definition of proscribed trade and financial transactions.
The pivot on which all North Korea questions turn is, as ever, China, its neighbor and only major ally. China backed the passage of the new sanctions, and the latest missile launch and nuclear test came in the midst of an important political transition in China. The new leadership team of Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang can hardly be amused. Despite that, China’s fundamental strategic calculations remain the same, North Korea expert Andrei Lankov argues in a recent essay. “All things considered, China tends to see a nuclear North Korea as the least unacceptable option,” he wrote.
Other observers say that China may be rethinking its position. Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, wrote last month that North Korea’s actions are undermining China’s international image and entangle its leaders in growing regional tensions. “I do sense in my interactions with Chinese officials and experts a growing concern over Kim Jong Un and his ability to lead the country,” says Haenle, who was the U.S. National Security Council China director from June 2007 to June 2009 and White House representative to the six-party Korean denuclearization talks. Any changes will be quiet, he says. “I don’t expect overnight any major sort of 180 degree change in China’s policy and I don’t expect it to be done in any sort of public, loud way, but what we could potentially see is a shift back to where they were at end of the Bush administration, where they put conditions for aid and assistance and even high-level interactions on progress in the denuclearization track to prevent North Korea from provocations and destabilizing actions.” China eased its carrot and stick approach after Kim Jong Il suffered a stroke in mid-2008, Haenle says, because it was clear the country was going into a leadership transition.
If China’s endorsement of the latest sanctions are a sign it is growing weary of its North Korean ally, it has been at pains to deny it, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying it continues to advocate stability and denuclearization. “I don’t think China has changed its stance,” says Fang Xiuyu, a North Korea expert and professor of international studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. “China’s position on the North Korean nuclear crisis is very clear: support denuclearization and maintain regional peace.” The new sanctions are “an international consensus and we have no reason not to support them.” Now the question is if they’ll have any effect.

In addition, it is indicative of the man or woman trying to flee worried circumstance or an impulse which the dreamer generally cannot recognize. Other things from the fantasy could possibly be the indicator of this method to interpret that different colour. The most essential colour must not be pink. Pearl vehicle paint hues are made by combining dyes and pigments with pearlescent pigments to reach a large variety of hues.

Read more about WPA 2010, Conversations Toward Action (July 15-18 in Philadelphia) - Ready for Proposals!!
It’s the new year and the new term, a time when some take the opportunity to make and act on resolutions. It might be, in fact, that CWPA can help with some of our members’ resolutions with some fabulous opportunities. Maybe you’ve decided to:
Meet a writing instructor, program director, writing center director, or other writing professional near-ish who you’ve been meaning to chat with, but haven’t yet done.
Perhaps, as the semester winds down, you are already thinking about next term, about spring, about CCCC and the WPA breakfast at CCCC. This year’s event, which is open for registration, brings a new twist. As part of CWPA’s efforts to facilitate connections and conversation, we’re introducing themed tables at the breakfast. "What themes," you ask? You tell us!
How often have you, CWPA member, said to yourself, “I know there’s another writing instructor/program director/writing center director/writing program down the road [even if the road is 500 miles long, as it is in some spots]. I’d like to get to know her or him, I just haven’t gotten to it…” Well, CWPA has some incentive for you to get to know that person!
Just as the mid-point of the semester seems like a good time to look back on the work we do with students, it seems like a useful moment to reflect on CWPA’s work this Fall 2009 term. There are a lot of opportunities for CWPA members (and friends) to be involved with the organization – and maybe a list of some of the initiatives will inspire others to join!
Based on input that we collected through WPA Directions at the 2009 summer conference, we’ve started or will start several new initiatives. These include:
I’m still abuzz from the inspirational efforts of writing/ELA students, teachers, and others that I heard about on the National Day on Writing, and that I’ve seen in the National Gallery of Writing. If you haven’t checked it out, you must! Of course, I highly recommend the CWPA Gallery… but there are literally thousands of other submissions that are just mind-blowing.
The WPA Gallery in the National Gallery of Writing NEEDS YOU! More specifically, we; need your work!
What should students learn in writing classes to be prepared for college? Who should make that determination, and how should they do it? And how might we affect responses to these questions?
One of the initiatives that came out of this summer’s WPA Directions work has to do with engaging in systematic dialogue with other teachers and administrators about our common interests and shared work. To that end, CWPA members are going on the road!
It’s fall and back-to-school time – which means that there are also a fair number of stories about writing and education in the news.

Only a fraction of bitcoins issued so far can be found on the exchange markets. Bitcoin markets are competitive, meaning the cost a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. Many people hoard them for long term savings and investment. This restricts the number of bitcoins that are really circulating in the exchanges. Additionally, new bitcoins will continue to be issued for decades to come. So, even the most diligent buyer couldn’t purchase all existing bitcoins. This scenario isn’t to suggest that markets aren’t vulnerable to price exploitation, yet there exists no requirement for big sums of cash to transfer market prices up or down. The merest events on the planet economy can change the cost of Bitcoin, This can make Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency volatile.
Bitcoin is the primary cryptocurrency of the net: a digital money standard by which all other coins are compared to. Cryptocurrencies are distributed, world-wide, and decentralized. Unlike conventional fiat currencies, there’s no governments, banks, or another regulatory agencies. As such, it really is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. The benefits of using cryptocurrencies as your method of transacting cash online outweigh the security and privacy risks. Security and seclusion can readily be reached by just being smart, and following some basic guidelines. You wouldn’t put your entire bank ledger online for the word to see, but my nature, your cryptocurrency ledger is publicized. This can be fastened by removing any identity of ownership in the wallets and thereby keeping you anonymous.
Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner running software with specialized hardware. Mining software listen for transmission trades on the peer-to-peer network and perform the appropriate tasks to process and validate these trades. Bitcoin miners do this because they are able to get transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction processing, and new bitcoins in existence are under denominated formulas.
Cryptocurrency is freeing people to transact money and do business on their terms. Each user can send and receive payments in a similar way, but they also be a part of more elaborate smart contracts. Multiple signatures enable a transaction to be supported by the network, but where a specific number of a defined group of folks consent to sign the deal, blockchain technology makes this possible. This permits progressive dispute arbitration services to be developed in the foreseeable future. These services could enable a third party to approve or reject a transaction in the event of disagreement between the other parties without checking their money. Unlike cash and other payment procedures, the blockchain always leaves public evidence a transaction occurred. This can be possibly used within an appeal against businesses with deceptive practices.
Here is the coolest thing about cryptocurrencies; they don’t physically exist everywhere, not even on a hard drive. When you examine a unique address for a wallet containing a cryptocurrency, there is absolutely no digital information held in it, like in the same way that a bank could hold dollars in a bank account. It’s nothing more than a representation of worth, but there is no real palpable type of that worth. Cryptocurrency wallets may not be seized or immobilized or audited by the banks and the law. They don’t have spending limits and withdrawal constraints imposed on them. No one but the owner of the crypto wallet can decide how their riches will be managed.
Mining cryptocurrencies is how new coins are placed into circulation. Because there’s no government control and crypto coins are digital, they cannot be printed or minted to create more. The mining process is what makes more of the coin. It may be useful to think about the mining as joining a lottery group, the pros and cons are just the same. Mining crypto coins means you’ll really get to keep the full rewards of your efforts, but this reduces your likelihood of being successful. Instead, joining a pool means that, overall, members are going to have much higher chance of solving a block, but the benefit will be split between all members of the pool, based on the number of “shares” won.
If you’re thinking about going it alone, it really is worth noting the applications settings for solo mining can be more complex than with a swimming pool, and beginners would be probably better take the latter route. This option also creates a steady flow of revenue, even if each payment is small compared to totally block the wages.
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Ether, YOCoin, and many others happen to be designed as a non-fiat currency. Quite simply, its backers assert that there’s “real” worth, even through there is no physical representation of that worth. The worth climbs due to computing power, that’s, is the only way to create new coins distributed by allocating CPU power via computer programs called miners. Miners create a block after a period of time that is worth an ever decreasing amount of money or some kind of benefit in order to ensure the deficit. Each coin contains many smaller components. For Bitcoin, each component is called a satoshi. Operations that take place during mining are exactly to authenticate other transactions, such that both creates and authenticates itself, a simple and elegant solution, which is one of the appealing aspects of the coin. Once created, each Bitcoin (or 100 million satoshis) exists as a cipher, which is part of the block that gave rise to it. The blockchain is where the public record of all transactions lives. Most all cryptocurrencies function as Bitcoin does.
The fact that there’s little evidence of any growth in the utilization of virtual money as a currency may be the reason why there are minimal attempts to control it. The reason for this could be just that the market is too small for cryptocurrencies to justify any regulatory effort. It really is also possible the regulators simply do not understand the technology and its implications, expecting any developments to act.
The wonder of the cryptocurrencies is the fact that fraud was proved an impossibility: as a result of nature of the protocol where it is transacted. All purchases on a crypto currency blockchain are permanent. When youare paid, you get paid. This isn’t anything shortterm where your web visitors can challenge or desire a refunds, or use illegal sleight of palm. In-practice, many merchants could be wise to make use of a fee processor, because of the permanent nature of crypto currency purchases, you have to make certain that safety is tough. With any form of crypto currency may it be a bitcoin, ether, litecoin, or some of the numerous different altcoins, thieves and hackers might get access to your individual tips and so steal your cash. Sadly, you almost certainly can never have it back. It’s vitally important for you to follow some very good secure and safe routines when dealing with any cryptocurrency. Doing so will guard you from most of these adverse events.

It should be hard to get more little gains (~ 10%) throughout the day. Study how to read these Candlestick charts! And I discovered these two rules to be accurate: having small gains is more lucrative than trying to fight up to the peak. Most day traders follow Candlestick, therefore it is better to examine publications than wait for order confirmation when you think the cost is going down. Secondly, there’s more volatility and reward in currencies that haven’t made it to the profitableness of sites like Coinwarz.
Entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency movement may be wise to research possibilities for making enormous ammonts of money with various types of online marketing.There could be a rich reward for anyone daring enough to brave the cryptocurrency markets.Bitcoin design provides an instructive example of how one might make lots of money in the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin is an astonishing intellectual and technical accomplishment, and it’s created an avalanche of editorial coverage and venture capital investment opportunities. But very few people understand that and miss out on very lucrative business models made accessible because of the growing use of blockchain technology.
You’ve probably noticed this often where you often spread the good word about crypto. “It’s not erratic? What goes on if the cost failures? ” So far, many POS programs offers free transformation of fiat, relieving some concern, but before volatility cryptocurrencies is addressed, most people will soon be unwilling to put up any. We have to discover a way to struggle the volatility that’s inherent in cryptocurrencies.
Many people choose to use a money deflation, especially people who want to save. Despite the criticism and skepticism, a cryptocurrency coin may be better suited for some uses than others. Financial privacy, for example, is great for political activists, but more debatable when it comes to political campaign financing. We need a stable cryptocurrency for use in commerce; should you be living pay check to pay check, it’d happen within your wealth, with the rest allowed for other currencies.
The physical Internet backbone that carries information between the various nodes of the network has become the work of a number of firms called Internet service providers (ISPs), including firms offering long distance pipelines, sometimes at the international level, regional local pipe, which ultimately connects in households and businesses. The physical connection to the Internet can only happen through any of these ISPs, players like degree 3, Cogent, and IBM AT&T. Each ISP manages its own network. Internet service providers Exchange IXPs, owned or private companies, and sometimes by Authorities, make for each of these networks to be interconnected or to transfer messages across the network. Many ISPs have arrangements with providers of physical Internet backbone providers to offer Internet service over their networks for “last mile”-consumers and companies who need to get Internet connectivity. Internet protocols, followed by everyone in the network makes it possible for the information to stream without interruption, in the appropriate location at the right time.
While none of these organizations “owns” the Internet together these companies decide how it operates, and established rules and standards that everyone stays. Contracts and legal framework that underlies all that is happening to determine how things work and what happens if something goes wrong. To get a domain name, for example, one needs permission from a Registrar, which includes a contract with ICANN. To connect to the Internet, your ISP must be physical contracts with providers of Internet backbone services, and suppliers have contracts with IXPs from the Internet backbone to attach to and with her. Concern over security dilemmas? A working group is formed to focus on the problem and the solution developed and deployed is in the interest of most parties. If the Internet is down, you have someone to call to get it fixed. If the issue is from your ISP, they in turn have contracts in place and service level agreements, which regulate the way in which these issues are solved.
The benefit of cryptocurrency is that it uses blockchain technology. The network of nodes the make up the blockchain is not regulated by any focused company. No one can tell the miners to update, speed up, slow down, stop or do anything. And that is something that as a committed supporter badge of honour, and is identical to the way the Internet works. But as you understand now, public Internet governance, normalities and rules that regulate how it works present built-in difficulties to the consumer. Blockchain technology has none of that.
Ethereum is an unbelievable cryptocurrency platform, nevertheless, if growth is too quickly, there may be some issues. If the platform is adopted fast, Ethereum requests could grow dramatically, and at a rate that exceeds the rate with which the miners can create new coins. Under such a scenario, the whole stage of Ethereum could become destabilized due to the increasing costs of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest Ethereum stage and ether. Instability of demand for ether may result in an adverse change in the economic parameters of an Ethereum based business that could lead to business being unable to continue to run or to discontinue operation.
For most users of cryptocurrencies it isn’t essential to understand how the procedure operates in and of itself, but it is simply crucial that you understand that there is a process of mining to create virtual currency. Unlike currencies as we understand them today where Governments and banks can only choose to print endless quantities (I ‘m not saying they are doing thus, just one point), cryptocurrencies to be operated by users using a mining program, which solves the complex algorithms to release blocks of currencies that can enter into circulation.
We would like to thank you for coming to TAN in looking for “The Affluence Network International Alpha” online.
For most users of cryptocurrencies it is not essential to comprehend how the procedure operates in and of itself, but it’s essentially important to comprehend that there’s a procedure for mining to create virtual money. Unlike monies as we know them today where Governments and banks can only select to print unlimited amounts (I am not saying they’re doing thus, only one point), cryptocurrencies to be operated by users using a mining program, which solves the complex algorithms to release blocks of monies that can enter into circulation.
You have probably seen this often where you frequently spread the nice word about crypto. It is not risky? What goes on if the value failures? sofar, many POS devices delivers free transformation of fiat, improving some concern, but before the volatility cryptocurrencies is addressed, a lot of people is going to be reluctant to put up any.

Lots of people would rather use a currency deflation, notably individuals who desire to save.

Instability of demand for ether can lead to a negative change in the economic parameters of an Ethereum based company that may lead to company being unable to continue to run or to discontinue operation.
In the case of the fully functioning cryptocurrency, it might actually be exchanged as a thing. Supporters of cryptocurrencies say that sort of online money is not governed with a main banking system and is not thus subject to the whims of its inflation. Since there are always a limited variety of items, this coin’s price is founded on market forces, allowing owners to trade over cryptocurrency exchanges.

Since one of the earliest forms of making money is in cash financing, it really is a fact you could do that with cryptocurrency. Most of the giving sites currently focus on Bitcoin, many of these sites you might be required fill in a captcha after a certain time frame and are rewarded with a small amount of coins for visiting them. You are able to see the www.cryptofunds.co website to find some lists of of these sites to tap into the currency of your choice. Unlike forex, stocks and options, etc., altcoin marketplaces have quite different dynamics. New ones are always popping up which means they don’t have lots of market data and historical perspective for you to backtest against. Most altcoins have somewhat poor liquidity as well and it is hard to develop an acceptable investment strategy.

You are able to run a search on the web. First learn, then models, indicators and most importantly practice looking at old charts and pick out trends. Anytime you commence to keep a trading diary screenshots and your comment/forecast. Precisely what is the best way to get confident with charts IMHO. Oh certainly, and don’t fool yourself into thinking that you purchase the uptrend will never decrease! Always will go down! Viewers incremental profits are more reliable and profitable (most times)
It’s definitely possible, but it must have the ability to recognize opportunities regardless of market behaviour.

In January 2010, Esmark Chairman and CEO James P. Bouchard learned of the enormous loss-of-life and devastation in Haiti caused by by a catastrophic earthquake. He immediately knew that he had to do something to help and mobilized an 80-member contingent of doctors, specialists and volunteers to send medicines and supplies to Port-Au-Prince. Working in collaboration with the medical team Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh and the CEO of Highmark Healthcare , Ken Melani, Jim chartered an aircraft to fly the medical team and volunteers on a mercy mission to Haiti's capital.
Loaded with more than $15 million in medicines and supplies, the team landed in Haiti and proceeded to assist local emergency responders and doctors in getting the badly needed medicines and supplies to the victims. Their return flight was also an amazing humanitarian effort. Jim and the team brought more than 100 orphans back to the United States to be united with their adoptive parents.
In addition, Jim and his wife Carolyn later orchestrated additional mercy mission flights to Haiti and continued to find ways to help Haiti in its rebuilding efforts.
The very first line of the brochure for the current model Hyundai iLoad says, “we have one goal – the be Australia’s most loved car company, we’re driven by the simple philosophy that life’s most incredible moments shouldn’t be reserved for a select few, and everyone should be able to experience an exciting and enjoyable drive”. Marketing hoo har or a genuine message? In my opinion, that’s such a great, honest way of delivering an intro and given my experience in the iLoad, it fits perfectly.
Now before I start, here’s the thing about how I personally plan to review cars on HoonTV. An honest opinion, no technical fluff and definitely no use of the word bespoke… that is unless it’s a brand name. Hate that word.
Wind back the clock to 2008 when I first drove an iLoad, I went from Sydney to Casino which is on the border of NSW and QLD on one tank of diesel. Aside from the great economy though, it was definitely much nicer to drive than a regular style van where you’re sitting over the engine and made the trip quite enjoyable.
Ten years on and I’m driving around in the new, updated version. It’s not that far removed, but it’s updated and Hyundai have put in a lot of work to iron out earlier bugs. In saying that though, basic research shows that any vans with issues are usually ones with high mileage or those that have had a hard life. They’re definitely a popular option and these days you’d be struggling to drive around in a day and not see a lot of iLoads on the road.
Over the past week I’ve used the iLoad not only to commute around Sydney’s busy roads, but I’ve also been carting around a few motorbikes (one being the WE/98). Something it’s great for given the fact that it has so many tie-down points and dual sliding doors. I’ve been driving an automatic diesel CRDi model which has plenty of poke and definitely doesn’t go like an old van. Another thing I liked was the fact that the iLoad isn’t too tall, so I was still able to squeeze it in to the undercover carpark below the hotel where I was staying.
The features of the iLoad… Well I’m not going to sit here and regurgitate the sales brochure to tell you about this and that, how many of those it has etc, because it’s been done time and time again. And to be honest, you can just go straight to the Hyundai website or even a dealership to read about it or speak to a salesperson.
In closing, if you want my opinion, the new iLoad is spot on. It looks great, does exactly what it’s designed for, it’s not over complicated and is a pleasure to drive. The price is right, it has the typical Hyundai warranty and the servicing doesn’t cost a fortune. I’m giving it an honest score of a 9/10 and that’s only due to the fact that the cruise control is a little bit old school compared to more modern systems, yet it’s its defence, any cruise control is better than no cruise control, so it’s a minor moan.
Yes I would own one and even more so, yes I really like the updated aesthetics. I’d just like to see one with a set of aftermarket wheels, or even a dealer option that gave buyers something similar to the Ford Transit Custom which was given the M Sport treatment…. Maybe an N model, like the i30N.
Anyway, I like it, so if you are considering a new van. Take one for a test drive. I doubt you’ll be disappointed.
“Giving it an honest score out of 10 I'm at a 9/10 and that only due to the fact that the cruise control is a little bit old school compared to more modern systems, but it's its defence, any cruise control is better than no cruise control, so it's a minor moan.”

As a warm-up to a Grammy Awards ceremony expected to be laden with tributes, the world of music yesterday celebrated Lionel Richie during the 2016 MusiCares Person of the Year show. The glamorous event was held at the Los Angeles Convention Center and attracted the who-is-who of the industry. Much as the evening belonged to that legendary singer-songwriter, there was an important cause behind the festivities. MusiCares is an organization set up to provide critical assistance to music people whenever they need it. Raising funds towards its kitty was another of the reasons the industry’s elite were gathered in L.A. And with a record $7 million raised on the night, it’s safe to say that objective was met.
But Lionel was also given his proper due. A raft of artists from virtually all parts of the musical spectrum gave renditions of some of the songs that etched the former Commodore in the history books of music. Usher got the performances to a rousing start as he belted out ‘Lady (You Bring Me Up)’, one of The Commodores’ biggest hits. At hand to infuse ‘Jesus is Love’, another Commodores favorite, with power and grace was gospel powerhouse Yolanda Adams. There was still time for Stevie Wonder to offer the audience a jacked-up version of the timeless Richie ballad ‘Three Times a Lady’. From the world of rock and roll Lenny Kravitz came, accompanied by guitarist Craig Ross to deliver a scintillating cover of 80s pop classic ‘Running With the Night’.
Rihanna was also present, and she gave a touching soulful rendition of ‘Say You, Say Me’ but Dave Grohl singing ‘You Are’ was undoubtedly one of the show’s highlights. He said he was returning the compliment after Lionel Richie sent him a basketful of muffins as he recovered from a broken leg. Another notable moment was when the man of the hour stepped on stage to collect his accolade. After an honest speech filled with thank yous, Lionel stepped behind the microphone to croon ‘Hello’ and ‘All Night Long’. We can’t forget to mention the sight of host Jimmy Kimmel in that extravagant Commodores outfit, complete with afro.

Like many people in the first world, our palates have become somewhat jaded from gorging on festive fare. The number of ways in which turkey, gammon, sausages, stuffing and sprouts can be served is indeed limited. On top of this problem of plenty, I’ve also been suffering from agitation, insomnia, anxiety, the sweats, muscle aches, cramps and diarrhoea. This is not because I didn’t get what I wanted from Santa, but because I stopped taking opioids (morphine-based painkillers) on Christmas Day and I’ve got withdrawal symptoms. I haven’t yet seen any pink elephants climbing the walls, but I guess there is still time.
When I left hospital three months ago I was taking 50 mg of morphine a day. A thoracotomy (the opening up of your ribs) is one of the most painful surgical incisions. My morphine dosage was very slowly stepped down until three weeks ago, when I finished the course and began to rely entirely on prescription strength co-codamol tablets. Codeine is also an opioid and, as I have found, very hard on the stomach. On Christmas Eve we opened a bottle of champagne, the first we’d had all year, and my stomach became very sore after just half a glass. I stopped drinking and had a long discussion with T, who had severe stomach problems in the past. The next day I stopped the co-codamol tablets and returned to the painkilling patch on my left side and straight paracetamol. I also began a short course of omeprazole to help heal the stomach. My festive season was thus turkey full and alcohol free.
The pain in my left side had been reducing very steadily, but the wound got stirred up during Rex’s disappearance. Firstly, I climbed over the back fence, pulling up with both arms, whilst looking for him in the field behind the house. Secondly, T accidentally knocked the right side of my face when I was leaning forward and I flinched backwards, pulling the muscles of my left side. These two pulls in quick succession seem to have irritated the drain site and put me back into plenty of pain. The drain site is at the bottom of my ribs, on the left side, where a tube was inserted into the lung cavity during surgery. The tube was removed and the hole stitched up before I left hospital. In the weeks after the operation it was possibly the most painful place on my body, although there was plenty of competition. So what has probably happened is that an internal scar, called an adhesion, around the drain site has been torn a little and has irritated a nerve. The painkilling patch is working well and in a few weeks I expect the tear will heal and the nerve will settle down again. I’m pretty confident that I haven’t done anything bad to the hernia repair.
In the meantime, I also have to cope with the withdrawal symptoms from the opioids. I am shocked at how strong they’ve been. I have hardly slept these past few days and I feel easily agitated and very anxious. Despite this, I’m glad to say that I don’t feel drawn to re-start taking opioids (I still have a bottle of liquid morphine on the bedside table). No wonder long-term addicts find it so difficult to get off smack for good. I’ve read that the withdrawal symptoms are most intensive for the first two weeks and after that they decline. The only upside is that I don’t have to take laxatives anymore.
The most wonderful time of the year can also be the most awful. I’m not thinking of the rampant consumerism but of the very mixed feelings that this most intense of our annual festivals inevitably brings. At Christmas we celebrate our relationships with family and friends (through cards, phone-calls, visits and shared meals), but in so doing we are also much more aware of our ties to those people who were once close to us, but who have since departed through death or separation. Christmas is the time of family and friends and at the same time it is also the time of loss and loneliness. It is a festival that is inevitably bitter-sweet.
I always find Christmas a difficult time. Thirty one years ago my first wife and I had just bought our first house and had moved in just before Xmas. But in early January she was killed in an accident. It took a long time before I could bear to open the door of the new house. And when I did I found the house full of boxes from the business of moving in that for her would always be unfinished. Everyone has their story. A good friend of mine’s grandmother died at home on Xmas day. When his mother went back to the house her elder relatives were rapidly removing all of the decorations.
For tens of thousands of years humans have celebrated a Midwinter festival. It happens at the darkest, coldest and most deathly time of the year, when life seems at its lowest ebb: many animals hibernate, most plants are dormant or died back. It is unsurprising that our ancestors were moved to mark this important festival by the bringing in of symbols of life to the hearth (evergreen conifers, holly, ivy, mistletoe) and the sacrifice of an animal to mark the point at which the year turned from the dark, cold and death towards the light, new life and regeneration of the spring.
It is also unsurprising that early Christians, some 1700 years ago, should have selected this Midwinter festival as the point in the year at which to celebrate the birth of Jesus. It was entirely symbolically appropriate to piggyback the Christian festival onto the pre-exisiting one: the bringing of new light into the Midwinter world of darkness and death. This point was deliberately chosen for the festival of Christmas as early scholars and historical records suggest that the birth of Jesus actually took place in midsummer.
However you choose to celebrate Christmas, may I wish you the very best relationships with your nearest and dearest as well as the very best honouring of your ties to your dearly departed. May you feel rested and reinvigorated on your journey into the New Year. My dearest T and I will be celebrating quietly at home with Rex. We have sprigs of evergreen plants on the front door and have a conifer erected at the hearth. The tree is lit by real candles that I bought in Germany. We shall raise a glass to you all.
Unsurprisingly, Rex has been out of sorts since his ordeal. When he arrived home, after his release from imprisonment on the farm, he was very thirsty and hungry. He devoured a couple of days rations in several hours, and then howled during the night. The next day he seemed depressed. Since then he has been eating normally and seems to have picked up a little in mood. We have been reassuring him with lots of stroking and plenty of treats. We took him to the vet who examined him and pronounced him fit and reasonably well. Rex is certainly a resilient dog, he probably learnt this because of the maltreatment he had for the first year of his life with the old farmer. The vet also told me that a dog could only live for around four days without water. So Rex had been rescued just in time.
I reported the incident to the police. They told me it was a case of animal cruelty, which made it the responsibility of the local council. I rang the officer in charge. He took down the details but told me that a successful prosecution was unlikely because there was no independent evidence of the crime. Unfortunately a dog is unable to give evidence against its abuser. He said he would visit the old farmer and give him a stern warning that any subsequent problem with him would lead to a prosecution. I wasn’t satisfied, but this seemed the best option available. Later in the week, the officer reported to me that he had visited the old farmer and had warned him, and he had denied all knowledge of the crime.
I also spoke to a near neighbour about the old farmer. They told me that his wife had left him with their young child, so the old farmer had been on his own for forty years. They said that he came from a strange family. Apparently the old farmer and his brother were known for playing vicious tricks on people for their own perverse amusement. Several decades ago they had tricked a simple farm labourer up on top of a building they were constructing and he fell 30 feet and broke several bones, but could easily have been killed. The locking up of Rex without food and water was in the same vein. This confirmed my gut feeling that the old farmer is unbalanced and dangerous.
As the week wore on, I spoke to several other neighbours about Rex. One told me that he had visited the old farmer when Rex was missing and asked him if he had seen the dog. The old farmer replied that he hadn’t seen him, but he was glad that he was missing because he didn’t want to see him again. And this dreadful lie was spoken when he had our dog locked up just a few yards away. The other told me that the old farmer had recently told him that he was very angry with me for reporting him to the RSPCA about not feeding his own dog properly. I shook my head and laughed. The old farmer had now produced a further lie to try and deflect attention from his own dirty deeds. I then gave my neighbour the true story.
We were speaking together below the farm towards the end of the lane. Just as we finished talking, the old farmer came around a bend on his tractor. He stopped, dismounted the tractor and began shouting at me.
‘Because you tried to kill our dog,’ I shouted back angrily. ‘You locked him up for over three days without food and water.’
‘Oh yes you did.’ I glowered. ‘Rex would be dead now if I hadn’t rescued him from the shed you locked him in.’
‘And you’d better watch out,’ he shouted, pointing his finger at me. ‘If I see you or that bloody dog around my yard again, I’ll do you.’
At that point he turned to get back on his tractor. I set off up the lane with Rex. I was fuming at his brazen duplicity. Five lies about Rex and two threats in one week. As I strode along I made a mental note of our exchange. When I got home, I wrote everything down and reported the lies and threats to the police and to the local authority.
A week ago Rex went missing. At first we weren’t too worried. He had a habit of occasionally visiting the farmyard where he had lived for a year. It was only a quarter of a mile down the lane and he went there to see the old farmer’s new dog. But when we went down to the farm to collect Rex, he was nowhere to be found. Then the snow came and we began to worry more. The next morning we again went to the farm and asked the old farmer if he had seen Rex. He told us he had seen him the day before but not since. Rather uncharacteristically, he told us that he hoped Rex would come back soon. As the icy weather set in, our worries increased. We began to go further afield, asking people and calling for Rex beside old barns and suchlike where he might be hiding out. But we had no luck at all.
After a couple of days we were terribly anxious and filled with a deep foreboding that something bad had happened. We remembered that the old farmer had threatened to shoot him and usually complained to us about Rex visiting his yard, for he believed that Rex was a bad influence on his new dog. Then a ray of hope, a neighbour told us they had seen a Facebook post about a stray collie that had been seen about three miles away. As T began to search for the post, I drove to the area where the stray dog had been seen and began to ask around. The backroads were very icy and I had to go very carefully. For several hours I met people who had not seen a stray collie. Then I met a farmer who said he had seen a young collie a couple of days ago. My spirits lifted. I made house to house enquiries. Many people were not at home. The remainder seemed helpful and concerned. I left our number written on pages torn from a notebook.
I got home late afternoon. T had finally tracked down the Facebook post. It was on a local ‘lost and found’ page. We scanned the hazy picture of the stray collie. He was very like our Rex, even down to the white patch on his tail. But it wasn’t him. Our spirits fell through the floor. We returned to the awful suspicion that the old farmer had killed him. After all, he had both motive (however unbalanced) and opportunity (the farmyard was the last place Rex had been seen). And he had acted suspiciously when we had asked him on the Friday about Rex, by not complaining about the dog coming in to his yard. I knew that the old farmer always visited a family member on Sunday afternoons. I decided to go down to the farm and have a good look around whilst he was not at home.
As I strode down the lane the light was fading. I feared that I would find a crime scene, with the stiff, dead body of Rex with gunshot wounds out the back of a barn somewhere. I sighed and steeled myself, I had to find out what had happened to our wee dog. As I walked into the yard there was a low bark from some stone outbuildings. I looked up the yard and saw the farmer’s new dog tethered there. The bark had come from another dog. I shouted Rex and whistled for him. No response. I pushed open the door of the first outbuilding, it was full of debris and had only half a roof. As I came out I looked up. Framed in a small high open window was Rex’s wee face. I shouted to him. He bobbed his head to me.
My heart flew as I ran around the stone barn looking for a way in to the upper floor. On the other side of the yard was a flight of stone steps covered in unbroken snow. At the top was a bolted door. I pushed it open. Rex ran out between my legs and raced across the yard. I glanced around the gloomy room, I could see neither food nor water. I ran out into the lane after Rex, calling to him. He was already far up the lane on the way to our house. Despite the icy conditions, a great well of happiness and warmth came over me. Rex was saved.
As I walked home, I realised that the old farmer had intended to kill Rex in the most horrible way. He had locked him in the outbuilding on Thursday, probably around lunchtime. The snow had come on Thursday evening and the steps up to Rex’s prison were still covered in unbroken snow when I rescued him on Sunday. He had been in there for over three days without any food and water.. A dog can’t survive for much more than four days without water. And the old farmer had lied to us on the Friday morning when we had asked him where Rex was. Our wee dog had been imprisoned on the farm all of the time. But for now my only concern was Rex, the old farmer was a problem for another day.
The surgeon told me that the wound in my ribs would be painful for three months. He wasn’t wrong. It’s ten weeks since my surgery. The pain has diminished but it is still stubbornly there. I feel it most often at night. I haven’t found a position to lie in that doesn’t put some pressure on my ribs. I have to get up straight away after waking, as standing up eases the soreness of the night. The pain in the daytime mainly comes from simple movements such as twisting and stretching, or when I use my arms to do something without thinking. Despite having a nap most days, I find that by the evening I’m rather tired. After tea I pretty much conk out. Recently I’ve been invited to all sorts of evening events, many of them in Belfast thirty miles away. It is of course the season to be jolly. But I’ve had to decline them all.
I’ve now graduated to the lowest dose of morphine, 5mg time-release over 12 hours. I take this at night. During the day I take co-codamol to the same value. I have prescription strength tablets, each of which have 15mg of codeine. I was told by the pharmacist that this is equivalent to 1mg of morphine. The co-codamol tablets you can buy over the counter in a pharmacy are half of this strength. So I have come down from 50mg a day of morphine when I left hospital, to 10mg a day now. I hope that I can be off opioids entirely by the New Year. I’m very much looking forward to the time when I don’t have to take three sachets of laxatives a day in order to keep regular.
The surgeon also told me that walking was the key to recovery. I go walking twice a day, most days, usually with Rex. He is happy going up and down the lane, taking excursions into the fields to follow animal trails. But I’m afraid I have to report that his affair with Glen, the blacksmith’s dog, has taken a turn for the worse. For a long time they were very much in love. They would greet each other affectionately, with licks and nips to the face and neck. Then Rex would mount Glen and pump away at his backside whilst growling enthusiastically. Then Glen would mount Rex. This sexual turn-taking could go on for a while. Indeed, when I eventually walked off and called Rex he would very reluctantly join me, but would soon return to Glen after hearing his plaintive cries.
The last time they met all seemed to be going as normal, until their rumpy-pumpy suddenly turned into a full-scale fight. I don’t know why. Both dogs leapt at each other, snarling and biting. It was a ferocious melee of twisting bodies, each trying to pin the other down and bite them. The fight spun across the lane as I looked on startled and helpless. Then, suddenly, it was over. Glen ran away and Rex stood in the lane shaking and panting through foam-flecked lips. As we all know, the path of young love does not run smooth.

A review is thought out to be one of the most typical kinds of content within the boundaries of World Wide Web. I am sure you have tried to find the review of the given item several times. Although, being on the answering side of the review, as we say, can be a completely different game in comparison with the writing one.
To start with, some persons confuse reviews with sales messages. Several markers you are dealing with, as opposed to a review, tend to be: too large a focus on praising the item, the existence of various affiliate backlinks, and too little details concerning the use of the product or service under review.
So, how may you function as great girl or guy and compose an appropriate review? Below you will find some useful tips when writing a review.
Nowadays, you will find several methods in order to receive this or that product. One of the simplest ways is to ask its owner to present a free copy. If this method does not work, you are able to register as affiliate, purchasing the product with the help of your affiliate link. It can permit you to get right up to 90% off the retail cost.
Establishing all issues and purpose aside, we will concentrate on the core items of your writing service reviews.
Key benefit: There are constantly some advantages the product is ready to put forward, and listing all of them is often the biggest worth a review can bring. Merely to determine the notion of an advantage briefly: it is just what the top features mean to the people, and how these features boost their lives.
Practical details: Mention things, for example, connected with the price, the place to buy the product, various guarantees, how long the clients need to wait for the distribution, etc.
In case you need assistance crafting your review, do not hesitate and ask for the best writing help. Reviews are not always the easiest thing to do.
This is not compulsory. It is not a compulsory part of perfect reviews. Moreover, sometimes there is not a great number of alternatives for specific products.
No matter if there are, there is often no true point in enumerating them all. For instance, when you review a book, even though there are various other books in the same location, it is not likely to supply much worth if you enumerate them as alternative variants. So, if you are going to compose a review and you understand that some assistance will be needed, then it is better to consider the writing help. Review will be successful if only written properly by professionals in this sphere of activity. Though it does not mean that you can be considered as an expert. In case you require a professional assistance, you always have two options: to address to your teachers or instructors (if you are a college or university student) and to try to order a review online. Both options are acceptable here. One way or another, pay a close attention to recommendations received from the other people but do not forget to sort them out according to your personal points of view.

Juanito Come Caca (°1983, Santiago, Chile) creates mixed media artworks and drawings. By merging several seemingly incompatible worlds into a new universe, Come Caca creates intense personal moments masterfully created by means of rules and omissions, acceptance and refusal, luring the viewer round and round in circles.
Her mixed media artworks doesn’t reference recognisable form. The results are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. By contesting the division between the realm of memory and the realm of experience, she uses a visual vocabulary that addresses many different social and political issues. The work incorporates time as well as space – a fictional and experiential universe that only emerges bit by bit.
Her collected, altered and own works are being confronted as aesthetically resilient, thematically interrelated material for memory and projection. The possible seems true and the truth exists, but it has many faces, as Hanna Arendt cites from Franz Kafka. By applying abstraction, she absorbs the tradition of remembrance art into daily practice. This personal follow-up and revival of a past tradition is important as an act of meditation.
Her works bear strong political references. The possibility or the dream of the annulment of a (historically or socially) fixed identity is a constant focal point.

I've been starting and making lots of things, as well as finishing plenty of small things, but I finally put together and finished my Birch Bay lap quilt from this shopping trip fabric buy. And felt like writing about it, so here I am!
Not too much to say, it's prettier in person, one of my cats made it into a bed within minutes of the finish and me putting it down on the coffee table so I know it's a winner.
Here is the truth. I had to take it off my quilt wall mid assembly to take photos of something else and I didn't keep track of what went where so the rows did not go together in the way they were supposed to. Whatever, I don't care, it's bright and cheerful and I have it wrapped around me this very moment.

I witnessed as a child the changes to an adjacent town where the traders would take over the pavements, the streets with their cars, ignore parking and traffic rules, ignoring other road users by double parking, stopping to chat to mates. Now that Hayes has been opened up, I am witnessing it all over again and the town will become a twin, slowly segregating itself. Apart from mini supermarket names, why are big business and familiar names ignoring Hayes Town? My opinion is that they stay away because the customers are not there and they will not come, ever
I don't understand why it attracts so many people. There's nothing there that warrants the traffic hassle they must have trying to park.
Pedestrianisation ruined Hayes Town. Also in the past there was lots of free parking, on streets, at the swimming pool and in Pump Lane. All that's left now is a small part of the parking in Pump Lane which of course you have to pay for. Councils all over Europe have wilfully destroyed their shopping centres over the past 20-30 years.

Nigerian parliament in rowdy session over call for the impeachment of President Buhari | 4Beta Naija
April 25, 2018 Mr HansLeave a Comment on Nigerian parliament in rowdy session over call for the impeachment of President Buhari
President Muhammadu Buhari said his government had given anticipatory approval for the withdrawal of $496 million from the Excess Crude Account and transferred it to the U.S. Treasury in February 2018 without recourse to the National Assembly.
The row was over the ‘unconstitutional’ payment of $496 million to the United States Government by the Buhari administration for the much needed 12 Super Tucano fighter jets.
According to News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, the rowdy session followed the reading of President Buhari’s letter to the House of Representatives, by Speaker Yakubu Dogara.
Members of the chambers of the National Assembly have been spoiling for a fight over the payment, which they contended was done in breach of the constitution.
In the letter which caused rancour at the floor of the Lower chamber of the National Assembly on Tuesday, April 24, 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari said his government had given anticipatory approval for the withdrawal of the said sum from the ECA and transferred it to the U.S. Treasury in February 2018 without recourse to the National Assembly.
“It would be recalled that, for a number of years, Nigeria had been in discussions with the United States Government for the purchase of Super Tucano Aircraft under a direct Government-to-Government arrangement.
“Recently, approval was finally granted by the United States Government, but with a deadline within which part payment must be made otherwise, the contract would lapse.
“In the expectation that the National Assembly would have no objection to the purchase of this highly specialized aircraft, which is critical to national security, I granted anticipatory approval for the release of US$496,374,470.00. This was paid directly to the treasury of the United States Government”.
The Nigerian lower chamber witnessed a rowdy session on Thursday, April 24, 2018, over calls for impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari by a member of the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, Hon. Kingsley Chinda.
The Pentagon last year August notified the U.S. Congress of the sale to Nigeria of the 12 Super Tucano A-29 planes and weapons worth $593 million, needed for the fight against the militant group, Boko Haram.
The sale was originally agreed by former President Barack Obama’s administration but was put off by the Obama administration after incidents including the Nigerian Air Force’s bombing of a refugee camp in January that killed 90 to 170 civilians.
But on 2 August, the deadlock was broken by the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, when it announced that the sale would go ahead.
The Super Tucano A-29, an agile, propeller-driven plane with reconnaissance and surveillance as well as attack capabilities, is made by Brazil’s Embraer. A second production line is in Florida, in a partnership between Embraer and privately held Sierra Nevada Corp of Sparks, Nevada.
The Super Tucano costs more than $10 million each and the price can go much higher depending on the configuration.

One of the few things I know about writing is this: spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time. Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now. The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now. Something more will arise for later, something better. These things fill from behind, from beneath, like well water. Similarly, the impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.

How did taxes and tribute get collected in the past? How often were they collected, by who, and how? Were there treasure fleets and caravans that shipped tons of gold between vassal and liege?
The government/central body or whatever would set a general tax rate for a region. Then compeeting tax collectors (think of them almost as private enterprises) would bid on how MUCH tax they could get out of that region. The state went with the collector that thought it could collect the most tax.
After that, the tax collector would try to squeeze even more taxes out of the assigned region and keep all the surplus for himself as profit.
Medieval taxation system is a mess because medieval society had a bunch of separate institutions that would takes taxes: the local liege, the kingdom, the church, the corporations, and so on. And of course it's different by country.
Still, the main idea is that only local taxes were permanent, while the king levied (is that the word? not english, sorry) a tax only occasionally, to pay for a war or a new castle or something like that. In fact, it was a way for the crown to repay a debt: the creditor would...
How do you think he felt in his jail cell, knowing that he caused WW1 and death of millions all over Europe?
I doubt he really cared about the consequences of his actions. His history is filled with a miss-guided sense of pride and he had a massive inferiority complex. He was rejected from joining the military because the major found him too small and weak.
Proud that he's unleashed the forces that will liberate his nation and his fellow Slavs from the Habsburg yoke
how come traditionally Catholic countries/empires (Spain, Poortugal, etc) in history have comparatively shit colonies compared to Protestant ones?
Because 95% of all the "Protestant" colonies you are referring to happen to be originally British and got all the pleasant habitable lanlater ds (America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa)
I think the Larne gun-running was a dangerous precedent. It introduced the gun to Irish politics and it was used to circumvent democracy because a bunch of Orangemen were paranoid of having devolution.
I know quite a bit of English who are indifferent to Northern Ireland and think Orangemen cause too much trouble than they're worth.
Northern Ireland is a mess. Maybe after this generation dies off in 50 years, the younger ones will try to put the past behind them and look to the future.
So /his/ are you a descendant of any historical figure?, do you know any good websites to research genealogy?
Please help me. I am looking for the animated .gif where Stalin pulls down the hand of a saluting officer in order to shake it. I have the Putin version.
Opinions on Sankara? Is he one of the few examples of a relatively succesful dictatorship in Africa, or does it only show that politics is all about balancing between interests groups?
I don't know much about him, I know he was loved and that he's kinda trending with anti-euro, 'sovranists' european confusionists.
I wouldn't say that his whole government could be used as an example of anti-western governments done right, as he was killed in a coup and frequently tortured political opponents, but it 's still damn interesting to take into consideration that he was able to create a food surplus and basically revitalized the economy of Burkina Faso while declining foreign aid. But as is probably inherent to dictatorships; he lost control.
Obviously I'm not fond of how he suppressed voting and trade unions, but I guess he's worthy of respect in how he tried to bring Burkina Faso out of feudalism and poverty while taking a stance against the French colonialists - who were probably behind his death.
I've been trying to read up on Muslim beliefs and sects but they confuse hell out of me. All that Imam succession stuff and which ones are recognized by whom and what the actual differences in their belief systems are.
Sunni= believe that the faith should not worship a single bloodline descendant of Mohammed. major regions are Iraq and historically all Muslim areas west of Iraq. do not pray directly to mecca, although do face mecca when praying.
Shiite= worship bloodline of Mohammed. area of Iran to pakistan (although Afghanistan is a distinct mess). pray directly to mecca. Surprisingly legitimately more tolerant of other religions provided Jizya is paid. This is the sect that actually allows lying for the sake of advancing...
>/his/ is not /pol/, and Global Rule #3 is in effect. Do not try to treat this board as /pol/ with dates. Blatant racism and trolling will not be tolerated, and a high level of discourse is expected. History can be examined from many different conflicting viewpoints; please treat other posters with respect and address the content of their post instead of attacking their character.
As you can see the thing opens in half for housing a bottle. I don't know what kind of bottle there was in there if any.
no. They originate from Ismaili heretics that were devoted to the Mad Caliph Al-Hakim. Now they like to pretend that they are a legitimate faith separate from Islam but in reality function like a closed ethnic community.
Maybe, but they're going extinct quickly, just like all other religious minorities in the middle east.
As far as I know they are doing okay for themselves as many are in Lebanon and a fair number are keked in Israel
Did he put the USA on the road to civil war? Did he create democracy or ruin it? What do you think of him?
Jackson honestly believed it was his God-given duty to protect the interests of the common American; for this reason he was and continues to be considered insane by the Beltway.
If you don't accept Spinoza's arguments as sound, why would you defend his method or insist on the consistency of his system and the soundness of his arguments? I often see people saying things like 'Spinoza was the greatest genius of the early modern era, BTFO religion, revealed the true nature of Deus sive Natura...what's that? His definitions are flawed, his method is confusing, and his logic isn't sound by modern standards? Ah, you're right, but all the same, Spinoza's system is correct.'
soundness and consistency are memes that the rationalist has formalized in order to realize his puerile fantasy of a framework wherein he can use soundness and consistency, since he cannot find it in natural language in his desperate attempt to reach some objectivity in order to avoid any choice at all which scares him to death.
read spinoza and stop worrying about consistency and soundness, as if those concepts are found in natural languages. soundness is nothing but ''I like it'' and unsound...
Are you the same idiot who doesn't understand the definitions of rationalism and empiricism in every thread?
It's hard to do that and care what he thinks when he literally this ks his system is logically correct and bases all of his claims off of geometric proofs while claiming his conclusions are co sostwnt with his definitions and axioms.
He certainly halted the decline of the Byzzies for a time but ultimately he made it way too dependent on "capable" Komnenos rulers. Once an incapable one came along it was all ogre.

10/10/18 – PLACEMENT NEEDED – Last week Dr. Van at Patterson Veterinary in Clinton Twp., had a cat signed over to the clinic; the owners wanted the cat euthanized because she had fleas. Dr. Van contacted 4 Paws 1 Heart in hopes we could assist with placement. She is a beautiful 3 year old, spayed tortious shell that is very friendly and loving. Dr. Van treated her fleas and dermatitis, tested her for FeLV/FIV (neg) and updated her vaccines. She is in perfect health and a really nice cat.
Unfortunately, the doctor cannot keep her or even foster her because her own cat is a bully and previous fosters have been miserable at her house. She ideally would need someone to foster her and hopefully someone to adopt her. She is living at the clinic currently but that availability is limited.
Please let Dr. Van (or me) know if you’d be able to help. Dr. Van is willing to cover the expense of all the veterinary care she’s had and anything she needs further before adoption. Dr. Van can be reached through Patterson at 586-791-6260 – Thanks!
I have not heard from the doctor. I know they were getting calls. The doctor said she would take care of the medical expenses if a good home could be found. Give Patterson a call to see if they are still looking.

Blaze Brothers #1 by Vernon Whitlock III and Matthew Scott Krentz focuses on two brothers out for blood. It opens up with them in confession, trying to receive forgiveness for the kills they’re about to commit. A scene like this does pretty well to set the tone for the rest of the story.
Whitlock and Krentz have created a team consisting of two brothers with crazy martial arts skills as well as what seems to be extensive gun training. They have an arsenal at their disposal and within this one issue they do well to make good use of it. The dynamic between the two brothers adds to the story a bit too, with Billy being the more irrational of the two – and trying to smoke in their new car! (smoking in the car creates a humorous scene between the two brothers).
A great scene features Jack and Billy walking into their latest job. A secretary sits behind a counter and asks their business. Once they reveal who they are she pulls a gun from behind the counter and jumps into a blaze of ammo (get it? “blaze” of ammo? Nevermind…) Her panel is filled with the spray of bullets as artists Marat Mychaels and Deitrich Smith portray her scrunched face in a battle cry. The panel is colored with bright yellows by Doug Sirois as the shots fly from her machine guns. The panel right below it shows Jack and Billy leaning to the side to dodge the bullets, with each firing off a shot and hitting her in the forehead on the very last panel of the page.
If you’re looking for an action filled read then you will definitely find what you’re looking for in Blaze Brothers. Sword play, gun shots going off, and intense action sequences keep things lively, all while Whitlock and Krentz keep the story rolling.

While we specialize in deepwater projects, our experience includes all aspects and types of marine engineering projects including terminals, loading buoys, fixed platforms, floating platforms and ultra-deep developments.
RPSEA Project 5404 is just one of many exciting and industry-shaping projects Houston Offshore Engineering is currently working on.
Selected over competitors as the primary contractor, Houston Offshore Engineering and participants Red Wing Engineering, John Halkyard and Associates, Los Alamos National Laboratory and MARIN are making significant progress on the project, formally titled, "Vortex-Induced Motion Study for Deep Draft Column Stabilized Floaters" (DDCSFs).
The objective of this study is to improve the overall mooring system safety and riser system integrity by providing guidance on which design parameters for DDCSFs have the most impact on vortex-induced motion (VIM), and determining which VIM mitigation strategies can work for DDCSFs. Testing and analysis will mainly involve the investigation and comparison of four-column DDCSFs and multi-column DDCSFs - namely, our patented paired-column semisubmersible.
Expected to reach completion in December of 2015, Project 5404 consists of two phases: Phase 1's scope of work primarily involves extensive research, testing and analysis using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to understand DDCSF VIM sensitivity and evaluate VIM mitigation strategies for industry recommendation. Phase 1 will provide the primary groundwork and data for Phase 2's VIM testing and analysis. Phase 2 will involve extensive VIM model testing of selected hull forms, correlation of CFD data and model test results, and ultimately will provide design guidance for the industry.
CFD graphics of a traditional 4-column semisubmersible compared with that of HOE's paired-column semisubmersible
The project's total cost is estimated to be around $2.4 million. RPSEA is responsible for contributing 80% of the total cost, while the remaining 20% is a shared contribution by industry and participants.
HOE and its supporting participants are considered pioneers in this particular application of CFD, as this method has not yet been widely used for VIM analysis. Unlike other model-testing methods, CFD technology allows the capability to numerically simulate the full-scale facility, rather than just the scaled-down model. Coordinating CFD analysis and VIM model testing in this study will allow for previously unmatched precision in VIM suppression data.

While Amazon grew in the ‘90s largely thanks to its growing share of the print book market and its dominance of online book sales, it was its early investments in ebooks and e-readers that turned it into a digital publishing and book-selling powerhouse. Amazon began work on its first Kindle e-reader starting in 2004 under codename Fiona, with its internal Lab126 hardware division leading the product development process. The first device was released in November of 2007 and sold for $399. Amazon has since released numerous iterations of the Kindle, and it now dominates the e-reader market after edging out competing products from Barnes & Noble, Kobo, and others.
A growing number of supermarkets allow their customers to shop online for their groceries, preparing the order for pick-up or delivering it directly to their door. Shopping from home for your grocery store items is a great way to deal with this necessary chore: It's convenient, it's a time saver, and sometimes you can even take advantage of online sales not otherwise accessible.
Not only do these sellers enjoy increased favor with customers, but they also receive better placement on product pages and may qualify for Buy Box perks. By ‘winning’ the Buy Box, you will get default sales when a client clicks the “Add to Cart” button for your product. It’s important to note that only professional sellers qualify to be featured merchants.
Shelfari was a social cataloging website for books. Shelfari users built virtual bookshelves of the titles which they owned or had read and they could rate, review, tag and discuss their books. Users could also create groups that other members could join, create discussions and talk about books, or other topics. Recommendations could be sent to friends on the site for what books to read. Amazon bought the company in August 2008.[100] Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon until January 2016, when Amazon announced that it would be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari.[102][103]
Go digital. Even though you’re not shopping online, embracing technology can help you save. “Sign up for email alerts from your favorite retailers and follow them on Facebook and Instagram for exclusive offers,” says Freeman.

The Amazon sales rank (ASR) provides an indication of the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a "best sellers list" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[134] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[134] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of "movers and shakers"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[135] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[136] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[137] though Amazon states:
In late 2016, the company launched its first experimental Go store, which replaces cashiers with a computer vision system that automatically detects when you take products off the shelf and checks you out as you leave the store. Go now has two locations in Chicago, three in Seattle, and one that just opened in San Francisco today, with more planned in California and New York City over the course of the next year. Bloomberg reported in September that Amazon may open as many as 3,000 Go locations by 2021, with the goal of competing with stores like CVS and 7-Eleven, as well as fast casual and made-to-go meal establishments. The company is also now experimenting with brick-and-mortar stores that sell only four-star rated products from Amazon.com, starting with a location in New York City.

Throughout the summer of 2018, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Amazon's wages and working conditions in a series of YouTube videos and media appearances. He also pointed to the fact that Amazon had paid no federal income tax in the previous year.[170] Sanders solicited stories from Amazon warehouse workers who felt exploited by the company.[171] One such story, by James Bloodworth, described the environment as akin to "a low-security prison" and stated that the company's culture used an Orwellian newspeak.[172] These reports cited a finding by New Food Economy that one third of fulfilment center workers in Arizona were on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).[173] Responses by Amazon included incentives for employees to tweet positive stories and a statement which called the salary figures used by Sanders "inaccurate and misleading". The statement also charged that it was inappropriate for him to refer to SNAP as "food stamps".[171] On September 5, 2018, Sanders along with Ro Khanna introduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act aimed at Amazon and other alleged beneficiaries of corporate welfare such as Wal-mart, McDonald's and Uber.[174] Among the bill's supporters were Tucker Carlson of Fox News and Matt Taibbi who criticized himself and other journalists for not covering Amazon's contribution to wealth inequality earlier.[175][176]
In the course of a single generation, Amazon has grown from fledgling online bookseller to one of the most valuable and powerful corporations in modern history. The empire of CEO Jeff Bezos has grown so vast that critics, overseas regulators, and Washington politicians are all now wondering whether the company has become an unstoppable force, and what, if anything, is capable of reining in its reach. A recent spat with Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) resulted in a minimum wage hike for tens of thousands of employees, but Amazon still operates largely without any meaningful checks on its power even as it aggressively expands into physical retail, the smart home, and warehouse and aviation robotics.
Aside from creating the logo, A.J Khubani actually played a huge role in the advent of the infomercial as we know it today, which started with his Amber Vision sunglasses in 1987. More recently, his company sold the PedEgg, another As Seen On TV product which has sold 50 million units (in addition to other successful products like the As Seen On TV mop and the As Seen On TV hose). Anyone looking for the same level of success with their own product can pitch their idea to both Telebrands and As Seen On TV, Inc. although they only accept a few submissions each year.

For one thing, the conversion rate is higher on Amazon, where it has 20,000 products on sale, than it is on Lamps Plus’ own website where it sells 60,000 products, said Hsu. For another, Hsu said Lamps Plus can treat Amazon as friend and not foe, since it manufactures a lot of the products it sells on Amazon and differentiates itself from competing companies.

Do you have an extensive collection of silk flowers and candles that you use to decorate your home for each season and holiday? Storing silk flowers and candles must be done just right or the flowers will become misshaped and discolored and the candles can lose their form. Here, you will learn how to pack up your silk flower and candles and store them in a local storage facility in an organized manner.
You don't want to pack your silk flowers with dust on them. Doing so could cause the flowers to become discolored. To clean the flowers, use a feather duster to knock the dust off. You can also use a can of compressed air to blow the dust from the flowers.
Tip: If using compressed air to clean your flowers, be sure to spray a small amount of air away from the flowers before blowing it on them. This will help eliminate any moisture in the can and prevent it from spraying moisture onto the flowers.
For the absolute best results, find a box for each arrangement. Packing multiple arrangements in a single box could cause them to become squished and misshaped. Before you pack the flowers in the box, wrap each one loosely with tissue paper. If the arrangement does not fit snugly in the box, crumple tissue paper and tuck it around the arrangement so that it doesn't shift during transport.
Put all of the small boxes in larger boxes and label the box with a list of the contents. Try to keep each season of flowers together to make it easier for you to retrieve them when you need them.
Candles require a lot less care than silk flowers, but they must still be given special care to keep them in good condition for the next use.
Trim the burnt wick so that the burned wick does not break off and cause the candle to become discolored. Wrap each candle in plastic wrap so that they do not rub together and become damaged or smeared with the neighboring candle's color.
Lay the candles flat in a box. Do not store too many candles in one box because they can become very heavy and actually compress the candles at the bottom of the box.
Once you have everything labeled in boxes, it is time to take them to your storage unit. Be sure to choose a climate controlled storage unit so that the decorations are not damaged by changing temperatures and moisture. Place each box in the storage unit in an organized manner so you can easily find what you need when you need it. If you are looking for a storage unit, try a company like Epic Group Inc.
Moving is an exciting experience, but it can also be a stressful one at the same time. Finding a new place to live is just the beginning of the moving process. You'll have to worry about utilities, figure out where to shop, and how to get to work every day, and you need to make sure that all of your things are safely transported so you don't end up with a bunch of broken and useless stuff. After moving several times with young kids in tow, I know just how overwhelming all of these things can be when you have to face them at the same time. So, I've compiled tips and tricks for working with moving companies, game plan outlines for making sure that your actual move is a smooth transition, and important information about things like insurance that you should consider. Thanks for letting me support your endeavors!
The loss of a child can be devastating for a parent. Having to go by their room each and every day can bring up old memories and make it even harder to move on from the mourning process and start to live your life again. Many parents eventually decide that it is best to pack up their child's belongings so that they can use their room in another way. Packing up the items may be too difficult for a parent to do on their own though. A packing company can be hired to handle the packing process for the parents though. The following guide walks you through the best way to have a packing company pack a child's belongings after they have passed.
When the packers are packing up the items that are to be removed from the room, it is important to know that not every item has to be packed away. You can choose a few of your favorite items to display on a bookshelf or store in a trunk near your bed so you can touch them, smell them, or simply hold them when you need to. Inform the movers of any items that you do not want packed away and they will be able to hold those items to the side when they are packing.
Be sure to explain to the packers how important it is for them to pack like items together. When you are looking for something in particular, being able to look in one box for all of your child's stuffed animals, or personal effects will make the process much easier for you.
Be sure the packers take the time to label each and every box in detail. You do not want to have to search through every box that you have stored to find the one or two items you want to see. Labeling the boxes allows you to easily find what you are looking for and allows for the items to be organized in a neat and orderly way.
With everything properly sorted and all boxes labeled, you can view your child's belongings anytime you choose and know exactly where the items are in the boxes quickly and easily. You do not have to move the items to a storage facility. You can simply store them in your attic or basement so that you can easily get to them whenever you need to.

This post is third in a series on how you can support your Starving-Artist-Friend. Click here for Part One and Part Two.
Now it’s time to really show your Starving-Artist-Friend what you think of him. He’s made is first book (album/portfolio/….) and is trying to sell it. What do you do?
You’re the first in line, of course. Yes, you do need to shell out some of your hard-earned cash. Here is where you show what you think of his work. Do you buy one and put it on your shelf? Or do you buy several and give them as gifts throughout the year? Do you read the book then put it up? Or do you take the time to write a review?
And in that last point you can have a great impact. Your Starving-Artist-Friend’s baby is out there struggling for attention in the sea of so many other babies. And you can help point people his way.
This post is specifically about reviewing books, because that’s what this Starving-Artist knows. If your Starving-Artist-Friend produces a different type of art, check with him for industry-specific recommendations.
So, you bought the book. You read the book. In one sitting. Because you couldn’t put it down. You tell your Starving-Artist-Friend how wonderful his book is. End of story. Right? Wrong.
Now you need to hop over to Amazon (or Barnes and Noble), find the book and write a review – but it can’t be just any review – it has to be a good one. Stop! Don’t run away! I’m not talking about your 8th grade book report. This piece will have life and vitality and will encourage others to invest in your Starving-Artist-Friend’s work, also. Here are some thoughts to help you get started.
Give a brief synopsis. And I mean brief. Don’t spoil the plot twist. Just introduce the main character(s) and tell what problem they need to solve. This section will probably be 3-5 sentences.
Tell something you like about the book. Does it draw you in? Is there a character you particularly relate to? Does one of the characters remind you of someone you know and love (or hate)? Is the author’s writing style friendly/confident/sassy? But, again, don’t give away the plot.
Tell something you don’t like about the book. Yes, do it. It won’t turn people away. It will lend an air of authenticity to your review. And you want to write a review people will trust. So don’t be afraid to share a minor flaw.
Who would enjoy this book? Children? Dragon-lovers? Business people? Fans of that popular British show with the time machine disguised as a police box?
DO NOT tell how you used to wipe the author’s nose or that you love to go out with him Friday nights. As far as the review is concerned, you do not know the author. Stating that you do is one of the best ways to have your review removed and that won’t help your Starving-Artist-Friend at all.
And while you’re at Amazon, read the other reviews. Do you see those that have the disclaimer that they received a review copy? Your Starving-Artist-Friend sent them a free copy of the book so they could write the review. They are another breed of Starving-Artist. They love to hang out on Amazon and write reviews. All they get in return is free stuff to review and a pat on the back (or a like). So let them know you are thankful for taking the time to review your Starving-Artist-Friend’s book by liking their review. It takes half a second and it helps everyone involved.
One more word about Amazon: Amazon’s magic number is somewhere around 50. Yes, that’s right five-zero. Your Starving-Artist-Friend needs 50 reviews of his book in order for it to start working its way into the search hits. Fifty. He’s not going to reach that goal without you. So, when he starts asking on Facebook for people to review his book, do it. And comment that you did (remember, your comment will help boost his post). Then encourage all your other friends to do the same. Don’t just share the post; tag them in it. Then, when you see them in person, ask them if they did and explain to them how important it is that your Starving-Artist-Friend gets reviews.
Your homework: Put what you’ve learned today into practice. Now through April 26, 2016 I have reduced the electronic version of Our Stories: Tales of the Bible’s Extras to only $2.25! That’s 1/2 of the regular price. So, hurry over there, buy it. Read it. Enjoy it. And then… review it.
Our Stories: Tales of the Bible’s Extras is available from Amazon (in print or for Kindle) or from Barnes and Noble for Nook.
This story will appear in a more-polished form in Our Stories, Too: More Tales from the Bible’s “Extras”. But I wanted to share it with you all now. Have a blessed Resurrection Day.
I sat at the edge of the crowd in the temple courtyard, listening to the teacher. The elders were trying to corner him but he resisted them at every turn. He started into one of the stories he was famous for – the ones we all knew meant something, but could never quite figure out what he was saying. This one was obviously against the temple elders, and even I could tell he was calling them unfaithful and wicked. I laughed to see them murmuring among themselves.
Jacob knelt beside me and I grimaced. I was supposed to be working. He caught me again. I don’t know what it is about this teacher. I can never concentrate when he’s around. I did have three more purses than I had when I started, but, still, with this crowd, and as long as I had been out, I should have had several more. But he didn’t ask.
He picked up a pebble from the ground and tossed it in the air. “There’s a caravan coming from Egypt. They seem quite burdened down with all their supplies. Meet me at the Tower of David at the fifth hour. We’ll help lighten their load.” He stood and turned to go, but looked back over his shoulder. “And don’t get distracted by fancy words. You have work to do.”
I nodded and watched him slip into the crowds, then turned my attention back toward the teacher. A huddle of the Pharisees’ disciples moved toward him. They pushed one man forward. He nodded at the teacher. “Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth; and you don’t care about other people’s opinions. So, tell us what you think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”
How did they come up with all that and who did they expect to fool? Even I, who lived a life of lies, was ready to knock them all down.
But the teacher didn’t flinch. And he didn’t really answer them. He asked them to look at a coin and tell whose image was on it. Caesar’s, of course. He tossed it back to them. “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give to God what belongs to God.”
He continued teaching, often being questioned by one religious group or another, but always seeing through their deceptions and never getting caught.
A passerby bumped me. My hand instinctively covered my purse. In doing so, I snapped out of the trance the teacher held me under. I glanced at the sun and swore under my breath. I should have been at the tower an hour ago.
I sprinted out of the temple and pushed against all the pilgrims trudging into the city. As I approached the meeting place, I could see Jacob pacing, watching for me. I skidded to a stop beside him.
He saw me, grabbed the collar of my robe and shoved me against the wall. “Where have you been? They’re almost here.”
I shook my head. “Plan: brothers fighting. We already have that going. My target: I’ll just pick someone. I’ve done this enough.” I started toward the gate.
He grabbed me by the shoulder, spun me around, and shoved me against the wall again. This time I smacked my head so hard I saw stars. “You can’t do that. You’ll slip up. They’ll catch you. And with a target this size, they’ll crucify you. Is that what you want?”
I glanced toward the gate. Half the Egyptian company was already through. I set my foot behind Jacob’s and pushed him. He landed on his back. I ran toward the gate, taking in the scene before me. I spotted three purses I knew I could cut. I fingered my knife, getting it into position. My first target made eye contact with me. No good. Two more steps and I was alongside my second target. In one motion, I sliced his purse and side-stepped a dog in my path. As I tucked the purse in my belt, a hand grasped my arm. I tried to twist free, but one of the Egyptians had me. He pulled me close to him and held a knife to my throat. Without thinking, I drove my knife into his side and fled.
I heard shouts and footsteps behind me, but I ducked in and out of shops. I rounded a corner and ran into a stack of grain sacks. I gathered my wits and slipped behind them just as my pursuers turned the corner. I heard them pass me and turn the next corner.
I counted to thirty. No one came back so I slipped out. My first mistake was not leaving my purses I had gathered tucked somewhere safe. My second mistake was to go back to the gate – but I had to know what happened to the man I stabbed.
I didn’t see him, but guards were ushering the Egyptians toward the city, probably to meet the captain. As I turned to slip away, Jacob shouted, “There he is.”
I spun around. Two guards held him against a wall. I ran, but a group of bystanders wrestled me to the ground. I tried to feign innocence and ignorance but the guard found the purse in my belt – and the others I had tucked into my shirt at the temple. I couldn’t explain why I would need so many purses, especially one filled with Egyptian coins.
I guess Jacob didn’t fare much better because we were put side by side in stocks in the in the inner prison.
My wife came, bringing me food to last several days. She fell on my neck, sobbing. I didn’t know what to say to her. I apologized, but I knew my words won’t comfort her heart nor feed the children. I should have stayed in the forge, but I was so miserable, and Jacob promised me so much. In the end, she left the basket at my side and walked away without looking back.
Jacob spent all night cursing me for me for rushing into the situation and I blamed him for double-crossing me. It didn’t matter when, a couple of days later, they took us to be whipped – forty less one lashes each.
They made me watch as they beat Jacob. He collapsed at twenty and six. I made it to thirty and two. When I woke, I was back in the stocks with Jacob beside me. Thankfully, he was too weak to say anything.
He had plenty to say the next day when they led us out for our final punishment: Jacob and me and one other man. I just glared at the soldier who dropped the wooden beam in front of me. He laid his whip across my back. I took the hint and picked up my burden.
The crowds we hailed a week ago for the income we would gain from them, now mocked and spit on us. A few of our tormenters even threw stones and rotten food.
We started the slow march out of the city. Jacob staggered along behind me, cursing me with every step.
The man in front of me stumbled. I lowered my burden to wait for him, but was greeted with another lash across my back. I maneuvered around him and saw a soldier grab an onlooker to carry the fallen man’s cross. He stepped in line behind me. At least I didn’t need to listen to Jacob anymore.
They drove us up the hill like a line of cattle. My wounds ripped open from the strain of the weight of the beam on my back. I could feel the blood running down my legs. Each step took every ounce of will to move. My mind told me to just stop. And I should have – there was only worse pain at the end of the journey. But the lashes I received when I slowed kept me moving.
When we reached our destination, the guard beside me struck me on the chest with the handle of his whip and nodded toward the side of the road. I let my burden drop. I wanted to fall on the ground, too, but the thought of being any closer to that thing than I had to be made me ill. I stood by the side of the road, eyes to the ground.
I heard a scuffle down the line and looked up to see what the commotion was. Several women knelt around the man beside me. They were crying and trying to wash his wounds. But their activity didn’t match what I heard. I glanced further. Jacob’s spot was empty. Several paces away a group of soldiers wrestled someone to the ground. They lifted him to his feet. I wasn’t surprised to see Jacob.
Two soldiers grabbed his feet and two his arms. They carried him back to his place, slammed him on the beam and hammered his hands in place. He screamed and fought with every blow. It took four soldiers to hold him in place. As they moved to his feet, the world around me started spinning then went black.
I feel them moving me and I wake. Fear grips me. I’m naked. My clothing lies in a pile at my head. I try to struggle but the soldier pins my right arm down with his knee. Others hold my legs and my other arm. I feel the cold point of the nail on my hand. I determine not to cry out, but as the hammer hits the nail a yelp escapes. I’m prepared for the next and hold my breath. They may kill me, but I will not give them the satisfaction of a reaction. I almost break when they drive the nail into my feet.
They read the sentence of the man beside me, “King of the Jews.” The High Priest argues with the centurion about the wording, but they push him aside. I look at him for the first time. It looks like the Romans gave him everything they could. I don’t think even his own mother would recognize him. Serves him right – causing trouble with the Romans – proclaiming himself king for us. Who needs a war just to put a different tyrant on the throne?
The time has come. As a boy, I would come watch as they executed criminals. I loved to stand on the side and mock them as they were lifted into place. Once I started working with Jacob, though, I avoided these roads as much as I could. I knew one day….
They lift me and drop me into place. My head jars, my teeth sink into my tongue, and a curse escapes. My struggle for life begins.
I push up on my feet to gasp for air, but the pain is too much so I slump again. The seat is just low enough that the nail pulls at my arms and I can’t breathe fully, but not low enough for me to just give up. I push up again for another gasp of breath and settle into the rhythm of hanging onto life.
The crowds focus their attention on the man beside me, throwing dirt at him. For some reason the Jewish leaders have all taken an interest in him and have gathered for the show; rather surprising since Passover begins this evening.
The crowds join in, shouting “You said you could destroy the temple and build it again in three days. Well, come, then, step down from there.”
Jacob joins them and I even threw a few insults at the man myself. I know I’ve done wrong, but at least I never hurt anyone – well except that one accident earlier this week. But it was an accident. I didn’t mean it. He, on the other hand – he’s trying to start a war. Besides, cursing him somehow makes me feel better.
Then I hear him speak. Softly. I can hear the pain in his voice, but no anger. None. “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they’re doing.”
I hear that voice. I know that voice, even through the pain. I look closer and I can see the man he once was – when I was listening to him just a few days ago.
I look at Him again. He is fighting for breath just like me – but not like me. He isn’t angry. He isn’t afraid. He doesn’t fight back, even when they mock Him.
I hear Jacob again and I can’t hold back. “What are you doing? We’re getting what we deserve, but this Man has done nothing wrong.” I turn to the Man. “Please, Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.”
He looks me in the eye. For a time, the pain is gone. I can’t hear the crowds. I see only the Man. “I promise you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”
Then it all comes back. Nothing has changed. I still am on the cross. I still struggle for every breath.
But everything has changed. I no longer am afraid or angry. Tears stream down my cheeks. But, somehow, they are tears of relief.
The sun darkens as if it’s midnight. I hear the screams and panic from the crowd. The soldiers light torches.
Then the Teacher calls out again. “Father, why have you forsaken me?” The soldiers rush to give him wine, but he refuses.
I expect a host of angels to come and rescue Him. But nothing happens. We fight for life. And we wait in darkness and silence.
He cries out again, “It is finished.” In the torchlight, I see Him slump forward. An earthquake rattles every bone in my body, tearing my flesh against the nails.
And I wait. Fighting. They come and break my legs so I will be dead before nightfall and the start of Passover. I hardly feel the pain anymore, but I can no longer push myself up to get a breath. The end is here. My fight is done.

There is no magic plan, no fruits or vegetables such as you are immune to HPV. There is no way to reduce the risk of HPV to reduce 100%, and the vaccine against HPV protects only against the high-risk types, which can lead to cancer and so on. This means that you can make some simple changes to your diet to improve your immune system to minimize risk of contracting HPV, and HPV contract should you, your immune system will be able to service your body against infections to release more quickly. In fact, we forget for a moment and HPV does not consider this: If you eat healthily, you’ll feel better. Food Stores Many people in error. Eating it is better not to live longer, not to avoid foods that “will kill you” (without food can kill really, if you suffer from severe obesity or hypertension and problems cholesterol) These are the years you have at your disposal more fun. If you eat well, you’ll be in a better mood, such as nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining mental health. If you are eating well, you get stronger, faster, less fatigued, you feel better and look better in your body, your skin’s appearance and feel better, your bones will get stronger, you’ll become sick less often and you be happier. You’ll live longer as well, but the real issue is that, in the here and now you can improve your quality of life by leaps and bounds, taking a few simple changes in diet. Fruits and vegetablesHere the basic rule of fruits and vegetables: It’s almost like too much. You can have the supposed “Super Fruits,” which is very fashionable these days have heard of, but honestly, most of them no bigger than the average orange or apple. However, if a scent is exotic enough to make you eat more fruits, go ahead. In particular fruits rich in vitamin C, highlights, orange. As for vegetables, try switching sweet, salty snacks to salads. Play with different combinations of light and dressings until you have something like you. Salads offer special fibers that help keep your system clean and rinse excess waste possible. This can be very useful in improving your immune system and preventing colon cancer. Water sound much, but try to drink a liter a day. The water contains no vitamins or something, but it works as a kind of lubricant for the body and greatly improves all aspects of your biological functions. ProteinYou need protein to keep your immune system strong and your skin to help fight against infection with HPV. Try to avoid red meat, though. Something to keep in mind, the pig is actually one of the safest, healthiest meats available. He earned a bad reputation, and certainly probably the most food fat you can eat, but it is easier to digest than meat is leaner. If you are in more protein from beans and fish, which is even better. ExerciseNutrition goes only so far. You can have a perfect system, but if you do not keep active, the immune system is not strong enough to cope with an HPV infection quickly and effectively. Stay fit. If you are a time of day for some sit-ups and push-ups to large. If not, you should at least take a walk every day.

Manufacturers and resellers went through the same process. Adding prices or tags to each item requires an ample amount of time. Now, things have ly changed. Perhaps, a huge contrast to what most people experienced in the past decade.
Since the pricing process has changed, the way people shop and sell their products has also changed. Now, customers can leave the store in mere seconds after shopping and receive the bill from the store. The reason behind this is the existence of barcodes. In the event that you were living under a rock in the past years, a barcode is a product lookup code that is made up of the lines and numbers that you see. There is no information hidden within the barcode.
When you go to a grocery store or open your refrigerator, chances are you will see that almost every product has a printed UPC barcode. In fact, almost every product in the United States has its own UPC barcode, whatever type of product it may be. So what are UPC barcodes and what are they for?
Universal Product Codes, or simply known as a UPC, is a 12 digit long number that appears on the majority of all United States products. These barcodes were originally intended to help grocery and department stores speed up their checkout process. Also, through these UPC barcodes, grocery stores were able to efficiently keep track of their inventory. The system quickly caught on with all other retail products because of its benefits. UPC barcodes were designed for mass circulation and tracking of products.
All of Speedy Barcodes customers are required to have an account. It’s free and easy to set up. It is a central location for storing all of your barcode orders and if you ever misplace the file you downloaded to your computer, you can simply login and redownload your order. If your order was placed more than 90 days ago, you will need to regenerate your order (no charge) to gain access to your numbers.

They will no longer be assigned to you. GS1 will wait a certain length of time, currently 4 years per their website, before “renting” them to someone else.
What we have found is that the majority of these companies that require the GS1 certificates belong to the GS1 Management Board Members; therefore, that is why they want you to purchase your barcodes directly from GS1.Click here to view the list of GS1 Management Board Membersas listed on GS1’s website (a new window will open).
Here’s a thought to ponder, if GS1 is a non-profit association what do they do with the revenue that they bring in?
You will need one for each title. If you change anything about your DVD or movie, it becomes a different product and needs a different barcode.
You can put the multiple items together and sell them as one item, so you will need one barcode. If you change out any of the items then it becomes a different product and will need a different barcode.
You can use the barcodes an unlimited amount of times as long as it is on EXACTLY the same product. The minute you change one thing about your product it becomes a different product and needs a new barcode number.
Previously UPC barcodes consisted of a manufacturer’s number (also known as a company prefix) and a check digit. The first six digits of the barcodes were referred to as the manufacturing number that always remained consistent on all of a company’s products. The manufacturing number was followed by a five digit product number that was unique to each product. The 12th digit was a check digit, which was mathematically calculated based on the numbers within the barcode.
Because there are a limited amount of numbers available with the current barcode method, GS1 had to change their method of issuing manufacturer’s numbers. In addition to their original 6-digit prefix they now issue 7, 8, and even 9-digit manufacturer’s prefixes as well.
No, you will not be the one assigned to a prefix. We sell individual customers ranges of barcodes all under one prefix. If you would like, you can purchase a full prefix from us, but that requires that you purchase 100,000 barcodes.
That is only necessary if you are selling to any of the big name retail stores that require you to produce a GS1 certificate in your name.Click hereto see a list of the stores that we are aware of that require a GS1 certificate.
If you’ve ever sold an item on Amazon.com, you may have been told that you need to have a UPC for each of your unique products. Like many people, you may have asked the glaring question, justwhat is a UPC?Let’s take a moment and discuss the basics.
UPC stands forUniversal Product Code.UPCs are used by manufacturers to quickly specify different products. Comprised of two elements, UPCs are made up of numbers, and a corresponding image. This image is the UPC barcode. The barcode is comprised of a series of vertical lines, all of differing widths. These line widths are carefully structured to represent numbers, and therefore the barcode is a graphical representation of the number sequence associated with it.
The UPC in its most common form is the UPC-A, made up of 12 digits. Each number is unique, and created by GS1. While it seems that it would be simple to just create a series of numbers to be used, there is actually encoded information in each UPC, including verification checksums. These checksums are used by the computers which read the codes to ensure that the codes are read correctly with no errors.
All of the numbers we sell were issued by the Uniform Code Council (UCC), currently known as GS1, and all of the numbers were purchased prior to August 28, 2002.
All of the barcode number SpeedyBarcodes.com sells were originally issued by the UCC (Uniform Code Council), known today as GS1, and were issued prior to August 28, 2002. That date is important because that’s when GS1 started sending out renewal notices demanding that past prefix holders pay renewal fees and agree to the new terms and conditions. Eventually, a class action suit was filed against GS1, in the State of Washington, and GS1 lost. All prefix owners prior to August 28, 2002 became discharged from any GS1’s renewal fees and a new codified agreement. The settlement agreement indicates that if a prefix holder paid a membership fee to the UCC prior to August 28, 2002, the prefix holder will be entitled to perpetual membership in the UCC and not be obligated to pay annual renewal fees to the UCC, either now or in the future. Also, the Terms and Conditions of the original ownership agreement with the prefix holder and the UCC, was deemed null and void. All of the barcodes sold by SpeedyBarcodes.com are included in the terms and conditions as stated above and therefore, all of our barcodes are legal and legitimate.

His website, Authenticated UPC Registration Directory, has a list of companies that he has checked out and verified that they have the legal rights to sell barcode numbers.

We have a vast amount of barcode numbers in our inventory and we feel that they should be priced low enough that everyone can afford them. The other companies have a limited amount of numbers; therefore, they charge as much as they can for the ones they have because once they sell out they're done.
Speedy Barcodes keeps an up-to-date database of all divided barcode prefixes to ensure than no barcode numbers are ever duplicated.
Information such as the name that the barcodes are transferred to, purchaser’s name, company name, address, telephone number, email address, and any other pertinent information.

At least, Garcinia Cambogia appears to be safe. There are no serious side effects, only some reports of mild digestive issues (14). It is best to get a brand with at least 50 Hydroxycitric acid. The most common dosage is 500 mg, 3 times per day, half an hour before meals. If you want to buy garcinia cambogia despite the poor results in the studies, then there is a great selection of brands with thousands of customer reviews on Amazon.
The biggest of the studies included 135 overweight individuals, which were split into two groups (7): Treatment group: 1 gram of Garcinia Cambogia Extract, 3 times per day, taken 30 minutes before meals. Placebo group: The other group took dummy pills (placebo).
Both groups also went on a high-fiber, low calorie diet. These were the results of the 12 week study, which was published in The Journal of The American Medical Association (a highly respected scientific journal): Heymsfield, et al.

This small sixteen page booklet contains a brief history of the ACLS, a section on "who can administer the ACLS", a section on developing interrater reliability, and detailed instructions for administering and scoring both the ACLS 2000 and the LACLS 2000. This booklet contains the scoring information included with the new ACLS/LACLS 2000 plus additional information such as the history and scoring flowcharts. Currently this booklet is only available from Allen Conferences.
The two items essential for using the Allen Cognitive Levels are an ACLS and this book! After obtaining a tentative ACL score using the ACLS, this book is consulted to determine the details of the persons abilities, suggested treatment methods and applicable safety precautions. As a required references guide to understanding the cognitive performance modes, this book defines the cognitive levels by modes. It offers a concise, organized presentation of the description of each mode, and the amount of cognitive and physical assistance required. In addition, it gives a description of the abilities for each mode, the therapist's and therapeutic goals that are appropriate to that mode, and a list of safety precautions. It also lists the adaptive equipment that a person in that mode can handle.
The Structures of the Cognitive Performance Modes book is intended to be a companion book to Understanding Cognitive Performance Modes and serve the following purposes:
To present the underlying mental structures of the cognitive performance modes in a clear, understandable fashion.
Newer concepts of explaining the functions of memory have been developed, This revised model is very important, because for the first time, the Information Processing Diagram(s) clearly illustrates two roles of the brain:
Cognitive Processing represented by the Working Memory Diagram. This is the memory model required to live in a changing environment such as presented in the home or community.
Habitual Learning represented by the Procedural Memory Diagram, is a subset of the Information Processing Diagram. This is the model we use to perform our Activities of Daily Living or ADLs.
The underlying structure of each cognitive performance mode is described in visual form using the Information Processing Diagram format. The resulting mode-specific diagram is further developed in a broad outline form and through several pages of text. It represents new input to the Allen Cognitive Level theory, developed since the publication of OT Treatment Goals for the Physically and Cognitively Disabled in 1992. More Info
This 1992 text first introduced the cognitive performance modes. The book was written to be used as a classroom text.
Significant chapters include the description and usage of the Allen Cognitive Level Screens, The RTI (Routine Task Inventory), and the CPT (Cognitive Performance Test). There is an extensive listing of the activity analysis of various craft activities and of the adaptive equipment used by people in various cognitive performance modes.
This publication tells you all you need to have in order to get started using the Allen's Cognitive Levels. Although the title implies a geriatric setting, the books message is applicable in all settings. The book is written by Carol Bertrand who was Director of Rehab in a SNF at the time of writing the book. After attending Claudia's workshops, she was anxious to start using the Cognitive Levels in her facility. This proved to be an almost overwhelming procedure due to the vast amounts of information that were to be digested at once. This publication is a result of her struggle. It simplifies the usage of the Allen Battery and breaks it down into practical step by step procedures. It will introduce the therapist to selecting the correct materials, selecting the patients to start, budgeting the Allen's, selling the program to administration and nursing, pulling together an interdisciplinary team and in-servicing physicians, families, and rehabilitation personnel. The book is written in a practical "Let's Get Going!" style. More Info
The handouts which were used at Claudia's workshop "How To Use the Allen's Cognitive Levels In Daily Practice" are available. Containing 80 pages, this handout is all the material taught in a Stage One workshop. This book also contains all the instructions for the ADM project Placemats.
Kerala - a long strip of enchanting land tucked away in the west corner of India, The green and serene Kerala offers an amazing array of the backwaters. The breathtakingly beautiful destinations are the true storehouses of the nature at its best. The splendid sunsets, the waxing moonlights, the shoals of ducks, the pulsating palms and the wonderful waves make the backwater destinations the most sought after in kaleidoscopic Kerala.
The Kerala backwaters are inland waters, Makes it so enchanting is its exquisite network of lakes, lagoons, rivers, canals (both manmade and natural) and estuaries With 41 west-flowing rivers, five large lakes, Stretches to almost 1,900 kilometers extending virtually the entire length of Kerala state. The backwater routes date back over the centuries and have been long used for all transportation needs, in particular trade in coconut, rubber, rice and spices. In this National Waterway No-3 from Kollam to Kottapuram, covers a distance of 205 km and runs almost parallel to the coast line of southern Kerala facilitating backwater tourism activities. ‘Kollam(Quilon)’, ‘Alappuzha(Alleppey)’, Kottayam and ‘Kochi(Cochin)’ are the principal backwater towns
The backwaters have a unique ecosystem - freshwater from the rivers meets the saltwater from the Arabian Sea in certain areas, such as the Vembanad Lake where a barrage has been built near Thanneermukkom and the Other one in Kayamkulam Lake near Thrikkunnappuzha, In between salt water from the sea is prevented from entering the deep inside, keeping the fresh water intact. Such fresh water is extensively used for irrigation purposes
The people who live along the backwaters in Kerala have a unique relationship with the backwaters. It is the source of the local people's livelihood. The fish caught from its waters, the paddy, coconut and other crops harvested along its banks, the boats they build and use to transport them across the labyrinthine backwaters, are all an integral part of their traditional way of backwater village life.
Many unique species of aquatic life including crabs, frogs and mudskippers, water birds such as terns, kingfishers, darters and cormorants, and animals such as otters and turtles live in and alongside the backwaters. Palm trees, pandanus shrubs, various leafy plants and bushes grow alongside the backwaters, providing a green hue to the surrounding landscape
Not to be missed, these cruises leave you refreshed and rejuvenated. The banks of these rivers are ideal for picnic spots. While cruising you will skim past backwater villages, Traditional fishing operations, Local ferries, Ancient Chinese fishing nets, Renowned snake boat races in onam season, Lush paddy fields, Coir villages, Rustic homes, Temples and coconut groves etc…
A cruise along these backwaters in a ‘Kettuvallom’ (A traditional houseboat) is the perfect way to have a rendezvous with pristine nature and to come face to face with the lifestyle that thrives on the sea shores. Cruises offered in House boats are – ‘Kollam Rounding’, ‘Alappuzha Rounding’, ‘Kollam to Alappuzha’, ‘Kollam to Kumarakom’ and ‘Kollam to Kochi’.
In a seemingly rude, but possibly helpful move, an Italian hotel boss has filmed a TV advert apparently giving etiquette tips to Russian tourists. It is all done in a bid to improve relations with the locals, it's been reported. And he feels that teaching uncouth Russians how to behave in a more civil way, should not be construed as Italian arrogance.
An Italian hotel owner had issued an etiquette guide for 'uncouth' Russian tourists, though he may not need have worried. The Association of Russian Tourism Agents issued statistics that showing that Egypt is the most attractive country for Russian tourists in 2014. More than 500,000 Russians visited Egypt in the first quarter of 2014, while Thailand ranked second with 409,000 in the first quarter of 2014 and the UAE came in third with 215,000.
As the summer tourist season approaches, Italians have a message for their rich Russian visitors - "you may be minted, but you have no manners."
Big-spending Russians have proved a lifeline for the Italian tourist sector during the last few years of economic recession but the Russian tourists are often perceived as boorish, brash and rude.
Italians tell rich Russians how to avoid being boorish and rude when they descend on Tuscany's smart resorts for the summer. The eastern tourists have gained a reputation among locals for being 'arrogant', according to Italian newspaper La Repubblica, for not thanking staff or appearing cheerful enough.
Now a hotel owner in Tuscany - the Russians' favourite destination - has produced a TV commercial which aims to educate wealthy Muscovites and other Russian visitors about the finer points of Italian etiquette.
Salvatore Madonna runs luxury hotels in Forte dei Marmi, an upmarket resort on the Tuscan coast which caters to Russians with menus written in Cyrillic and plentiful designer outlets, and has been nicknamed “Moscow-on-Sea”.
The three-minute advertisement advises Russians to “smile more”, to say thank you more often and to be more pleasant in their dealings with waiters and hotel staff.
They are told that ordering a cappuccino after lunch is an unforgivable faux pas – in Italy the frothy coffee is seen as an exclusively morning drink.
Nor should red wine be ordered with fish – for seafood, it has to be white wine every time. Cashed-up Russians are also warned that it is vulgar to choose the most expensive wine on the list.
The advert, which will be shown on TV in Russia and on Russian social media networks, features Ljudmila Radcenko, a Russian model who lives in Italy.
“In Russia we're maybe not really used to doing that,” she says, speaking in Italian but with Russian sub-titles on the screen.
Even showy Italians baulk at Russian women wearing barely-there, sequinned bikinis and swim costumes.
“When you leave the hotel, it's nice to be communicative, to express your satisfaction for the service, to smile and say thank you,” Ms Radcenko concludes in her advice to her compatriots.
Mr Madonna, the head of a luxury hotel group called Soft Living Places, says he hopes the short film will help “better integrate” Russian tourists to Italy.
Teaching uncouth Russians how to behave in a more civil way should not be construed as Italian arrogance, he said, but a way of gently shepherding tourists towards more culturally acceptable behaviour.
“It is mortifying for the people who dedicate so much time and attention to preparing dishes when they are asked to serve them all at the same time, as the Russians often do,” Mr Madonna said.
“But we don’t want to give them instruction, just to offer advice on some of the peculiarities of the Italian way of life.”

My friend and I were recently discussing about the prevalence of technology in our day to day lives. Reading this post makes me think back to that debate we had, and just how inseparable from electronics we have all become.
I don't mean this in a bad way, of course! Ethical concerns aside... I just hope that as the price of memory drops, the possibility of transferring our brains onto a digital medium becomes a true reality. It's a fantasy that I daydream about almost every day.

Store large items in an plate and non-child-safe and lighter objects towards the surface. Probably the items that are most frequently employed ought to head within the middle.

I had something specific in mind for my wife to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary, and 1791 couldn't have made it easier. I told Designer Alice roughly what I was after and within a day I had a beautiful rendered image of the ring design sitting on my desktop that you could have sworn was a photo of the real thing. So from idea to reality in about 48 hours, not bad! We were easily able to make a couple of small design tweaks, and the result was stunning. Right through the process from design to the paperwork afterwards was a pleasure and I would highly recommend 1791 to anyone looking for value for money and an outstanding result. I know my wife loved it :)
I went to the post office to grab the parcel this morning, and recieved in my hands a medium sized box.... hmmm... strange... its.... bigger than i thought!!
I carefully unhitched the bubble wrap and held quite a unique presentation box... upon opening that box I found another! and then finally the ring. I sat in my beat up rusting car in the morning sun outside the postoffice and was literally blinded by the flashes of colour reflecting off the diamond.
I was initially interested in your company as my choice for an engagment ring because your site steers away from the now prevalent tacky and fanciful image of offering "amazing deals on diamonds and gold". Not only was your site easy to use, but during the entire process I have been guided through in a courtious and professional manner at every stage, from diamond selection to the delivery.
I also had a hidden desire that I wasnt going to just recieve a ring in a ring box... It was a treat to find that you (mindread?!) go that extra mile to impress your clients. But it should be said this has been your outward goal the entire way.
Having your wedding ring designed to match your partners bridal jewellery sounds like a romantic ideal but some men may be concerned that their wedding band will look too feminine, especially if the design includes diamonds. Rest assured that this is not the case with the handsome Princess Solitaire mens diamond wedding ring.
The strong straight lines of the princess cut diamond add a distinctly masculine edge to this diamond wedding band. While the bridal jewellery is certainly meant to catch the eye, either with a large solitaire diamond or several stones nestled tightly together to enhance the sparkling effect, the mens wedding band is far more subtle in design. The single diamond is set low into the wedding band rather than prominently above it.
The male ring band is much wider than the matching female rings, drawing almost as much attention to the lustrous metal as to the brilliant diamond.

Hello, I would like to notify you that I am the owner of this listing. I would like to verify it‘s authenticity.
This is a event description section where you can write about your event. We have provided an editor for entering this information on Submit event page so your visitors will be able to format their description easily. They can highlight their content with Bold, Italic, Underline options, they can also use ordered and un-ordered lists:
An event is normally a large gathering of people, who have come to a particular place at a particular time for a particular reason. Having said that, there's very little that's normal about an event. In our experience, each one is different and their variety is enormous. And that's as it should be: an event is something special. Aone - off. We plan these occasions in meticulous details, manage them from the ground, dismantle them when they are over and assess the result.
Events can be used to communicate key message, faster community relations, motivate work forces or raise funds. One of the first things we ask our clients is, what they want to achieve from their event. This is the cornerstone of the whole operation for us, our starting point and most importantly, it's the way success can be measured.

Awesome tool for creating a global business directory! Adding new cities is as easy as it can get, the extensive backend features for admin makes this theme a clear winner in this niche.
Even authors who list their businesses on the site have a lot of control over their listings. They can edit their listings at any time, they can setup their own profile which will be visible to all the site visitors and guess what they can connect their places and events too with the cool Events add-on.
I have not seen better Google map integration then this ever. Marker clustering is one hell of a useful feature when you have a huge directory with thousands of listings on map. Ability for the listing submitter to select street view map is an icing on the already yummy cake!
Beauty for me is as an admin i have control over EVERYTHING, The whole theme is widget ready so that makes it easy for me to display the elements which i want to display. Just drag and drop the widgets and I am done. I must say this is one well thought out product as a whole, m lovin it!

Over twenty innovation and entrepreneurial-focused students traveled to Silicon Valley in mid-March as part of the 14 Floors Program. Approximately a hundred students compete for the opportunity to attend the annual Bay Area trip, and students represented the college of engineering, sciences and arts, the school of technology, and the school of business and economics. The week-long, thirteen-stop trip is enabled by friends and alumni of Michigan Tech, notably notably Dave House and the House Family Foundation, Kanwal Rekhi, Tom Porter and the Porter Family Foundation, and Charles and John Gates. The week kicked off with a 60-person alumni event at House Family Vineyards and tours of large, enterprise companies in the heart of Silicon Valley. The group moved north to the San Francisco and Oakland area, touring progressively smaller companies and startups, ending at the single-employee green technology startup run by tech alum Collin Stoner. Michigan Tech friends and alumni are critical to the tours, discussions, and hands-on activities at companies as most are in leadership positions and able to provide a diverse and often behind-the scenes view. HP executive Stuart Pann led leadership discussions and a tour through HP’s technology gallery, Alphabet Treasury VP Tony Altobelli showcased his mini-Wallstreet trading room deep within Google’s campus, and alum Alex Johnson walked the group through Facebook’s sprawling, city-like campus before a technical discussion. Other stops included the China-based, Germany-designed, California-engineered electric vehicle startup Byton, Distribute, nVidia, regulars like Clari, Handshake, Twilio, Netflix, and Ford’s new research facility called Dearborn Labs.
In mid-April, the bi-annual Michigan Tech based component of the 14 Floors Program will see a small contingent of guests on campus, including regulars Dave House, Kanwal Rekhi, John Rockwell, and Shankar Mukherjee. These alumni will spend a number of days engaged in one-on-one advisory and technical discussions with staff and faculty, mentoring sessions with students, panelists for business plan pitches on and off campus, and networking opportunities with the campus community. Students on the Bay Area trip will have a chance to debrief with these guests and the campus community in the Pavlis Honors College’s ICE House which fosters and houses entrepreneurial students on campus.

Dream Pop/Steam Pop/Meme Pop/Scheme Pop Buy the album: http://alohatigersmusic.bandcamp.com Aloha Tigers are a dream pop duo from Blooomington, IL consisting of singer/multi-intrumentalist Nick Aister and producer Michael Wharfield, who have just completed their first, self titled LP. Their sound is sad, hazy, hypnotic and blissed out, combining shoegaze , R&B, piano ballads, and classic pop hooks, with a heavy emphasis on dark, literate, and emotionally complex lyrics. Aloha Tigers' early exposure has been overwhelmingly positive, including being singled out for Song of the Day on the Line of Best Fit with an early version of the album track "Oh, The Glory of It All", and a recent post at newdust.com, who showered their praises on "Coven" and "Nice White People", two B-sides from their debut album.

Challenge: A Rocky Mountain operator had drilled approximately 328-427 ft (100-130 m) to reach a total depth of 9265 ft (2824 m). The drilling team experienced tight hole conditions and reamed to bottom, encountering some deviation control problems and creating a number of doglegs. These conditions resulted in a hole drag increase to 35,000 daN, which was approaching the rig limit on maximum hook load of 125,000 daN and the rig manager’s estimate of 110,000 daN.
Solution: The drilling team increased additions of Millenium Technologies Alcomer 120 L additive to 3 pails/ tour (to a maximum of 6 pails/day) and set the potassium level at 25,000 mg/L to improve hole cleaning. Coarse walnuts were added to the active system as pills and as a daily treatment. The bottomhole assembly was modified to have more Smith Services Hevi-Wate drill pipe and fewer drill collars to reduce string weight. The ALPINE DRILL BEADS product was added at a concentration of 3-5%, and a beads recovery unit was kept on standby.
Result: The drilling team’s addition of 100 sx of walnuts and increased additions of polymer to the active system failed to rectify the problem. The team decided to add the ALPINE DRILL BEADS product. The beads were spotted at the kickoff point (KOP) and at 656-ft (200-m) intervals from 8530 to 3609 ft (2600-1100 m). Hole drag improved by 5-6 daN on every pill. Drilling proceeded to the casing depth, after which the drilling team logged the well and ran the production string. Approximately 231 sx of the ALPINE DRILL BEADS product were used on this location.
The well was directionally drilled, with the KOP at 3228 ft (984 m), with a build rate of 2.5°/98 ft (2.5°/30 m) to a maximum of 32.65° in the direction of 30.05° azimuth by a depth of 4649 ft (1417 m). The hole angle was allowed to drop back to less than 5° from the middle Gething formation to form an S-curve and was maintained to TD. Hole conditions were good during connections and surveys. Tripping was performed with little time lost to reaming bridges and/or cleaning fill on bottom. Potassium concentrations were kept in the 20-22,000 mg/L range to maintain good wellbore stability. Maximum drag on trips was 14,000 daN.
At 8602 ft (2622 m), the drilling team tripped into the hole with a new BHA, changed the motor to 1.5° and reamed from 5069 to 5095 ft (1545 to 1553 m), and from 8333 to 8399 ft (2540 to 2560 m) for 3.5 hr, then washed to bottom.
The team then drilled ahead, increasing the potassium level to 25,000 mg/L, spotting an ALPINE DRILL BEADS pill at 3937 ft (1200 m) and dropping the string weight by 5000-6000 daN. The team drilled to 9108 ft (2776 m), spotted a second pill at the KOP and noted a 5 daN improvement. Drilling continued to 9239 ft (2816 m). The drilling team mixed and spotted a 7-m pill with 46 sx of ALPINE DRILL BEADS product at 8530, 7874, 6890, 4593 and 3609 ft (2600, 2400, 2100, 1400 and 1100 m) and worked into the formation while rotating at 75 rpm. The team drilled to TD, circulated the hole clean, then tripped out of the hole. The hole was tight.
The team spotted the ALPINE DRILL BEADS product from 8202 to 4265 ft (2500-1300 m) and pulled out of the hole to lay down directional tools. Ran back in slick, circulated, and conditioned the hole and mud, pulling out to log. The well was logged to bottom on the first attempt and a 4½-in. (114.3- mm) production string was run.
QUICK SLIDE CT multi-blend lubricant is designed for coil tubing operations to decrease the coefficient of friction in all water-base drilling fluids.
Decreasing the coefficient of friction reduces torque, drag and the potential for differential sticking in the wellbore. QUICK SLIDE CT lubricant is a suspension of polymer drill beads in a base fluid that contains no hydrocarbons. The co-polymer beads act as a mechanical lubricant, embedding themselves in the filter cake in openholes and providing mechanical standoff in cased holes, reducing metal-to-metal friction. The carrying fluid has a unique wettability characteristic that lowers the potential of accretion on the bottomhole assembly (BHA) and drill pipe, allowing more consistent weight to be applied to the bit. QUICK SLIDE CT lubricant is only slightly water soluble under most conditions, but is dispersible in water-base muds.
above: Stigma is a major problem with mental illness ; But arguably there is another neglected crisis - mental health related life expectancy - which results in hundreds of thousands dying decades before their time...
Last week was ‘Mental Health Week’ in Australia. Importantly this has drawn attention to related issues such as poverty, stigma and a decades-long crisis in mental-health-related life expectancy.
According to a study from The University of Queensland and The University of Western Australia mentally ill Australians are on average dying 16 years earlier than the general population. This would include sufferers of Depression, Bipolar, and Anxiety. The study noted that the vast majority of cases of early death actually related to “physical causes such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, rather than from suicide or accidents.” Medication can certainly play a role in promoting obesity – which as noted can lead to heart disease, but also diabetes.
Also despite this, recent research has established that suicide claims approximately 2,500 lives a year. Proportionately the most likely to commit suicide were elderly men.
What is more, regarding mental health related life expectancy, “the gap is growing”. And the figure for sufferers of Schizophrenia – which is estimated to be a minimum of 200,000 Australians (some say closer to 300,000) – is 25 years. That is, those with Schizophrenia in Australia die on average 25 years earlier than the general population.
Also according to the UQ/UWA study this result was worse than that experienced by smokers, and comparable to that suffered by indigenous Australians. Indeed, research on Indigenous Australian life expectancy revealed a gap of around 10.6 years. The figure for indigenous Australia is of the highest concern and demands a significant commitment of resources. But the comparison begs the question why mental health related life expectancy does not attract the same relative amount of attention given the numbers, and given the dire plight of those involved. Indeed, both indigenous and mental health related life-expectancy warrant a very significantly increased amount of resources.
Furthermore the statistics on mental health related life expectancy have not improved in 30 years revealing gross negligence by governments of all stripes.
In early 2014 Ryan Bachelor of the Chifley Research Centre condemned apparent moves by the Abbott Government to vilify and scapegoat disability pensioners. This approach was reinforced by a disgraceful campaign by Australia’s Murdoch tabloid press. Bachelor also emphasized that while the figures for the Disability Support Pension (DSP) were high (approximately 800,000 people), more recently these figures were slowly declining. The cost to the Budget was approximately $15 billion in a $1.6 Trillion economy. And the proportion of Disability Pensioners with a psychosocial disorder was 31 per cent.
Considering life expectancy statistics, no – sufferers of mental illness are not ‘having us on’ when it comes to the Disability Support Pension. As Frank Quinlan of the Mental Health Council of Australia argued in 2014, many amongst the mentally ill want to work – but cannot do so on account of discrimination. And they are also deterred because of severe means testing of their pensions. As Quinlan explained elsewhere:
“The reality of the experience of severe and persistent mental illness is that it can have a profoundly disabling impact on day-to-day living and social functioning, leaving some Australians requiring ongoing financial assistance despite their eagerness to work independently.
It may not be so popular to draw on Karl Marx in this day and age. ‘Marxism’ as such has been so distorted by those who claimed to act in his name that many would not give his ideas a second thought. But Marx’s maxim: “From each according to ability, to each according to need” should seem an eminently reasonable basis on which to fairly organize an economy and a society. And it is a perfectly reasonable basis on which to organize pensions, and the social wage and welfare system more broadly. This should mean an end to severe means testing, more positive incentives to find flexible work (rather than ‘punitive welfare’), emphasis on fighting mental health related discrimination, and positive incentives for employers to provide suitable flexible employment.
Specifically, Disability Pensioners have trouble maintaining any kind of social existence; not only because of illness, but also due to poverty. Poverty means it is often difficult or even impossible to run a car, for instance. This impacts on ability to even search for suitable work. There’s the option of public transport ; but that is not always available. This can also make it difficult to keep friends, or to find friends in the first place. Poverty also makes fitness a more difficult prospect. Again, ill health, obesity etc can contribute significantly to early death, while the mentally Ill need to work so much harder to maintain health and fitness due to the side-effects of medication. Due to poverty Gym memberships are generally out of the question. And health costs can also be prohibitive. Consider Dental and Optical just to start. This affects all pensioners, but the disabled are likely to be dependent long term with no way out.
Also many experiencing mental illness are stuck in substandard and insecure accommodation. Further, not all the mentally ill have support from Carers, and many ‘fall through the cracks’ into homelessness. A 2002 report had also noted:
“many people with mental illness are unable to afford stable housing or make their own housing choices, and frequently have problems accessing appropriate housing and difficulty maintaining tenancies because of disruptions caused by their illness.”
New Turnbull Government Health Minister Susan Ley says there are “no easy fixes” and that the system must “[catch] people before they fall.” (“The Age”, 5/10/15) This implies some insight as to what people actually go through. Though while early intervention is crucial in preventing such suffering few can really conceive of, healing for the afflicted is just as necessary. Expecting people to just “pull themselves together” demonstrates an appalling lack of empathy, understanding and humanity. So if Minister Ley is serious she must decisively reject the disgraceful stigmatization and vilification of Disability Pensioners conducted by the Murdoch Press, and by some elements in her own party.
We are yet to see whether or not there will be a decisive change of direction under the new Turnbull leadership. Resolve to achieve the following will comprise the degree to which we can judge the extent to which the Turnbull Government is meaningfully addressing the crisis:
· Increase the Disability Support Pension by at least $35/week indexed. To begin, this might make it possible to run a vehicle and to eat better quality food ; Improve support for Carers as well
· Implement anti-discrimination legislation and provide positive incentives for employers to offer flexible work
· Provide much more generous means-testing of Disability Pensioners – especially the mentally ill, slowing the rate at which the Pension is withdrawn ; and make it easy for those affected to immediately re-access the pension even if they had found full-time work – but relapsed into illness
· Provide comprehensive Medicare Dental and Optical – ideally on a universal basis – but if this is not possible under the current government, then at least offer it to those in poverty, including those on welfare
· Provide access to ‘physical health case managers’ – who assist in improving the physical health of the mentally ill – a dimension which is commonly neglected by mental health professionals
· Provide funding so the mentally ill can actually act on such advice: subsidised access to health and fitness facilities, gear and services.
· Promote social-connectedness for inpatients as well by enabling access to internet and social media where viable
· Increase social expenditure on mental health to make it reflect its proportion of “the country’s health burden”; ie: raise it from 7 per cent to 14 per cent of the Health Budget ; but achieve this by increasing the investment; and not through cuts elsewhere
· Finally follow through on the demand by ‘Australians for Mental Health’: for “improved access to mental health services, clear pathways for treatment and support, more early intervention and prevention services, and service integration”
Again the mentally ill are not ‘having us on’ when some of them can expect to die on average 25 years earlier than the general population. We have to hope that the new Turnbull Government will mark a shift in attitude. But what is actually necessary is an increase in funding for programs assisting the mentally ill. (as considered in the dot points above) We must judge all the political parties and independents on the basis of action and not just words.

Well, I got my video card, and definitely needed new holes drilled in my side panels. Unable to find a usable drill press, I decided to bring it to a local glass shop, as I mentioned before.
The guy acted like he could handle it, and said it was completely “feasible,” but that he’d have to “look it over tomorrow.” So I left the panels with him. I called him twice the next morning to see if he still thought it was possible, and to suggest I reduce the drill pattern to make it easier for him. No responses. He disappeared until 5pm or so. When I called him back he said he was “done.” I couldn’t believe it. Could the side panels be finished already? He said they “looked good,” there was just “a little shelling.” (Ok, so I can’t expect something like this).
Came across a website called Project Outsourced the other day. A group of documentary filmmakers are attempting to cover outsourcing from every angle. Interesting clip on the front page relating to Lou Dobbs, although almost everyone in that clip (including an NYU Economics professor) is so unbelievably wrong about Lou Dobbs that it hurts me to hear supposedly intelligently people speaking such garbage…
Posted on June 1, 2004 August 2, 2005 Author Andrew MontalentiCategories Globalization, Movies, Politics, Technology
It’s June 1, so work begins today. I’ve started out by looking for a JSP/Java Servlet host for my web development project for the summer. Found out an old friend of mine from high school (Andy) is running a business where he resells server space, and he found me a real cheap price and a lot of features, which is nice. I’ll be the only client of his using Tomcat.
My computer problems seem fixed. I don’t want to jinx it, but the tests are running smooth, and I spent all last night developing without a crash. I really think it was a hot spot on my CPU from uneven spread of thermal paste. I switched to the stock Intel cooler with the “black dust” thermal paste, and it is running better. The only problem now is that the old cooling system makes a bit of noise, but I’ll replace it soon.
I planned on doing some case mods to my ECube along the lines of this and this, but know I won’t be able to do them alone (not without a good drill press). I am going to have the holes drilled by a local glass shop I think (Lion’s Pride in Manhasset?). I don’t receive the Nvidia video card until Wednesday, but I hope it fits and I can have these modifications done at the end of the week.
Well, I’m annoyed now. My hardware’s been unstable since the start of the summer. In WinXP I experience random BSOD on mysterious STOP codes like 0x0000008E and 0x0000007E (which are like page faults and unhandled system thread exceptions). I’m suspecting bad RAM. I pulled out one of my memory cards and left 3DMark03 running in loop, and indeed the computer still crashed. I have the other RAM DIMM out and will do the same kinda test to see what happens. If this crashes as well, the only thing I have left to suspect is this damn AIW 8500DV, which’ll be out of here soon anyway.
So, I decided I’m going to move away from my ATI hardware (an 8500DV AIW) and on to a cheap GeForce card by Leadtek. According to reviews, my 3D performance should increase significantly (from 1000 3DMarks with my current card to ~3500), and this way I should be able to use the Nvidia Linux drivers which are all the rave lately. Frankly I’m tired of ATI’s piss-poor graphics support for Linux.
The other thing is that now I will move my TV capture to a separate card in the PCI slot. A Hauppauge WinTV PVR Media Center Edition (MCE) 250 is my current choice. What’s nice is that then I’ll also get the capture functionality in Linux, which I’ve been missing with my ATI card.
The only thing I fear is that the Leadtek’s fan won’t fit in my Ecube because the AGP slot is near the side panel. But if that happens I’ll RMA to NewEgg.
About a year ago, I bought a commercial version of Debian from a Canadian company called Libra Systems. It’s called Libranet, and it’s become pretty popular. Basically, it is a 2-CD distro that gets you up-and-running with a Debian sarge system in no time. Pretty soon, Libranet may be obsolete what with the debian-installer efforts and better and better configuration tools being released for free, but I’m still thankful for a commercial Debian distro that gets out of your way and allows you to get up and running with ease, and all the while maintaining 100% compatibility with the official Debian branches. I have since upgraded to sid without a problem, and even run Gnome 2.6 from experimental. All of this upgrading has never been met with problems, despite the custom packages produced by the Libranet maintainers.
In any event, libranet-archive is a project that is not entirely mine. Someone on the libranet mailing list (a great place to get general Debian Linux help) said that he had made archives of the mailing list from February 2001 to December 2003. So I opted to host them on my server. You can view the libranet-archive here. I plan on continuing his effort by turning my mboxes of the libranet mailing list since December 2003 into html using the same tool, MHonArc. For now, though, this may be useful for people searching for answers to the questions.

Glade-3 UI Designer: This is the only real tool out there for designing GTK+ interfaces without resorting to pure-source design. Development has stagnated a bit, but there are some good ideas for the rewrite which is in CVS right now (Glade-3). I am sure if I spent some time hacking it, I could make serious usability improvements and make it a more viable tool; I’ve played with the CVS checkout and although it’s a complete rewrite in terms of internals, the UI design approach is about the same. I think we can do better, and I think this is probably the best project for me to hack if I want to really learn GTK/Glib/GObject. I’ve heard that Dan Wither is working on a GUI designer for C#/GTK# called Stetic, but he hasn’t released anything. I think I’d want a good GTK+ designer first, and then we could make it work with C#, too. Since Glade-3 is a rewrite, this seems like a viable suggestion.
Galeon: a tabbed. mozilla-based web browser that is fully integrated into GNOME, is lean, and has a shitload of awesome features I can hardly live without. I have a few ideas for new, useful features I could add.
Nautilus: the GNOME file browser and graphical shell. I’d like to work on Nautilus’ plug-in architecture, and maybe even write a plug-in or two.
GTK+: a toolkit for writing GUI apps in C, I’d like to delve into its internals and focus on hacking toward fixing speed issues (particularly, responsiveness and redrawing, the two things that take the most complaints from “usability experts” coming from other desktop environments).
So, I spent a little bit of time to get a new design going on this site. Basically put back together CuteNews 1.31 and coded some nice-looking stylesheets to go with the site. I also had to learn a little PHP for modifying CuteNews and also for simplifying the layout of the site (the header and footer are componentized, and the header has a little php code behind it so that it figures out what page you are on and chooses which images to write to HTML based on that information).
The reason I came back to this site is that I plan on working on a lot of projects this summer, and hopefully I’ll be disciplined enough to document my efforts here. We’ll see how that goes.

Why am I evil? Well, I'm not, but that's the perception of all of us in HR. Need to fire someone? Come to HR. Need to explain to someone why, even after working their rear end off all year, that their annual increase is 2.7%? Come to HR. Need to come up with new mountains of paperwork? Come to HR. So, come join me on the Evil Side. Oh, and send me your HR questions.
I just got home from a fabulous vacation in Sharm El Sheik, Egypt. I'd never heard of it before we moved to Europe, but it's a very popular vacation spot. We went and it was wonderful. Plus, I learned a few things about business.
Fancy isn't always better: We ate some really fancy desserts. They looked incredible. But, honestly, the brownies at a church potluck taste better.
Before you go spend all that money on the high priced consultant, see if you've got any brownie bakers in your company. You may be surprised that their view of the situation and proposed solution is actually more palatable then the one dreamed up by the B school grads with the fancy power point presentations. After all, your people are in the trenches every day.
Under promising and over delivering really works: We flew on Edelweiss Air. I have such low expectations of airlines that I about fell over when the flight attendant brought out little backpacks with coloring books and beach balls in them for my children. Wow! I said. I will fly this airline again.
The return flight was an evening flight and they brought me a pillow and blanket for my toddler without me even having to ask. "I thought this might help with the flight," she said cheerily. Again, wow.
Now, I didn't know anything about this particular airline when we booked the flight, but I expected the same lousy service I'm used to on the standard US carriers. By doing just a few things better then them I felt like I'd found the best kept secret in air travel.
HR has a lousy reputation in a lot of companies. If we do just a little bit better on the basics, people may actually start listening to the important things we have to share.
And speaking of airlines... We actually flew the same day as the infamous Panty bomber. I, of course, didn't hear about this until the next morning when I turned on my computer for the first time in a week. I rightly predicted that a whole bunch of new regulations will be thrown at passengers, none of which will actually make us safer.
The new TSA directives include "Perform thorough pat-down of all passengers at boarding gate prior to boarding, concentrating on upper legs and torso." Super. So, if I'm a terrorist, now, I'll just put my plastic explosives in my socks.
See? Silliness. But, what do businesses do? Instead of coming up with solutions that will actually, you know, solve problems with problem employees, we come up with rules that will bother everyone else. For instance, we make exempt employees clock in, or we track when they log on to their computers, or we make them sign in and out for lunch, rather than saying, "Gee, we have a problem with Bill in accounting. He's not getting his work done. Let's work with Bill to come up with a solution."
Because, you see, requiring Bill and all his coworkers to clock in, doesn't actually make Bill a good employee and it bugs the snot out of those of us who are putting in 60 hours a week anyway, and get yelled at for not coming in until 8:13 when we were working (at home, on our laptops) until midnight the night before. Bill can be on time and still be a lousy employee.
Instead of imposing big rules that annoy your employees, teach your managers how to manage problems. Some problems can be solved. Some problems need to be shown the door and put on the "do not rehire" list.
Don't be a Russian Girl. We took a day trip to Cairo to see the pyramids. It was fantastic and fascinating. Our guide was a 25ish Egyptian man. He was nice and knowledgeable and funny and a little too open about his life. He told his he really wanted to get married to a "British girl," and did we happen to know any available ones? He assured us he would only marry for love, but she needed to be British.
Later he informed us that Russian tours were his favorite (he spoke Arabic, English, German and Russian) because the Russian girls were soooo easy.
Some of you may find out that your boss actually considers you a "Russian girl" while you keep thinking you're British. Stay with me and I'll explain.
I get e-mails from people all the time complaining about how they are hard workers, competent, get regular praise, but can't ever get promoted. That's because you are missing some quality that your boss (or your company) has decided is essential to a promotion. Any "Russian girl" dating our tour guide may think she's doing everything right to have a relationship that progresses to marriage, but our guide is just using her.
Unlike our love seeking tour guide's "dates" you can do something about changing yourself from Russian to British. Find out what those qualities are that you are missing. Work to obtain them. Realize that your particular boss may never recognize that you would be good in a higher role and leave the department or company. If you have cannot gain the necessary qualifications to "become British" then find a company that values your Russian-ness. (And no, I don't mean be "easy." This is just an analogy and keep your minds out of the gutter. Hard working! Responsible! Be good!)
No need to be so sensitive: We were in Egypt on Christmas Eve and Christmas day. Egypt is mostly Muslim. They put on a fantastic Christmas party for the guests. I have no idea of the religious affiliation of the rest of the guests, but I'm guessing the mothers in headscarves telling little "Mohammed"or "El Sayed" to go sit on Santa's knee (Santa rode in on a camel!) weren't practicing Christians. But it was a good party and so they came.
Most of the guests were from Europe (both Western and Eastern Europe), where most people celebrate Christmas. So, the hotel staff said, "Hey it's good for business if we cater to the bulk of our clientele. We realize that those of us putting up the Christmas trees and some of our guests won't actually be celebrating, but most of the guests will be." And so they did.
If your company has a Christmas party and you're Jewish/Muslim/Hindu/Atheist/Whatever, don't sulk in the corner because it's not your holiday. Likewise, if you're Christian and your company has a generic "holiday" party, don't go sulking in the corner complaining about how it should be a Christmas party. Come on, lighten up. It's a party. No one is asking you to be baptized or declare your faith null and void.
I'm sure more than a few non-Christian kids climbed on Santa's knee and got a present. Super for them. And super for their parents. Before you pitch a fit about something, ask yourself, "is this important, or is it just a party?" If it's the latter, let it go.
And speaking of letting things go: Sharm El Sheik is on the Sinai Peninsula. This bit of land has been the site of many wars over hundreds of years. Now, while the snorkeling is fabulous and a hike to where Moses received the 10 commandments (among other things, but this is not a Sunday school lesson), is enlightening, the rest of the place is pretty desolate.
We kept asking ourselves, "Why do so many people care about this piece of land?" This, of course, was a rhetorical question. We know why they care. (Both my husband and I have degrees in politics and I studied Hebrew in college, for goodness sakes. We know why from an intellectual stand point.) My point is, that if you don't have an emotional/religious/historical attachment at stake it's not great land.
How many times do employees hold grudges, or attempt to cling to a project that is doomed to failure because they've already invested time into it? Sometimes you need to take a step back and just let go. Give that project to the person who has been angling for it for months and work on something else. Evaluate if this really is the hill you want to die on, before you go to battle. Some things just aren't as great in the cold light of day as we build them up to be in our minds.
These are a few of the things I learned on my vacation. I also learned I can get Betty Crocker brownie mix in Egypt, but not in Switzerland. That's worth a post of its own some day.
I have a single employee, currently enrolled in our group health plan, who is getting married to someone who does not work with us in April. He wants to drop our health insurance group plan in favor of joining his bride's group plan with her employer when he gets married. But he has asked our business owner if we would be willing to pay his new wife's monthly premium. He's arguing that it would be cheaper for the company to do this instead of carrying him and his wife on our health care, and our boss likes the idea.
Is this legit? I'm worried that it might be discriminatory (wouldn't we have to offer to pay for all our employee's spouses health care premiums?) Are we going down a road we don't want to travel? Or is this a clever way to reduce health care costs. I'm not an HR expert, just the poor guy assigned to these duties in the office, and I really could use some guidance. We're located in Pennsylvania.
This is an excellent question, for which I don't know the answer. So, I'm publishing it anyway! I used to work for a company that did just that, but that was 11 years ago, I was an admin, and I certainly wasn't in on any of the discussions. It was in New York State, if that helps any. I worked with some fine people, so I presume they did their legal checking, but it was also a very small company, so who knows?
Anybody know the answer to this, or how to proceed? I would never want a policy where you paid the whole amount of the spouse's insurance increase.
I would just raise everyone's salary by $200 (or whatever) and increase the amount they paid towards their own benefits by $200, so if they didn't take the insurance, they would have the extra $200. But, of course, once you did that, people would forget about that and you'd run into the same situation later.
I am the manager of an administrative team of seven people plus myself. Next year I am going to have to lay off one of my people for poor performance and inability to work as independently as the job requires. She's been informed of her poor performance but doesn't seem to understand that we are serious.
She has been in this position for about six years. Because of rules in our state institution, we are required to give her at least three months notice. We are allowed the option of moving her to a different position once she has received notice, but we don't have any other position open at this time. Sending her home and paying her for three months isn't an option. She can certainly leave earlier if she gets another job, but I can't count on that happening.
My question is, what is the best way to work with the rest of the team, who will definitely be shocked and surprised and unhappy that she is being let go? Her performance issues aren't evident to them. I can't cite budget issues because we will actually be hiring two people to replace her (each will handle half of her job and take other duties as well). I'm reluctant to tell them that her performance is poor, because that seems, well, pretty nasty, like kicking someone when they are down.
I really don't want the rest of the team feeling like their jobs are in jeopardy, and I can't imagine what it's going to be like to keep going for three months with her still working there knowing she is leaving. Any advice on how to handle this?
First of all, I don't like using the term layoff for someone who is being terminated for performance reasons. It makes people leery of hiring people who were terminated for no fault of their own. But, that's neither here nor there.
I hate terminations with advanced notice. I'm of the "today is your last day" philosophy for precisely the reasons you outlined. It's hard for someone in that position to come in. The co-workers don't know what to make of it and it makes for a tough time for everyone. I much prefer payment in lieu of notice.
But, as you said, that's not an option here. First of all, if you don't think she's aware of how serious you are, do you don't have her on a formal performance improvement plan? If not, put her on one now. She needs to be totally aware. (Now, truth me told there are times in which you will tell an employee, "If you are late to work/miss an assignment/swear at Bob one more time you will be terminated." And then when the employee does just that they are in utter disbelief. But that doesn't seem like the case here.)
You seem to think that her co-workers will have no idea that her performance is low. I seriously doubt it. They suspect it. And if she has friends at the office, she's talked with them about the performance meetings you've held with her.
I think you are absolutely correct in informing her co-workers. Rumors are always worse then the truth. Notify her of her impending termination, with a clear statement of her last day of work. (And please be clear that this her LAST DAY OF WORK. "March 15, 2010 will be your last day of work. You will be terminated as of end of day on March 15." You'd be surprised at how many people don't process the fact that they are actually being terminated if you are not absolutely clear.) Then have a meeting with the rest of the staff. "Stephanie is going to be leaving us. Her last day of work will be March 15, 2010. We wish her well. The nature of the job duties are changing and we will be recruiting new people for the department."
Yes, you'll be asked a bunch of questions, none of them relevant. Stephanie will tell them all that you're a big meanie who is firing her for no good reason. But, don't stoop to the level of trying to justify your decision.
Now, one more thought before you terminate. If her co-workers truly don't suspect, it means that she's doing at least an adequate job in many areas. I don't know what her problems are, but if it's a case of non-willful non-performance, have you thought about dividing the job responsibilities now, giving Stephanie responsibilities for the things that she does well and hiring someone else for the remaining responsibilities?
It takes a lot of work to bring people up to the same level as someone with 6 years of experience in the organization. I have no idea what her issues are, but this may be something to think about.
You also mention that she will be looking for another job (duh!) but I kind of got the feeling you meant internally. If this is the case, please, please, please be honest with the potential manager about her inadequacies. Please do not play the "shuffle the bad employee" game. It is a bad game with no winners.
I work for a small family-run company. Upper management is all related, middle management and lower is not. The owner is a porn addict. One of my employees, "Lisa", complained about his porn within her view on occasion and said she was offended. I tried several methods to resolve this issue without direct confrontation as I found out that another employee in the past was conveniently terminated shortly after voicing her complaint.
That said, the end result was that I had to move Lisa to another area. It was not a punishment by any means (the work environment is much nicer in my opinion) but she now complains that she was not happy about why she had to be moved. Since the move, she disclosed to me that she has a mental illness. She also has made several statements about how she doesn't have any money and she seems to be a chronic complainer. The quality of her work has declined since her move and I get the feeling that she feels that she can do whatever she wants because she knows the "boss' dirty little secret". I do believe that if she were terminated that she would pursue a lawsuit for sexual harassment or whatever else she could come up with. She does enough to get by although she is definitely slacking more than normal.
The family is not aware of his porn problem although it turns out almost all of the non-familial employees do. Since I have resolved the situation to the point where she is no longer exposed to the harassment conditions, do I have anything to worry about or can I move forward with the issue with her non-performance? Should I just let her performance go if it makes the basic standards? If I let the necessary management/family members aware of his porn problem then it is almost guaranteed that I will lose my job.
PS This is the second small company I have worked for where I have faced this problem of an owner viewing porn in front of employees. Unbelievable!
Okey-dokey. And why don't we have filters on our servers? I know they aren't fool proof, but they sure do make it easier. (Yes, I know the answer to this, the owner is the porn viewer.)
You have reason to believe that someone was fired for complaining about the owner's viewing habits. You also have reason to believe that you will be terminated if you complain. Interestingly enough, Lisa has the opposite view--I know the owner is viewing porn so my job is safe. Because it is, from you, because you don't want to lose your job.
Porn viewing in the office can definitely lead to sexual harassment cases and the owner is putting his business at risk by doing so. The fact that the last person who complained about it was fired and didn't sue probably makes him feel invincible. You know, the whole "It's my company and I'll do what I want!" mentality.
You say the family members don't know about the porn problem. I bet that is not true. They just don't want to deal with it. Not only is this man their father/brother/husband, he's their boss. Talk about a classic example of why family owned businesses have a tendency to fall apart.
Your first step is you need to make your boss aware of the situation, even if your boss is the owner's wife. There are real potential consequences to his behavior. You, personally, need to be able to document that you have done everything in your power to end the porn problem in the office. Go to www.eeoc.gov and learn about the potential consequences to the business. Here's a little quote to present:
The court held that the proliferation of pornography and demeaning comments, if sufficiently continuous and pervasive "may be found to create an atmosphere in which women are viewed as men's sexual playthings rather than as their equal coworkers.
I realize you think you'll be terminated for bringing this up. You, yourself, would be able to file a sexual harassment charge in that case. So could everyone else that is aware of this. You, as a manager, whose only action was to move the complaining employee, are demonstrating that the company isn't committed to a workplace free of sexual harassment. Seriously. This could become a bigger problem for you if you don't tell.
If I were you, I'd go contact your local EEOC office first, and ask for advice. Have them document that you are afraid you'll be terminated for bringing up the problem. Then, go to your boss. Explain the situation, including the person who was terminated before. Say that you expect that this will be taken care of or you'll proceed to file a lawsuit.
You don't say, but I'm guessing you're male, so they probably think you can't complain about porn. Not true. It's obviously affecting your ability to perform your job.
After all this is done, go to Lisa and have a discussion about her work. If she has true mental health problems and your business is subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act, work with her to develop an appropriate plan. If it's not, work with her to develop an appropriate plan anyway. Explain that you expect high performance from her.
If she brings up the whole issue with the owner, tell her that you have escalated the issue and that she is free to approach the EEOC as well. Point out that you have removed her from the situation as well, so there should be no ongoing problem. This, of course, doesn't prevent the prevailing overall atmosphere of women as objects.
Now, normally, I would tell you to just go straight to the offender before you go to the EEOC, but he's already demonstrated that he's not interested in changing and is interested in retaliation. (Note to my readers--he gave me some additional info that he asked me not to share, as it increases the risk of identification. Just trust me on this one that the boss will retaliate.)
No matter what, you want to start looking for a new job. This company is messed up and it's doubtful this will solve the problem. If you are fired for this, you can definitely sue and will probably win but that can take years and years and what a pain. Your boss needs to be made painfully aware that this habit is costing the company good employees and has potential to cost it a lot of money as well.
And PS, fellow 24 watchers, I'm totally lame and just started watching this show, so I'm only on season 2, so no spoilers past 9:00 p.m. on day 2. :>)
I am a 33 year old that has been working at the same company for 5 years. Things were going along quite smoothly until about 10 months ago. This is an involved story, and I apologize for writing an email longer than you want. I just can't explain quite how nuts the situation is without going into it all.
I work for a private marketing firm of about 35 people, with 4 partners. We do not have an HR department, but rather one of the partners is designated HR partner and we are to go to him with any HR related issues. With the exception of 1 person, who I will call Dee, we somehow all manage to get along great. The real problem? Dee is married to the HR partner, who also happens to be my direct boss.
For the first 4 years that I worked for this company, I managed to stay on the "Good Side" of Dee. Dee is not in any management or higher up position - she is a peer to everyone else at the company. While I was on her good side, I was amazed at the mean, vindictive and hateful things she would say about her coworkers. I did not join in. Furthermore, the quality of Dee's work is astonishingly low, and it is generally assumed that the only reason she is still working for the firm is because she is married to one of the partners. I don't know of a single coworker who respects her or her work.
I managed to get on her bad side about a year ago when at a work social event I mentioned that I was putting my house up for sale. Evidently, she is a realtor in her spare time. The second she found out that I was putting the house on the market, she began to offer her services to me. Knowing that I don't find her work to be satisfactory, I knew that the last thing I wanted was for her to be my realtor. However, I wasn't ready with a quick response such as "Oh, my friend is a realtor and we are using her!" (This is beside the point that under no circumstances should I have to have a ready made realtor excuse, but it sure would have made my life alot easier!)
Anyway, over the next couple months she harassed me endlessly about being my realtor. I was "Realtor harassed". I finally told her that I had a realtor in mind that I had used in the past and that I was going to have her be my realtor. This is when the evil Dee came out! She told me that she was going to be too busy anyway, and that people were going to have to walk through urine to get to my house (I'm not sure where she came up with that one) and several other petty comments. I smiled and said "Well as long as it gets sold!"
The next day all hell broke loose. She strongly badmouthed me to several of my coworkers including badmouthing my job performance - insinuating to them that her husband, my boss, had said negative things about my job performance while they were at home at night. Being that the coworkers are my friends and not so much hers, they reported everything that was said to me. At this point I was still considered a "rising star" in the firm, and I am literally my boss's "go to girl" for everything, so I was suspicious. I routinely make him look really, REALLY good, and clients have let him know that. Furthermore, I considered him to be my mentor and we had talked at length about how important it is to communicate criticisms so that one might have a chance to improve - he had promised to always let me know if he had an issue with me. But since the accusation was brought up, I felt like I had no choice but to address it. So I spoke to him privately, let him know what happened, and told him that I had no interest in involving him in petty issues, but that if my job performance was in question, then I needed to know that.
He responded that No, he had no issue with my work and was very appreciative to have an employee like me. He said that he would take care of the issue and apologized to me that it was even an issue. He seemed to recognize that it was an absurd situation for me to be in. He also thanked me for coming to him. No other employee has gone to him when they have had a problem with Dee, they always go to other partners because they are too scared to say bad things about his wife to his face.
However, since this conversation 10 months ago, things have been different at the company. My boss seems like he tries really hard to separate his professional and personal life, but he's not really good at it. Dee continues to harass me in her own way - sometimes affecting my work and other times just being obnoxious. She routinely tries to make me look bad - I don't think she's succeeded yet, but quite frankly, the behavior is getting old. I have no interest in being involved in pettiness, but it's getting harder and harder as the days go on. I can deal with people I don't like - because I care about the end goal and I care about getting my job done. What I'm having a hard time dealing with is someone attacking me and tearing me down. I have tried very hard to control my reactions to her behavior, but after a year, I feel myself losing the battle and am feeling quite negative.
6 people have left the company in the 3.5 years that I have worked for them because they couldn't put up with Dee's behavior anymore. The company looses good employees because they refuse to deal with the bad ones. I have come very close to leaving the company, but I enjoy my relationships with my clients, and with the economy being what it is, there is NOBODY hiring in my field right now. I also enjoy my job aside from Dee! I've tried very hard to simply ignore it, but now Dee is involving our projects in the mess as well. I sincerely believe that she is affecting my chances for success at this company. Do I talk to my bosses again? What will come of that? Valuable people have left because of her, and they've done nothing. If I am valuable enough for them to fire her over me, then I'm going to be the employee that got my boss's wife fired, and that's not good.
If I do go to the bosses, how far do I go in explaining her behavior? Do I tell my boss that she's accused the president of the company of staring at her boobs? Do I tell my boss that she makes coworkers uncomfortable by saying terrible things about his mother to us? Because everything she has done is small and petty, I don't know how to explain it to them without sounding petty myself.
Part of the problem is that I can't really prove much. I can't prove that she's dragging my name through the mud to our clients, but I am 100% sure of it. I can't prove that she's done much of anything.
Alright, I think you get the gist of it and so will end this now. Hopefully you can see my conundrum. I'm really feeling like I'm in a no-win situation.
There is nothing worse then a co-worker with a side job that involves selling. Pamper Chef, Melaluca, Real Estate. It's all bad. (Although, as a side note, I had a delightful Real Estate Agent co-worker at my last job and she never pressured anyone.) Make this person the boss's wife and you've got a recipe for disaster.
To his credit, your boss, recognizes there is a problem and is not intentionally holding it against you. Obviously, he's got a difficult situation going on. Even though you are the only one who has gone to him with Dee problems, his response to you indicates that he knows full well what she is like. It's uncomfortable for him.
In the past you "stayed out of it" hoping that Dee would keep attacking others and leave you alone. This worked for a while. Now you are the target and others are laying low, hoping Dee will just leave them alone.
The time to hope Dee leaves everyone alone has come to an end. This plan will work best if you have some trusted co-workers that you can bring in on it. If not, you can go it alone. Here's what you do:
Every time Dee makes a negative comment about another worker, speak up. "Dee, you know that Ryan did a great job on the Jones account. Why would you say otherwise?" "Dee, that is an inappropriate comment." "Dee, why would you say that? Stephanie is hard worker with good results." "Dee, I didn't choose you as my realtor because I wanted someone who had experience in my neighborhood." Don't cower from her. Don't be mean, just let her know that you are not going to listen to or tolerate her mean behavior.
None of your other coworkers like her either, but they have been too scared to speak up. If you start this others will follow. Dee will go crying to her husband. But, given his earlier response it's doubtful that he'll do anything towards the rest of you. He's undoubtedly tired of the problem as well.
Don't run to any of the partners about her behavior. They see it. The other partners are just as stuck as you are. Just work on retraining her. (Also, I wouldn't worry about the quality of her work. I'd just focus on the meanness.)
If no one will listen to/put up with her mean behavior she'll have to change somehow. She may just sulk, but at least that's quiet. She may realize she can't expect immunity any more because she's a partner's wife.
This plan requires extreme caution. You cannot say, "Dee you are such a jerk!" Or "Dee, stop being rude!" You can only say things that are actual fact. If her complaint about how dumb Ryan is is met with, "Ryan did a good job on the Jones account," how is she going to complain to her husband about you? "But she said that Ryan did a good job!!! Waah!" See, it holds no water. Now, if you said, "Dee, stop being a jerk to Ryan," then she can say, "That big meanie called me a jerk!" So, don't do that.
And, just to be on the safe side, it's always a good idea to freshen up your resume! But, my bet is that as long as you say these things firmly and stick to the facts, you will have nothing to fear. But, also, keep notes. Just in case
I am just 21 years old. Currently I am pursuing a graduate degree in HR through correspondence college.But at the same time,I am working as an HR Executive with one of the reputed BPO.As I am very much passionate about my career,so I started to work as an HR after completing my graduation only.At present,I have one year experience in HR including recruitment and HR operation.Being a girl,my friends and my parents really feel proud about me that I am on a right track of my career.
I joined my current company in the month of October,2009.The company with whom I am working now,it is already settled in IT.But,they are very new into BPO business.So I joined this BPO by thinking that at the initial stage of career,I will get opportunity to learn as well as grow.But after joining,I came to know that HR policies are not in place.For every single thing,I need to struggle.My HR manager is not with me.He is handling everything from a different City.Even,employees have lot many issues about the policies and facilities like salary(which is a big concern),HR policies etc.But,management says that it will take time to streamline everything.
Now,I started to feel very insecure that I took a very important decision to join this company and the company situation is forcing me to rethink on my decision.Normally,I always believe on myself and my decisions.That's why,while taking this decision,I never discussed with anybody.
I can not leave also because before accepting this offer I rejected other offers by thinking that this company is offering me good designation as well as package.Now I am in a big mess.But,still I feel that this company is a reputed company in IT market so they will try to settle in BPO as well.So let them give a chance and continue my work.In short,I am confused and double minded about my decision.
Can you please advice me that what should I suppose to do in this condition as I am very much concerned about my career?
You've answered your own question, by they way. You'll notice that I put a few lines in bold. This is to draw your attention to them. You said you wanted to learn and grow, which is why you took this job. The company doesn't have policies in place, your manager is at a different location and things are not peachy keen. This is what we call an ideal situation for learning and growing.
There's a reason it's called work, and that's because it is hard. You've landed a hard job and it isn't the dreamy world of a "career" that you wanted. When I was young and stupid I wanted a "job" that would require a suit and heels, because that must be an important job. I had an idea of what "business" was and somehow the suit was an important part of it. I found out rather quickly that this was neither an indication of power nor importance, but of business culture.
You had some idea of what it meant to be in a learning and growing position. I bet it involved a mentor, who would listen to you and guide you and it would be like college except with a paycheck. Instead, you found out that it is thinking on the fly, figuring things out, dealing with crisis after crisis and doing this, mostly on your own. Welcome to the real world.
Your company has troubles. They hired you to help figure those out. You do need a mentor, but you'll have to do the work to get the mentoring. Having an offsite boss can be a difficult thing. Figure out how he prefers to communicate with his offsite people--is it e-mail, phone or occasional face-to-face meetings. See if you can establish regular contact with him.
Find out what his goals and priorities are and figure out how he can meet them. At one point I was telecommuting and my boss was one of those super-de-duper busy VPs so I couldn't really call her to chat. What I did was send her a weekly status report on everything I had done that week and what I planned to do the next week. This gave her the opportunity to stop me from investing huge amounts of time in a project that she was planning to kill, but hadn't gotten around to telling me about yet.
You may have to explain and remind your boss that you need a little bit of guidance. If he's not amenable to providing guidance, well, then you create policies and then present them to him.
You wanted learning and growing and by golly you got it! I understand that you are now second guessing yourself, but it's a little late for that. Plunge forward. Give it at least a year before you begin looking for a new job. You may find that this is the best experience of your life. But, you have to go forward with full steam. If you keep saying to yourself, "I should have asked for advice from my parents/friends/professors before I did this. This was probably the wrong decision" it will show in how you attack your work.
Your management said it will take time. They are right. Policies, procedures and company culture don't appear out of thin air. It takes time. Find out from your boss what your role is in this whole process.
And one more petty little thought: Back in the dark ages, when I was in school, we were taught to put double spaces between sentences. I understand single spaces are acceptable now. Fine. Pick one and stick with it.

And she writes the best reminder notes ever. Remember to support your Carnival! Submit your best posts and read it regularly and you'll be a better HR professional. Really.
E-mail me!. There is no way I can answer every question, but give me a try. I admit, I don't know the answer to everything, but I'm mostly willing to pretend I do. Right now I have 472 questions in my queue, so it might be a little while. (I might be exaggerating, just a bit.) To increase your chances of getting your question answered, please limit yourself to two-three reasonably sized paragraphs and try to figure out what your real problem is.

A scene from “First,” an advertisement from Chevrolet to showcase its deployment of vehicles with built-in 4G LTE Wi-Fi.
Chevrolet owners used more than 4.2 million gigabytes (4.2 petabytes) of data in 2016, a 200% increase that highlights the ever-growing availability of wireless Internet connectivity and the demand for streaming music, video, and other data in vehicles.
It’s a wonky, yet important data point that shows how the GM brand is using special features and technology—like OnStar 4G LTE—to grow retail sales. These new technologies not only attract new buyers, they help these consumers become repeat customers as features like wireless Internet become “an integral part of their day-to-day lives,” said Alan Batey, president of GM North America and global head of Chevrolet.
The automaker introduced OnStar 4G LTE connectivity to 2015 model-year Chevrolet cars and trucks. The 4G LTE connection comes standard on all new Chevrolet retail models. Customers have to pay for a data subscription. A monthly data plan subscription ranges from $10 for 1GB to $40 for 10GB, according to GM’s website.
The biggest increase in data use among Chevrolet customers were Tahoe and Suburban owners, who used three and a half times more data than a year ago.
Tahoe and Suburban owners used 713,669 gigabytes of data in 2016, a 260% increase over the year before, according to GM.
That’s not surprising, considering these vehicles can hold more people, including kids, who can use the data connection to play games or stream video. GM says 713,669 gigabytes of data is equivalent to 3 million hours of streaming standard video, GM says.

Response . nOne commonly would not repair these models. You will want use of a significant tension twelve ton, push to open up device for bearing substitute.. Much less expensive to choose device to some electrical repair shop. If you are activity, the usual problem is bearings, the diodes are fairly secure, but one might have it checked, without cost, for the community car retailer.
An area named Automotive Exchange on Twain Road in San Diego (question Google) just quoted me $85 to rebuild an alternator for my buddies '93 190c, and I may have them do it, Whilst I have done this persistently in past times. They've a driver coming right here anyhow and will give me no cost pickup of my outdated alternator and shipping and delivery in the repaired just one about five hrs afterwards. You can get diodes a whole lot more cost-effective and do it home by yourself. Diodes tend to be the cause of alternator issues. Use an ohmmeter (100x) to ensure Every single diode has substantial resistance in one direction and very low in the other.
When to exchange the alternator? The following electrical or mechanical faults are signs that the alternator may need to get replaced:
Inexpensive alternator repairs at your house or Business office. Have a free estimate and book on the internet with one among our cell mechanics currently.
On "vee" type belts, Never above-tighten them. You ought to be in a position to deflect them an inch or so with no lot of pull.

The alternator is located among the engine & the firewall about the passenger side. You need to get rid of the entrance appropriate tire, cv assembly, for extrication from underneath. Not a straightforward job. The alternator might be removed from the bottom and accessed in the leading in the engine compartment. I have completed this two times and It's not at all in Amy guide I learned it from a mechanic. I am not mechanically enclined so be sure to choose this for what it really is well worth.

Delcotron note: You will find a rectifier diode assembly with both equally optimistic and negative diodes in it. Strips of steel with u-formed slots go above the electrical Call studs around the rectifier assembly. To isolate the diodes bend these strips absent to either side more than enough to isolate them from one another.
The most crucial alternator employs the other configuration with a rotating field and stationary armature. A bridge rectifier, called the rotating rectifier assembly, is mounted within the rotor. Neither brushes nor slip rings are utilised, which reduces the quantity of sporting elements. The principle alternator incorporates a rotating area as described above in addition to a stationary armature (electrical power technology windings).
Often there are actually three sets of stator windings, physically offset so the rotating magnetic industry creates a three period present, displaced by just one-3rd of the period with respect to one another. Synchronous speeds[edit]
The newer automobiles have alternators which are "temperature compensated". This means they charge at different voltages depending on the temperature. A incredibly hot battery needs less voltage to demand than a cold battery, And so the temperature compensated alternators charge at a reduced voltage when warm than when cold.

“If you see the battery light on, it’s actually imperative that you get it addressed,” he claims. “Should the headlights are dimming, it’s crucial to get yourself a charging system examination.”
ROTOR: The rotor assembly consists of numerous "pole sneakers", copper field windings, and the slip rings, all mounted over the central shaft of your alternator. Various "N" and "S" poles to the rotor move across the multiple sets of stator windings (in teams of three) to generate 3 section AC latest.
If your vehicle starts off and runs, or Should the engine turns around Generally whenever you check out to begin it but it really will not likely basically run, there might be nothing Erroneous together with your alternator, starter , or battery.

Sacha Baron Cohen was attached to the Freddie Mercury biopic for many years, but once the project started moving forward Cohen left, and the film seemed like it might die. But then Ben Whishaw joined and actor-turned-director Dexter Fletcher was hired to helm the project. Now Fletcher has left the film, citing "creative differences," which makes us wonder if this project is cursed.
And, as Deadline notes, Whishaw -- who played Q in ‘Skyfall‘ -- is now locked into the James Bond franchise, so if they can't get the Mercury biopic going shortly, they'll have to wait until after he shoots 'Bond 24,' which means it's anyone's guess if this project is ever going to get off the ground. But producer Graham King has money and a distribution deal with Sony, so it seems likely this will happen sooner rather than later.
Word has been that the surviving members of the band Queen are the main agitator for these reported creative differences, as they may not want certain aspects of the late singer's life put to film. Fletcher was an interesting choice as he's someone who's had a lot of experience in front of the camera (he appeared in his first movie when he was ten), and is now transitioning into directing. This would be his third film and likely the first to get worldwide exposure, which means it would have been a huge boon to his career. That he walked away says nothing good.

In June of 2017 the Resilience Research Centre partnered with Optentia Research Focus Area, NWU (alongside organizational support from the Primary Healthcare Directorate, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town) to co-host our fourth Pathways to Resilience conference in Cape Town, South Africa. We welcomed over 400 guests and nearly 300 presenters to our events from 54 different countries around the world.
Bringing our conversation into South Africa allowed for important and engaging dialogue focused on issues in the Global South where people are often disproportionately challenged by double and triple jeopardies (e.g., being both socially marginalized because of race, gender, ability or class, while at the same time experiencing climate change, armed conflict, and structural inequality). In the face of the apparently intractable challenges to human wellbeing, knowledge of how and why individuals, families and communities adapt to adversity and transform their worlds has become increasingly important. Pathways to Resilience IV provided a forum for understanding how this adaptation varies across cultures, how those in the Global South define resilience, and what can be done to meaningfully support health, wellbeing and social justice. We aimed to make a real difference to those who are tasked with responding to adversity, not only in the Global South, but through what we learn, in the Global North as well.
The Child-to-Child Trust warmly invites you to participate in the second edition of the international conference on children's participation: CATS (Children as Actors Transforming Society).

Ohio State men’s basketball center Micah Potter has transferred from Ohio State just two days before the start of the season.
The 6-9 junior appeared in 59 games for the Buckeyes, averaging 4.1 points and 2.8 rebounds. pic.twitter.com/z5oILBwjNE
It hasn’t been announced yet where Potter will transfer to, but it might be worth noting that Micah’s brother Noah Potter is a four-star recruit who has said he is still committed despite Micah’s transfer:
Four-star defensive end Noah Potter says he's "still 1000% committed" to the Ohio State football team despite his brother Micah's transfer from the basketball team. https://t.co/MdMfBeI3pt
This sort of shake-up is always tough to deal with, as Potter figured to take up a larger portion of minutes with the exit of Keita Bates-Diop and Jae’Sean Tate after last season, but it might be especially difficult given the timing of the situation. However, after last season, Chris Holtmann seems to have earned the confidence of Buckeye hoops fans.

How do you start up a Raspberry Pi? I got a starter kit which includes everything needed to get going, but the starter kit didn't include a HDMI cable, so i got one of those. After several trips to the store before i settled on the right adapter. (i think). Then i downloaded SD card formatter and NOOBS, so that i could use my sd card.
But then it turns out later versions of windows can't detect sd cards at all, but my old as shit pc detects that my 16 gb card has a storage of 5 gb. But it can't be used.
Man, all in all, raspberry so far has been the most labor and hardware intense thing i have ever attempted. All the guides on youtube simply assume that everything is setup and properly arranged before you start using it.
But i cant even get it to start. Am i missing something here? Surely, it must be crucial that windows can detect SD-cards. But it is impossible. I have tried on several different computers.
I don't know if you're kidding but... If you have trouble getting SD cards to work on Windows, it might be ten years too early for you to try out Linux.
Sounds like your SD card is incorrectly formatted, that's all. It's that complicated because you were too cheap to buy a prepared SD card from their store, I guess.
I have one that won't read cards over 2GB, and another that breaks at about 8GB. The former was just pre-SDHC, while the latter was a bargain bin piece of crap.
Recently bought a Bosch GWS angle grinder. Bought it for a particular job and it is done. Now I wonder what else I can do with it. I looked for other blades. Anybody have advice? Information?

i got an error that said the values didn't equal or something and then windows shut down. but if windows shut itself down it would save changes (to itself) too, right?
If Windows is the one shutting down then changes will be flushed to disk as part of that shutdown. The only time that wouldn't be the case is if you had an overheat condition (typically CPU) that causes the system to spontaneously power off. In that case you wouldn't see any messages about Windows shutting down, it'd just power off.
Thinking about getting 2 MSI GTX 970s for sli. Going to have 4 moniters hooked up to them. (2 17' 1 24' and 1 52' moniter). Anything I should be aware about before buying these or any other recommendations?
First the .5Gb was locked unless you were a special case (specifically backed by NVidia and actively excluded anything to do with AMD). Then they unlocked it when people realised they weren't getting what they paid for and could potentially sue. Now developers have to deliberately avoid using that extra .5Gb to avoid shit-canning performance.
It's the prequel to nVidia Gameworks, shit-canning performance all over the place so they can lock developers into their product with the promise of "extra performance".
Gameworks is also about shitcanning performance on older Nvidia cards too. Even if your older card is vastly more powerful than a newer card, the newer card will get better performance.
The only reason developers are using Gameworks is to get a taste of that sweet, sweet Nvidia development monies. Having Nvidia work for free on your code is the same thing as paying a developer cash to hire someone to do the work. Nvidia just cuts out the middlemen.
a couple of GTX 970's is still no match for a GTX 980 just save a little bit more and you can run any kind of games you want with a single GTX 980 than having to crossfire your cards. Crossfiring does not give you much performance it always depends on your game and how shitty it is optimized the most you will probably get is about 10-20 fps increase that is a pretty shit deal if you ask me, Just saying OP

Anyways, i've been having problems with my phone lately (iPhone 4). The issue is in terms of storage space, I have jack shit on here (one application and 0 photos) and I still have less than a gig left in storage. I've reset multiple times and completely reset it. I've hooked it up to my computer and the only thing I could find were the pictures. I've had this little guy for about 2-3 years. This problem became relevant a few months ago and it hasn't stopped plaguing me. I've looked up solutions to this but most of them are for the 5, 5s and 6. Any suggestions as to what i can do to fix this.
I have an issue with iDevices where "Other" grows to be several gigabytes in size, even larger. Other covers Safari's cache but also data from Messages and Mail.
The problem is that while you can delete individual items in Mail and Messages to get that space back, Safari's cache is anything but temporary. The only way to fully clear it once its grown to unwieldy sizes is to use erase all contents and settings, then restore from an icloud backup. Restoring from an iTunes backup will just restore those ungodly files back into it.
Speaking of iPhone 4, I have an old one that doesn't power on. If you plug it in, it goes between the logo start screen and being off endlessly. Any ideas?
Could be the battery, but without opening it up and disconnecting the battery you won't know. Could also be some kind of serious corruption in the flash, affecting the initial series of processes that load at boot. A jailbreak gone awry could cause this, since they typically insert themselves into the boot process or otherwise try to modify it.

Is there a way to extend a router's signal using two wireless routers without having the 2 routers connected?
I (hopefully) want one wireless router to "repeat" the signal in a long basement apartment with shitty coverage.
The guy who has the base router and modem in his room is a bit of a bitch about having any cables going out of his room.
The main router nor secondary routers need to support repeater mode if you string them together via cat5. All you have to do is give the two routers the same name, same encryption method, same passkey, and disable DHCP on the secondary router.
Its only if you're stupid enough to use WDS that they need to support WDS, and have changes made on all routers to enable WDS, and generally hope and pray that nothing goes wrong and knocks WDS offline (which it will, regularly).
I need some way to save these images as individual files. Yes, I can save as in my browser (firefox), but only one at a time, and there are 400 pages with as many as 100 images each.

So unless I can find some bulk method that will work with base64, I'm looking at a really, really long slog through this mess. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
Otherwise you could try a base64 converter, although if you've put each inside an HTML wrapper, instead of simply putting each into its own base64 file, a converter may not be able to interpret it:

In the interview with RT below, he doesn't seem to know "1,800 mSv/Hr radiation" is almost all beta radiation (dose equivalent), and doesn't seem to be aware of what's inside the leaky tanks (hardly any gamma nuclides).
The latest surge in radiation at Fukushima nuclear plant may suggest not only additional water leaks at the site, but could also mean fission is occurring outside the crippled reactor, explains Chris Busby from the European Committee on Radiation Risk.
The increase in radiation reading is too significant to be blamed on random water leaks, believes Busby.
Chris Busby: I think this is an indication that it has actually deteriorated significantly, very suddenly in the last week. What they are not saying and what is the missing piece of evidence here is that radiation suddenly cannot increase unless something happens and that something cannot be leakage from a tank, because gamma radiation goes straight through a tank. The tank has got very thin metal walls. These walls will only attenuate gamma radiation by 5 per cent, even when it is 1 cm thick.
Although they may think this is a leak from the tank, and there may well be leaks from the tank, this sudden increase of 1.8 Sieverts per hour is an enormously big doze that can probably kill somebody in 2 to 4 hours.
Today there was another leak found at 1.7 Sieverts per hour in more or less the same place. This huge radiation increase, in my mind means something going on outside the tanks, some radioactive fission is occurring, like an open air reactor, if you like, under the ground.
RT: What impact will this have on the clean-up operation and those who are involved in that operation?
CB: First of all it is clearly out of control and secondly no one can go anywhere near it. Nobody can go in to measure where these leaks are or do anything about them, because anybody who is to approach that sort of area would be dead quite quickly. They would be seriously harmed.
I’ve seen a photograph taken from the air recently, in which the water in the Pacific Ocean is actually appearing to boil. Well, it is not boiling. You can see that it’s hot. Steam is coming off the surface. There is a fog condensing over the area of the ocean close to the reactors, which means that hot water is getting into the Pacific that means something is fissioning very close to the Pacific and it is not inside the reactors, it must be outside the reactors in my opinion.
1800 mSv/hr is not gamma radiation but beta radiation, expressed in 70 micrometer dose equivalent to show the effect on skin and eye lens, with effective dose 1/100 of that amount.
It is not "sudden increase" in radiation. This waste water has that order of beta radiation all along, as evidenced by the measurement in the leak in February 2012.
The water leaking is very high in all-beta including strontium but almost devoid of gamma nuclides including radioactive cesium, incapable of giving off gamma radiation to the tune of 1,800 mSv/hr.
For a scientist, Busby makes claims in this interview in a way too non-scientific way, i.e., not backed up by credible reasoning and verifiable information. Just overlooking the obviously significant difference between gamma and beta radiation is pretty pathetic for a scientist actively dealing with just that field. Likewise, the RT reporter does anything but dig into the statements made. Seriously unimpressive and unconvincing all the way around, at least for my taste.
Tritium is a very damaging beta emitter since tritium can pass through the skin and passes thru anything (glass, metal, plastic, etc.) for that matter except the most densest materials, like gold. And there is no shortage of tritium onsite. More easily absorbed in the body when combined with chlorine and there is plenty of chlorine in seawater. Where is all the tritium coming from?
Your counterpart is reporting high radioactivity being found upstream now before the Daiichi site. Also reports, TEPCO is neglect in using the proper monitoring tools for reporting radiation.
Where is all this recent radioactivity coming from? Released from pent up underground basements all of a sudden?
I'm guessing sudden unwelcome criticalities may yet occur through fractional distillation within the water moderated underlying strata.
Anon at 10:59AM, so where is Busby's data to base his assertions that it is gamma radiation and that the Pacific Ocean is boiling? Oh excuse me "appearing to boil"?
Anon at 5:07AM, your logic is flawed. Busby seems to think fissioning is occurring because he thinks 1800mSv/hr radiation is gamma radiation and because the ocean looks like it is boiling. Without these two reasons, what else is there to base his theory?
I think someone ought to tell Busby that he is basing his theory on wrong information. He will further lose credibility in Japan if someone translates this into Japanese, though hard-core fans won't be swayed no matter what.
Anyone who thinks underground criticality is warming the sea water (but not the ground water under the reactors) has automatically disqualified themselves from any further discussion me thinks.
If the readings from the leaks are that high and represents all the holding tanks then TEPCO is reassembling part of the cores back inside the holding tanks. It is not just some cooling water diluted with ground water that was used once or twice besides what was already removed in filters, it is radioactively 'hot' and to unstable to send back through for cooling.
Of course, there is nothing to see here, move along, go about your own business, everything is fine, go back to your homes.
Just want to throw this out there for those with much more insight..Given the geology and the geography of the site..reports of seams and fissures in the substrata caused by earthquakes, and old underground water flows..is it not possible that all the hundreds of thousands of tons of seawater dumped to cool the cores is actually flushing them out through the seams to sea? Would that not account for the sudden and intense spiking?
Earlier this year, the Unisys sea-surface temperature chart clearly showed a huge hotspot ballooning out into the ocean from the Fukushima area. That was enough to convince me, even then, that an uncontrolled reaction was heating the groundwater before it flowed into the sea. Soon after, alomost overnight, the chart showed no such anomaly. It's as if the sea-surface temperature chart was doctored to hide the obvious - which is what we're discussing now and is plain to see.
corium may be reacting with earth natural thorium in a runaway reaction ... black sands may be the culprit , if that is so we might see japan burning and sinking in the sea...somewhat alike atlantis sunk eons ago ,,,,
tell japan to detonate a 2,000 megaton hydrogen warhead to incinerate all the nuclear fuel in a single event , leaving a molten crater sunk in the sea ... fukishimma was predicted in their manga movies, along with the solution I tell ..
Oh, horsefeathers to all of this. Because, as everyone knows, "Nuclear power plants are a safe and efficient way to produce electricity".
(Can you imagine what would happen if an EMP from the sun knocked out the cooling systems of the plants of whatever side of the Earth the EMP struck? And if diesel backup generators for cooling survived the EMP, how long will they run as the EMP has also knocked out the infrastructure of getting more fuel to the diesel engines? Jeepers. The mind boggles.)
What you are seeing is an actual China syndrome. The cores have melted into the earth but have hit a layer through which they can no longer melt. Once ground water was reached, there was no explosion. You have molten radioactive material sitting on a layer of rock boiling away groundwater.
Kidding or not, ignorance or not, nuking SPF pools is like spreading more nuclear poisons around the earth in aerosol form. Daiichi has more than 600,000 spent fuel rods onsite. Spent fuel rods are highly radioactive nuclear waste. The common fuel pond at ground level holds holds up to 6291 fuel rod assemblies. Each assembly holds sixty-three fuel rods.
Because plutonium is a daughter by-product of fissioning uranium. 1% of all spent fuel rods is plutonium.
So, it is not a good idea to drop a nuke on a nuclear plant, operating or not because of all the spent nuclear fuel waste onsite, not counting cask air-cooled storage which Daiichi also has.
Busby is more than competent in his field of nuclear epidemiology but has little apparent expertise in the physical dynamics of nuclear meltdown. I wonder if he has ever seen the video from the Chernobyl basement of how those coriums solified or vitrified into pahoehoe lava pouring out of the ducting a level or two below the breached, empty pressure vessel. Sure did not see fission happening there afterwards.
Total non-expert here but have known since Day 1 it was worse than bad... But question to the experts: could it actually be a GOOD thing that the cores (or whatever stuff leaked out and is going "China Syndrome") are hitting groundwater rather than not? Doesn't the groundwater now serve as a giant cooling pool that can't (or probably won't) run out of water? I mean of course it sucks in terms of contaminating the groundwater but isn't that going to help prevent further "criticality?"
Dr. Busby was about the first one on scene (within weeks of 3/11?) in Japan trying to warn their people about fallout from Daiichi. Even got in trouble for pushing calcium supplements to displace or prevent strontium-90 uptake in the human body. He was also the first person I heard say the burning of radioactive debris throughout Japan was intentional by the Japanese government to spread the contamination around so comparisons to Fukushima radiation wouldn't appear as elevated...if the government there didn't bother to report until 3 months after the fact that 3 cores melted down within 48 hours of 3/11 then that government is capable of anything.
Arnie Gundersen wrote a pamphlet early on in Japanese warning of the risks of Daiichi and what happened there. Visited many small towns to give talks to the locals to help them understand what was happening.
Greenpeace had boots on the ground trying to take readings and other private citizens trying to report readings.
The US government congratulated Japan on the 'cold shutdowns' at Daiichi and ceased reporting fallout in the US shortly after 3/11 and continues allowing the importation of Japanese meats, rice, fish, etc., from Japan without testing. Also raised the allowable radiation exposure rates after 3/11...Wouldn't matter much except the radioactive poisons bio-accumulate in the food chain.
When you read in general about nuclear reactors, water is used to carry off heat and turn it to steam to drive turbine generators and also at the same time acts as a 'moderator' and a moderator slows down the speed of 'neutrons' so they have a better chance of hitting the uranium fuel and fracturing it to cause a sustained chain reaction of fission to create the heat.
Usually graphite and/or boron are used to absorb the neutrons and stop the chain reactions. Decay heat continues as there is no 'OFF' switch that can stop it.
In Chernobyl, the worry was the melted core would find groundwater or even rainwater and water would moderate neutrons and cause whatever fuel was left to fission uncontrollably and exploded again (the melt there never made it out of the building). At Daiichi, the US sent Japan boron to be mixed with the water or seawater used for cooling to prevent any fission.
What happened to the worries of the core melts finding plenty of underground freshwater to moderate neutrons to hit any remaining fuel and cause uncontrolled fission and possible nuclear explosions is kind of a mystery to me but water can be both good and bad when surrounding nuclear fuel. It carries off the heat and keeps the melt a solid but moderates neutrons at the same time.
What kind of idiots put a nuclear power plant on one of the most geologically active regions of Earth? In a few million more years when the Asians have evolved a bit more I think they may look back at the slant eyes of today and realize that they are a stupid people.
The USA had Project Gnome (1961) which was a program to test whether or not nuclear bombs could be used in all the ways envisioned by the atomic utopianists (i.e for construction not destruction) They did some deep underground nuclear explosions one of which was to hollow out a mountain to see if it could be then used for human habitation.How does this relate to Fukashima? Well maybe a nuclear explosion(s) deep (miles?) under Fukashima could create a large cavern(s) they could then channel all the radioactive water into rather than dump it into the ocean? Maybe the entire Fukashima plant (all the fuel rods) could be dumped into this cavern and then fill it in and seal it off?
Fukushima is actually in melt down,, in other words there is a spot where molten pit is burning into the earth, as it melts more earth, it goes deeper, eventually it will seal itself off but right now it is MELTING DOWN literally in a downward direction, once that is deep enough, then the whole surface can be burried under a mound and sealed off

A postcard found on ebay by Len Parker (now in Florida) titled ‘Surfer’s and Dogs Delight, Compton Bay’ The surfer is Martin ‘Bert’ Spencer sometime during the early 90’s carrying a Custard Point longboard at Compton Bay, Isle of Wight.

A great big thanks to Andy for coming down to the Island for the Surf Movie Night weekend and for being there with his camera when we got those great waves on Saturday 9th October 2010 at Compton.
Andy has a great Longboarding movie ‘Devon Lanes and Longboards’ (shown on the movie night) for sale.
The film was born out of the love of surfing and an appreciation of North Devon, its waves, its people and its places. Devon Lanes and Longboards features many of the UK’s top Longboarders surfing at various beaches around the North Devon area. Starring local surfers including Ben Haworth, Ashley Braunton, Phil Hill and many more. It also features other top Longboarders such as Ben Skinner, Elliot Dudley, James Parry and Adam Griffiths.
The motivation to complete and publish the film was stimulated by the awful news Andy’s sister was diagnosed with secondary cancers in April 2009. Andy wanted to show her his love and support by making and dedicating this film to her fight against cancer and to donate all the profits from the film to a charity of her choosing.

What a day Saturday the 9th of October turned out to be. The swell started to grow from only a couple of foot first thing to an epic swell that saw Compton, Freshwater Bay and The Pearl all fireing. I checked Compton early and a few of you were either in or going in and it was about 2 – 3ft and building. The wind looked a little strong, making the waves hard to catch but as the swell grew it got better and better. I knew I was only going to get one go at getting a few waves so opted to come back in a couple of hours in hope my timing would pay off. Will still alot of things to finalise for the movie night I did about 15mins filming and the shot off to try and get as much done as possible in 2 hours.
While I was away my phone didn’t stop. I had messages saying nearly every break from Freshwater Bay right round to Sandown were breaking. When I came past Freshwater Bay there was too much water and I couldn’t wait any longer. At Compton I met up with Andy Haworth (Devon Lanes and Longboards) who was already on the cliff top filming (Can’t wait to see the footage Andy). After quick introductions he exclaimed that in all his times on the Island he had never seen Compton like that. While talking a set came through and I hadn’t seen anything like that at Compton for a very very long time. I then ran back to my car to get changed and get in. With only about 15 – 20 people in the water it was perfect, I managed to get a couple of the big set waves right to the beach. When I wasn’t catching waves it was just great to watch some of you guys getting some great waves and the standard of surfing on the Island is very high. I don’t know all of you, but being out there on Saturday really showed that all those days surfing in small wind chop, onshores and just getting in when there was any wave has produced some excellent surfers on the Island.
I only had a short time at the beach and only managed to photograph Compton for about an hour. If any of you have any good photographs of anywhere on Saturday please send them in to us and we’ll put up a gallery of all your shots. I have seen some great shots of The Pearl and Freshwater Bay on Facebook so send them to us too.
Havig such a great swell during the day it couldn’t have been any better for the Movie night. With everyone buzzing from the waves earlier in the day the Sandpipers was soon full to the brim and a wall of noise as everyone talked about the waves. We started the evening with ‘Devon Lanes and Longboards’ by Andy Haworth (If you are interested in buying Andy’s movie go to his website here Devon Lanes and Longboards ). This was followed by a great movie by Sid Pitman ‘Surf Rats’. We also had Strat Cat Productions who very kindly set up a screen and played movies in the Sandpipers big hall all night from ‘Brown Water’ by Sid, ‘Isle of Wight Surf Club’ by Annie Macpherson and Andy Haworths footage from the day. A big thanks to Mark, Nigel and the boys for helping making it a great night. The evning was to finish with ‘Fusion’ by Ross Johns and you can also buy his movie at surfclips.co.uk. At this point I think most of the Ale in the bar had gone and people still wanted more, so by popular request we put on Bert’s ‘Wight Water’. We went on playing movies well into the early hours and raised over £100 for the Freshwater Lifeboat. Many thanks to all who came and especially Jason, Andy, Ross, Annie, Sid, Bert, Al, The Sandpipers Hotel, the West Wight Landscape Partnership and all who helped to make the evening a great success (Apologies if I forgot anyone).
If anyone took any photos during the Surf Movie Evening we would love to put a few on here too, so send them in to paul@wightsurfhistory.co.uk
Saturday was another one of those days that will be remembered for a long time. I got a few nice little sequences so here is the second sequence of Bert on a nice wall.
I got a text Friday night from a good friend Chris Court to say that Compton could be good in the morning. Compton wasn’t exactly epic but there were some fun waves to be had. After about an hour and a half I got out and was chatting to Bert and let him try out […]
The Wight Surf History Project aims to document and celebrate 50 years of surfing on the Isle of Wight. It will tell the story of how surfing arrived and evolved on the Island, and the characters involved over the years. The contributors are two local surfers and photographers, Jason Swain & Paul Blackley and the project is supported by the 'West Wight Landscape Partnership'.

Made Christmas cookies with the little man today. I actually don’t think I’ve ever made Christmas cookies before but this will definitely be a new tradition in the Fisher household! Newsflash: Isaiah likes frosting (shocker)! 🎄
Carrie Underwood is starting a new Christmas tradition with her son Isaiah — and it's a pretty sweet one!
The country superstar showed fans on Instagram that making Christmas cookies is her and Isaiah's new holiday activity. She shared an adorable photo of her 2-year-old son sitting in his high chair, decorating a beautiful Christmas tree cookie covered in red sprinkles, plenty of green and red M&Ms and a dollop of yellow frosting that serves as the star on top.
"Made Christmas cookies with the little man today. I actually don’t think I’ve ever made Christmas cookies before but this will definitely be a new tradition in the Fisher household!" the singer writes, adding that her son is definitely a fan of frosting.
Underwood keeps her young son out of the spotlight for the most part, but has shared a handful of loving moments on social media, like when they had a precious sing-along in the car and celebrated his second birthday with an amazing Cookie Monster cake. She's also captured some charming moments between her husband Mike Fisher and their son, such as when dad gave his son his first horseback riding lesson and when he skated over to his little one to give him a puck during a Nashville Predators game.
The "Something in the Water" singer recently co-hosted the CMA Awards for the tenth year in a row with Brad Paisley, delivering a powerful rendition of "Softly and Tenderly" during the broadcast that brought Bridgestone Arena to a standstill honoring the lives lost in 2017, including the victims of the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.

The first step to managing anger is to be aware of and acknowledge the feelings that indicate you are angry.
Some early symptoms of anger are disappointment and irritation. Methods to control anger include the STAR-R approach (stop, think, ask, reduce and reward), time outs, safety-plans and mindfulness practices.
There are a number of practical ways that individuals, couples, families and communities can empower themselves to make small yet significant differences in the amount of violence that’s happening in society.
Anger is an emotional or behavioral reaction of displeasure to an unmet expectation, demand or belief. Anger also occurs when we sense that our progress towards a goal has been hindered, or when we feel hurt by another person’s actions or words. We often view anger as an inherently negative emotion; however, anger can sometimes be a healthy and appropriate emotion to feel. Anger often becomes unhealthy when we make unsafe choices or actions based on anger. We can think of anger as having three components: thinking, feeling and acting.
Sometimes when we are angry it can seem like our mind is blank and all we can feel is anger (e.g., “seeing red”); other times, it is as if our mind is racing with negative thoughts and beliefs about ourselves or others. For example, when we are angry, we may think: “I’ll have to remind her three times and get mad before she’ll set the table!”, “You can’t trust him! He’s always out to get what he can for himself!”, or “I can’t believe I acted so stupid!”
If we think this way, judgments may increase our feelings of threat (e.g., “This is not how it out to be”) and actions of defensiveness (“I need to change the situation to make it right”).
The feeling part of anger includes from low to high levels: disappointment, annoyance, irritation, resentment, frustration, contempt and rage.
We may turn our thoughts and feelings into action. Often times these behaviors are directed towards the person or situation that we view as having wronged us. When people are angry, they may do a variety of things: shake their finger and say, “You turkey! Get your _____ car out of my way!”, or, “Say what? You called me a _____? We’ll see about that!”
Extreme actions that express anger include assault and violence. In the last few years, multiple violent acts (e.g., assaults, murders) in schools, on public transit, in fastfood restaurants, and through gang-related activities led to public outcry and a call for legislative action to control handgun sales, stiffen penalties on felons, and appropriate funds for prevention.
Ten different people might have 10 different reactions to the same situation. For some people getting stuck behind a slow driver on the way to work might be seen as humorous, for others it might be seen as a personal slight or hurt and for others it might be evidence that the world is out to get them. In other words, different situations might “trigger” us to feel angry. As we move towards learning how to control our anger, it is beneficial to take a look at how our own life experiences and relationships might be contributing to our current feelings of anger.
For example, children who have been abused are more likely to see neutral events around them as negative or threatening, compared to children who have not been abused. Experiments with adults have also found that when we are primed to feel angry, we are more likely to interpret neutral people or events as threatening or dangerous. With this in mind, it is often helpful to understand our typical anger “cycles”: what types of situations often make us angry, what thoughts/feelings/actions come next, and how do our reactions affect other people. Many people find it helpful to talk through these things with a trusted friend or counselor.
It is also important to recognize that we are often feeling multiple emotions at one time. For example, when a close friend does something hurtful, we often feel angry and sad and hopeful that we can remedy the interaction. These complex reactions to any given situation are often related to our own relationships (past and present), experiences and ability to regulate our negative emotions.
There are many popular ways to manage anger: count to 10, take three deep breaths, take a time out, leave the situation, ask yourself if anyone will remember this problem in five years, etc. Sometimes these tips work well, and other times they do not. If you find that these ideas for managing anger are not working for you, you might find it helpful to consult a therapist or counselor to discuss different strategies.
How many times were you angry, and your anger gave you the energy and the motivation to redirect your actions constructively? Some people make positive use of their energy or adrenaline in anger to communicate with the other person or take action to solve the problem. For example, instead of lying awake all night and stewing, one person preferred to get up in the middle of the night to map out a strategy to resolve a problem with a boss. This helped manage his anger. Another person might prefer to “compartmentalize” or leave the problem at work and get a good night’s sleep.
The first step is to stop, be aware of and acknowledge the feelings that indicate anger. The more aware we are of the early symptoms of disappointment and irritation, the more likely we can take effective steps to solve the problem, decrease our anger and prevent a potentially violent scene. The less aware we are of our anger, the more likely we are to have trouble controlling our anger, which can turn to rage and actions that hurt ourselves or others. There are many tools we can use to better understand our own anger reactions. For example, you can focus on what happens in your body you’re feeling angry:
The more we can be aware of our own anger “signals” the more we can work with our anger to be constructive. For example, many times we get angry at others who fail to meet our expectations. When this happens, express the anger and unmet expectation in a constructive way that is likely to lead to a resolution. A constructive way is to use an “I” statement, rather than a “you” statement: “You always forget to __________”, or “You never pick up your clothes.”
“You” statements blame. When we are blamed, we usually defend ourselves. “What do you mean, I never pick up my clothes? I picked them up the day before yesterday!”
Successful I-statements open up discussion and lead to solutions to the problem. “When you __________, I felt __________ and what I want is __________.”
For example: “When you didn’t pick up your clothes yesterday and put them in the hamper I was angry and felt unappreciated and taken advantage of. What I want is to find your clothes in the hamper when I am ready to do the laundry.”
Have you ever been so angry you couldn’t see straight or you felt like taking it out on anyone who happened to be available, like the dog, a spouse or child? These are good times to back off and control your anger. Once we control it, we can channel it into successful problem-solving by beginning with an I-statement. Some people find it relatively easy to move from their anger into these positive strategies; for other people, this is not as easy. If you find that it is hard to say these types of things when you are angry, you can consider a time-out policy or other safety-plan.
A time-out plan means that when you become aware of your anger signals (e.g., physical signals, specific thoughts or feelings), you call a “time-out.” If you are with another person, like your partner or family, the time-out involves taking a break for a pre-determined period of time and then agreeing to meet back together to discuss the situation. For more information, see the “Dealing with Couple’s Anger” fact sheet.
If you are alone and feeling angry, a time-out might mean removing yourself from the situation that is making you angry and participating in a calming task (See “Mindfulness and Anger” below).
If you have any concerns that you might become violent or hostile in a particular situation, it is important to have a well-developed safety-plan. Asafety-plan includes specific steps you can take to keep yourself and other people around you physically and emotionally safe. It can be very helpful to discuss your safety plan with trusted people in your life. Safety-plans often include steps such as:
Noticing escalation signals (e.g., “I know I am at risk for becoming violent when I start to ______.”
Removing yourself to a safe place when you are feeling angry (e.g., going on a walk outside, retreating to a quiet place inside the house). It is important that you do not do any activities during this time that might further escalate your anger (e.g., watching a violent movie or show, ruminating on the event, etc.).
Reaching out to others in a safe way (e.g., calling a trusted friend, a national hotline, a parent).
Another approach to use is called the STAR-R approach, from the book, Preparing for the Drug (Free) Years: A Family Activity Book. STAR-R stands for stop, think, ask, reduce, and reward.
Stop. Notice when you get angry and look for the signs. Is your voice rising, neck tightening, face getting hot, hand shaking, jaw tightening and breath shortening? Do you want to run away?
Think. Try to picture the consequences if you lose control. Most of us don’t want to hurt our children, spouse, co-workers or others, either physically or emotionally. If you try to picture the consequences both for you and for the person with whom you are angry, it can help you engage your brain before you engage your tongue or fist. Example: “If I lose control, I’ll feel worse, be embarrassed, humiliate myself and the other person in front of friends. There might even be a newspaper story with my name in the headlines tomorrow.”
Ask. Ask yourself what you’re really angry about. What do you want? All too often the family member we’re angry at is just in the wrong place at the wrong time. We may actually be angry about a decision our boss made, the slow driver who made us late, or ourselves for not handling a situation as well as we should have. (Notice the unmet expectations in each case?)
It usually is easier to take our anger out on a spouse or child than on other people. For example, it is probably easier to yell at our children for not doing their homework than to face the possibility that we made a mistake or that we do not have enough money to pay the bills. Still, sometimes we need to tell the person by using an effective I-statement. (“When you __________, I felt angry, and what I want now is __________.”)
Reduce anger. Often we’re so angry that we can’t resolve the problem until we cool down. Ask yourself, “What can I do to reduce my anger?” Take a walk or a 20-minute run, a cold shower or bath, listen to relaxing music, do stretching exercises, call a friend, or sit in the shade and unwind.
Reward. Reward yourself by saying, “I did a good job and I’m going to __________.” You’ve controlled your anger and maintained a bond with a family member, friend or other fellow human being. To continue this new behavior, reward yourself, go to lunch, see a movie, buy something special, or spend time with a friend. By controlling anger and thinking about effective solutions, we increase our chances of finding healthy solutions to our problems.
Although the STAR-R, time-out and safety-plan approaches are often effective for handling our anger in the moment, other techniques are helpful in improving our overall ability to deal with difficult emotions and events in our lives. Mindfulness practices have been shown to help us better regulate our negative emotions and responses. When we are better regulated, we are better able to soothe uncomfortable feelings, make safer choices, and live healthier lives.
Mindfulness can be thought of as a specific way of paying attention to our daily lives. Often times we are living our lives on “autopilot” – we are not always paying attention to our moment-to-moment experiences; instead, our minds often are stuck ruminating on the past or the future. Oftentimes people report that their rumination on negative thoughts/feelings contributes to angry or aggressive acts (e.g., “I just couldn’t stop thinking about how much he screwed up my life!”). Mindfulness provides us with a set of tools to help us shift our attention from ruminating on negative thoughts back to the present moment. Common practices include focusing on our breathing and/or shifting our attention to a neutral body part (e.g., the soles of our feet). For more information on how mindfulness can be helpful in managing anger, you can read about the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program at www.psychologytoday.com/blog/crisis-knocks/201003/mindfulness-based-stress-reduction-what-it-is-how-it-helps.
While research on the effect of hostility and health is relatively new, there is growing evidence that habitual hostility is associated with increased risk of suffering a heart attack and increased risk of dying from other causes. Some researchers find that people who remain angry and hostile much of the time also have less physical activity, less self-care (e.g., adequate sleep and dental hygiene), more smoking, more alcohol consumption, and more frequent drinking and driving episodes. Ironically, sometimes anger hurts the angry person most.
In a 25-year study of physicians and attorneys, researchers found a relationship between hostility and heart problems. High hostility physicians were four to five times as likely to develop coronaries than low hostility ones. Of those with high hostility scores at age 25, 14 percent of physicians and 20 percent of attorneys were dead by age 50. Of those with low hostility scores at age 25, only 2 percent of physicians and 4 percent of attorneys were dead by age 50.
Each of us can help reduce violence by changing our thoughts of fear, anger, hostility, and possibly rage, to optimism, gratitude and tolerance. We can change our feelings that we or our families are victims. We can practice for 30 days managing our anger and negotiating our differences for mutually beneficial outcomes. As we practice expecting better solutions, we look for more options and create alternatives to violence in our communities and our lives.

Amy M. Burns has taught PreK-grade 4 general music for over 20 years at Far Hills Country Day School. She has authored 3 books on how to integrate tech into the elementary music classroom. She has presented many sessions on the topic, including 3 keynote addresses in TX, IN, and AU. She is the recipient of the TI:ME Teacher of the Year, NJ Master Music Teacher, Governor’s Leader in Arts Education, and the NJ Nonpublic School Teacher of the Year Awards.
The fourth graders study the American Revolutionary War during the winter trimester of the school year. To correlate with their study, we study the music of the Revolutionary War. The students learn that many patriotic melodies were originally British melodies. They also study the purposes of the drum and fife players during battles.
Finally, they study the melody of Yankee Doodle. They learn how to read and perform the melody on their recorders. In addition, I place them in small groups and access their Noteflight accounts (noteflight.com). They open the "Copy of Yankee Doodle" file and read through the melody and drum lines. The file has some of the melody and some drum patterns. The students can copy and paste these patterns into the empty measures and perform their new arrangement.
Once finished, we export this new arrangement directly into Soundtrap (soundtrap.com). They are assigned a musical style and come up with an updated version of Yankee Doodle. This is in the style of Tour the States, a youtube sensation where the students sing and rap the states and their capitals. Below is an example of one of the fourth grade group's creations. They hope you enjoy it!
After studying the music of the Revolutionary War (1775-1783), which included many British melodies being written into American patriotic music and a couple of dances from the era, the students traveled further back in history to the time of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). The students studied his childhood through books such as Bach by Ann Rachlin and Bach by Michael Venezia, and experienced his music and adulthood through the movie, Bach's Fight for Freedom. The movie showed the part of his life where he was imprisoned when he chose to play his own music instead of only playing the hymns that the Duke wanted him to play. The students showed their knowledge of the subject by answering questions and creating a circle content map about his life. All of this culminated into the fourth graders creating movie trailers about Bach's life using iMovie. In these trailers, some groups chose to focus on one portion of his life, while others chose to focus on his entire life. The trailers also show the fourth graders' amazing creativity. There are trailers which had two purposes: to show you Bach's life as well as to want you to come and see the actual movie that the trailer was used to promote. We ended with a viewing of each trailer. I would tell them three things: "I like..." I wish..." and "I wonder...". The "I wonder" was usually, "I wonder what you would have created if you had a little more time." I hope that you enjoy these extremely creative trailers. They will be displayed on Seesaw by the end of the week. I am very proud of the students! iMovie.

Once you’ve landed on the Marketplace and you have your spreadsheet setup, your next step is to take a look at the categories in the left-hand sidebar. For a site like Quick Sprout, it’s pretty straightforward: Business, investing, computers, internet, e-business, and e-marketing. Those are categories that would fit well with the audience at Quick Sprout. Depending on what your site is, you may have a category too that really jumps out at you. You don’t just want to stop at the categories that fit best, you want to look at other categories that might be in line with something else your target audience wants. Sometimes, you can find your best products using that. You definitely want to start with the categories that seem to make the most sense.
Over the past two years, I have been nothing but overwhelmed with internet and affiliate marketing. I think I am like many beginning internet marketers. Try every tool and every internet marketing guru's advice because they promise the world and make it seem so easy. Cost? Huge. Results? Few. When I came across Pat Flynn I felt there was something different. He just seemed real to me. So, I decided to try Pat's 1·2·3 Affiliate Marketing course.

I have regained my faith and really enjoy the white hat aspect of affiliate marketing. I feel like Pat really cares about us, which is unique in this business.
Always disclose your affiliate relationship. Most visitors will probably understand that graphic ads will lead to your getting paid, but if you write a review or use an in-text link as a recommendation, you want your readers to know that may lead to compensation as well. This ensures you retain transparency and trust with your readers, but also, it's required by the FTC's endorsement rules.

This is a very common way to promote offers. For example, you will often see a blog post with links to certain products or services. If the reader clicks through and makes a purchase, the blog owner will make a commission. These in-text links blend in with other content on your site and are a great way of promoting an offer within your content, without being over-the-top salesy with banners.
Every course Pat creates is an amazing experience. The content is only one portion of that experience. His continued support, encouragement, and countless hours of his time spent answering questions and guiding you during the weekly office hour sessions are absolutely incredible. If you are serious about about applying this information to your business, you'll appreciate the support, tips, and strategies provided for you.
To those on the outside, affiliate marketing can seem like a black box. It’s inner workings are mysterious to most marketers and in many companies it’s not treated with the same seriousness as other channels. Some marketers, only familiar with the bad reputation acquired by some industry players in the 2000s, deride it as a source of spam and little more.
The next platform, which has created a great community of affiliate marketers and is a fantastic resource for a versatile and step-by-step affiliate marketing training program is Wealthy Affiliates. Over the years it has become one of the most reputable and highest-rated resources to teach you the ropes of digital marketing and online business for someone who has no or very little experience in the online and blog world.

It’s Romney-Ryan! The Human Events Conservative of the Year 2011 is tapped as Mitt Romney’s running mate after months of speculation.
Opinion: Whomever Mitt Romney taps as VP, Democrats will accuse of wanting to destroy Social Security and Medicare. So why not pick someone who actually favors reform?
The 2011 Human Events Conservative of the Year has the intellect, will and determination to put America’s fiscal house in order. Will those qualities translate to joining Mitt Romney at the top of the Republican ticket?
In many ways, Rob Portman is like Robert Taft in his early years as a senator: someone colleagues and Republicans outside Congress look to for guidance and leadership on key issues.

Welcome to Alw2aad Q&A, where you can ask questions and receive answers from other members of the community.
Many things affect a personal injury lawsuit's outcome. If you happen to make one single mistake in the filing process, your case can be rendered null and void. Use the advice below to make sure you do everything by the book and succeed.
If you don't want to splash out on lawyer's fees Valdosta GA Car Wreck Attorney, and you can easily prove the other person was at fault, see if you can work out an out-of-court settlement with them. Their insurance company will be happy to do this as they're in no hurry to go to court, so you'll end up on top.
Get a detailed police report regarding an injury you receive Valdosta Personal Injury Lawyer, for future reference in court. Not only will the information gathered by the authorities be very credible, it can help prove that you were wrongfully injured and win your case. Failure to collect credible evidence means your claim may be viewed as hearsay, and that won't win you anything!
Don't pay any money up front to a personal injury lawyer. A reputable personal injury lawyer will not require any money up front; in most cases they will offer a free consultation prior to taking your case. During this consultation be sure to ask them about exactly what you will be charged (whether it's a flat fee or an hourly rate), and if they offer some sort of payment plan.
The personality of your lawyer is just as important as their experience in personal injury law. You need to choose a lawyer who lets you play a role in your case. You should be in touch with them frequently so you can update them on any information you have and vice versa.
Always go to the hospital if your injury may be the fault of someone else. If you do not fully document your injury as soon as you can you put yourself at risk for not getting the money that you may deserve in a settlement. So, if you want to protect yourself, be sure to visit a doctor right away.
The only people you should discuss a personal injury case with are your insurance agent, your spouse and your attorney. If an insurance adjuster calls you to record a statement about how the accident occurred, give them the number of your attorney and tell them that this is who should be called if they have any additional questions.
Work with a company that focusses solely on the subject of personal injury law. A law firm that handles a number of different legal fields, such as family, tax and criminal law, may not have the experience to secure you a good monetary settlement. An experienced personal injury law firm will handle all aspects of your case such as the initial investigation, offering advice, drafting documents and court representation.
It can be exhausting to endure a personal injury suit; however, a good lawyer can make the process easier. Take what you have learned here and consult with the experts. At the end of the day you will be monetarily compensated, and perhaps you have prevented this type of accident happening to another.

This Monday has seen the addition of GamePal to Eye On MOGS, bringing their great product catalog to your front door and pushing our listings so close to 100,000 I can almost taste it!
The GamePal listings are a little buggy at the moment and should be fixed over the next few days - needless to say it's something I want to clean up! BTW I do appreciate it when you guys let me know there are issues with any of the listings, sometimes it is hard to keep on top of them all!
Today also see's an integration of the Eye On MOGS Blog onto the main Eye On MOGS site in the guise of the News and Information page. Granted that results in some duplication but not everyone who uses Eye On MOGS uses the blog and vice-versa, so I wanted to make sure everyone had access to the content.
Ask for VIP (sometimes called “tiered”) commissions. Many affiliate programs have different commission levels. Usually the standard commission level is made public, but higher commissions are offered to higher performing affiliates. Sometimes you may be bumped up to “VIP affiliate” status by the advertiser, but most times you have to ask if there’s a higher tier and how you can get there.
Industry-related statistics show that affiliate marketing has an important place in business strategies. As a method of online advertising, affiliate marketing has the power to influence people and drive sales, which directly reflects company revenue. Within this course, you will learn what affiliate marketing is and about the roles you can take to become a part of affiliate marketing.
ClickBank aims to serve as a connection between digital content creators (also known as vendors) and affiliate marketers, who then promote them to consumers.

Through its affiliate network, ClickBank also assists in building visibility and revenue-generating opportunities for time-strapped entrepreneurs.
You can create a free account and get an overview of the dashboard and access some initial knowledge without any payment. However, live events, research features, and the level 2 - level 5 series of courses, walking you through the process of creating and growing a business within the niche that you want, are limited to premium members. Membership costs $19 a month, or is priced at an individual rate. But it’s absolutely worth it when you take it seriously and want to invest in yourself.
The technology we have available today allows us to massively automate many tasks that had to be manually done only a few years ago. This has reduced the level of technical ability required for people do things like build their own websites, set up landing pages and build lists of subscribers. You can literally build a website within minutes today, even if you have zero technical computer skills.
In November 1994, CDNow launched its BuyWeb program. CDNow had the idea that music-oriented websites could review or list albums on their pages that their visitors might be interested in purchasing. These websites could also offer a link that would take visitors directly to CDNow to purchase the albums. The idea for remote purchasing originally arose from conversations with music label Geffen Records in the fall of 1994. The management at Geffen wanted to sell its artists' CD's directly from its website but did not want to implement this capability itself. Geffen asked CDNow if it could design a program where CDNow would handle the order fulfillment. Geffen realized that CDNow could link directly from the artist on its website to Geffen's website, bypassing the CDNow home page and going directly to an artist's music page.[10]
Pretty Nice Article Gael. This is much better than playing the waiting game of 4-6 months for the site to rank in Google. Much faster to test the funnel right away with paid traffic and get leads in your funnel for future marketing as well. These funnels might take time to build initially but once set they are truly source of passive income unless offer is taken off.
For a slightly different take on the subject and figuring out how to get targeted traffic onto your promoted links, you must have a look at Affiliate Marketing: Instant Traffic to Affiliate Links. A quick look at the reviews will help you decide if this is the exact course you are looking for. Sometimes the right approach is what is required to make a campaign work, this one might just work for you.
This is the standard affiliate marketing structure. In this program, the merchant pays the affiliate a percentage of the sale price of the product after the consumer purchases the product as a result of the affiliate’s marketing strategies. In other words, the affiliate must actually get the investor to invest in the product before they are compensated.

I recently came accross your blog and have been reading along. I thought I would leave my first comment. I dont know what to say except that I have enjoyed reading. Nice blog. I will keep visiting this blog very often.
At this time, On My Way To Meet You Episode 344 only have raw released. Please Bookmark us to notice when English Subtitle released.
Your major health concerns when traveling to and hunting in Zambia are the things that you cannot see or feel. Sure the Black Mamba is your worst nightmare yet most of the time they fear you instead and clear off. With a charging Buffalo you can at least shoot or climb a tree BUT with things like Malaria, hepatitis and TB, you cannot be too careful.
Of course you need to be on Malaria preventatives and these days there are better drugs on the market than the most talked about one, Lariam. Seriously, most US clinics and doctors recommend Lariam because it is believed to be the only drug that is effective against all strains of Malaria and it is cheaper. While this may be true it is also the one that causes the most adverse reactions in people, especially when out of their comfort zone. People have had to cancel their safaris to Africa sometimes because of the side effects. If you can avoid using Lariam do so it is worth it.
Bilharzia - is prevalent throughout Africa and the general rule is do not expose yourself to untreated water anywhere in the country. Bilharzia is however easily treated and does not pose an immediate threat to personal health. This does not mean you should shy away from all water sources, your PH may think you are really soft when you refuse to wade across the crocodile infested river!
Zambia, as with many other countries south of the equator, requires that you have a Yellow Fever vaccination to enter the country. In fact to travel through Johannesburg, Yellow Fever is a must as they will decline entry if you do not have this certificate. Other immunizations to get are Hepatitis-A, Tetanus and Typhoid, just the plain common sense ones.
It is quite easy to pick up ticks when walking in long grass especially early on in the hunting season. The regular sized cattle ticks are OK, at least you can see them, it is the small 'pepper' sized ticks that could transfer tick bite fever. Make sure you check yourself ALL OVER (!) when you bath each night as they are tiny and very difficult to see. DEET on your clothes and legs usually does the trick.
Nobody likes snakes, they have been symbols of evil and danger throughout history and in Africa it is no different. Most snakes, if found are killed without even considering if they are dangerous or not. Zambia has its fair share of BAD snakes and many people are bitten each year mainly through their own ignorance. Of the 131 snake species which occur in southern Africa, 14 can cause death if they bite you and a further 18 carry venom which can lead to serious complications. HOWEVER it is very rare to ever be confronted by a dangerous snake let alone see one while you are hunting.
Pack these items for your trip: your own regular medication, malaria prophylactics, tick repellent (DEET), mosquito repellent creams and sprays, sun block and sunburn cream, diahhorea tablets, plaster for blisters and sore feet, general pain killers, antacid, anti-histamines, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic tablets (e.g. Phenergan). Eye-drops are useful in the dry season. If you do carry prescribed medicines, it is advisable to bring a copy of your doctor's prescription for the drug.
Medical facilities in Zambia are very limited, especially out where you will be hunting. Government facilities in rural areas are inadequate at the best of times and safari operators generally cannot handle major medical emergencies. As with any travels to Africa, it is important to check your own medical insurance policies and purchase medical evacuation coverage. Also remember that your insurance coverage will most likely not apply and that you'll need to pay cash for most medical treatment and then claim from your insurer on your return home.
However, the drawback is associated with long-term costs that your affiliate products and affiliate links for promotion. Email marketing is the most cost-effective method of products coming in or specials on cuts, highlights, manicures, or whatever seasonal promotion you decide to offer. Email marketing can make your start-up hair salon a success at a you should also make sure that you do nevertheless stay in contact regularly so your subscribers get into the habit of expecting emails from you. He is actively involved in promoting SEO in India so that they can get hold of the information regarding product or services that they are looking forward. Conclusion The use of http://ruseller.net/intrigued-in-online-video-advertising-and-marketing-then-study-this a website to promote your affiliate of email marketing you can increase your targeted customer base in a cost effective manner.
For instance, Robert Allen who is the major "proponent" of the Nothing Down method used these days in Real estate and Co-author on a link and go straight to the website the sender wants you to go. Automatically sending out email, newsletters, and other information allows you have the current and the upcoming list of campaigns. It is important to get the right mindset so that you do not fall into that class of internet itself as the backbone of your email marketing initiative. To cut the long story short, he not only exceeded that target, he made make sure to build a high quality mailing list first. However, while doing all these things make sure to keep the email mailing list out with nothing more than $100 in his pocket on that Fortune-filled day.

No links to rapidshits, megafuckloads, etc. This board is supposed to provide you with content, not to refer you to it.

When you apply for a job at the university where I work, you are quickly acknowledged with a note that contains the following:
As we are an Equal Opportunity Employer, we request that you fill out the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Form which can be accessed at the link below. The form will be returned electronically to the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. This form will be kept separate from the hiring process and will not play a role in the employment decision.
Note the last sentence of the quote above. It’s reiterated in the form itself: “This form will not be kept with your application nor considered in the employment decision.” It doesn’t even matter if you fill it out or not.
So what’s the point? They’re asking for information that you don’t have to give them, that they won’t connect to you or the decision to hire you in any way, and which has no bearing on anything other than keeping statistics that have no meaning (since they are not based on complete information).
I have always made it a point to ignore requests to provide this information, as a matter of principle. It’s a case of completely useless and wasteful resources going towards something that sounds good in theory, but is impossible to achieve in practice.
In my experience EEO has always been a joke. The EEO “officer” at my last place of employment was a complete moron. Even his name told you that. I shit you not, his last name was Comedy. Because he had a JD, he insisted on being called “Doctor.” If you failed to refer to him as such, he would correct you immediately.

The all-new E-Class cabriolet is the latest edition to the successful Mercedes-Benz E-Class line-up of mid-size vehicles. The E350 continues the Mercedes-Benz tradition of manufacturing stylish, well built automobiles with world-class engineering, innovation, luxury, high-technology and safety features like few others.
The unique, elegant and sporty exterior design of the E350 cabriolet starts up front with a ‘cubist’ treatment of the trademark Mercedes-Benz twin-headlight face. Two parallelogram lights are cut into the front flared front fenders, bracketing the three-dimensional frame of the front grille. With a large star emblem in the center of its sporty two-lamella grille, while the overall body shape of the two-door E350 line features a sophisticated interplay between lines and surfaces. The silhouette is a subtle wedge shape with highly raked windshield ‘A’ pillars, a thin, rising, full perimeter chrome strip at the bottom that wraps around the front airdam, front fenders, doors, and through the muscular contours of the rear bumper. There is also a rising crease starting at the front fenders, along the doors through the pull-out door handles, with chrome accent, and ends at the rear fender. Another elegant, thin chrome strip appears at the beltline and grows thicker around the rear deck.
These clearly defined lines help define the large concave and convex surfaces of the car. At the rear, sharply angled LED taillights wrap from the side to the rear, a thick chrome strip shows at the center of the trunk lid cover, while down below are two nicely spread chrome exhaust tips with a diffuser down below to help better manage the airflow at speed. The optional Appearance Package for sport-minded drivers of the new E350 cabriolet includes 18X8.5in. AMG twin-5-spoke alloy wheels, punched brake discs with painted calipers and a lip spoiler at the end of the trunk. It is a style that is totally unique to Mercedes-Benz.
The two-door, four-seat Mercedes-Benz E-Class features a classic fabric soft top that can be opened or closed in just 20-seconds, even at speeds up to 25mph. Its four-layer convertible top is insulated for low noise and year-round comfort, even in very cold or hot weather. With the top down, a new AIRCAP system works at the push of a dash-mounted button to reduce drafts and air turbulence for all four occupants, and an AIRSCARF system can blow heated air directly on the neck area from outlets in the seat back-just below the head restraints. The soft top is stowed in a special compartment behind the rear seats. When the roof is up, the panel between the top stowage area and the trunk can slide to the rear, increasing the trunk capacity by 30%.
Inside is a cabin you will find comfort, luxury and sportiness that is befitting of any Mercedes-Benz convertible. Mercedes-Benz designers paid careful attention to the E-Class interior to ensure that every surface is appealing in form, color and material. The standard leather interior features burl walnut, chrome and aluminum trim plus 14-way adjustable power front seats with integrated headrests and steel seat frames with integrated suspension. Optional multi-contour seats offer impressively variable seat adjustments through a series of air bladders and mechanical bolsters that are integrated into the bottom cushion and seat back. Additional controls for the multi-contour seats are tucked between the seat cushions and center console for the perfect fit whether you are just cruising or enjoying a more spirited drive utilizing the sport-tuned suspension.
The cockpit features five analog gauges, including two pairs that overlap each other, as well as a leather-wrapped, power tilt/telescoping three-spoke multifunction steering wheel and console-mounted shift lever. Also standard is a COMAND system featuring a large 7in. color display screen with a standard in-dash, six-disc CD/DVD changer and a Bluetooth interface that allows a phone still in a pocket or purse to be operated through the car’s audio system. Using the large console-mounted controller the central display in the dash can be operated by either the driver or front passenger. The COMAND system can be equipped with an optional iPod/MP3 interface, SIRIUS satellite radio, HD radio, and an advanced voice control system for audio, navigation and phone systems. The new system can also display maps and directions for the optional hard-drive navigation system, which can display SIRIUS real-time traffic information and Zagat restaurant ratings.
All buttons, switches and levers are within easy reach and fully illuminated for safe nighttime driving. The rear seating area features a pull-down armrest, dual-cupholders under a burl walnut dual slider, air-ducts at the rear of the center console and 60/40 fold-down seatback for added storage in the trunk.
Also coming standard inside but not mentioned above are power windows with express up/down up front, power door locks, in-dash memory car reader/auxiliary input for MP3 player, dual cupholders, cigar ash tray, deep storage bin with twin-opening top covers, storage slots in each door, deep lighted glove box, storage net at the passenger-side footwell, dual lighted vanity mirrors, four-airducts to quickly cool or warm the front driver/passenger from the dual-zone climate system, auto-dimming reaview mirror, auto-dimming/heated side mirrors, rain-sensing wipers/washers/headlamp washers, dual map lamps, thick cut-pile carpeting, front and rear floor mats and a Universal Garage Door opener.
As part of the optional Appearance package inside you’ll get stainless steel pedals with rubber studs and black gear-shift paddles on the steering wheel as part of the AGILITY CONTROL Sport Suspension.
My E350 Cabriolet test model came with these options inside, but not mentioned above: Harman/Kardon Surround-Sound Premium Sound System, Hard-Drive Navigation, Rearview camera, heated/cool front seats, Bi-Xenon Adaptive front lights, and KEYLESS GO push-button start/stop.
The new E350 cabriolet is powered by a 3.5 liter, DOHC, all-aluminum V6 engine that generates 268hp at 6,000rpm and 258lb.ft. of torque at just 2,400 to 5,000rpm. That’s plenty of get-up-an-go with 0-60mph coming from a standstill in just 6.7sec.
The V6 engine is mated to a seven-speed automatic with Touch Shift manual shift control. You can just sit back and let the automatic take over with almost instantaneous kick-downs or shift manually by using either the paddle shifters on the steering wheel or by pushing the shifter to the right to upshift or to the left to downshift. Gear changes come almost instantly and it really gets the adrenaline flowing when you are able to attack curving roads at high speeds.
The excellent fully independent suspension gives you both a compliant ride when you are cruising, or high-performance capability when you want more excitement. The front suspension features a strut setup with two-piece control arms, anti-dive geometry, coil springs, gas-charged shocks and stabilizer bar. The rear independent suspension features a five-arm multilink setup with anti-squat geometry, coil springs, gas-charged shocks and a stabilizer bar. The standard electronic stability control system can keep you on your chosen path or you can shut it down to let the rear wheels slide out when exiting a corner at high speeds. Standard on E350 models is the AGILITY CONTROL suspension that provides the best of both worlds for a conventional coil-spring suspension. When you push the console-mounted round button that shows C/S. A small piston is connected to a bypass port in the hydraulic flow of each shock absorber. Its design provides a softer, quieter ride on normal roads but retains full shock damping over dips, twisty roads when you need it most. Just push the button to C (comfort) that shows next to your gear selection in the speedometer, or S (sport). That’s a good choice to have in a luxury sporty coupe. Precisely guiding you on your drive is the wonderful speed-sensitive power-assisted rack & pinion steering system. Just a little tug on the steering wheel and the car quickly and precisely goes in that direction, just like a racecar. That’s not bad for a luxury coupe, but Mercedes-Benz blurs the line between luxury and sportiness like no other car manufacturer today.
Quickly slowing the E350 cabriolet down from speed are large, power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes. Up front are 12.7in. vented discs clamped with dual-piston calipers, while in the rear are 11.8in. solid discs clamped with single-pistons calipers. Braking force and control is augmented by standard ABS and emergency-brake sensing Brake Assist. These powerful brakes give you the confidence to go deeper into curves knowing that you can instantly slow the car to successfully exit the corner.
The E350 with the optional Appearance package comes with larger 18X7.5in. front and 18X8.5in. rear alloy wheels that are wrapped with 235/40R18in. front and 255/35R18in. high-performance tires in the rear for excellent traction and a compliant ride over all types of road surfaces. While the cabriolet is heavier than the coupe, my driving impressions of the E350 cabriolet was impressive especially when I switched to Sport mode. The coil springs tightened up and the reaction to my inputs was quicker and more balanced, almost neutral even though the convertible top and motor are placed right behind the rear passenger compartment.
Outside, inside and under the skin the E350 cabriolet is one of the best luxury sporty open top coupes on the road today.
Keeping you and your passengers safe is a long list of safety systems that rivals most any other mid-size luxury sporty four-seat coupe. Coming standard are 3-point safety belts for all four seats with the front seats having pretensioners and load limiters. There is standard roll-over protection, NECK-PRO Active head restraints up front, advanced braking with HOLD function, 9 airbags including driver knee airbag and front pelvic airbags, and a tire pressure monitoring system. Options include Attention Assist system that uses a steering sensor that is coupled to smart software that uses over 70 parameters to establish a unique driver profile during the first 20-minutes of driving. Between 50 and 112mph, the system identifies the erratic steering corrections drivers make as they begin to get drowsy and triggers an audible warning, and a ‘Time for a Rest? Message with a coffee cup icon appearing in the instrument cluster. Adaptive Highbeam Assist uses a small video camera to sense both headlights and taillights, then softly and automatically transitions between high and low beam operation to avoid dazzling other drivers. PRE-SAFE Brake can apply 100% braking force in emergencies when equipped with the Distronic Plus, another revolutionary Mercedes-Benz safety feature-PRE-SAFE brake-can now apply full braking automatically in emergencies, to reduce accident severity. When PRE-SAFE Brake senses an impending rear collision, the system sounds three warning tones. About 1.6sec. before impact is likely, partial braking is automatically initiated, and the PRE-SAFE occupant protection systems are activated. If the driver still fails to react, full-power braking is initiated about 0.6sec. before the collision, reducing the impact and effectively acting as an ‘electronic crumple zone’.
After just one week behind the wheel of the all-new 2011 Mercedes-Benz E350 cabriolet I wanted to keep it. I was very impressed with the sleek and angular looks, interior comfort, luxury and safety features, plus a dual personality suspension that took care of my daily driving and the time I found I wanted to see what the car could do when cornering at high speeds. The E350 cabriolet is almost the perfect all-season, two-door luxury and sporty coupe that can give you the fun of the sun in your face and the wind in your hair. Prices start at just $56,850.00 and my nicely loaded model was priced at $68,450.00.

The neo-oligarchy (are they the same as the aristocracy of old?) have been extraordinarily successful in dividing and conquering those at the bottom end of the worldwide financial pyramid scheme. Most of us now attack each other, over more often than not, mere trivialities which are framed within non-trivial modes of trying to survive within the oligarchic casino. This fact renders any long term meaningful resistance to the mafia casino owners impotent at worst and marginal at best. Of course, it doesn’t help that the oligarchic casino owners use Putin’s method of propaganda using their media empires to promote every manner of conflicting narrative so as to render incoherent or muddy any assessment of their ways of doing business. It’s a type of media obscurantism, or non-stop bullshit baffling brains! Moreover, we now have non-stop paid shills for whatever product or narrative the corporatocracy wants to propagandize us with; this renders scientific knowledge next to useless because most voices are now paid to promote hidden agendas. Stephen Hawking’s latest outburst on humanity having a limited time to get off the planet is one example of this; how absolutely stupid of this man to promote this narrative when all his energies should be spent trying to convince humanity to take care of the only planet we know of that sustains life! What idiocy! It’s hard to believe there isn’t some kind of hidden agenda here when the message is coming from one of his stature; he might consider Wittgenstein’s adage to shut the fuck up if this is the best he can do when speaking about things he knows little or nothing about or at least dismisses as irrelevant. Geez, he must be aware that there is going to be exponential fighting for the scraps in the near future if he’s correct in his bleak assessment about why humanity has to leave this planet…..Haha, bet he’s never considered that there may be those out there that will never let us leave this planet until we learn to respect this one!
Well, well, well, the left got into power in Alberta and federally in Ottawa and all the chit chat about the environment amounts to about squat being done to change anything. Apparently, there is high unemployment there due to the oil patch crisis and it’s not occurred to anyone in power to restructure the economy away from dependence on what oil is left there after 150 years.
Haha, and in the spirit of Gomer Pyle, “is anyone really surprised?” Look, as this website continually points out: nothing is going to change until the legacy of The Rothschild/Rockefeller neo-oligarchy is addressed and abandoned as a model of governance.
-Okay, then, bring back the best idea they ever had there: a public utility Social Credit non-debt currency.
-use the Social Credit to institute retrofitting of every home and building in the province. That would end unemployment over night!
-the safety net would create the conditions for a new entrepreneurial green revolution! Leave the oil in the ground where it belongs and get out of the 18th century! But if Albertan’s insist on 1850 tech then maybe they should consider a revival of retro 1850 green sustainable lifestyles. Tiny Houses and organic farms for everyone! You know, get a head start on the coming Great Crash of 2030 which is being brought on by the casino-owning oligarchs and their amoral financial systems.
This website has explored why that is in the modern age–the legacy of the first oligarchs in modernity: The Rothschild, Rockefeller era–central bank fiat currency and oil.
Along with the oligarchs came the 24/7 propaganda of spend, spend, spend, consume, consume, consume. Very few people have been able to withstand this incredible programming by these archons (rulers). They’ve normalized every manner of financial crime and now run the earth like a casino and Trump certainly is the symbol for that ethos.
Oh, yes, blah, blah, blah, wealth has trickled down, but none of it’s sustainable and no one really knows how to escape the vast span of the oligarchic class and their bought and paid for political structures.
Perhaps one day more than a few people will wake up and vote The Green Party on mass and at that point the earth and civilization may have a chance……
Occasionally I run across an artist that is very much worth listening to. Although a Christian Gnostic myself; I very much appreciate his positive modern Buddhist vibe…….I was always a huge Peter Gabriel fan, too; and this is inspirational in the same mode!
They’ve made this topic extraordinarily complex but I’ll try to break it down to a simple community analogy. Let’s say there are one thousand houses in this community. One house controls the means of exchange of goods and services within the community. This house asks every other house to buy a bond against the creation of the means of exchange. The creation of this means of exchange has no inherent value and no meritorious ethic as far as quaffing it into existence; you should also note that this one house has asked all the other houses to socialize the creation of this means of exchange, it’s done so even though it hasn’t created anything of value–just a means of exchange–which is created via debt through the bond treasury of the other houses; yet this private house reaps all the rewards of that ‘socialization’ of the creation of the means of exchange. In reality, they never really got permission from the other houses to do this but rather did it by stealth and by force, or by fiat–they used coercion to set this system up.
Now, the creation of the money is issued to all the children living in the house that prints the means of exchange. Having ‘first dibs’ at trillions of dollars gives these children extraordinary advantages compared to those living in the other houses. These children can buy up assets sooner and cheaper than anyone else. BTW: this is also what happens with quantitative easing…Over time the money supply trickles down through the community but by that time two things happen: the excess money supply causes goods and services to be more expensive than at the initial creation at the top of the pyramid, and the debt associated with the expansion of the supply grows exponentially! And this ladies and gentlemen is the storybook version of The Central Banking Pyramid scheme…
Oh yes, it created wealth; no question about that, but it’s easy to see all the associated cultural problems that come along with it; not the least of which is this town has nowhere to grow bigger–it’s an isolated place with a money supply which demands more and more money be printed which causes more and more growth and more and more debt….
Now, what do you think would happen if all the other houses demanded that they socialized the money supply and distributed it evenly among all the houses at creation without borrowing against the creation of the means of exchange itself? It’s quite likely the main house owners would react violently towards any and all who attempted to do that and would try to create a war against all the other houses……
KA$H is god; The Holy Spirit the hidden Hand of The Free Market; The loving Kristo’s is mimicked by The Anti-Christ in every manner of false inverted Christianity; The Pharisees’ the economists; the scribes are the media; The Sadducee’s are The Marxist’s; The Caesars and The Money Changers have the same roles in this millennia age drama of ‘The Genes of Isis” (Genesis); The Apostles are The Heads of the Central Banks; The Evangelists are people like Alex Jones and Stefan Molyneux; The Priests are the corporate C.E.O.’s; The High Priests are the real-estate developers; the brands and stores are the temples and the consumers the faithful!
Oh yes, this post called Show Trials talks about a dream I had the night I posted the blog. I couldn’t figure out at the time what the South Atlantic Resort represented. I do now: the 33rd parallel north; which of course runs right through Israel and Mt Hebron…This Nephilim Didn’t Fool Me post is also tied into these shenanigans.

We are in the End Times in which Yahweh will execute judgment on the false believers and the nations during the Great Tribulation in which most of the human beings who are alive today will die. This is just the beginning, since after their deaths, each and every one of the human beings that existed during the 6000 years of human history, will stand before the Great White Throne (Rev.20:11-15) to be judged during the “Last Judgement” (“Juicio Final”), which is what gives title to the song I brought for you today. My goal by making music, writing articles and other stuff, is to awake as many people as possible before everything mentioned already gets to happen, although I understand that most people, those who do not want to seek the Almighty but instead want to pursue the kind of life this world has to offer, will feel that what I do is to cause fear, not understanding my intentions at all, which is to let listeners know exactly what Scripture says, so that they can make the most important decision about where they will spend their eternal life, plus how they will get there, either being transformed as the Chosen Few without having to go through death, or after death as the Many, during the coming Tribulation.
Then I saw a Great White Throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before Yahweh, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Sheol delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. Then Death and Sheol were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.
It will be one Judgement for every man who ever lived. There are many churches that teach that works do not matter, because they considered themselves simply saved by “Grace”, taking several verses of Scripture out of context. However, if it were so, then why does the paragraph shown above, clearly states that all will be judged according to their works? Indeed it is true that Yahushua saved us through his death as a Favor, for Free, however, once we believe in Him and confess His Name (Yahushua), we must start acting like the Almighty commands, therefore doing works (Hch.26: 20), for it is written that Faith without works is dead (Jam.2: 14-26). Many people look to be saved only by having faith, then end up having Faith in Faith itself, which does not save, it is Yahweh through His Son Yahushua who saves us, so we must have faith in Him. It is for this reason, that the Hebrew word Emunah, which translates as Faith, basically means “to believe the truth”, therefore Emunah (faith) is actually believing in Yahushua, because He is the truth (Jn.14:16).
Truly, these times of ignorance Yahweh overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man (Messiah) whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.”

George and Junior are two characters from their only four shorts (one of them banned for racistsum) and only two modern cartoons in the WHAT A CARTOON!! show. They first appeared in Spongebob and Friends meet Oliver and Company, as dog cacthers, but easily outwitted by Dudger's street smarts, and that Dudger also took adanaged of their tex avery cartoon-like comedic stupidity.
George is a smart, small one, Junior is tthe big, dumb-headed one, who gets disiplented by George for any stupid thing Junior does by simply kicking him in the butt.
They are simply Neutrol characters, cause while not with the louge, it's clear they aren't with the leage or other villain teams because they later appeared after Scroop and Deadpool left, or that they didn't showed up with them, or did they had other villains with them.

He addressed the media at his residence in Sukkur of Sindh province and gave his viewpoints on various highlights of the week.
He answered a question, said that War would never be in benefit of either of the two, India or Pakistan, it could turn into a third world war as well.
Shah called for different influential actors in the world to take notice of Kashmir dispute and pressure India to stop depriving the people of Kashmir of their right to determination.
Shah also talked about MQM-P and Altaf Hussain in his press conference, said that Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) – Pakistan claims of patriotism should be believed.
Olohuoneen nurkassa on jo viikonpäivät seisonut kaksi vanhaa ikkunaa. Kannoin ne verstaan vintiltä sisään, koska olen suunnitellut niiden hyödyntämistä. Verstaan vintillä on viitisentoista ylimääräistä ikkunaa, jotka eivät kuulu mihinkään.
Behold the luxurious and mysterious romantic allure of the orchid. With its asexual regality, the orchid does not flirt, yet plays hard to get, making you lead with effort, giving special instructions for its maintenance that, if ignored, will surely abandon you. The orchid’s decorative, edible, and medicinal qualities, make it a flower that feeds all five senses. To nurture it requires commitment, and like the mate that elicits your best qualities, it teaches patience and perseverance.
Each Spring, the New York Botanical Garden celebrates this elegant flower with its annual Orchid Show. Thirty thousand species of orchids displayed and inspired by an ever-changing theme, is at perfect as it sounds. In a nod to this year’s Orchid show, and to celebrate the first week of Spring, I reminisce on last year’s ‘Chandelier’ event; daydreaming of being surrounded by thousands of species of floral bliss, in an explosion of orchids with varying personalities, each beautiful in their own complex way.
Walking through the exhibit ignites childhood memories of trips to the Fort Worth Botanical Gardens, picnicking with my mom, and inciting sensory cognition of floral notes that smell and feel new, and hopeful, like the first days of Spring.
An in-flight movie purchase starring my ‘dream’ client Jennifer Lawrence; the soothing and supportive words of strength offered by a close friend, and the quest of a tennis icon and her historical season, are the musings behind my Fall fashion motif. A perfect storm of inspiration ignited by one name…Serena
Jennifer Lawrence’s character in the film Serena was bold and brash, but captivating; unapologetic and malicious, while still maintaining an air of vulnerability. Serena Hedison, a close friend and confidant, is what I like to call BeautyCool. She is quick-witted and astute, self-aware, open, and present. She also happens to be, gorgeous with effortless glamourous hair! And then, there is Serena Williams, the epitome of dominance and strength, tenacity and confidence, the embodiment of allure…and that specimen of a body! Her competition is her own being.
In the film, costume designer Signe Sejlund styled the character Serena in varying textures and shades of olive green, layered and complimented with hints of the softest blush, to an intense fuchsia. The wardrobe was strong and soft, bold and subdued, x and y… personified by a name, SERENA.
A few favorites for the upcoming season! Currently obsessed with polaroids, pink roses, and Paris (obviously).
Starting a rock band always solves all your problems, right? Right??? At least that's the idea in Band Aid, an angst-filled relationship clash with a riffing twist.
Anna (Zoe Lister-Jones, who directs) and Ben (Adam Pilly) are a notoriously unhappy, constantly bickering couple on the verge of calling it quits. But after a therapy session, they decide to pick up some instruments and turn their fights into songs. Along the way, they're joined by their awkward neighbor (Fred Armison) on the drums, while they work through their grief and crank out some jams.
It's clear from the opening's epic showdown that this is a film that runs on snippy back-and-forth dialogue. It piles on the zingers, running the gamut between caustic, clever, and annoying. For a while, the film maladroitly stumbles along like a Duplass-lite dramedy without the messily endearing characters. In fact, Anna and Ben are both a bit on the bland side, and frankly, they're sort of insufferable most of the time (no wonder why they're always arguing with each other!).
But to my surprise, Anna and Ben began to grow on me. As did the film, especially toward the second half when the comedy hits harder and bits of affecting emotion ring in. And you know what? The songs they come up with are actually kinda good. Raw indie-rock with some catchy hooks. Like, can I purchase an album by The Dirty Dishes somewhere (that's their band name)?
Band Aid still can't escape some of its own obnoxiousness, but it ends up transforming into a decent tune.
Agribusiness experts present risk management strategies to address the complex financial and business challenges Florida agriculture producers face every day.
The 2017 Florida Agriculture Financial Management Conference (FAFMC) addresses key financial issues growers and producers face. Some of the nation’s leading agricultural and economic experts will provide information on the latest trends and tools to assess and manage the overall financial health of their business. Analyzing financial performance, evaluating new market opportunities, risk management, cybersecurity and adapting to regulatory and technology changes are just some of the highlights of the conference.
The conference, now in its seventh year and supported by a USDA specialty crop block grant among other influential sponsors, will equip participants with the skills to analyze their economic opportunities and challenges. Organizers have maintained their commitment to offer a high-quality experience and affordable pricing for farmers and producers at one of central Florida’s premier resorts.
The event promotes networking with colleagues and peers, the sharing of ideas and best practices, and gives attendants the opportunity to discuss the current financial market and its impact on agribusinesses. Owners and managers of Florida farms – large and small – are encouraged to attend, along with chief financial officers, controllers, CPAs, accountants, book keepers, lenders and attorneys who represent growers. CPE and CLE credits will be available.
The Florida Agriculture Financial Management Conference offers solutions and relationship-building opportunities. Anyone invested in the future of agriculture in Florida will benefit from attending and be part of building the future for us all.

Travel from LA to the city of sin, then up to Area 51 to get your geek on before touring Route 66 and circling back to L.A, all possible within a week.
Explore the West Coast, from California to Alaska, with these highlights to hit along the way. Yes, you’ll have to pop into Canada for a spell but it’s still a mostly American road trip. Cut out the northern part and do San Diago to Seattle for the abbreviated, all-American version. We did most of this route, including the stunning Redwood Forrest, a few years back and can’t recommend the West Coast high enough.
We drove from the extreme north of the continental US to the East Coast, and then across the entire continent, hitting the highlights along the way, before landing along the West Coast. We did all of this with a newborn, in a tiny car, in only a few weeks. And then, because we’re mad– we did it in reverse a few weeks later and went back to the East Coast.

There's an unsettling quietness in Isherwood's writing and narration that continues to fascinate me. He shares Shirley Jackson's gift for turning mundane every day life events into life-defining moments, minus the chilling effect that settles in afterward.
This story here, like all Isherwood stories, is much more than the sum of its parts, and is particularly difficult to describe without going off on all sorts of tangents. Mostly because it's one of those great-impact novels that touch on so many aspects of life and identity. There's lots of nostalgia and introspection mixed into the writing to give it that unsettling quietness that I can't get over.
The story takes place in Hollywood at a glamorous party in which Stephen Monk attends only to see his wife there with another man. Finally realizing there's nothing left to salvage of his marriage, he descends into a depressive state and takes refuge at a relative's home in the county to get away from it all. While there, he has an accident and injuries himself seriously enough to need bed rest, which gives him what he's afraid of most: time to think and reminisce. It takes him back to his days spent on the Canary Islands shortly before WWII and the affair he had with a younger man. The rest of the story is him reminiscing about this time period. In the end, he comes to an understanding, of himself, of life in America, of his failed marriage. Things don't tie up neatly like that, but Monk seems to have a grasp on his life again.
Isherwood's writing, though not read much outside of literary circles when he had been alive, helped define a new consciousness in an era when people didn't talk about certain things and instead would much rather ignore anything they thought threatened the mainstream consciousness, like homosexuality. Isherwood's voice was one of the first to speak of queerness openly--we don't see such writing until much later, the late 80s at least. He had a way of showing gay relationships as being just another way of living; another facet of life, although a very quiet, hidden life. The subtlety in his prose makes his stories stand out and stand the test of time, I think.

As a kid, I always liked comedy and would listen to albums by George Carlin, Bob Newhart, Bill Cosby, and Lenny Bruce. Despite my enjoyment of these great talents, I decided to pursue an unfunny career and left Los Angeles for San Francisco State College to be a lawyer. When that did not hold my attention, I switched majors and ended up getting a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Communications.

Perhaps no other drug in the entire history of humankind has achieved as much fame (and at the same time, notoriety) as Viagra. Targeted at curing impotency, this drug - developed by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer - has achieved almost cult status, with sales of over hundreds of thousands of pills everyday around the globe. The success of Viagra itself speaks volumes about how prevalent impotency is among men all over the world. According to what we have learned from the authorities, the FDA has no control whatsoever over the price of any drugs seen as products.
for the time being FDA does not hold the information of the cost of Viagra but any pharmacy can be contacted to ask for information. Erectile Dysfunction patients around the world bestowed their trust on the strength of Viagra and it also did not fail them. Their sexual yearnings and desires were considerably fulfilled at the cost of Viagra efficacy. As more and more people around the world started to administer Viagra to their system the sales of the drug also skyrocketed with 140 million Viagra tablets getting sold in the year 2000.
Pfizer introduced oral pill viagra in 1998 and it created uproar, which is contrary to the reaction generally related with a launch of any usual medication. Since then more then 23 million people have been put it to good use. Different pharmaceutical companies have launched generic version of viagra. It is just as safe and effective as their brand-name counterparts. Doctors worldwide are prescribing generic viagra to all those suffering from ED. The results have been encouraging and these men have enjoyed their sexual lives as before.
Trials have shown that generic viagra is safe to use and can be combined with a number of medicines that one is prescribed or buys over the counter from time to time. When the police nabbed the guilty this aspect of viagra generic power till then hidden came to light and along with this revelation, shock waves spread across the world and millions stood startled at this amazing erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. First Viagra made humans strong enough to deal with erectile dysfunction and now the drug has also infused demonic strength into animals.
So thereafter, what else? But before going into details of the natural treatment options available for impotence, let us see what the real Viagra does. Viagra is the trade name for the drug sildenafil citrate. When it is consumed, it helps the blood flow to focus better on the corpus cavernosa of the penis. The corpus cavernosa is composed of several spongy tissues. When these spongy tissues are engorged with blood, the penis becomes hard, which is the state of erection.
Thus, Viagra brings about a temporary erection by filling the corpus cavernosa with blood. There are some disadvantages when a person consumes Viagra. One of the most important ones is that Viagra needs to be continuously used to obtain an erection. No Viagra, no erection. And those who use Viagra know how expensive the little blue pill is!

There's a unique history behind a tourist attraction in the Peace Garden State that's recently earned the title of North Dakota's 'Weirdest Tourist Attraction.'
If you're not from North Dakota, you may not realize all the tourist attractions that exist here. There's Salem Sue in New Salem, Dakota Thunder in Jamestown, Tommy the Turtle in Bottineau, the Enchanted Highway, and several others. But according to MoneyWise, none of the aforementioned tourist attractions are considered the weirdest.
For that, you would need to go to the 'Geographical Center of North America' in Rugby, ND... or wait, is it Robinson, ND? Therein lies the controversy. MoneyWise described the geographical controversy as such in their article that lists the 'Weirdest Tourist Attraction in Every State':
Two North Dakota towns, Rugby and Robinson, fight over the title of the 'geographical center of North America.' Rugby claimed the honor in 1931, changing the town's seal to reflect the status. A stone obelisk in a parking lot marks the spot. Robinson's Mayor Bill Bender discovered that Rugby let its trademark expire and claimed it for Robinson instead. Rugby answered by filing a nearly identical trademark — indicating the fight isn't over.
Hanson's Bar in Robinson took over the geographical claim back in October of 2016. However, in MoneyWise's listing, they didn't mention that back in April of this year, Rugby and Robinson came to an agreement, as noted by an article in Minot Daily News. Rugby's Chamber of Commerce issued a statement in regards to the dispute:
...has been resolved in a manner satisfactory to both the Rugby Chamber and NFNP (Hanson’s Bar). As a result of that resolution, NFNP has both ended its use of the mark and acknowledge the Rugby Chamber’s rights in the mark going forward from the date of the agreement. The parties are pleased to have reached on amicable resolution of their differences.
And there it is, the controversy has been resolved over North Dakota's 'Weirdest Tourist Attraction' and Rugby is once again the geographical center of North America.
For those special occasions, sometimes the best seat in the house is a table with the best view. And the view could be of the city, lake or mountain. Different cities and towns have different views to appreciate.
I want you to think about this, where would the restaurant with the best views in North Dakota be located?
I was thinking in Medora. Have you ever been to the pitchfork cookout before the musical? The views are magical!
According to Cheapism.com, the best view in North Dakota is in the town of St. Michaels on Devils Lake. You'll have to enter Spirit Lake Casino and Resort, and the house restaurant is called "The View". Imagine that!
The Yankees (15-13) were finally able to put together a solid offensive performance on Sunday afternoon and Phil Hughes pitched great in the 10-3 victory over the Royals (9-18). After looking sloppy and dropping two of the first three games in Kansas City in a series that saw them lose Mariano Rivera for the season and saw their bats disappear the Yankees ended up salvaging the short road trip splitting it two games apiece. Phil Hughes went 6 2/3 innings gave up three runs on six hits and struck out seven en route to his second win of the season. Royal’s starter Luke Hochevar got shelled by the Yanks. Hochevar only last 2 1/3 gave up seven runs on seven hits.
In the second inning the Yankees got on the board thanks to a Raul Ibanez RBI single. In the third inning the Yankees would really get to Hochevar and blow the game open. Dwayne Wise and Derek Jeter led off the inning with back to back singles which led to a Curtis Granderson RBI single; A-Rod was then hit by a pitch to load the bases. Robinson Cano then sent them all home with a Grand Slam. It was only the second home run of the season for Cano and only put him at eight RBIs so far, hopefully that blast will turn the star second basemen’s season around. Later in the third Nick Swisher would knock Hochevar out of the game with a solo shot, his seventh home run of the season. It was Swishers first day back in the lineup after missing the previous six games due to a tweaked left hamstring.
Alex Rodriguez would add to the Yankee lead in the eighth inning with a three-run home run off Royals reliever Tommy Hottvy. It was A-Rods fifth of the year.
Kansas City Royals rookie Irving Falu had two base hits in his major league debut including a triple in his first ever at bat. Royals catcher Humberto Quintero hit a solo home run off of Phil Hughes in the seventh inning, Quintero’s first of the year.
The Yankees have Monday off and will play again on Tuesday against the Tampa Bay Rays. Ivan Nova (3-1 5.58) will start for the Yankees; James Shields (5-0 3.05) is scheduled to go for the Rays. Pregame begins at 6:30, first pitch at 7:05 right here on 104.5 The Team ESPN Radio.
About a month and a half ago a man in OKC managed to steal $400 worth of beef jerky from a convenience store. Local police hope that photos taken from security cameras will help identify the jerky thief. He was wearing an Adidas hoodie and blue jeans in the footage. It is unknown how he carried the products out of the store.
So far there have been no updates to this story. It seems like this beef thief has gotten away with his crime, so far. It is unknown how he carried the jerky unnoticed, and it’s unknown why he even stole all of it. Why? Who would need to go home with that much beef jerky in a single day?

Sincerely, Wen Jun Zhang Microsoft Online Community Support ================================================== Get notification to my posts through email? Note: The MSDN Managed Newsgroup support offering is for non-urgent issues where an initial response from the community or a Microsoft Support Engineer within 1 business day is acceptable. A more common approach is directly writting the schema into message's context. The recommended way to do that is using declarative security through the use of attributes, in particular “Registry Permission Attribute”. In NET 1.1 existed the “Wait Handle” class for thread synchronization but for NET 2.0 has been superseded by the new “Safe Wait Handle”. The model for IDictionary based collections changed in the way internal items are compared and stored through the use of Hash codes.So, all constructors using an ICompare and IHash Code Provider are now obsolete and should be replaced by the new IEquality Comparer interface.The recommended way to do that is using declarative security through the use of attributes, in particular “Event Log Permission Access Attribute”.
The method “To Date Time” from the class “Xml Convert” has a new parameter indicating the serialization mode of the date value.The class “Xml Reader” now uses a new class of type “Xml Reader Settings” to configure the type of validation to use and schema information to include.This class is passed to the constructor of the new “Xml Reader” class. You have come up with really good list migration item list here. Was wondering if you could answer a problem we are facing. So, you must eliminate these unwanted attributes from every Assembly file and touch every project configuration manually.If your application writes to the Event Log you should be doing a security assert trough CAS.

Last Thursday May 7, gold prices were at $1,192.64 per ounce right before undergoing a sharp rapid descent to 1,181.02 per ounce, after Fed Chair's comments on this commodity which brought about an approximate estimation by investors regarding the rate hike this year.
One day earlier on Wednesday, nonfarm payrolls increased while unemployment rate in USA showed the highest level since 2000. For the time being, the Federal Reserve, together with investors, lie in wait for Friday's job report shedding light on the strength of the economy for providing further information.
On Friday 8 was marked by ups and downs of gold prices edging higher from a minimum $1,183.33 up to nearly $1,190, still limited amid strong dollar backed by Thursday's disappointing employment data. During the weekend, the price of gold remained in the level of $1,188.46 per ounce.
In the wake of Monday's morning, gold prices rised to $1,190 per ounce before falling below $1,180 among expectations of the Bank of England's announcement of the new monetary policy to fight inflation, and the eurogroup meeting's final decision on Greece's debt. Everything pointed out that Greece will keep the head above water, and indeed, at the deadline to repay the debt to the International Monetary Fund this Tuesday, the Hellenic country managed to pay it.
On Tuesday 12, the price of gold shot up to $1,195 per ounce and during Wednesday 13 it remains steady between that figure and $1,191. Meanwhile, experts await the development of the events in the international arena to make their forecasts.
The gold market has key significance for the advantages of this product. The clients of Emgoldex are fully aware of gold advantages as they enjoy them in the online store of the company.

Its not the city of "Chicago" any more than it is the state of "Illinois" or the whole "United States". This wave of endless violence comes from a small segment of the population. Which is what makes it so mind boggling when you think about it. If it was interspersed throughout the entire city and it could be anyone doing it, I can see where it might be difficult to figure out who is committing the crimes and how to stop them. But when it is a relatively small segment of the population, and most importantly - they identify themselves with clothing or tattoos or whatever their particular choice is, its hard imagine how they can go unchecked for so long.
Of course, I am talking about gangs. The worst of which is the democrats. If I had to pick one group of people who are responsible for the most suffering in Chicago, it would be the democrats. Not the gangs. Not the police. Not whitey. Democrats. They have been running this city, and the other ten to fifteen cities in this country with the worst violent crime, for decades. It is no coincidence.
The town where I live has been on a crusade to relocate inner city "refugees", as they are called, to the suburbs to give them hope for a brighter future. They live in subsidized housing, get free cable and cell phones, and who knows what else. Since this program has started we have had a steady increase in violent crime, break ins, and car theft. Today we had our first smash-and-grab type theft of a local retailer.
Today my neighbor, an 84 year old woman, was walking her dog when I saw two unfamiliar black men walking toward her. She was obviously hesitant and intimidated but remained calm. I chose that moment to clean my shotgun in my garage and decided a little fresh air would be nice. As the door slowly raised I saw the two men stop and talk to my neighbor. I stood the 12 gage up by the side of the door and yelled to my neighbor asking her who her two friends were. The men decided to leave for some reason. They never saw the 12 gage, the .357 in the small of my back, or the 9mm on my hip. My AR was also very near by. Had they hurt her it would have ended badly for them.
This is my neighborhood. That is my neighbor. It happened in front of my house. And I can clean my guns any time I want to. On the other side of the street I saw another neighbor wave from a window right behind where the conversation took place. He was watching too. I waved and smiled at him. He waved and smiled back. My neighbor and her dog made it home safely. This was at 4:30 in the afternoon. I asked her what the men wanted. I hoped it was directions or something like that. They asked her where she lived. She didn't answer them. Good for her. The authorities have been informed and descriptions provided.
The gangs in Chicago have not broken up. If anything they are bigger than they have ever been. The latin kings are very active in certain areas. Don't believe me? Go down town some night and shout their name along with a few insults. You will find out very quickly how wrong you are.

It's true that the Hispanic gangs are still pretty well organized, but the black gangs are completely leaderless, and that's where most of the violence is coming from, not the Hispanic gangs. 75% of the gun crime in Chicago is committed by blacks, under 20% is by Hispanics, so clearly the Latin Kings are not the source of this violence surge.
I've lived in Chicago for almost 20 years now. Chicago is a beautiful world class city. It really is only second to NYC and to be honest, Chicago is a much more livable city than NYC since it is no where near as expensive, crowded, and dirty. We have the lakefront, world class museums, two of the best universities in the world (Northwestern & U of Chicago), home to dozens of f500 companies, great food, etc.
All the crime you hear in the media largely takes place on the south and west sides of the city. The neighborhoods are about 10 miles from downtown Chicago. The violence is literally contained to relatively small areas of the city. With that said, these neighborhoods in some respects are like third world # holes.
There is no reason anyone would be in these areas unless you were unfortunate enough to 1) live there or 2) you are a dope fiend.
What is always glossed over in this discussion is how this is largely a poor black neighborhood problem. These areas have literally failed culturally and socially.
The violence is largely perpetrated by young black males and to a lesser degree, hispanics. The biggest issue is the lack of fathers. You literally have entire neighborhoods with feral young men with nothing to do except get involved in the street life.
Chicago is somewhat unique in the sense that there is a huge gang culture unlike any other city which drive a lot of the violence. However, Chicago isn't unique in that you see the same violence anywhere you have poor blacks in any significant number even in smaller cities. On a per capita basis, cities like Baton Rouge, St. Louis, Detroit, etc are more violent than Chicago. The demographics are the same though. Young black men.
Until the black community and progressives are willing to have a frank and honest discussion,solutions to this crisis will be fleeting at best.
I'm extremely proud of my black American heritage. However, anyone who is objectively looking at this issue has to acknowledge to complete and utter failure of the black community socially and culturally over the past 50 years. The celebration of ignorance and thug life has been detrimental beyond all repair.
I do understand all of that--I've been to Chicago a few times and have regular dealings with the IRS' National Forensics Lab--I talk to people that live there quite often.
Now, after contemplating that list of U.S cities and comparing crime per capita with other first world nation countries and their cities, you might come to understand that what is going on in Chicago does indeed represent all of America.
Then, go and look at how many cities there are in America, and realize that large urban areas with high murder and crime rates are NOT representational of the average American city.
Yes, large urban sprawls produce the vast majority of our murders and gun violence, among other types of crimes (drugs being a major one), but again, large urban cities are not the average American city.
You're not comparing apples to apples, here, just as you're not when you compare our American culture to either that of non-first-world countries or European nations.
Just because you've traveled here numerous times doesn't mean that you understand America or Americans. See, I'm not making my comment in regards to a global perspective, I'm making my comment based on reality. That's what matters, not making false comparison because you've visited here a lot and are looking at our country from the outside in--that barely gives you a foundation upon which to make your claims.
Disagree with me all that you want, but until you've lived in America for over 35 years in more than six different cities of varying sizes in three different states in two vastly different regions of the country, don't preach to me about what the average American city is or is not just because your global perspective skews your view average America.
You're patriotic and you have every right to be. America has given the world a lot of wonderful things, but don't allow that patriotism to blind you concerning the nature of this particular topic. Just to be clear; I personally see *most* Americans as being very kindhearted, caring, sophisticated, peaceful and intelligent people. I have many friends in America. And they are well aware of my views...
American society *overall*, when violent crime and murder is weighed per capita (per 100 000 people,) is not considered very peaceful when compared to other first world nation societies when weighed per capita (per 100 000 people).This doesn't mean there isn't low crime cities in America that exist. There are many safe cities in America.
Again: WHY do many major American cities (not only Chicago,) have such an alarmingly higher rate of murders and shootings per capita when compared to other major cosmopolitan cities (hubs) of developed industrialized nations in the world?
Why do large urban areas in America have an extremely higher rate of violent crimes and murder per capita when compared to large urban areas with similar population density of other first world countries?
Pittsburgh has a population of 305,841. It's 'Violent Crime Rate Index' is 798/100 000 people. The total murders for 2015 were 71.
Now, I will use Toronto, which is Canada's largest city with a population of 6,055,724 and ranked the safest major city in N.America and eighth safest major city in the world. It's 'Violent Crime Rate Index' is 907/100 000 people. The 'Homicide Rate' is 2.0/100 000 people. The total murders for 2015 were 55.
Toronto's population has 5,749, 883 more people than Pittsburgh, yet has fewer murders and violent crime.
This pattern can be found when one compares ANY city in America to ANY city in another first world country.
In other words: Welcome To America: The Most Violent Country of First World Nations. Chicago represents what American society has become. The national numbers don't lie...
I'm not a tourist. I travel and live in many places (including the U.S) due to the nature of my business. I pay income and property taxes...
Disagree with me all that you want, but until you've lived in America for over 35 years in more than six different cities of varying sizes in three different states in two vastly different regions of the country, don't preach to me about what the average American city is or is not just because your global perspective skews your view average America.
As I stated in my initial comment: I understand where you are coming from based on my extensive travel and stay (months at times) within the U.S (over 40 States and 13 different cities over the past 4 years). In other words: I know most Americans are cool people.
Btw, that is just the last four years alone and those 13 cities cover a few States. Next year will be nine years in total I have been doing this.
I don't know America as well as you do, but I have good feel for things, and I know my way around...
I like America, don't get it twisted. I just can't understand how some Americans believe the States isn't a violent nation.

The cloud for the enterprise is a remarkable product, as companies and businesses around the world continue to use it for all types of data. On Monday, Microsoft and SAP signed a brand new initiative that will bring together the cloud and big data in all new ways.
The agreement between SAP and Microsoft continues the ongoing partnership that the two companies have had for over 20 years. This new alliance though marks the launch of the cloud infrastructure for both companies, and will allow SAP to launch its services on Microsoft Azure.
The new SAP and Microsoft cloud agreement will allow SAP to run several of its major cloud services on the Microsoft Azure platform. These services with include: SAP Business Suite software, SAP Business All-In-One solution, SAP Mobile Platform, SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (SAP ASE) and the developer edition of the SAP HANA platform.
With these services run on Azure, business and enterprise customers will be able to run these apps anytime, and benefit from the infrastructure of the cloud. The unlimited cloud resources that Microsoft Azure can support any businesses SAP needs, from the smallest company to the largest.
In addition to the cloud resources, the SAP agreement will also allow SAP mobile tools to interact directly with Windows Phone. Microsoft is planning later this year to release a new SAP mobile SDK for SAP customers, and those will allow those customers to build mobile apps that tightly use the SAP infrastructure.
Lastly, the SAP Gateway for Microsoft has been rebuilt, and will allow it to connect with powerful business tools from Microsoft. The biggest one will be the ability to connect Excel to the SAP Business objects and Power BI together. The ability to bring big data together with the cloud, Azure, and SAP will make crunching big data easier and more efficient. Clearly, Microsoft sees the enterprise and the cloud as a major push in the immediate future, and building a new partnership with SAP will certainly do that today.
This is a big enterprise play for SAP and Microsoft. Both enterprise tools generate billions of dollars, and will only build more in the future.

The night of Route 91 Harvest Festival is a scarring memory Jason Aldean will never forget—and in a new interview, he's reflecting on the emotions he felt in response to the tragedy.
Aldean was performing on stage during the final night of the 2017 festival when a gunman opened fire on the crowd below, taking the lives of 59 people and injuring thousands more. Speaking with Willie Geist for Today's Sunday Sitdown, the singer opens up about the unthinkable event.
"When somebody buys a ticket to our show or comes into an arena to watch you play, we want them to come, have fun, get home safe, and come see us the next time we're in town," Aldean says. "The last thing we're thinking is they're going to show up and never leave."
One aspect that made the experience particularly terrifying for Aldean was the fact that his wife Brittany, who was pregnant with their son Memphis at the time, was backstage during the shooting.
"We are safe... our angels were definitely watching over us [that night]. No words for what happened... Just horrific. Praying for everyone," Brittany wrote in an Instagram post the day after the shooting, and Aldean agrees with her description.
"It definitely was scary," he says. "I hate that she was there to have to experience it. On the other hand, I know if she was at home and saw it on the news she would've freaked out—and I don't know what would've been worse."
In the days following the tragedy, Aldean and wife Brittany traveled back to Vegas to visit with the survivors and those recovering in the hospital. Aldean is often met with questions about Route 91, and while he'll never forget that night or the people affected, it is a harrowing memory he tries not to re-experience.
"That's not something I want on my resume for the rest of my life," he says of his association with the tragedy. "For me, it's something not that I want to forget, but it's something that I choose to not relive over and over."
The singer recently visited a fan in Arizona who sustained serious injuries during the shooting and brought her a signed guitar. Several of the survivors started a group called "58 Survivors, 1 Last Set" asking for Aldean to return to Vegas to complete his set as a way to help in the healing process.

At this stage, Union Railway is pre-qualifying bidders to begin the implementation of the first phase of railway network that will link Shah with Habshan.
The railway company will tender civil engineering works in March, hoping to start the construction to commence in mid-2011 following the naming of the winning company.
The scope of work of this initial phase, also known as stage zero, includes earthworks, laying down the track, building the railway bridges, installing the communications and signalling systems, as well as the construction of the depot and project offices at Mirfa. The next two phases of the project will see the establishment of a network in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the stage one, and a network in the Northern Emirates in stage two. Commenting on the tender, Union Railways CEO Richard Bowker said, “The development of an integrated and modern railway network is critical to enhancing the current freight transport system and driving economic growth in the UAE.”
A large number of leading international companies have expressed interest in competing in the prequalification, thereby allowing us to select the best partner to undertake the first steps in constructing the network,” he said.
Union Railways has appointed ATKINS as the Preliminary Engineering Services Consultant to oversee the execution of the three stages of the UAE’s railway network, with the reselection of the Project Management Consultant soon to follow.
ATKINS has already begun work on the flagship project and the preliminary design for the Shah-Habshan-Ruwais line is to be completed next month.
When complete, the railway will serve the whole country via a 1200km-long safe and cost-efficient rail network.

I work overseas and away from my wife. In my free time I do Da’wah work online. Some time ago I met a non Muslim woman online. I invited her to become a Muslim and Alhamdulillah she has accepted Islam. She is now totally committed to Islam and is currently giving Da’wah to her family.
After some time of chatting, we fell in love with each other. I am happy to have her as my wife and so is she. My wife has come to know of my contact with the woman after checking my messages on my phone. She was very upset and insists that I divorce her or leave that woman. I feel bad to leave that woman alone as I’m the only one who she can discuss Islam with and I love her. I thought her how to pray, fast, read Quran and all about Islam and Da’wah. If I stop talking to her it will devastate her and cause her depression. Can I lie to my wife that I stopped talking to this woman just to make her happy? Because I don’t want to lose her either and she is not flexible on this issue.
Alhamdulillah, you were a means of the woman in reference to accept Islam. She trusted you and was guided by you. Now that you have overstepped this mark and used her conversion to Islam for your own benefit, you risk losing the rewards of your efforts. Furthermore, you ought to be a role model of a practicing and Allah conscious Muslim to her. She ought to look up to you to get closer to Allah. When you have fallen in love with her and broke the laws and limitations of Hijab, how do you expect her to believe and understand the rationale behind the laws of Hijab? How will she understand Taqwa and fighting her Nafs to please Allah when you yourself are actually exchanging love text messages to her? She knows you are married, she may be questioning the role of a married Muslim woman and how she can be cheated on. She may even lose trust in you due to your Haraam conduct with her. You teach her about Allah consciousness and go against what you taught her. If you are honest about Da’wah and wished for the woman to accept Islam for the pleasure of Allah, take it one step further and tell her you fear Allah and your Nafs got the better of you. You should not have trespassed the limits of the Da’wah communication and you are sorry. Tell her you are making Tawbah to Allah and wish to obey Allah by breaking contact with her. Tell her this is the law of Allah. Do tell her you feel like a hypocrite telling her about Allah and going against Allah. Advise her to be steadfast on Islam and refer her to some Muslim woman who could assist her or refer her to a reliable Muslim woman website like www.idealwoman.org. If you do this, you will salvage the damage you have done and Insha’Allah also preserve the reward for her being guided through you. You cannot lie to your wife and continue your Haraam communication. Thank your wife for helping you abstain from Haraam and apologize to her for hurting her. This honest and repentant attitude requires courage but will ultimately please Allah.
Perhaps a way to prevent misunderstandings or errors of judgements is to allow sisters to interact with sisters and brothers with brothers.
May Allah Ta’ala make this time easy for the families involved and provide them with solutions. Ameen

You paid helluva lot for that wide-aperture lens, so you’re going to use it. What’s the point in shooting at an aperture that complements an image’s composition, its message, and your personal understanding of documented reality?
Oh, wait. You just paid helluva lot for that wide-aperture lens, hence you damn well see the world at f/1.4 or below, so that’s fine. Pinpointing what matters™, highlighting it in gloriously shallow depth-of-field. After all, there’s the Bokeh to consider, the creamier, the better. Unless you bought a cheapo lens and the out-of-focus areas are kinda hard, in that case that’s the statement you truly wanted to make. The harsh reality outside of what normal people perceive. The human condition, rendered in two inches of sharpness, the rest in uncomfortable blur. You even got an ND filter to make sure you won’t get tempted to stop it down in brighter conditions. Because the shallowness is what it’s all about.
For example, how could the following photo profit from a stopped-down lens? Juxtaposing the mercantile marketing world represented by the discarded Coke can to newspapers ready for disposal? As a somewhat ironic comment? Are you bloody kidding me?
Na, the message is: the “% sodium” label sits in the same focus plane as the twine on the right. Because that’s what you can do with this fucking lens, that’s what it’s there for and what you’ve paid for. It’s huge, it’s heavy, it’s expensive. It’s irritating the manufacturer still bothers with aperture blades! Such lenses are made to be shot wide open, so you’ll do your damnedest to only use it wide open. Always. No exception. The Bokeh will make it a good image by default. No?

An ex-New Yorker living in San Francisco – eating everything in sight. A food blog for local restaurant reviews.
If you didn’t see it coming and haven’t heard the big news yet, Amy and I are relocating from NYC to San Francisco. So, there’s gonna be lots more West Coast eating and writing is on the horizon. But before making the move, we’ve had enough time for us each to pick one last date night spot to cross off of our NYC to-do lists. Amy’s pick was the ever-trendy Lower East Side cool-kid hot spot Beauty & Essex and mine was the shall-we-say more meat-centric Peter Luger’s Steakhouse which you can read about here.
Beauty & Essex is about as trendy as restaurants get in NYC. It’s actually as much a nightclub as it is a restaurant. It’s the kind of place you get decked out to go to drink fancy cocktails and nibble on small plates next to models and the who’s who of the NYC nightlife scene. You shouldn’t be surprised if you find yourself seated near to a celebrity or two — if you can get in. If you’re coming just for evening drinks, there’s likely to be a line wrapped around the block. Amy knew this was where she wanted to go, so she booked a reservation well in advance, so we had no problem getting seated for dinner though getting inside the restaurant was a bit of an adventure in its own right.
Beauty & Essex is a speakeasy restaurant and lounge that’s fronted by a fully functioning pawn shop. You need to walk to the back corner of the room and pass through the big, unmarked wood door before you’ve actually entered the restaurant space. Immediately you’ll find yourself confronted by the soft neon glow of bar lounge lighting, the aggressive thumping of club music, and the carefully curated velvet and leather stylings of a classic upscale restaurant with a vintage pawn shop edge.
Besides the obvious cool factor to the location, decor, and hidden speakeasy quality, one of the big draws to the restaurant is celebrity chef that owns and runs it. You may recognize Chris Santos from his many judging appearances on the Food Network show, Chopped. Having never visited his much loved first NYC restaurant Stanton Social, I didn’t really know what to expect from the food at Beauty & Essex. In fact, I’ll admit that I went in with pretty low expectations. I figured it was just a really trendy place that would be more concerned about feeling cool than about producing inventive, delicious food. As you’ll soon see, my preconceived notions were wrong.
Though we made a reservation, after approaching the front desk, we were still handed a buzzer and asked to wait while they got our table set up. We took the opportunity to go straight to the main bar and order a round of cocktails while we waited. Immediately as we placed our drink order, our buzzer went off, so we carefully carried our cocktails upstairs with us where our table was waiting. I guess we got a little too anxious. Bad timing on our part. Also, I got the sense that they segregate the restaurant between the top of bottom floors. I think the downstairs serves the trendy singles crowd and the upstairs, where we were relegated, is for couples on dates and family gatherings. Guess we’re not cool enough to be seated downstairs.
Nonetheless we took our table and sipped our cocktails while we looked over the menu. I began with a drink called the Smooth Criminal made with Illegal Mezcal, lemon juice, lime juice, and peach purée. Though it was rather pricey at $15 for a cocktail, it was still a really nice drink. It tasted like a really smokey, complex margarita.
I could have guessed which cocktail Amy would select. She started with a drink called The Woodsman which included all of her usual ingredients and flavors and sounded right up her alley. It was made with Woodford Reserve Bourbon, allspice Dram, maple syrup, lemon juice, and muddled pears. The cocktail was very spirit-forward and had a ton of those wintery-spice flavors she loves so much. This was another well-conceived drink, though also admittedly pricey.
Just as we figured out what to order for dinner, an amuse bouche arrived at the table for each of us. Served in ceramic white shot glasses was a Cucumber Gazpacho dressed with crema and cilantro. It was very cold and refreshing, had an interesting pulpy texture, and a sort of bell pepper flavor followed by a strong, herbal cilantro punch at end. We both appreciated the complimentary starter.
Shortly after, the first of our small plates arrived. The Sashimi of Tuna Tonnato Style was dressed with lemon zested olive oil, crunchy chorizo, sea salt, and a really unique creamy topping. I think the dish was meant to play off of the idea of the Italian veal dish Vitello Tonnato which in its classic incarnation tops cold veal with a tuna flavored mayo sauce.
I can’t say the inspiration sounds particularly appealing, but this riff on it was incredible. The raw slices of tuna were super high quality and there was such a complex layering of flavors and textures in the dish, particularly from the creamy sauce on top, but especially from the crunchy fried chorizo cube adornment. Every element of this seemingly simple dish played together perfectly and the plating was beautiful. This ended up being one of our favorite bites of the meal.
Next to arrive were the Lobster Tacos, which came three to an order. Most of the Foursquare tips at Beauty & Essex raved about this dish, so we kind of had to go for it, even though it’s pretty pricey at $21 for the plate. Each of the three tacos included a massive hunk of beer battered Maine lobster topped with slaw and spiced cream. There really was quite a lot of excellent, fresh lobster meat in there.
But honestly, we both agreed that it would have been even better without the fried beer batter coating. I know — blasphemy. I think the fried exterior is what people love about it, but we thought it was more distracting than beneficial and detracted from the textural and flavor subtleties that make lobster meat so wonderful.
Instead, if you want lobster, I suggest getting the Lobster ‘Mac & Cheese’ which was one of the most incredible versions of mac and cheese either of us has ever had. Everything about it from the thick and creamy texture, to the chewy spiraled noodles that sopped up the cheese so well, to the oceany meaty lobster bits, to the crunchy Sicilian bread crumb topping were top notch. At only $15, this heaping skillet of ooey-gooey deliciousness was a steal.
But if there was one dish on the menu I absolutely knew I had to have, this next one was it. The Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon, and Tomato Soup Dumplings were a riff on the now-famed French Onion Soup Dumplings concocted at Chris Santos’ other restaurant, Stanton Social, which in itself was a riff on the much loved Shanghaiese Xiao Long Bao “Soup Dumplings”.
Each of these six soup dumplings came served as individual prepared bites on their own wonton soup spoons. A magical cheese-filled and cheese-wrapped dumpling was seated in a spoonful of creamy tomato soup, each one ready for the eating. The texture of each grilled cheese dumpling was pretty amazing, made from a blistered cheese skin pouch wrapped around internal molten cheese. Each one was sprinkled with crispy bacon bits and when slurped up with a spoonful of hot tomato soup was totally reminiscent of the grade-school classic. This was childhood comfort food warped through Chris Santos’ brilliant mind.
And finally, a wild card. No one in their right mind would come to Beauty & Essex expecting excellent Mexican food, but we just couldn’t resist trying the Duck Confit Chilaquiles. This gourmet version of the Tex-Mex comfort food classic was absolutely smothered with tender, shredded, duck confit meat, an enormous sunny-side duck egg, plenty of bright, pickled fresno peppers, and sweet black amber plums.
There were enough complex flavors happening in this hearty bowl to keep me digging ’til I was scraping the bottom clean. If I had one minor quibble with this dish, I’d say that I wished the chips retained just a touch more of their original crispiness. But at $15, this huge, filling bowl of awesomeness was another killer offering.
So, as you can see I didn’t go in to Beauty & Essex expecting much more than a trendy scene and overpriced mediocre food, but found myself walking away stuffed and utterly impressed. Yes, it’s still gonna cost you to eat and drink there, but nearly everything we ate was impressive and worth the splurge. Bring your girl out on a date to Beauty & Essex, she’ll love it.
Got another swanky date night spot that is actually much better than expected? Let me know in the comments below.

This blog is dedicated to sharing the concept that our hands are essential to learning- that we engage the world and its wonders, sensing and creating primarily through the agency of our hands. We abandon our children to education in boredom and intellectual escapism by failing to engage their hands in learning and making.
The title of this post refers to a new book on woodworking with kids by Pete Moorhouse in the UK. I received a review copy yesterday. It is full of good information on getting started with woodworking, particularly in the early levels of school. Part of the book deals with the history of woodworking education in the primary years, making some reference to Friedrich Froebel and Rudolf Steiner.
Perhaps most useful to some will be the discussion of the teacher's role in introducing woodworking to kids. Moorhouse quotes Otto Salmon as follows: The teachers concerns must be: "not only of how much he shall demand from the children, but of how much he shall tell them and how much he shall not tell them. The best teacher is the one that teaches least."
The point, of course, is to stage and maintain an environment of discovery, not just of distribution of information through instruction. It is also a mistake to think that you must be a skilled woodworker to teach woodworking to kids. Do it.
I am getting ready for travel to Connecticut tomorrow for my five day adult class in box making. An interesting point is that children and adults learn best in the same way, by discovery that comes from doing real things.
I had placed this book in my Amazon cart when I saw your posting and now recently actually placed the order. Got the book and it is a great resource. Thanks for sharing.
I have a goal to someday get situated in a similar setting - either in a workshop associated with some school - or just on my own, offering workshops for children to learn through woodworking. Not sure yet how that will shape up. I know that your blog has been a great inspiration - and am sure it is to others wishing to do the same.
1) Liabilities - How to prevent any liabilities of injury, etc. should they heaven-forbid ever occur. Of course I would want to promote all the various suggested safety measures, preventative-steps reasonably possible – and that would go a long ways – but still how to handle the hopefully rare case. I am guessing there would need to be some kind of document/form signed by responsible party to not hold you accountable financially, etc. Suggestions?
2) Interactions with Students – How to make sure what you say & do have the most benefit to the child. Your blog gives a lot of advice and insight on that – so if I can just put that to practice I should be good. : )
3) Expectations of Parents – Again, based on insights from your blog and other related reading the benefits gained from such a session is not something that is should be measured so much by the number of beautiful things the students make, but rather about the learnings and development of self. (related to chapter 3 of book you provide info on). As long as this is key selling point to my services then I think expectations can be managed reasonably well.
One thing that I have got going on that is related and beneficial is a part time family owned/operated wooden toy making business (mentioned before) where we sell predominantly to furniture shops - most in the Central & Eastern states but also occasionally in the West. My five lovely children participate not only in aspects of the toy making process – but also have leisure to build whatever they want in the shop. My youngest (6 years old) is a great inspiration for me in that every time someone’s birthday comes up, she’s out on her very own workbench (constructed after the one you have on your blog) where she spends a few minutes thinking about what she wants to make and then BAM, within a rather short period of time (usually an hour or so) she has it made whatever she dreamt up. This gives me some experience in item b above in that I try to think a bit about how to respond when she asks me certain questions.
Sorry for the rambling. Thanks for all that you do. Someday I would like to visit you at your school.

Jeffrey is a 1995 American gay romantic comedy directed by Christopher Ashley. It is based on a play by Paul Rudnick, who also wrote the screenplay.
Jeffrey is a common English name. It is most commonly spelled as Jeffrey, but sometimes spelled with one f as in Jefrey. The name Geoffrey is the precursor to Jeffrey, and Godfrey in turn a precursor to that, from the German "Gottfried," meaning "God's peace" or "Divine peace."

manner: how something is done or how it happens; "her dignified manner"; "his rapid manner of talking"; "their nomadic mode of existence"; "in the characteristic New York style"; "a lonely way of life"; "in an abrasive fashion"
The authoritative fashion history of the roots, growth, and offshoots of the quintessentially American preppy style. Preppy offers the first definitive and in-depth volume on preppy fashion, exploring its evolution from its pragmatic origins and presence on elite Eastern campuses in America to its profound influence internationally and metamorphosis on the runway. For the first time, the preppy story is told completely and beautifully with iconic and never-before-published archival and editorial photographs and personal snapshots from the original Ivy elites.
Exploring all facets of men’s and women’s preppy fashion, this vibrant volume is replete with photographs and vintage ads illustrating the iconic elements of prep: from Oxford shirts, khakis, and Shetland sweaters to Peter Pan collars, madras pants, and Lilly Pulitzer tropical blooms. Authors Jeffrey Banks and Doria de La Chapelle also examine the fashion designers who played a major role in shaping the preppy look, from retail pioneers J.Press and Brooks Brothers to Ralph Lauren, who single-handedly marketed not just a look but a lifestyle. Also featured: a band of young twenty-first century Ivy stylists and fashion labels worldwide, who have infused preppy with high-octane design on and off the runway. Preppy is a stunning tribute to an American phenomenon.

From the witty, whimsical mind of acclaimed writer Paul Rudnick (In & Out, Addams Family Values) and celebrated stage director Christopher Ashley comes a hilarious, star-studded, boy-meets-boy romantic comedy! Steven Weber, Patrick Stewart, Michael T. Weiss, Bryan Batt, OscarA(r) nominee* Sigourney Weaver, Golden GlobeA(r) nominee** Nathan Lane and OscarA(r) winner*** Olympia Dukakis star in this "warm and humorous exploration of all-too-human relationships" (Boxoffice) in the age of AIDS. Disenchanted with the not-so-romantic side of safesex, sweet, single and obsessive Jeffrey (Weber) vows to become completely celibate! No sooner has he sworn off sex than he meets hunky, sensitive Steve (Weiss). But just as passion starts to ignite,Steve reveals some earth-shattering information, leaving Jeffrey to choose between losing the man of his dreamsor taking a risk on what just might be true love!
Surprisingly lighthearted and witty, Paul Rudnick's Jeffrey (based on his off-Broadway play) was one of the first films to tackle the AIDS crisis without patting itself on the back or offering everything up in a sobering movie-of-the-week scenario. The titular Jeffrey (Steven Weber) is a happy-go-lucky gay man who suddenly comes face to face with the fact that AIDS has turned sex into something "radioactive." Paranoid in the extreme, he vows to become celibate--at just about the same time that hunky Steve (The Pretender's Michael T. Weiss) saunters into his life, eyes twinkling and hormones raging. The only problem is that Steve, for all his muscles and charm, is HIV-positive, thus setting Jeffrey's deepest fears into motion. When it was written in 1995, Jeffrey struck a nerve in mining the fear that a number of gay men felt during the height of the AIDS crisis. Even just a few years later, though, Jeffrey's paranoia (what, he's never heard of condoms?) seems dated, and his behavior more self-damaging than self-aware--basically, he needs a slap upside the head as opposed to therapy. Still, Rudnick (who went on to pen the more mainstream In and Out) is never one to pass up a witty one-liner or an opportunity to poke fun at anyone, and Jeffrey now stands as a hilarious, sometimes poignant portrait of gay single life and the perils of dating in a paranoid time. Weber's Jeffrey is simultaneously open to the possibilities of life and fearful to embrace them, and Weiss is, well... gorgeous and funny and sexy beyond belief. Still, it's Patrick Stewart, as Jeffrey's interior decorator best friend, who effortlessly steals the film with his cutting wit; in his mouth, Rudnick's lines are priceless gems. With a host of amazing cameos, including Sigourney Weaver as a conceited New Age maven, Kathy Najimy as her sad-sack follower, Christine Baranski as a high-society hostess for a roundup-themed charity dinner, and a top-form Nathan Lane as a gay priest who seems to have discovered the meaning of life--literally. --Mark Englehart

Meghan Sims, an amazing artist from Ontario Canada who has achromatopsia, has shared with us some stunning oil paintings she has done with a new approach to color painting with achromatopsia. We are proud to have three of her works hanging in our offices. We also feature one of her paintings as a backdrop to the poem Ode to My Eyes in our Children’s section.
“I wanted to share with you, my new series of work that I did with a full color palette! As an experiment, I decided to cover my tubes of colored paint so I could no longer read them. I then organized them from darkest to lightest and numbered them accordingly. From here, I chose from photographs I have taken and reproduced the image in oil paints in an attempt to match each color from a tonal perspective. Truly, I have never been so excited and curious about an idea before. It has been a freeing experience for me and has only just begun.” - Meghan Sims
You can see more of these new color oil paintings and learn more about Meghan Sims at her website at http://www.meghansimsartist.ca/ and in the Heros and Pioneers section on our website.
BCM Families Foundation is a non-profit organization incorporated in May 2014 in USA, in the state of Delaware, by families affected by Blue Cone Monochromacy (BCM). The mission of BCM Families Foundation is to eradicate Blue Cone Monochromacy by supporting the most promising biomedical and scientific research that will ultimately lead to a cure.
We would love to bring attention to a great website and organization. Achromacorp is a non-profit setup by John & Bridget Vissari, parents of a 6 year old boy with achromatopsia. Their mission is to raise money and awareness in order to fund research that will eventually lead to new treatment and someday a cure. Please visit their site and make a donation if you feel strongly about funding new research to help find a cure or even better treatments for achromatopisa. Click here to visit their site.
We just added the story of Ken Kase, A St Louis based musician, producer and artist. He shares his story of living with and overcoming Achromatopsia.
“My eyes may be flawed, but I strive to see beyond my own experience. I try to understand the motivations of others rather than yearn to be understood.” - Ken Kase
Our doctors have just added a new movie, Achromatopsia: New Options in Contact Lenses. It discussed the new design and fitting approaches our doctors at the Achromatopsia Clinic have developed. Click above to view the movie on our Contact Lens page, or view the movie directly on youtube.
We have now added the amazing story of John Kay lead singer and founder of Steppenwolf to our Pioneers and Heros section . John has been the voice of classic rock ‘n’ roll songs like Born to be Wild and Magic Carpet Ride. Having achromatopsia alone might limit some individuals but John was faced with obstacle after obstacle in his early life. He never let these obstacles detour him from his dream of music stardom. His story should be read by all with achromatopsia and serve as an example of persistence for everyone to appreciate. Click here to view.
We have just added the story of another amazing person with achromatopsia. Staci Mannella is an Adaptive Alpine skier from New Jersey pursuing her goal of participating in the 2014 Paralympics in Sochi, Russia.
After you read her story, I hope all those with achromatopsia consider supporting her quest with a donation through her website at www.StaciMannella.com . The costs to the family of any young athlete involved in ski racing are extensive. For a visually impaired ski racer those costs are double as all visually impaired athletes are required to race with a guide. Both racers need to be on FIS legal equipment. Staci’s family carries the additional burden of supporting Staci’s guide, including paying all her expenses for attending camps and races with Staci. Click here to view.

Before we begin, an introduction to the Sky Crawlers franchise is called for. Though... it may not necessarily be needed. Flight simulation enthusiasts have most likely seen the opening scene of the Sky Crawlers movie multiple times by now. ​
​A world that has found peace following the events of the Great War, a world that never suffered through World War II. Rather than nations launching military campaigns against one another, international tensions are eased through the battles of contracted corporations. Soldiers under contract, in this case, fighter pilots, engaging one another in actual combat with live munitions. The war has no purpose; the war seemingly has no end. To the civilians that watch it and the news media that cover it's akin to a modern day sport in some aspects. The story goes much deeper, even including rumors of people that can "never die". For now, we will turn away from the intricacies of the full story and focus on Sky Cralwers: Innocent Aces.
​​Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces (October 16th 2008) is a video game adaptation of the Sky Crawlers series, which started with five books authored by Hiroshi Mori beginning in June 2001. After the movie adaptation directed by Mamoru Oshii, the video game adaptation and manga adaptation would follow. Within the Sky Crawlers timeline, this game is a prequel to everything. Having read the book series or watched the movie is not a pre-requisite.
​​Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces also introduced the concept of clouds affecting the heads up display (HUD). In mission 15, the final enemy ace pilot in the mission utilizes clouds to confuse and attack the player. By diving in and out of the clouds, the enemy Ace disappears from the players in game HUD. This connects directly to the new cloud cover system that is being introduced in Ace Combat 7.
The Ace Combat 7 cloud system is more advanced, as the system is being designed to add a more strategic element to combat within the game. Flying within the clouds in Ace Combat 7 causes an aircraft to disappear from the HUD and for it to fade on the radar. However, being within a cloud does not prevent guided weapons from locking on. Remaining inside of clouds for too long will also have negative effects, including turbulence and aircraft surfaces being iced over, resulting in less aircraft maneuverability and zero visibility for a time. Either of these could be fatal while in combat. The Ace Combat 7 cloud system is specifically designed this way to prevent overuse of the Cloud system.
An enemy aircraft hides within the cloud. Note that it can still be seen on radar in the bottom left corner.
A screenshot from the Ace Combat 7 demo. While in a cloud all radar and HUD indicators fade out, except for allies.
​A button layout was created for use with Gamecube controllers and the Wii Classic Controller for Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces. Though they could have just carbon copied the tried and true controls of the Ace Combat series, with the Wii's unique motion controller setup brought before them, Project Aces created a control scheme that mimicked the real world stick and throttle layout of an aircraft cockpit as best as possible. The Wii remote acted as the throttle, and the nunchuck was the flight stick. To further compliment the unique motion controller layout, new semi-automatic maneuver systems were created.
With its release on October 16th, 2008, Innocent Aces utilizes Tactical Maneuver Commands (TMC) and Manual Maneuvers to allow players of all experience levels to perform expert flight maneuvers. At the time, some of these aerobatic maneuvers were impossible to implement even in the Ace Combat series.
Tactical Maneuver Commands can be used for offense and defense purposes. So long as the player remains within 350 meters of the airborne target, the TMC gauge gradually increases in level. The higher the level is before activation, the better the position the player will have behind the enemy aircraft once it is complete. In a TMC the aircraft is not the player's control while series of aerobatic maneuvers are displayed. Manual Maneuvers can be performed without needing to fill any gauges. By selecting the desired maneuver with the Wii Nunchuck maneuvers such as the Immelman Turn, Chandelle and Barrel Roll are executed automatically. Against higher difficult enemies a TMC performed by a player can be countered by a Manual Maneuver or TMC done by the enemy. This system allows for cinematic dogfights to occur in-game, which put the game in line with the thrilling combat sequences seen in the Sky Crawlers movie.​
​​​​​Three years later, with the release of Ace Combat: Assault Horizon (October 11th, 2011) and Ace Combat Cross Rumble (aka Ace Combat Assault Horizon Legacy; November 15th, 2011) elements of the Tactical Maneuver Commands and Manual Maneuvers were extensively used or expanded upon for both releases. ​
Ace Combat Cross Rumble utilized the TMC in its entirety with minimal changes. The semi-automatic maneuvering system in this game is known as the Action Maneuver system which is separated into two parts. The first part is Attack Maneuvers. This is an exact copy of the TMC system from Sky Crawlers. It includes new cinematic camera angles, and aerobatic maneuvers such as Pugachev's Cobra. The range requirement for filling the Attack Maneuver gauge was changed to 1500 meters. Manual Maneuvers from Sky Crawlers were reworked to become Evasive Maneuvers for Cross Rumble. When a guided enemy missile closes within a specific range to the player aircraft, the Evasion Guide appears on the screen. This guide shows three directions the player use to perform a quick maneuver to evade the missile at the last second. By pressing the Y Button while inputting one of the directions suggested at the same time, a quick barrel roll or jink can be performed. Dogfights against high level enemies can result in a string of attack and evasion maneuvers to create a cinematic dogfight experience. ​The in-game tutorials for Action and Evasive maneuvers are provided below:
​​Project Aces expanded upon all of these concepts for Ace Combat: Assault Horizon with the introduction of the Close Range Assault (CRA). In particular, the air-to-air portion of CRA known as Dogfight Mode (DFM).
Dogfight Mode can be activated within a specified range, depending on the angle and direction of flight of the targeted aircraft. The portions of DFM that include the player automatically being placed behind their enemy and the Counter Maneuver systems are still closely tied to the Tactical Maneuver Command and Evasion Maneuver systems. In Assault Horizon's single-player campaign, DFM does not have cool down time and is also used fly players through pre-set action pieces, which feature falling buildings, flying through cities and plot-related events. Counter Maneuvers performed in DFM are an advanced version of the Evasion Maneuvers which turn the tables on pursuing allies. A sub-system of Counter Maneuvers also exists, called Counter-Counter Maneuvers. This sub-system allows the player a chance to destroy the counter maneuvering aircraft before it gets behind them. The complete Dogfight Mode enabled visually dynamic dogfights to be displayed even in online multiplayer game modes. ​​
The use of Dogfight Mode in player vs. player game modes and it having been required to shoot down certain enemies in the single player campaign are what ultimately created the most problems for Ace Combat: Assault Horizon. Because of the volume of negative reviews caused by DFM, any game mechanic related to the Close Range Assault system was removed from the next game in 2013, Ace Combat Infinity. This effectively made DFM the last iteration of a semi-automatic maneuvering system created by Project Aces.
​A new game mechanic for Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown (2018), is a fully player-controlled maneuvering system inspired by Counter Maneuvers from Assault Horizon's DFM. Known as Post Stall Maneuvers (PSM), it does not utilize any gauges or automatically moves the player behind their enemies. Instead, it relies on direct player input to the aircraft's position and airspeed. PSM reintroduces player skill level when performing highly advanced aviation maneuvers. ​
​​The aircraft tuning system in Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception was expanded upon in Sky Crawlers, allowing all aircraft to be modified with parts. Ace Combat X2: Joint Assault would be the first Ace Combat game to do the same thing.
​​​Elements of the HUD layout for Piston aircraft in Ace Combat Infinity are identical to those used in Sky Crawlers, with some extra gauges and a difference in their position being some of the few differences.
​With a few concepts in the Ace Combat series having been introduced within it, this unexpected Wii game is recommended for fans of Ace Combat. Though we have already experienced or are still learning about the concepts introduced in Sky Crawlers: Innocent Aces, experiencing it for oneself is always better than simply reading about it. It may have slipped under the radar for many of Project Aces' followers, but it continues to be a game worthy of a test flight by Ace Combat fans from around the world. ​​

After witnessing a certain article I will not stop posting on Reily Reid vids until I fuck her. Reily I want to fuck you so much I may not be the fattest ever but do not care. I'm from Massachusetts and contact me via Reddit same name freespiritedgamer.
Most recently, the question I get asked the most is how I edit my photos. I am not a photographer by trade and have never had any formal training. However, I am self taught with A LOT of trial and error, and also learned a great deal from my time working at Bloguettes. Believe it or not, I edit everything on my phone. It’s free and somehow so much easier for me. All my photos are taken on a Cannon 6D by either my husband or my mom, but this method of editing can be done on images from a DSLR OR from an iPhone just the same. But first, a few tips:
My first piece of advice is to spend some time and figure out exactly how you want your pictures to look. Go to Pinterest and Instagram and start saving all the images you love. After that, really narrow in on which colors and subjects best represent you or your brand. I LOVE really moody photos like @tyfrenchphoto and I also LOVE airy photos like @julahengel. But I had to decide for myself what style best resonates with me. And after some time (probably 1-2 years tbh), I think I’ve figured mine out.
Second, be consistent. Just because you love really colorful and bright images and also really textured images with shadows, choose one style and stick with it. A cohesive Instagram feed (and branding of any kind) is ALL about being consistent with your editing style.
If photography is your profession then obviously there are more efficient ways to do things. If this is the case, I highly recommend using the desktop version of Lightroom, and even using presets, especially if you are editing in bulk. But if your editing is for personal use, then this way might be helpful and applicable for you too!
LIGHT: I usually like it fairly bright so I will play with the “Light” menu option down at the bottom. Move the exposure and highlight to see what looks best depending on the image. I also like contrast so I bring the whites up a bit, and the blacks down a bit.
COLOR: Tap on the upper right hand corner where it says “MIX”. I almost always take down the yellow saturation and the blue saturation. Depending on the image I will also bring down the reds, oranges, and pinks a tiny bit. Click “DONE” and it will take you back to the main “Color” options. I always bring the temp up by at least by 28-30.
DETAIL: I take the “sharpening” tool up to at least 65-70, and the “noise reduction” up by 15-20. SAVE.
Now, I send the photo from Lightroom to the Picfx app for some filters (MAYBE $2 in the app store?? It has been so long since I bought it so I’m not sure, but it’s worth a few bucks I promise).
For fine tuning I send all my photos to Facetune 2 (Free in the app store). Please keep in mind that I keep the intensity VERY LOW on all edits I do through Facetune.
RETOUCH: I make whites a bit whiter. Then I run the “Details” over the focus of the image, and over my eyelashes or other details that I want to be darker. Then add “Glow” on the bridge of the nose/cheekbones to make the highlight pop.
PAINT: Depending on the photo, I will paint the sky a different color of blue, or add a bit of yellow if it is a sunset (since I took out all the blue and yellow in Lightroom earlier).
That’s it! I know its soo many steps for EACH PICTURE. But once you understand the look and feel that you are wanting to achieve, it starts to get really quick! I have grown to love it and it is now my favorite part of blogging/Instagramming.
What do you do if there is a “piece” of sun glare on your face?! How do you fix that so that it looks a bit better..? Thanks for all the tips!
I’m not sure what you mean! You can send me the picture if you want and I can try and edit it! anicarosecurtis@gmail.com

With most of my work going on ‘behind the scenes’ in travel technology, its not often that I get to write about specific projects that 2 Aardvarks has been involved with. I’m very pleased, therefore, to celebrate a new online booking module going live with the recent launch of the new Ramblers Holidays website.
Ramblers Holidays has had a real-time online booking facility since 2012. When this functionality was introduced, around 25% of the company’s total booking volume was transacted through the website from day one. This was rightly heralded as a great success, but over time, feedback started to come in from customers who were experiencing issues with the usability and performance of this part of the website.
The problem was that this original booking engine was a bolt-on to the existing legacy website, displayed in an iframe of that site – so a website within a website. There were some issues with handing data between the two sites, and also with the way the booking site behaved inside the main website – problems with scrolling, pop-ups and overlays, error messaging etc.From a user perspective, this often resulted in just getting completely stuck during the process, and it was almost impossible to use on a mobile.
We felt that the actual steps in the process were well designed – the stages were intuitive and the right amount of information was being collected. However, the other major area of feedback was performance. There was a long wait when entering the process (30-60 seconds depending on the complexity of the tour being booked), and another long wait before payment.
Ramblers Holidays decided to redevelop their main website in 2016, as part of a brand refresh exercise, and also to make the whole thing more mobile and tablet friendly. As part of this they decided to completely re-write the booking module and make it a more integral part of the website.
I have been involved with Ramblers Holidays for many years and have a good understanding of how their business operates from both an operational and a technical systems perspective. Richard Clowser, IT Manager at Ramblers Holidays, decided to bring the development and management of the website in-house, but needed some specific expertise on the interaction between the site and Travelink, the tour operator management software used by Ramblers.
Bookings are made in the Travelink system by both the Sales team, using the Travelink GUI, and the website using the Travelink API. It is essential that bookings from these two sources end up exactly the same. This means that all the behaviours that are controlled by the Travelink GUI, or are trained into the Sales staff, must be programmed into the online system as logic and rules.
My specific involvement in this project was to analyse and understand all those rules, and to encode how data was extracted from Travelink (using SQL queries and stored procedures), then written back into Travelink (using the Travelink API).
I realised early on that the amount of Travelink data required to display the user interface and make the booking was actually relatively small. The 30-60 second delay at the beginning of the process on the old booking engine was being caused by inefficient data calls to Travelink and then an overly complex layer of logic being applied to it by the the website. This was really because the site was having to use a large number of ‘out of the box’ Travelink API calls to make up the dataset that Ramblers needed and then patch it all together afterwards.
I decided to write a highly-optimised bespoke procedure that got all the data needed for the whole booking process in one shot, including as much of the logic as possible. This now takes only 3-4 seconds to run, which is a huge improvement from the 30-60 second delay that users were experiencing before. The whole data set is held and used by the booking module, then the Travelink API is engaged at the end of the process to write the bookings into Travelink.
This approach is slightly risky, in that the data is coming out of Travelink through one channel and going back using another, unrelated, channel. It requires that the two methods are 100% accurate and in sync. Thankfully, testing was extermely positive and only raised one or two edge case scenarios that needed to be tweaked.
Richard coded the application itself, and introduced responsive behaviour for mobile and tablet. We worked together to ensure that the application uses the right logic to present the user with the correct price and availability based on what options they select during the process.
So all-in-all, the new booking module is faster, more accurate, and an integral part of the new mobile-friendly website.
THE ant has had from time immemorial many enemies, and because he is small and destructive, there have been a great many slaughters among them. Not only were most of the birds their enemies, but Anteater lived almost wholly from them, and Centipede beset them every time and at all places when he had the chance.
So now there were a few among them who thought it would be well to hold council together and see if they could not come to some arrangement whereby they could retreat to some place of safety when attacked by robber birds and aninials.
There was Red-ant, Rice-ant, Black-ant, Wagtail-ant, Gray-ant, Shining-ant, and many other varieties. The discussion was a true babel of diversity, which continued for a long time and came to nothing.
A part desired that they should all go into a small hole in the ground, and live there; another part wanted to have a large and strong dwelling built on the ground, where nobody could enter but an ant; still another wanted to dwell in trees, so as to get rid of Anteater, forgetting entirely that there they would be the prey of birds; another part seemed inclined to have wings and fly.
And, as has already been said, this deliberation amounted to nothing, and each party resolved to go to work in its own way, and on its own responsibility.
Greater unity than that which existed in each separate faction could be seen nowhere in the world; each had his appointed task, each did his work regularly and well. And all worked together in the same way. From among them they chose a king-that is to say some of the groups did-and they divided the labor so that all went as smoothly as it possibly could.
But each group did it in its own way, and not one of them thought of protecting themselves against the onslaught of birds or Anteater.
The Red-ants built their house on the ground and lived under it, but Anteater leveled to the ground in a minute what had cost them many days of precious labor. The Rice-ants lived under the ground, and with them it went no better. For whenever they came out, Anteater visited them and took them out sack and pack. The Wagtail-ants fled to the trees, but there on many occasions sat Centipede waiting for them, or the birds gobbled them up. The Gray-ants had intended to save themselves from extermination by taking to flight, but this also availed them nothing, because the Lizard, the Hunting-spider, and the birds went a great deal faster than they.
When the Insect-king heard that they could come to no agreement he sent them the secret of unity, and the message of Work-together. But unfortunately he chose for his messenger the Beetle, and he has never yet arrived at the Ants, so that they are still to-day the embodiment of discord and consequently the prey of enemies.

A lonely walk home is intertwined with an underwater fantasy world. The combination between reality and fantasy is portrayed in a love letter addressed to an imaginary “perfect” man. The film displays a critical, female point of view on the idea of romantic modern love in western society. Its main purpose is to dismantle the “knight in shining armour” myth. It is made with a unique technique of screen-printed animation. Every 20 frames are printed in a grid formation on A3 paper, then scanned and cut to their original form as a running, 25 fps film.

Let’s be honest for a second. There are things that happen on this campus that straight up don’t make sense.
$1.4 million on a clock tower? Uh, why? Enforced meal plans and living requirements for first- and second-year students? Huh? What do you mean it’s $500 for a parking pass for campus?
If you’re a student at Ohio State, you’ve more than likely asked yourself these questions over and over again. But, if you’re Ricky Mulvey and Seth Shanley of the Ohio State Comedy Club, you don’t just simply ask yourself these questions—you go straight to the press and crack some jokes about it.
Mulvey wrote his first column for The Lantern, the student operated newspaper at Ohio State, about why students should be grateful about the new Tom W. Davis clock tower. As you can expect, some people saw the humor and others were unable to read between the lines. But in the satirical piece meant to poke fun came honest question of: Is there a better way we could’ve spent the $1.4 million? In short, the answer for Mulvey was abso-fucking-lutely.
Since then, Seth Shanley teamed up with Mulvey to join in on the fun. And as I sipped on my beer at Ethyl and Tank while I hung out with the two, Mulvey explained that he typically comes up with the story ideas while Shanley comes in to provide hilarious jokes and punchlines as well as keeping Mulvey grounded when it’s 4 a.m. and he’s calling Shanley because he’s heated about an occurrence. It’s a balance of yin and yang with a common love of satire and comedy at its core.
The guys have been firing off hot takes on things like meal plans being a cool way to screw students out of money and how the university will be giving students iPads after professors constantly complain about cell phone usage in class. And while these satirical pieces are nothing new to the news cycle, they coincide with recent uprise of social and political commentary on late night television. In a sense, Mulvey and Shanley are the OSU version of the Weekend Update circa Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers on Saturday Night Live.
Just like the great personalities on late night television today—think Stephen Colbert or John Oliver—the two don’t shy away from expressing how they feel about a topic on a large platform. Though these fiery opinions on a topic could be misconstrued as a sheer hate for the university, Mulvey and Shanley collectively agree they do this out of love for the university.
“One of the reasons we poke fun [at the university] or stick our finger in the eye of the administration a little bit in our articles is because we do love this place,” Mulvey explained. “We want people to challenge. I think for people to love something sometimes is to challenge it.”
So with that in mind, I decided to fire off some of campus’s biggest complaints—the buses, those damn bikers, parking—to have the comedians provide some insight on the madness.
First up was the parking situation on campus. Most of the complaints from this derive from the prices for a yearly parking spot. And the complaints come with justification; the average cost of a parking pass at Ohio State is $463.98. For Mulvey, his complaint is less about CampusParc and it’s pricing and more about how the university seems to be wiping its hands clean of an issue while raking in some serious cash.
“When you privatize parking, it’s easy for the university to wash their hands and say, ‘Yeah, you are paying more than you should, but it’s not our responsibility anymore,” Mulvey said. “So with parking I think it’s an example of the university both washing their hands of an issue and milking money while pretending it was a gift.”
On the other hand, university spokesperson Chris Davey told me via email that the university isn’t washing it’s hands of anything regarding parking and that the current agreement places limits on the growth of parking fees. He added the committee is made up of students, faculty, and staff that closely monitors the terms of the lease agreement.
Next was the hot topic of buses on campus. If you’ve ever been on this hip new social media place on the world wide web called Twitter, you’ve more than likely seen a tweet or two about how college students are fearless when it comes to crossing the street. Is a bus coming? Who cares, I have a final and getting hit by this bus means I don’t have to take it. For Mulvey, he thinks the joke is inconsiderate when you take into account most bus drivers are students just working their job. As for Shanley, he’s just tired of the lazy jokes.
“I’m all for Twitter jokes that are inconsiderate, but that one is just hacky,” Shanley said. “It’s like when someone quotes your tweets with, ‘I’m crying.’”
“We’re not against it because it’s inconsiderate. It’s like when people don’t know how to be funny so they just quote Will Ferrel from his older movies because they are like, ‘Oh! Well that’s funny!”
Lastly was the recent banning of all IFC fraternities on campus. For Mulvey, who is in a fraternity, he felt they deserved more of a due process about the situation. Just like prohibition, Mulvey said he thinks there will be an up-tick of smaller frats popping up around off-campus which makes it harder for the university to monitor. But, he’s taking it in stride and is staying on brand about it.
“I was thinking about writing a song. You know the song “Folsom Prison Blues” by Johnny Cash? ‘Well, I’m stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on.’” Mulvey sang in his deepest Johnny Cash voice he could muster. “I was thinking about doing a blues song called “Frat Boy Blues” about being suspended. ‘Well, I’m stuck on suspension…’”
So yeah, these takes are without a doubt hot. Some might even say burning fire red hot. But that’s just what you get when two comedians come together for social commentary.
Ahead of the Ohio State v. Michigan Game, the university has once again taken precautionary measures against the age-old tradition that claimed a student’s life in 2015. Mirror Lake has been temporarily drained to avoid any temptations students may...

Although alternative medicine is aimed at improving not only physical but also emotional and mental state, her methods continue to cause some of the questions that remain unanswered.
The basic principle underlying the many methods of alternative medicine is balance. Acupuncture, Wellness, tai Chi, and various toning exercises are aimed at bringing the body into balance, which in theory, helps to restore health. This principle is meant in the first place, choosing for himself the method of treatment.
What are the advantages of alternative medicine? First, it is a complete recovery. Traditional medicine treats disease as an independent “entity” lurked in the human body. The trend toward specialization in medicine has led not only to the development of successful treatment regimens, but also distanced doctors from the healthy bodies of their patients.

Everyone who is interested in healing wondered how you can learn to heal with your hands? Why did the hand heal? How does it work? Can all people equally effectively to perceive energy through the hands? Let’s try a little understanding in these matters. People with supernatural powers have the ability to cure diseases and various ailments. But you need to have a serious psychosomatic resistance, and develop your aura and spiritual energy.

Esoterica there are several key exercises that will help to curb the power of thought, presence of mind and neuroadrenaline energy, which is the reference power, acting through the hands.

Through his routine use of the apps employed for Tryst Pic, Moco is continually struck by the strict and unforgiving list of preferences presented in select online profiles. Stipulations such as “no fats” or “no femmes” are frequent and in Moco’s view, problematic. His latest project is his response to the body-shaming and insecurity-inducing nature of such profiles.
Bare is a series of nude portraits exploring diversity in the male form through photography. Representing a wide array of subjects in exposed states, the project embodies the vulnerability and beauty of embracing one’s Bare self. Amplifying the voices of his subjects, Moco invites you to listen to recordings of the men discussing their bodies and the state of being naked.
A portrait project that links photographer Adam Moco to gay men around the world for the sake of non-sexual connection.

The “hookups” range in duration and transpire in the subject’s personal space. By relying solely on natural and available light, Moco aims to create an open atmosphere whereby the subject’s unique personality is illuminated.

For a start I should probably explain that the name of Great Basin is rather misleading. By a basin most people understand a flat area surrounded by hills or mountains. In the case of the Great Basin it is a bit more complicated. For a start it is an absolutely huge region, not much smaller than the whole of Spain, but with a small population. The only real population centres are located on its edges. But more importantly it is not flat at all. In fact the Basin includes valleys, basins, lakes and mountain ranges of Basin and Range topography. For example driving the US Hwy 50 in Nevada includes crossing at least half a dozen substantial mountain ranges and the road often climbs up to 7000-8000 feet. (2100-2500m) above the sea level. They run parallel to each other and are roughly oriented from north to south.
That means that driving here is never boring. Yes, there are long straight stretches of open highways (perfect for testing the top speed of our rental Camaro) but there are also twisted mountain roads as well as great vistas from the higher elevations. All this with minimal traffic. In fact some of the lesser roads were virtually empty. For example when we chose Nevada Hwy 722, which for 65 miles bypasses the main highway to the south, we only encountered 3 or 4 vehicles.
If the landscape wasn’t wild enough then there was the weather. We were crossing the Basin at the same time as a cold front from the North Pacific stretched this way. That meant spectacular cloud formations, dark mysterious skies and snow. Yes we did experienced snowfall along with some freezing temperatures, especially crossing the mountain passes.
It took us the good part of the day to cross most of the Basin from Fallon in the west to the town of Ely, close to the Utah border in the east, where we decided to spend the night. On one hand we were mostly speeding but on the other hand we made plenty of photo stops. Probably too many judging from the number of pictures of the empty highways I now have on my laptop but it was damn difficult to stop taking pictures as the landscape kept changing every few minutes and the spectacular sky even more often.
In Ely we stayed in an old-school, family run motel and had a great breakfast in a local diner. It was probably one of the least touristy locations on our 3300miles road trip and I absolutely loved it. Sure there was a casino, located in what was once the tallest building in Nevada, but the whole town had picturesquely desolate feel (still not as desolate as some of the communities we passed like Austin or Eureka) and even the casino had a very provincial feel. It is all a far cry from the glitz of Vegas.
One thing not to miss in this fascinating little town is Nevada Northern Rail Museum located in East Ely Yards. It is definitely one of the best rail oriented museums I have ever visited. It displays steam engines (some still operational, used for excursion trains) diesel engines and even an electric one. It also has a steam operated crane, one of the few left in the world and the oldest in America.
But what was best was not the collection itself (which might be smaller than in some more established railway museums) but the feel of the place. After paying a small fee we could wander on our own pretty much everywhere including in the workshop where the engines are renovated. There were no ropes or barriers and we could climb pretty much anything. There were also no educational displays, instead plenty of tools just lying around and the place was dark, oily, dirty and dingy, the way the proper railway works should be. I absolutely loved it but at the same time I was really surprised that there was no one around to keep eye on us. We could literally drive off in one of the steam engines which was actually powered up in preparation for an excursion train in the afternoon, with no crew in sight. Maybe it was due to the early hour we were there but we honestly had the place to ourselves. Still we managed to stop ourselves from stealing a train…
We could have stayed in the museum for most of the day but it was time to move on as we wanted to finally do some walking. For that we chose the Great Basin National Park located about 60 miles SW of Ely near the tiny town of Baker. It is one of the least visited parks in the National Parks System and it was clearly visible. When, after a spectacular scenic drive from the gate, we finally reached the parking lot at our trail head, there were only three other cars (which were gone by the time we finished our walk). We started our hike at the elevation of about 10000 feet (just above 3000m) and at this elevation there was still snow on the trail (that could be reason why so few people were there that day). Luckily it was only a few inches and the weather was actually very nice with a perfect blue sky, decent temperature and no wind. We chose the Bristlecone-Glacier Trail which let us see the oldest living trees on the planet, the bristlecone pines. Some of them are well over 3000 years old and still growing but if you expect Sequoia sized giants you will be disappointed. These trees live so long because they grow incredibly slowly in their harsh environment. They are just few meters tall and look half dead but they are still amazing organisms. Their wood is so dense that it is resistant to insects, fungi or other pests. In fact it is so dense that it practically doesn’t rot, even after tree dies. The interpretive trail loops around the grove of these amazing trees but instead of heading straight back to the parking lot we decided to push along the Glacier Trail to see the Wheeler Peak Glacier. It is the only glacier in Nevada as well as one of the southernmost glaciers in the US and one of the closest to the desert. After Bristlecone Grove we quickly climbed above the tree line and entered the cirque under the mighty Wheeler Peak. From there the glacier (a rock glacier to be specific) was clearly visible in the distance. We could push all the way to it (probably no more than a mile) but at that point we decided that time might be an issue and we didn’t want to get stuck if the weather changed. So after reaching an elevation of about 11000 feet (3350m) we turned back. In total we hiked probably about 8km in glorious weather and with spectacular vistas all around. It was one of the best hikes I have done for quite a while.
From the fascinating Great Basin NP we headed towards southern Utah as the Grand Canyon was our next destination. But there was still quite a lot of basin driving in front of us. By now the sky was clear (unlike the previous day) the sun was low and landscape looked more spectacular with every minute. I was really hoping that this day would never end. But finally the sun set and we arrived to the town of Parowan where we effectively ended our wanderings around this absolutely fascinating region.

I've always held the attitude that I have no real enemies or strangers in my life ... just friends I haven't met yet. As mentioned in the Jimmy Bowskill review, I recently changed positions in my day job and I now work in Peterborough, Ontario. Now that I'm spending large amounts of time in Peterborough, I am now realizing what fertile musical ground exists in this part of Canada.
At my workplace I've made a new friend in John. John is a great guy, very knowledgeable about a lot of things and is always up for a good conversation about two of his greatest loves in life, that being hockey and music. They happen to be two of my greatest loves in life as well, so we hit it off well in this regard. We have had many conversations about the state of music, the quality of singers, the value of being a singer-songwriter, and most importantly, who we're really in to musically.
John is great friends with a local performer in the Peterborough area named Uncle Jim. Uncle Jim is a veteran of the Peterborough music scene and has a steady gig at one of the finer local establishments in town called Elements. This past Saturday, John mentioned that if I wasn't doing anything and would like to see a great show, come on up to Elements and check out Uncle Jim. The bonus in all of this, was that Uncle Jim's daughter was also going to be on the show and she is a singer and musician "that will just blow you away." This was the second such time John had mentioned Jim's daughter and that she was incredible, so something told me it Peterborough was the place to be the next night.
And so it was on Saturday that my lovely lady and I made our way up to Peterborough to Elements to see this family in action. Little did we know that we were going to see one of the most uniquely talented up-and-coming performers I have ever seen.
When John introduced me to Uncle Jim, it was just before the show was set to begin. We greeted each other with a warm handshake and Jim was clear on this evening that he was setting the stage for his daughter to go up and take the mike. While he may have made his intention clear to me, I want to be clear that Uncle Jim is no slouch on stage. He is an excellent singer, songwriter and first-rate blues musician, as he so capably demonstrated playing the blues on guitar and harmonica at the same time. I'm always thrilled and impressed when I see something like that. I once played guitar and tried to sing at the same time ... it was a trainwreck. I have no idea how people play two instruments fluently at once, but thank God they can do it. It's a credit to the art when people can perform such a task.
Following Uncle Jim's first thirty minute set, the gushing father turned the stage over to his daughter Billi. Opening with a Ray Lamontagne number, this young lady had the hair on the back of my neck standing up by the time she hit the fifth word of that song. Billi Cope is arguably the finest, most talented up-and-coming star that has not been discovered. I had the great pleasure of meeting Billi briefly before and after her first set. My assessment of Billi is that she is a singer, songwriter, musician and artist of the highest order. Her guitar playing is among the best I've seen, clearly the beneficiary of growing up in a musical family. Perhaps it was those surroundings that gave Billi the skill to develop a strong set list which flowed from solid covers of the aforementioned Lamontagne to Tracey Chapman and a stellar version of John Prine's "Angel From Montgomery", to original material such as the mournful true story of "Josh's Song." Simply put, Billi Cope is the real deal. This girl is going to be a star. I may not be the only one who senses that fact.
As I was watching Billi perform, I caught a glimpse of Uncle Jim out of the corner of my eye. I could see this proud father wiping away a tear as he witnessed his daughter holding the crowd in the palm of her hand and guiding them through her songbook. I believe the day is coming soon where we won't be able to see Billi perform at Elements anymore. Rather, she will be performing on the stage next door at the Showplace Theatre in front a much deserved larger gathering.
I agree totally agree with your comments about my uncle Jim my mom's brother and Billi. Uncle Jim has brought music to my life and all his family since i can remember.There has been many a night sitting at his feet as he played and sang for us all.
Billi has a great chance to make herself well known across the country and I wish her all the best in her dreams and goals, keep strumming cousin!!!!!
I had the pleasure of being acquainted with Billi through the music scene in Waterloo, about 15 years ago now. Her voice and presence are unique.
I was lucky to have heard Billi sing as a young girl of 11. Even then she had a unique sound and was developing a stage presence of somebody so comfortable in this environment. When we heard Billi was coming into town for Father's Day, and was going to perform with Uncle Jim, we made the spontaneous decision to drive up to Peterborough to hear her. My partner Keith is a longtime musician (drummer), who has played in bands since the 70's. He was blown away with Billi's sound and style. My background being dance (Ballroom), and I was really impressed with not only her fabulous voice, and presence, but her musicality. From the moment she stepped onto the stage she had the crowd in the palm of her hand. She has a natural grace and is comfortable performing. It is so blatantly obvious that music is her thing, and she's very aware of her audience. We will definitely be seeing big things to come for Billi Cope in the near future.
Yes, I too have had the honor of hearing and seeing and also knowing Billi, and she is AMAZING!! There is so much emotion in her singing that is grabs you by the throat and hangs on until the show/song is over. Billi has worked so hard, and deserves all the recognition and success in the world.

You are here: Home / What is American Board of Optometry Board Certification? / Board Certification Examination Candidate Guide / Prometric Regulations
During an exam, candidates are monitored continuously via video, physical walk-through, and observation window. All testing sessions are video and audio recorded.
You must present valid, unexpired identification in order to take your test. Validity and number of IDs required are predetermined by the test sponsor.
Each time you leave the exam room, you must sign out on the test center roster. You must sign back in and show your ID to the Test Center Administrator (TCA) to be readmitted to the test room.
You are prohibited from communicating, publishing, reproducing, or transmitting any part of your test, in any form or by any means, verbal or written, for any purpose.
You must not talk to other candidates or refer to their screens, testing materials, or written notes in the test room.
You must not use written notes, published materials, or other testing aids, except those allowed by your test sponsor. (The TCA will refer to the applicable client practice for allowances.)
Clothing and jewelry items worn in the test room must remain on you at all times. Removed clothing or jewelry must be stored in your locker.
You must not bring any unauthorized items into the testing room. Such items include, but are not limited to, outerwear, hats, food, drinks, purses, briefcases, notebooks, pagers, watches, cellular telephones, recording devices, and photographic equipment. Weapons are not allowed at any Prometric Testing Center. You will be asked to empty and turn your pockets inside out prior to every entry into the test room to confirm that you are not in possession of prohibited items.
You must comply with the policy of your test sponsor regarding the use of phones during scheduled breaks in your test.
Your test may have either scheduled or unscheduled breaks that are determined by your test sponsor. The TCA can inform you what is permitted during these breaks.
Repeated or lengthy departures from the test room for unscheduled breaks will be reported by the TCA.
During a break, if you need an item stored in your test center locker, such as food or medicine, you must inform the TCA before you retrieve the item. You are not allowed to access any prohibited item, as defined by the client practice applicable for the test you are taking.
You must conduct yourself in a civil manner at all times on the premises of the testing center. Abusive behavior toward the TCA or any other test center staff may result in criminal prosecution.
To protect the privacy of all testers, the TCA neither confirms nor denies whether any particular individual is scheduled or present at the test center.
Rank is the position in the list of names ordered by total (eg, a rank of 1 means that it's the most common name, and a rank of 10 means it's the tenth most common, etc).
'N/A' indicates that we don't have data for this name (usually because it's quite uncommon and our stats don't go down that far). It doesn't mean that there's no-one with that name at all!
For less common surnames, the figures get progressively less reliable the fewer holders of that name there are. This data is aggregated from several public lists, and some stats are interpolated from known values. The margin of error is well over 100% at the rarest end of the table!
For less common surnames, the frequency and "per million" values may be 0 even though there are people with that name. That's because they represent less than one in a million of the population, which ends up as 0 after rounding.
It's possible for a surname to gain in rank and/or total while being less common per million people (or vice versa) as there are now more surnames in the USA as a result of immigration. In mathematical terms, the tail has got longer, with a far larger number of less common surnames.
Figures for top states show firstly the states where most people called FALSO live. This obviously tends to be biased towards the most populous states. The second set of figures show where people called FALSO represent the biggest proportion of the population. So, in this case, there are more people called FALSO in New York than any other state, but you are more likely to find a FALSO by picking someone at random in Rhode Island than anywhere else.
This does not necessarily imply a direct relationship between the names, but may indicate names that could be mistaken for this one when written down or misheard.
Matches are generated automatically by a combination of Soundex, Metaphone and Levenshtein matching.
The following words are slight variants of FALSO that are likely to be possible typos or misspellings in written material.

Why I Think This World Should End by Prince Ea It’s almost a certain guarantee that most of the people who watched this video are going to do the same exact thing they did today… tomorrow. But if we can change our ways of thinking, open our minds to new realities, maybe we can effect change in this world. This amazing video was done by Prince Ea (also known as Richard Williams), an American rapper and activist. His work left me in profound thought. In this particular video he talks about the way we live now, what we care about and what we have forgotten. “And the path towards a new beginning starts within you”. The world is coming to an end The air is polluted, the oceans contaminated The animals are going extinct, the economy’s collapsed Education is shot, police are corrupt Intelligence is shunned and ignorance rewarded The people are depressed and angry We can’t live with each other and we can’t live with ourselves So everyone’s medicated We pass each other on the streets And if we do speak it’s meaningless robotic communication More people want 15 seconds of fame Than a lifetime of meaning and purpose Because what’s popular is more important than what’s right Ratings are more important than the truth Our government builds twice as many prisons than schools It’s easier to find a Big Mac than an apple And when you find the apple It’s been genetically processed and modified Presidents lie, politicians trick us Race is still an issue and so is religion Your God doesn’t exist, my God does and he is All-Loving If you disagree with me I’ll kill you Or even worse argue you to death 92% of songs on the radio are about sex Kids don’t play tag, they play twerk videos The average person watches 5 hours of television a day And it’s more violence on the screen than ever before Technology has given us everything we could ever want And at the same time stolen everything we really need Pride is at an all time high, humility, an all time low Everybody knows everything, everybody’s going somewhere Ignoring someone, blaming somebody Not many human beings left anymore, a lot of human doings Plenty of human lingerings in the past, not many human beings Money is still the root of all evil Yet we tell our kids don’t get that degree The jobs don’t pay enough... read more
Some of the world’s biggest, most profitable corporations enjoy a far lower tax rate than you do–that is, if they pay taxes at all. The most egregious example is General Electric. Last year they generated $10.3 billion in pretax income, but ended up owing nothing to Uncle Sam. In fact, it recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 billion. How did this happen? It’s complicated. GE in effect consists of two divisions: General Electric Capital and everything else. The everything else–maker of engines, power plants, TV shows and the like–would have paid a 22% tax rate if it was a standalone company. It’s GE Capital that keeps the overall tax bill so low. Over the last two years, GE Capital has displayed an uncanny ability to lose lots of money in the U.S. (posting a $6.5 billion loss in 2009), and make lots of money overseas (a $4.3 billion gain). Not only do the U.S. losses balance out the overseas gains, but GE can defer taxes on that overseas income indefinitely. It’s the tax benefit of overseas operations that is the biggest reason why multinationals end up with lower tax rates than the rest of us. Can you believe that GE not only pays no taxes, they actually get credit from the US government? They ship US jobs overseas and then reap huge tax benefits as a result. What’s wrong with this picture? And they are not the only corporations paying little or no tax at all. Now you know! Are you awake Yet?

Just another corrupt politician who will get away with deceiving the American people. And you people keep voting them into office. Hillary Clinton deleted all her emails. There are no longer any copies of tens of thousands of emails from Hillary Clinton’s time as secretary of state. Secretary Clinton decided to permanently delete all emails from her server when the Department of State asked the Secretary to return her public record to the Department. The committee had issued a broad subpoena to Clinton asking for her communications related to the attack. In his statement, Gowdy noted the committee did not receive additional emails from Clinton even after her team asked for a two week extension on his subpoena. The State Department has already turned over approximately 300 of Clinton’s emails that were related to the attacks to the committee. Earlier this month, the New York Times revealed Clinton exclusively used a private address. This is a violation of federal recordkeeping regulations as well as a security risk. Clinton and her team have maintained she turned over all relevant correspondence when she was requested to do so by the State Department. They have also claimed she copied government addresses on all official correspondence, which would have ensured it was kept on State Department servers. Not only was the secretary the sole arbiter of what was a public record, she also summarily decided to delete all emails from her server, ensuring no one could check behind her analysis in the public interest. And you let these people run our country. Are you awake Yet? As a reader you deserve to know the truth behind the disasters America and the rest of the world faces.

“Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but for me, give me liberty, or give me death!” Patrick Henry’s passionate declaration for independence from Britain is widely acknowledged as the catalyst for the convention’s decision to deliver Virginian troops to help fight the Revolutionary War. “Liberty or death!” became the rallying cry throughout the colonies. Not all, but enough of the founding generation cared enough to risk their lives fighting the War for Independence. To them, it indeed amounted to a choice between liberty or death. Much has changed since. Today, most Americans clearly care for many things other than liberty. If this were not true, Americans would by now have thrown off the chains of the Federal Reserve. Likewise for the fear-mongered, liberty-suppressing “wars” on drugs, terror, poverty, etc., and the host of other policies, programs, agencies, bureaucracies, and departments comprising the unsustainable American welfare/warfare state. “Fear is the passion of slaves” said Henry. By and large then, are Americans not slaves? Are Americans not afraid of liberty itself? “When the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different: Liberty, sir, was the primary object.” By 1775, the trend was running away from liberty. Patrick Henry’s generation helped slow it, if only temporarily. How do Britain’s punitive “Intolerable Acts” (or “Coercive Acts”), imposed upon the colonies – the final straw of-sorts before revolution – stack up to today’s abuses against Americans by their federal government? The lying, the spying, the inflation, the taxes, the regulations, the wars, the groping by the TSA at airports, the domestic militarization, the multitudinous assaults on civil liberties and the pervasive disdain and utter disrespect for private property and voluntary economic transactions? If alive today Henry would be the first to thunder “Liberty or death!” “I know of no way of judging the future but by the past.” If Henry is correct, then something in the near-future, as in early 1775, has to give, no? Patrick Henry is correct. He was guided by knowledge of the past – by experience: “I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.” Here, Diogenes the Cynic is evoked. He was banished from Sinope for debasing the currency, but found a redemption-of-sorts in part by carrying a lamp in broad... read more
For those that didn’t get the memo, there is nothing real about the Federal Reserve. It is neither federal nor reserve. There also is nothing real about the U.S. Dollar anymore. It’s no more real than BitCoins, that popular cyber ‘money.’ In 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was fraudulently pushed through Congress, Congressman Charles Lindbergh stated: “This Act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth….When the President signs this Act, the invisible government by the money power, proven to exist by the Money Trust Investigation, will be legalized….The new law will create inflation whenever the trust wants inflation….From now on, depression will be scientifically created.” Most people assume that the Federal Reserve Bank is federal–that is, part of the united States’ government. However, the Ninth Circuit Court put that issue to rest in 1982 when they ruled: “Examining the organization and function of the Federal Reserve Banks, and applying the relevant factors, we conclude that the Reserve Banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of the FTCA, but are independent, privately-owned and locally controlled corporations.” [Lewis vs. U.S., 680 F. 2d 1239, 1241] Today, we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are U.S. government institutions. They are not government institutions. They are private credit monopolies; domestic swindlers, rich and predatory money lenders which prey upon the people of the united States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers. The Federal Reserve Banks are the agents of the foreign central banks. The truth is the Federal Reserve Board has usurped the Government of the United States by the arrogant credit monopoly which operates the Federal Reserve Board. In the united States we have, in effect, two governments….We have the duly constituted Government….Then we have an independent, uncontrolled and uncoordinated private government in the Federal Reserve System, operating the money powers which are reserved to Congress by the Constitution. They problem though… The Federal Reserve is not part of government. They just want you to think it is. Most Americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international money lenders….The accounts of the Federal Reserve System have never been audited. It operates outside the control of Congress and….manipulates the credit of the united States. Article I, Section 10 of the united States’ Constitution states: “No State shall…make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts.”... read more

Power Plant derives from dagga, the sativa-dominant pot grown in South Africa and its neighboring countries. South African varieties are famous for their fast growth and early finish, in contrast to the slow growing season required by most tropical sativas. Flexible and adaptive, Power Plant grows well indoors, whether in soil or hydro, multi-branched or in a sea of green. Power Plant’s foliage stays olive green with thin, seven-point leaves. Her strong, pungent smell may require odor control in regions where inconspicuousness is a must.
This power sativa’s smoke tastes sharp and lights up the neural networks after a few hits. Many sativa highs can be sustained during a serious working day, but Power Plant may prove too strong for work settings. Instead, she’s rocket fuel for a launch at 4:20 pm or later.

For me, the most exciting thing about New Year is the resolution that I make. I stay so confident when I make these resolutions. Do you know why? Because I always believe that I will be able to keep them. But things never turn the way I want them to. So, few days before 2017, I have surveyed to know the real reason behind such failure and how we can avoid them in future. After seeing the response to the survey, I have noticed that not many people are different than me; I will share the result of the survey with you. Analysis of Survey Conducted About New Year Resolution The age group of the participants of the survey lied between 13 to 30 years. 50% of the participants didn’t keep any New Resolution this year (2016). We will exclude the people who have no resolution because they a

After you register your business, you may need to get an employer identification number (EIN) from the IRS. While this is not required for sole proprietorships with no employees, you may want to apply for one anyway to keep your personal and business taxes separate, or simply to save yourself the trouble later on if you decide to hire someone else. The IRS has provided a checklist to determine whether you will require an EIN to run your business. If you do need an EIN, you can register online for free.
Despite the relatively easier access to capital that a franchise owner enjoys, there are many different elements to think about before purchasing a franchise. Each franchise is operated differently and will come with its own set of operating and start-up costs. When considering pursuing franchise business financing, here are a few things for you to think about:
In Canada, you can get a free credit report by contacting one of the two credit reporting agencies, TransUnion or EquiFax Canada. To receive your free credit report you will need to mail or fax one of these companies a request along with copies of two pieces of I.D. Note that you will not be able to get a free credit report through the website of either company; you will be charged a fee for an online report. CreditKarma provides free online credit reports through much of Canada.
StumbleUpon recently published an excellent business plan guide; also consider reviewing startup information provided by the IRS. Help from experienced mentors is free through organizations such as SCORE, an organization of volunteer business mentors who provide specific advice and resources to newly created and growing businesses on a no-cost basis. There are many other organizations, such as your local chamber of commerce, that can also provide mentoring and guidance.
A lockbox advance is a high risk merchant cash advance using a credit card split, but the way its split is different than a conventional MCA advance. When a lockbox is involved, all deposits are put into a new bank account setup by the funder, where the funder will then collect its share of the daily batches, and then release to the merchant. The process is a bit slower, taking up to 24 hours for the money to hit the merchant’s account.
In case of microloans or loan guarantee program which is the 7a term loans, we can show how you can get approved to get a small business loan without collateral. Unsecured business loans are rare but possible through the SBA. In case of disaster recovery loans, the damaged property or asset will be used as collateral. In fixed asset loans backed by the SBA, the procurement itself is a form of security considered by the lenders.
1. Understand how credit works. There is such a thing as a business credit score, which factors in things like whether your business makes late payments or is in debt. Be sure to also remember that as a business owner, you basically are the credit representative of your company. Your personal credit score, factoring in things from credit cards to car payments, is a big factor when a bank is deciding whether or not to lend. Don’t lose heart; there are positive things you can do to build up credit.
To ensure success for both entrepreneurs and investors, Plum Alley requires businesses that crowdfund to secure at least 30 percent of their goal during a one-week “private” campaign before opening the crowdfunding to the public. This ensures investors that the business already has some financing, making it more likely they will reach their goal since research indicates that businesses who get 30 percent of their funding goal within the first 48 hours of crowdfunding have the most success.
Loans backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) are a favorite of franchisees, since they tend to have higher limits and lower rates than commercial loans. However, SBA loans come with strict requirements, including the need to prove that you don’t have the ability to obtain a loan from traditional lenders. Partner institutions disburse and administer the loans with SBA approval and application requirements tend to be quite extensive.
Make sure you do your research before diving into any franchise brand by checking out the International Franchise Association or the SBA Franchise Directory. Read a franchise disclosure document carefully before signing any franchise agreement, and be sure you’re ready to commit a relationship with the franchise brand of your choice. Happy applying and best of luck buying a franchise!
2. Get a website. In today’s technology-based world, the first thing a potential customer or employee does is Google your business. You need a website to show you’re real and to offer information about your business to potential customers. Make sure your website is mobile-friendly and be sure to ask for search engine optimization. Use Google Analytics to track the traffic to your website, but be leery of people who promise you top positions on search engines. While there are lots of things that can be done to increase your ranking on various search engines, unless the developer works for Google, I would be leery of a promise to get you to the top. Remember that you get what you pay for. There are a ton of do it yourself website services, but depending on the features you need on your site, some things are better left to the experts.
Most lenders are interested in how long you've been at a certain job or lived in the same location, and whether you have a record of finishing what you start. If your past record doesn't show a history of stability, then be prepared with good explanations. Not only is the amount of income you earn important but so is your ability to live within that income. Some people earn $100,000 a year and still can't pay their debts, while others budget nicely on $20,000 a year.
We also specialize in opening new franchise locations. Some of our franchise clients have used franchise financing to cover franchise fees, pay for new equipment upfront, or prevent weekly deductions from damaging profits during slow or busy periods. Franchise financing can act as a cushion for monthly expenses and make it possible to grow existing locations on schedule after opening new ones.
Remember that a business is franchised for two reasons: to expand the business and to raise capital. So if you have a reasonably good credit record and pass all the financial requirements, most franchisors will bend over backwards to get you on the team. The help that franchisors provide to help you get financing usually includes assistance with business plans and introductions to lending sources. In many cases, franchisors serve as guarantors of loans you take out.
SBA.gov is the website for the Small Business Association. Founded in 1953, the SBA functions as an independent agency of the federal government whose mission, according to their website, is “to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small business concerns, to preserve free competitive enterprise and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our nation.” One way the SBA helps small businesses is by offering financial assistance through three programs: the guaranteed loan program, surety bonds program and venture capital program.
There are many financing options for your franchise, but making the right choice is critical to your success. ApplePie understands the complexity and time constraints that you face in securing capital. That's why we’ve created a transformative lending network to suit your financial needs, maximizing flexibility and reducing the headaches and inefficiency of working separately across individual lenders.
If you’re like the majority of new startups, cash flow will be your primary concern. You can have the best business plan in the world, but it won’t be of any use if you don’t have the money to keep the lights on while you’re getting your feet on the ground. With this, it’s important to know what resources are available to make the initial growth period a lot easier.
To find out the best ways for new business owners to secure loans, I consulted with experts who have a wide range of experience with funding businesses including Jared Hecht, CEO of the online lending website Fundera, David J. Hall from the Small Business Association, Hal Shelton who is a SCORE mentor and author of The Secrets to Writing a Successful Business Plan (Summit Valley Press 2014) and Larry Conley, Senior Vice President and Specialty Finance National Manager for Chase bank.
If you are under age 59 and your IRA is one of your largest assets, you still may be able to take advantage of this avenue without accruing the 10-percent penalty associated with early withdrawal. By taking Substantial Equal Periodic Payments spread over a minimum of five years, based on your life expectancy, and a set of annuity tables published by the IRS, you can eliminate the 10-percent penalty, although the money is still taxable.
As with other small businesses, finding financing for a new franchise can be one of the biggest challenges owners face. Some financing options are unique to franchises, such as franchisor discounts on fees and online financing companies that cater to franchises. General business financing options such as traditional and Small Business Administration loans are also available to franchisees.
One basic way to protect proprietary company information is through the use of a Confidentiality and Invention Assignment Agreement. This type of agreement deals with confidentiality issues, but can also ensure that the ideas, work product, and inventions the employee creates that are related to company business belong to the company—not the employee.
If you are an expanding business and need money for relocation and/or renovation, you’ll be looking for a term loan, which is essentially a lump sum of cash that will be paid back within a set amount of time. Depending on what you expect for the long-term when you are in a growth stage, you may be looking for investors rather than lenders at this point.

We will continue to work to help other states end the practice of pound seizure, whereby animals in shelters can be claimed by licensed institutions for experimentation purposes.
The Animal Rights Coalition is pleased to announce that Greg Kiefer has joined ARC as the new ARC Volunteer and Outreach Coordinator, and that Chelsea Hassler is staying on board as ARC Program Director. Greg has been an effective, capable, and well-liked volunteer at ARC and brings many skills that will help expand our activism and outreach. In the year Chelsea has been with ARC, she has proven herself a dedicated, reliable, and passionate leader and has grown our outreach efforts significantly.
From helping people transition to a plant-based diet to publicizing the abuse of animals in laboratories to educating the public about the exploitation of animals used in entertainment, ARC’s unique and innovative education and outreach programs reach thousands of people every year. We are confident that Chelsea and Greg will do a great job of leading this work to end the suffering, abuse, and exploitation of animals.
A lifelong animal advocate in our community has incurred massive debt from legal fees for rescuing a starving and abused dog. One of her dear friends and the Animal Rights Coalition are hosting several rummage sales to help defray these costs.
Please bring friends, family, acquaintances. You get the picture – bring one, bring all. There will be lots of new and gently used household items, companion animal items, framed art, and more. First fundraiser is on Saturday, 10/24 from 10:00-4:00 at Minnehaha Free Space, 3747 Minnehaha Ave. in Minneapolis.
Read THE ARREST and COURT STORY of the rescue of a starving and abused dog and learn about what’s wrong with our system of humane enforcement in Minnesota. This dog was failed on so many levels. What is it going to take to get authorities in our state to enforce the laws that the Minnesota legislature has passed in good faith – the same laws that these authorities take an oath to enforce?
It is with a mixture of sadness and gratitude that we announce that Dallas Rising will be stepping down as the Animal Rights Coalition’s Executive Director as of October 15, 2015. For the past seven years, Dallas has been the public face of ARC, initiating new programs, growing existing programs, and carrying out ARC’s mission of ending the suffering, abuse, and exploitation of non-human animals through information, education, and advocacy. Dallas has also demonstrated a strong commitment to fighting all forms of oppression and reducing ARC’s environmental impact. We sincerely thank Dallas for her dedication to ARC and wish her well in her future endeavors.
In the nearly eight years I’ve worked at ARC, I have had the privilege to have my day job support my life long dream and mission to be a serious and powerful force for animals.
I have had the great honor of getting to know and work with some of the best people I’ve ever met because of my position here. I’ve formed some deep and lasting friendships and learned a lot from the courageous, committed, and creative people who volunteer their time and talents for animals via ARC. I have especially enjoyed working with my colleague, Chelsea, who brings such kindness, talent, and wit to our work.
It is for these reasons that I announce my resignation as Executive Director at the Animal Rights Coalition with mixed emotions. I threw myself into it with as much passion and heart as I could, and it’s hard to leave something I’ve put so much of myself into. But it’s time.
My last day is October 15th and I will be staying in the Twin Cities. I look forward to opportunities to continue to serve animals in another capacity and hope to cross paths with many of you again in the future. In the mean time, I will be spending more time with my family, giving extra care and attention to our aging and ailing boys, Max and Taz.
While many people jump at the opportunity to get close to animals by buying exotic animal rides at fairs and fests, they probably wouldn’t if they knew about the suffering the animals endure being treated as amusement park attractions.
Much of the violence isn’t seen by the public because the owners of these operations know that people would be enraged if they knew how these animals are punished and beaten into submission. They have to make the elephants avoidant to punishment so that they will behave in front of spectators.
These animals are chained for many hours every day. They are trucked around the country in small trailers or trucks. If they were allowed to live in the wild, they would have extensive social networks and travel miles upon miles every day. But when they’re sentenced to being “rides”, they have to plod in boring circles day after day with hundreds of pounds on their backs, for hour upon boring, uncomfortable hour.
Join us in protest Saturday, October 3rd from 10am-12 noon. We will meet at the Highway 169 entrance at 3525 145th Street West in Shakopee. Signs will be provided, as will literature to hand out. All you need to do is show up with your sunscreen on and water in hand. If you’d like to carpool from the ARC office in south Minneapolis, please post in the Facebook event.
Krissy is one of the elephants forced to walk in circles all day with people on her back at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival. Krissy is 26 years old. She was taken from the wild as a baby and since then has endured brutal beatings, electric shocks, and spent most of her life in chains.
This is Mike Swain, son of Bill Swain, the owner of Trunks and Humps, the supplier for the elephant rides at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival. You can see Mike Swain beating Krissy, viciously dragging her to the ground with a hook, and kicking her in the face. This video was taken when Mike Swain, Krissy, and Boo were with Bailey Bros. Circus. Krissy is now “owned” by Bill Swain and Texas-based Trunks and Humps.
The Minnesota Renaissance Festival needs to know that this is unacceptable. Join our demonstration on Sunday, September 6 from noon-2:00 p.m. Meet at the Highway 169 entrance at 3525 145th Street West in Shakopee. Carpool will also be available from the ARC office. Signs will be provided, as will literature to hand out. All you need to do is show up with your sunscreen on and water in hand. More details at Minnesota Animal Rights Meetup.
When an intelligent, social, endangered elephant is reduced to an amusement park ride, it degrades us all in light of what we know about their complex needs. Elephants move in big, open spaces, live in large herds, and show compassion for family members. Camels also travel for miles a day in the open desert and have extensive social networks in the wild. In contrast, wild animals used for rides endure confinement, long journeys in cramped vehicles, brutal control methods, and physical violence.You can help end this abuse.
Many people haven’t thought about animal rides from the animals’ point of view. These incredible creatures are carted from one location to another and then prodded to walk in circles day after day after day. Even the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns, “You always put yourself at risk when you go near an elephant, no matter how good the trainer/handler and elephant appear to be.” This is because elephants are wild animals who are forced to comply with their handlers’ demands by force, and sometimes they will reach a limit, resist their captors, and revolt.
Yet, despite their knowledge of the inherent cruelty and danger, the Minnesota Renaissance Festival continues to feature exotic animal rides. Call the Ren Fest promoter, Mid-America Festivals, at 952-445-7361 or email them at info@mafestivals.com and let them know many festivals have dropped these rides and you’d like them to be next.
Join our protest on Sunday, August 30th from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. to raise awareness about these rides. Meet at the Highway 169 entrance to the festival at 3525 145th Street West in Shakopee. Find more details at Minnesota Animal Rights Meetup
Sit out on the rides, not on the animals; there are lots of ways to have a great time at the fest without hurting animals!
Jane Goddall said it best: “I was shocked and outraged to hear the story of Cecil, Zimbabwe’s much loved lion. Not only is it incomprehensible to me that anyone would want to kill an endangered animal (fewer than 20,000 wild lions in Africa today) but to lure Cecil from the safety of a national park and then to shoot him with a crossbow…? I have no words to express my repugnance. He was not even killed outright, but suffered for hours before finally being shot with a bullet. And his magnificent head severed from his wounded body. And this behaviour is described as a “sport.” Only one good thing comes out of this – thousands of people have read the story and have also been shocked. Their eyes opened to the dark side of human nature. Surely they will now be more prepared to fight for the protection of wild animals and the wild places where they live. Therein lies the hope.”
Honor Cecil by taking action: Write to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service immediately to urge them to issue a final rule listing the lion as “Threatened” and stopping all trophy imports.
The Animal Rights Coalition hopes that Cecil’s murder will not only open peoples’ eyes to the senseless killing of wild animals for “sport”, whether that be lions in Africa or bears in Minnesota, but that it will also cause people to think about all of the animals killed daily, whether for sport, supposed entertainment, or a temporary craving for a hamburger. Consider moving to a plant-based diet and make the world a more peaceful place, both for yourself and for the animals.
Growth. Innovation. Opportunity. 2014 was a year of strategic expansion for ARC. We saw victories and growth in our programs and campaigns to help animals. We experimented with new ideas for outreach via social media online, tried out new events and venues for in-person outreach, and improved our volunteer program with formal training for volunteers in specific areas of outreach. We learned a lot and we’re putting that new knowledge to work right now.
We want to thank our volunteers and donors for your gifts of time and funds in 2014. You are the backbone of the work we do. None of what we accomplish could be done without you. Our organization is only as extraordinary as those who support us. Together we’ll continue to think outside the box and learn and grow, putting each new lesson to work as we reshape the world for animals. Please check out our 2014 Annual Report to see what we accomplished for animals with your help.
Chicken Run Rescue recently rescued a handsome rooster named Turnip from St. Paul and 7 hens from a cruelty confiscation in Minneapolis. Turnip was lucky. CRR was able to place him, but the next discarded boy may not be so lucky.
If you live in St. Paul, let your city council member know that St. Paul’s rooster ban needs to be lifted as the ban is a death sentence for roosters who represent 50% of the chicks hatched for the backyard chicken fad.
Turnip and most of the hens lost part of their combs and a few toes to frostbite. The standards for care in both cities need to be improved and enforced. If the Cities are going to allow chickens, they need to step up to their responsibilities.

Signing of the Memorandum of understanding on the supply and financial lease of a 45 passenger aircraft
The Russian leasing company Ilyushin Finance Co, the United Aircraft-building Corporation (UAC) and the Atlant-Soyuz air carrier have signed a memorandum of understanding on the supply and financial leasing of 45 passenger aircraft.
Under the arrangement Atlant-Soyuz will have 30 regional Antonov-148 planes and 15 medium-haul Tu-204 airliners. The leasing contract is to be concluded by September 1, 2009.
An-148 will be handed over to the client over a period of three years, starting from 2010, and Tu-204, over a period of two years, starting from 2010, the general director of the Ilyushin Finance Alexander Rubtsov told to AIN.
The cost of the supplies will total 1.2 billion dollars. The contract is to be effected over a period of five years and will be the biggest in the modern history of Russian civil aircraft and guarantee stable contracts for companies affiliated with UAC and Russian Technology corporation (Rostekhnologii).
The Atlant-Soyuz press-service has told AIN the first An-148-100 planes will enter service in 2010. A likely network of routes is being charted for them. Later, the manufacturer will provide the longer fuselage An-148-200. The company's fleet of An-148 planes is to be completed over a period of three years, from 2010 to 2012.
Atlant-Soyuz builds its aircraft fleet development strategy on the basis of mostly domestically manufactured technologies. The company is determined to take the position of the biggest operator of Russia-made planes.
Flintloque, a game of Fantasy Napoleonics is published by Alector. The game pits "British" Orcs against "French" Elves. Other fantasy races make up the other major "European" powers during the Napoleonic Wars.
Flintloque is a fantasy game which has Napoleonic overtones. Orcs are redcoats, the Elves are French, muskets, rifles and swords are the weapons of choice. This scenario, using the rules and figures in the box set, has Lieutenant Sharke and his band of Orc Rifles fighting against a pursuing band of Elven Voltiguers amongst the ruins of an ancient abbey.
In the dark misty lands of south-west Albion lie the hills of Fortunth. In amongst the hills between the river and the forest it is said that a devoutly religious orc by the name of Elgin had a vision (probably something to do with the mushrooms he had just eaten) and news of this vision spread. Hundreds of orcs from across Albion came to the hills of Fortunth, mostly to find and eat the mushrooms, though some, the more devout orcs, came to seek Elgin and his wisdom. With money raised they built a small church, which as time went by became a large abbey. The Abbey of St Elgin became a site of pilgrimage for many orcs, and not all of these were just coming for the mushrooms.
The Abbey of St Elgin had stood for five hundred years, when following a nasty disagreement (something about drinking mushroom soup from the side or front of a spoon), the devotees of St Elgin split.
One thing you can say about religious orcs (obviously there are a lot of things you can say about religious orcs, but you wouldn't do it to their face unless you wanted to be excommunicated and the religious order of St Elgin had a way of dealing with the excommunicated, it involved three barrels of water, a long piece of rope and a teaspoon), where were we, the one thing you can say about religious orcs is that when they disagree they disagree violently. It started off innocently enough with the throwing of bread rolls in the dining hall, but once you start with bread rolls, it's not too long before you go onto chicken legs, then the crockery, tankards of mead and finally the cutlery. Before you can say steak knives, the ceremonial weapons are ripped down from the wall and used in the disagreement. It is said that one orc tried the lift the great sword of Cardinal Tums Backart. Cardinal Backart was a great big fat orc who was not too averse using his great sword on novice priests, who slurped their soup, cutting them into two halves. The great sword was very old, Cardinal Backart had actually won it in a game of cards in a Tavern, and it was never cleaned or oiled, and when you consider the number of food fights in the past and the tankards of mead and glasses of Elven wine thrown in its direction the great sword wasn't in the best of condition. So this orc lifted the great sword and found to his surprise that he only held the handle the rest still bolted to the wall. He didn't look for long as he was struck down by a flying roast hog, spit and all. Once the fighting was over, a lot of dead and dying orcs littered the floor of the Elgin Abbey's dining room and amongst them lay a lot of food. One badly wounded orc, his left leg was missing, was pleasantly surprised to find a whole leg of roast lamb within arm's reach which he started to gnaw.
However this was the beginning of a religious war which lasted sixty-four years. Both sides fought bravely and ferociously (as orcs would). The key strategic target was of course Elgin Abbey. It was taken and lost many times, each time more of the building was damaged and each time it was patched up. Before long most of the abbey was in ruins.
The war finally came to an end at the climax of a fierce battle in which the two opposing Cardinal Generals (the orcs who had started the war were long dead) battled in single combat to the death. As each swung their swords, ducked and dived, after twenty minutes of combat they came to rest with a sword at each others' throats. Both said simultaneously (isn't it nice how these coincidences happen at strategic moments),
Both looked at each other, realised, hugged and kissed each other on the cheek, then slightly embarrassed, blushed and looked away, it was okay nearly everyone else was dead or dying. During the war both forces could not remember exactly what they were fighting for and they changed their leaders, minds and even changed sides so often that the cause became inconsequential.
Elgin Abbey was never re-built (too expensive) and was left in ruins as a reminder that war could be a problem.
This was of no consequence to Lieutenant Sharke of the Orc Rifles, but it did explain why two hundred years after the climatic last battle of Elgin Abbey, Sharke and his small band of Rifles were holed-up in the ruins of the Abbey and there being no hot food available.
Sharke's small unit has been cut off from their regiment following a scouting party (well they were hog hunting, but don't tell the senior officers) by a column of Elven Grenadier Guards. A small platoon of Elven Voltiguers were currently hunting them down, under the command of Major Pointu Orielle. They had chased and hunted Sharke through forests, fields and the odd tavern, never found him in the taverns though. Major Orielle's platoon originally consisted of thirty men it was now down to ten including himself, Sharke's cursed rifles responsible for some of the losses, a few desertions, a few had injuries or fallen ill and returned to the regiment, and one died after eating something he shouldn't have.
Sharke was sick of running away and decided that it was time to make a stand against the cursed Elves, do or die as Wheeling-Turn often said (or was it somebody else, he wasn't sure, but it sounded good).
Elgin Abbey is in ruins, there are various outbuildings (also in ruins) there is some shelter, not much though. To the north-west and south-west of the abbey are a couple of small woods. Running in to the south of the abbey is the River Elgin, which is more of a stream (30% movement modifier). Small rocks and scrubs litter the landscape.
Grendle did make a ruined cathedral, which though not perfect, could be useful. You could make your own ruined abbey, or use a selection of ruined buildings.
In order to keep things very simple I used the metal figures from the boxed set, six Orc Rifles versus ten Elven Voltiguers. I also used the stats and weapons as given in the main Flintloque rules. The statistics for the Elven Voltiguers were taken from the Sharke's Gold scenario on page 22. Major Pointu Orielle is Experienced and he can be counted as Elite.
Sharke and his Rifles are making a stand and will attempt to fight to the death (yeah right), in reality this means that their northern route is blocked and the only way back to their regiment is by heading south back along the road those Voltiguers have just marched on. So if they can they will attempt to defeat the Elves and ensure that as many Rifles as can get away on the south road.
Rule Change: for the purpose of this battle if any of the Orc Rifles suffers a G result on a Morale Check, instead of routing they will surrender - in the hope that they could eventually escape.
The Elven Voltiguers enter from the south, and are cautious and all their weapons are loaded and primed. Major Pointu Orielle will stay near the back (he has already seen what Sharke and his Rifles can do). Their objective is to kill and/or capture as many as the Rifles as they can. If they can capture Sharke then time to shout hurrah, eat huge amounts of food (with garlic) and buy lots of wine.
A few alternatives to consider really depends on what figures you have in your collection, but here are a few ideas.
Wet & Windy: Change the battle to make it raining, at night and with a strong wind, therefore making it difficult to fire black powder weapons. Add an umpire and hidden movement and you have an entirely different game.
Historical: Flintloque is a fantasy game, but if you have a collection of Napoleonic figures, you could replace the fantasy with historical counterparts (Sharpe instead of Sharke). Maintain the same ratio of six Rifles to ten Voltiguers.
The Elgin Diamond: Sharke has the infamous Elgin Ring which somehow found its way into his haversack, okay so he stole it from the nearest village. So Sharke's Rifles are stuck in the ruins of Elgin Abbey and fifteen Raw Dark Elven Militia descend to take their ring back, they are under the command of their Militia Commander, Juegos Fronteras.
Elgin's Drift: This time a small group of Orc Redcoats (mainly Raw) under the command of Major Arry Arkright have taken shelter in the ruins, but the Voltiguers are trying to sniff them out (which shouldn't be too difficult).
Finally the background the destruction of Elgin's Abbey makes a great background for a more traditional fantasy game, orcs versus orcs - you can even use the same scenery...
As you might imagine a religious site such as Elgin's Abbey holds a certain magical power. This can take different forms, for example, one character from each side develops magical powers (see the magic rules in the Flintloque supplement Deadloque).
Certain areas of Elgin Abbey have positive influences and other areas negative influences. These areas of influence will affect the characters when they are firing their weapons, modifying their "to hit" percentage as appropriate.
Again the abbey is surrounded by areas of positive and negative influence, but these cause or heal wounds. It's probably safer to argue that you can not gain more wounds than you started the battle with.
But of course this magic could all be rumours and the abbey has absolutely no influence whatsoever (but as an umpire you don't have to tell the players that, do you?)
The main inspiration for this article was a visit to Fountains Abbey in North Yorkshire. This ruin (blame it on Henry VIII) set in beautiful grounds, lots of beautiful sunshine really set the scene for Sharke's battle against the Voltiguers in the ruins of Elgin Abbey.
A veteran of World War I, in the 1920s and 1930s de Gaulle came to the fore as a proponent of mobile armoured divisions, which he considered would become central in modern warfare. During World War II, he reached the temporary rank of Brigadier General, leading one of the few successful armoured counter-attacks during the 1940 Fall of France, and then briefly served in the French government as France was falling.
The base for De Gaulle is quite simple, De Gaulle, a staff officer and a motorcycle combination. The most challenging part of this base is the motorcycle combination. At one point I did consider leaving it off entirely....
She advises women put chemistry on the backburner and instead focus on how a man behaves — what he says and what he does. “There are so many alternatives to actually going out on dates.” Instead of going out, have girlfriends in for dinner and a movie. The point is to be social, have fun and feel engaged in your own life once again…regardless of whether a man’s in it or not. Have a sense of humour about bad dates “It’s not the end of the world that you had a bad dinner,” says Miller.
Consider his character and not his hairline in other words. “Take something from it.” The takeaway could be a funny story to tell your girlfriends or it could be that you took home some pretty great leftovers.
You know what you’re dealing with before you become intimate. Put chemistry on hold and focus on character A lot of women decide there’s no chemistry early on and as a result often give up too early in the relationship, says Miller.
‘Geoff’s immediate reaction was suspicion, but now he thinks it’s probably the best thing for us,’ says Wendy.
If you find your spirit lagging after a string of crummy dates, take a break. So while you’re going through with it, you have to find ways to enjoy it and make the most of it.” If after you’ve taken the time to heal, after you’ve gone on dates and re-started your life, you come to the realization that you don’t want a husband (or a boyfriend) ever again, that’s fine too. Ultimately you have to live it in the way that gives you the most satisfaction.

Undeniably, the most crucial role of a company following the production is the distribution and logistics of the final goods so that they reach the end consumers at the right time. Clearly, logistics and delivery both have an unmatched role to play in the performance of the business. Hence, a steadfast and seamless mechanism for your goods distribution will ensure that your customers are satisfied with you. While the system of logistics and distribution varies with companies depending on the kind of products they deal in, optimizing it means following some discrete approach. However, here are discussed some easy and tacit ways to simplify distribution operations to make sure customers get a satisfying service.
Most of the times, courier and delivery services companies deploy a uniform packaging system, irrespective of what they are distributing. Many times, we see a simple consumer good, which is not as fragile as an electronic item, arriving with layers of packaging. So, you need to make sure that your packaging do not become excessive and as per the product nature from you logistics service provider. This way not only wastes will be reduced but also the costs of packing.
Just not the products but there are many things that matter in delivery like the weight, dimension, nature or type of product, or whether it needs cold storage. While all this have a huge impact on the customers’ satisfaction and state of the product when it will arrive at them, you need to find out whether you own delivery system have options to take care of all the aspects well.
Another way you can assure that your delivery systems are fulfilling all expectations of customers is automation. Tracking of delivery route, time and vehicles/driver details, will help customers relax back while their orders are out for delivery. This further reduces the random calls and inquiries from the customers regarding their products.
The most befitting way to streamline your logistics and delivery mechanism is joining hands with a full-fledged delivery and courier services company who will help you through and out. From special handling of the products to warehousing management, products packaging to dispatch, doorstep deliveries to customers services, they will be in charge of all.
You need to realize that the logistics role is hard and it is that significant part of your business, which can hold back your customers providing them right delivery facilities. Whichever business you are into, just make sure your logistics support is well optimized and automated to get your products aptly to your end customers.
There can be varied reasons for a business start-up but the main values in running the business are of those who are the founders. We can see that company exhibits the main skills of the founder in its spirits, for example, if the founder is an engineer, he will emphasize in production rather than sales and marketing which should not be neglected. Main efforts are centered on the acceptability of the product in the market. If the owner can provide the demands of business i.e. time, energy, and finances, he/she can move to the second stage. Otherwise, he/she will have to wind up their business as there is limited time for the company to stay at one stage. Here the main focus changes to establish the company and earn profits. With this financial push company will need to formalize the system and start record keeping, an unskilled manager can’t handle this all. After this, there will be demand for change in administration’s style because of increased activity in his business.
The moment a company moves forward to the expansion stage it should be able to earn a decent profit, but that profit will not go to the owner. This is because it will be invested in the business in order to assist in the capital demands of the company. It demands time for coordinating functional managerial activities; it demands complicated organizational structure mainly focusing on functional lines. Now research and development will be established in order to increase product range. At the start, it will be on a smaller scale because of lack of capital. If management continues changing its environment, the company can stay at this stage for some time. In many cases, owners sell their business at this stage for substantial benefits. The increase of new markets and product will demand more finances. This stage faces larger competitors who deal the situation by putting stress on emerging firm; this stress can be in the form of very low prices as well. At this stage over trading is the biggest threat if not handled properly it can lead the business to demise. As the company grows it need to extend geographical trading and distribution, so ‘supervised supervision’ will be required at this stage. If new competitors enter the market and the owner wants to maintain his shares, he will have to put more capital by himself or attract some partners.
This stage demands proper management reports, budget control, and dispersed authority, along with a formal accounting system. Basic adaptation at this stage will be to systemic administrative roles which are keys to survival through this stage. The expansion stage demands stable long term funds which will be important and if there is not plan for partners then this stage must be considered right now. Although retained earnings are major forms of funds but dividends are the special attraction to the investors; at this stage these are inevitable. Now company’s track record will help in gaining long term loans but the company will have to give security in the form of assets.
At this stage main issues are about expense control, search for growth opportunities and productivity. The direction of authority can be towards functional lines or it is reorganized with production lines. As there is severe price competition, therefore, productions department should be the center of focus and authorities should emphasize on innovative moves towards betterment.
Now basic investments are in sales and marketing struggles and maintenance and plant up gradation. The company grows up to a level that income is sufficient to tackle this but occasionally more long term load prove to be a support. At this level firm may limit its operations or move on, normally acquisition or flotation in order to become a large corporation.
Whatever the situation, managers are pressured by shareholders to safeguard the future of the firm. However, the time of great trial falls to the founder. He built his business with great effort and sacrifices, and now he is asked to give it away.

"As per a report in The Guardian on February 28th 1998, Moyle seemed to have been sedated. A needle mark on his leg may have indicated this." (British Pol Ties to Auto-Erotic Deaths )
"In 2005, the commander of British forces in Gibraltar, Royal Navy Commander David White, was found dead and fully clothed in his swimming pool in The Rock section of Gibraltar. White had been ordered to return to Britain and go on mandatory leave by Britain's Ministry of Defense.
"After his death, police said White had been under investigation for possession of child pornography. White, whose job put him in command of a GCHQ SIGINT installation in the British colony, was determined to have committed suicide and that there was no sign of foul play." - (echkelon)
I'm guessing the guy had a conscience and learnt something while at the Pentagon he shouldn't have, then mentioned this to the wrong person.
Moyles - wonder if his death might be mixed in with Pinochet's lack of arrest in Britain when he came here for , I think, hospital treatment

Steven G. Johnson has written a free/open-source C++ function to compute the scaled complex error function w(z) = e−z2erfc(−iz), also called the Faddeeva function, for arbitary complex arguments z to a desired accuracy:
Note that this is SGJ's independent re-implementation of this algorithm, based on the description in the paper only. In particular, I did not refer to (or even download) the author's Matlab implementation (which is under restrictive "semifree" ACM copyright terms and therefore unusable in free/open-source software).
To test the code, a small test program is included at the end of Faddeeva_w.cc which tests w(z) against several known results and prints the relative errors obtained. To compile the test program, #define FADDEVA_W_TEST in the file (or compile with -DFADDEVA_W_TEST on Unix) and compile Faddeeva_w.cc. The resulting program prints SUCCESS at the end of its output if the errors were acceptable.

The trucking facility would be located on Renwick Road if the company receives a special permit Aug. 6.
The Plainfield Village Board recently postponed a vote on a proposed trucking terminal on Renwick Road, amid public concerns about the project.
Trucking company GP Transportation Co. is seeking a special-use permit to build a trucking facility at a 32-acre site near Interstate 55.
The company plans to build on contiguous sites at 22419 W. Renwick Road, 22531 W. Renwick Road and 22537 W. Renwick Road on land Plainfield resident Patrick Collins owns.
The vote, originally scheduled for Monday, was postponed until Aug. 6, Plainfield Director of Planning Jonathan Proulx said. The board also will hold a public hearing on the project July 23.
“Based on the feedback and the magnitude of public concern and public involvement, the trustees have asked to defer the full consideration of the project,” Proulx said.
Renwick Road resident Jeff Sniegowski has created a Facebook page with an online petition, which, he said, has collected 800 signatures against the GP Transportation Co. project.
“It struck a chord. They’re sick of the traffic already,” said Sniegowski, noting that people from around the Plainfield area are against the plan. “Everyone who travels Renwick Road knows what we’re talking about.”
The terminal would be located immediately behind Sniegowski’s home. He said an access road to the site would be 30 feet from his property line.
Alexander Domanskis, attorney for the trucking company, said the company would look at putting up a berm or sound wall near the residential area.
Sniegowski said he and two of his immediate neighbors have been rear-ended in the past four years after slowing down to turn into their driveways.
“There are accidents on that road all the time,” he said. “We’re sick of hearing the sirens already. That’s the way it is now.”
A staff analysis estimated there could be 116 truck trips during weekday morning peaks and 115 trips on weekday evening peaks, according to June 19 plan commission documents.
Sniegowski pointed to estimates provided by GP Transportation indicating the facility when fully built could generate 692 inbound trailers and 608 outbound trailers daily.
Some residents have also raised environmental concerns, due to the location of the Lake Renwick Preserve to the north.
“We actually already have orders for three electric trucks,” Domanskis said. “We’re doing all that we can to reduce [environmental effects] and we’re actually part of Environmental Protection Agency programs to avoid that.”
Domanskis said the company would move its headquarters from Darien to Plainfield. The company also has a location in Lemont.
“Most of what will be there will be an office facility that people will drive to in normal cars to do the logistics work,” Domanskis said.
In all, the company plans to build a modern office facility, a truck maintenance facility and two parking lots. It will also pave the location, and create a “safer entrance and exit at the western end of the property,” Domanskis said.
Jake Melrose, Plainfield’s economic development manager, said the current access point is dangerous due to limited visibility.
“There’s significant improvements and widening of Renwick Road that would be required as part of the project,” Melrose said.
Domanskis said the property currently is used for trucking and storage, and the GP Transportation site would “be a substantial improvement.”
“This is not a brand-new revelation. All they’re going to do is move their driveway west from where they came,” Collins said.

Eli Cooper, transportation program manager with the city of Ann Arbor, discusses the possible location of a transit center nestled between Fuller Road and East Medical Center Drive, just east of Fuller & Maiden Lane.
On Tuesday evening, way after hours at Northside Grill, a collection of city staff and city councilmembers met with around 40 residents to discuss the relationship of the University of Michigan with the city of Ann Arbor – both generally and with specific regard to the proposed UM expansion along Wall Street.
That construction is currently proposed to include an office building, parking structure and transit center. It was not news to neighbors that UM plays by a different set of rules (its own). What could have been a revelation were the general mechanisms by which city staff work in an environment where they can attempt to nudge UM to adhere to the vision outlined in the city’s planning documents – documents that were created with participation of UM staff.
So there were no magic bullets offered that could kill the parking structure component of the current UM Wall Street expansion. But the vision of a possible transit station along Fuller Road, which would include a substantial number of parking spaces serving a variety of needs, was held out as a possibility that could attract the university away from building more parking along Wall Street. That potential transit station would be nestled between Fuller Road and East Medical Center Drive, just east of Fuller & Maiden Lane.
Craig Hupy, head of systems planning with the city of Ann Arbor, outlined for residents why the University of Michigan does not need to adhere to city-level or state-level ordinances and statutes (with respect to zoning or anything else): UM is a state constitutional entity, and as such, whatever the university does on its land is its choice. One example cited by Hupy of the disconnect between administrative control and practical consequence is the university’s fire code standards, which are administered by its own fire marshall – but the fires themselves are fought by the city of Ann Arbor.
Where the city does have some very limited leverage, said Hupy, is when the university needs access to the public right of way, which is administered (not owned) by the city of Ann Arbor: utility connections and driveway permits, for example. But here the city does not have the latitude to deny use of the right of way as a strategy for bargaining on unrelated matters. The city can simply require that the right of way is used in a manner consistent with the conditions required of any entity (including the university).
In that context, Wendy Rampson and Mark Lloyd, planners with the city of Ann Arbor, described how city staff from planning and development services and systems planning meet with university planning staff on a roughly once-a-month basis. The point of the meetings is to work through technical details. And, said Rampson, staff attempts to “influence even if we cannot require” the university to take paths more consistent with existing city planning documents.
Asked to what extent the city could prevent the university from building parking structures based on the impact to traffic, Rampson said that the city did not have the sort of leverage they had with a private developer, where approval of the project’s site plan could depend on a demonstration that traffic patterns would not be disrupted. In the case of university parking structures, the city could require infrastructure improvements in terms of widening roads or improved signaling, but the city didn’t have the ability to kill a university project on that basis. The impact on air quality was handled on a regional level, said Rampson.
A pointed question from the audience: “How often do you say to them, ‘This conflicts with the North East Area Plan’?” Rampson’s answer: Often. She characterized the monthly meetings as “frank.”
But the focus of the monthly meetings to work out technical details is on projects already in the works. And residents wanted to know to what extent city of Ann Arbor staff are included in the university’s conceptual planning – before a project is brought before the Board of Regents for approval. Rampson described how there is a sense among university planning staff that a project does not exist until it has been approved by the Board of Regents. This made them reluctant to talk about projects when they are in their nascent, conceptual stages. [This is consistent with the repeated emphasis of the phrase "regentally approved project" at a previous meeting between university staff and residents on the Wall Street expansion.]
In fact, when asked when the university began the conceptual planning for the Wall Street expansion, Rampson said, it was not clear when that might have been. At the point when the city’s Northeast Area Plan was adopted, which included participation from UM staff, Rampson said that there was no indication that the university wanted to build parking decks along Wall Street.
Residents expressed the desire for the university to include not just city staff, but also ordinary citizens of Ann Arbor, in its conceptual planning process. Residents also expressed the sentiment that regents have little sense of the impact the university’s construction projects have on the Ann Arbor community. “The regents are oblivious,” said one voice in the audience.
Stephen Rapundalo, who was joined at Northside Grill by fellow city councilmembers Sabra Briere (who had asked for that evening’s meeting to take place) and Sandi Smith, said that the desire of greater participation by the city in university planning had been communicated to individual regents: “We have expressed the desire you have articulated.” But Rapundalo characterized the general approach of the university’s interaction with the city this way: “They come in and they lecture you.”
Some amount of frustration surfaced throughout the meeting on Tuesday evening and was reflected in the question from one audience member: “Are we going to lie down and let this happen?”
The meeting concluded with the expression of one woman in the audience of a wish for greater participation from citizens – but ultimately it was the city’s elected representatives who needed to bring specific proposals to the regents, she said. And if 100 residents needed to show up to the regents’ meeting to support them as they did that, then that’s what they would do.
One of the specific proposals on the city’s side that residents wanted communicated more clearly to the university is the vision of a multi-modal transit center nestled between Fuller Road and East Medical Center Drive. The university has expressed interest, said Rampson, but is still proceeding on a parallel track to build more parking on Wall Street. The Fuller Road transit center’s relation to the university’s regentally-approved Wall Street expansion is that it would relieve some of the pressure to build parking along Wall Street that does not serve medical facilities on Wall Street itself.
This is the source of much of the resistance expressed among residents to the planned parking structures – the university’s planned structures are meant in part to serve patients on other parts of the medical campus. This, as one resident put it, is the worst of both worlds: (i) the location is far enough away from the clinical facilities that it requires a shuttle bus, and (ii) it’s close enough to central Ann Arbor to cause congestion.
Eli Cooper, transportation program manager for the city of Ann Arbor, showed a sketch (prepared in-house by city of Ann Arbor staff) of what the footprint of a multi-modal transit station along Fuller Road could be like. He cast the station in the context of an overall transportation planning context that includes east-west commuter rail, north-south commuter rail, and some kind of high-capacity circulator within the city of Ann Arbor. Why do we need all this transportation? Part of Cooper’s answer had to do with one projection that sees the addition of 20,000 jobs over the next 25 years in the Ann Arbor area – a projection based on the two growth areas of higher education and health care.
As the western terminus of a possible east-west commuter rail corridor between the Detroit area and Ann Arbor, the Fuller Road transit station would, said Cooper, create demand for parking from people living to the north, the south, and further west, who would be driving to the station to get access. The Fuller Road transit station would include some 800 parking spaces to serve a range of different users – from university medical center patients to commuters. Cooper said that he’d had two phone conversations with Amtrak about the possibility of consolidating the Amtrak station (now located on Depot Street below the Broadway Bridge) with a Fuller Road transit station.
There were two questions about the siting of the Fuller Road transit station. One had to do with the possible restrictions on use of the land based on its history as a donated parcel. Cooper said that a preliminary look by the city attorney’s staff suggested that there were no encumbrances on the land. The second had to do with the environmental impact on the watershed, and where it sat with respect to the floodway. Cooper said that in terms of impervious surface, a transit station would be no worse than the surface parking lot currently at the site, which lies outside the floodway.
How soon can we expect to see east-west commuter rail? Cooper said fall 2010 is the target demonstration date for the project, which is being managed by SEMCOG and MDOT.

…the parking structure(s) will create a lot of traffic? to begin with, wall street isn’t a busy road. also, it’s not a dense, residential neighborhood where a parking structure and any increase in traffic that it would bring, would be problematic. maiden lane is a busier street but will always remain that way as it is a corridor that connects fuller to broadway/plymouth road and also pontiac trail.
i’m not sure what is meant by central ann arbor either. are they thinking that hordes of people would park down on wall street so they can shop and dine downtown? that they would park there and walk to some residences on the other side of the tracks and over a bridge? i seriously doubt that. people who will use the structure(s) will use it for the immediate area and i don’t think there’s any worry that it would attract even more people who would use it but venture off well outside the area.
as for the shuttles, that’s true. it would entail shuttles. although i would hazzard a guess that a lot of people wouldn’t mind a short walk to the med center. i already see a lot of employees doing that. visitors, however, will most likely use the shuttles. and guess what? there’s already an existing shuttle route for wall street. so nothing new there.
so, um has land and the money to build and in so doing, create jobs for contractors, skilled laborers, general laborers, architecture firms, and the like. sounds like a plus to me. the med system employs thousands of people. another plus. if they want to put up these projects… on their own land… GOD BLESS ‘EM! at least we can count on um to weather through these economic hard times.
so many people are quick to jump down the university’s throat. i think that’s the way it always is… any large entity must be evil. let’s take ‘em down! a lot of citizenry were up in arms over um purchasing the pfizer land taking tax money away from the city. guess what? nothing was happening with that parcel. no big takers, especially not now during this downturn. if um didn’t take it off the city’s hands, it would have ended up like the lower town project. years of nothing with ocassional glimpses of hope. so, they buy it with a definitive plan and the prospects of increasing the jobs base in the region. sounds good to me. i’m sure the businesses across the road will enjoy having some neighbors around again. and another thing, um originally owned a majority of that land. they sold it in the 1950s to parke davis which became pfizer. and then they sold them additional land when pfizer needed to expand with the agreement that um had the right to purchase should pfizer sell off. so, where were the: hoorays!!! for michigan for fifty years when the city was reaping property takes from parke davis and pfizer courtesy of um selling the property? no, i didn’t hear it then and i don’t hear it now. really, it’s their land, they should do what they want with it… parking structures on wall street, labs on pfizer.
the university brings a lot to this city. it isn’t the evil entity that people like to think. it brings in people who work, live and play here. it brings in art and culture. thank god for umma, huh? a city of 100,000 without a museum? wow, that would suck. the nat sci museum, kelsey museum… fantastic, huh? would the royal shakespeare company come to ann arbor if not for the university? all the musical, theater, and performance troupes and groups that come to ann arbor… guess what? courtesy of the university. the energy and excitement, the desire to try new things, creativity, thoughtfulness, get up and go… students, staff, visitors, infected townies. without the university and it’s building projects and expansions, this landscape would be a more barer and poorer one to live in… we’d be nothing more than a canton or a brighton or a livonia. maybe not even that considering we’re well past the suburban detroit ring.
so, people… quit yer bitchin’. it sounds like people have got their panties in a bunch because they feel slighted by the university. you don’t like it here? you don’t like the university? that’s ok… just move to howell so we don’t have to hear you anymore.
– Yes. UM’s own traffic analysis concluded that peak weekday traffic rate on Wall Street would increase from currently less than 200 cars/hour to well over 1000 cars/hour.
– The parking structure will also be immediately adjacent to Maiden Lane which is already jammed during rush hours. Worse, the only access to Wall Street itself from the east is via Maiden Lane.
– Well, at least you admit it. Central Ann Arbor is the area, in & around the center of the City, that has a high population density and a high density of pedestrians and vehicular traffic congestion. It’s also the area of the City with the highest air pollution concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and micro- & nanoscopic organic particulates. (The Wall Street/Lower Town area in particular is one of the most vulnerable areas in the City for air pollution because it’s in a valley and because of the high traffic flow through the area on Broadway and on Maiden Lane — not to mention the traffic through Fuller’s intersection with Maiden Lane immediately east of the Wall Street area.)
One of the most effective ways that other cities have restrained increases in these air pollutants has been to reduce single-occupancy vehicle (SOV) traffic in city centers.
“are they thinking that hordes of people would park down on wall street so they can shop and dine downtown? that they would park there and walk to some residences on the other side of the tracks and over a bridge?”
– Neither. The structures (two, with 600 parking spaces each) are planned entirely for UM Hospital employees and patients, and mostly for UM employees.
“visitors, however, will most likely use the shuttles. and guess what? there’s already an existing shuttle route for wall street. so nothing new there.”
– What’s new are shuttles to accommodate commuters using the 1200 additional parking spaces. The currently proposed Wall Street/Maiden Lane location for this new parking capacity is the WORST POSSIBLE location: It’s just far enough away from the Hospital’s main campus to require most users first to park and then to take a shuttle, yet it’s so close to the main campus that use of the new parking capacity will have virtually no effect on restraining the increase in SOV mileage accumulated in the central City.
“so, um has land and the money to build and in so doing, create jobs for contractors, skilled laborers, general laborers, architecture firms, and the like. sounds like a plus to me. the med system employs thousands of people. another plus. if they want to put up these projects… on their own land… GOD BLESS ‘EM! at least we can count on um to weather through these economic hard times.”
– That’s completely irrelevant to the issue, in fact, it’s a straw man, because nobody’s advocating limiting increases in employment or not building additional parking capacity. What’s being advocated is building parking capacity further away from the City center, specifically to restrain the increase in UM-related SOV traffic in the Lower Town/Wall Street area. (One possibility would be a parking structure at the location of the current surface parking lot northwest of the intersection of Huron Parkway & Glazier Way. [GoogleMaps Link ])
“you don’t like it here? you don’t like the university? that’s ok… just move to howell so we don’t have to hear you anymore.”
– Actually, there’s been no significant opposition, from the Wall Street area and Lower Town community, to UM’s extensive plans to build along almost all of both sides of Wall Street, from Broadway on the west to the River on the east. In fact, there’s no significant opposition to a single, smaller parking structure across from Kellogg that would be only for Kellogg patients. The opposition has been directed only towards the proposed _two_ 5- or 6-story 600-car parking structures.

"X4 Foundation" is by Far the best space game coming in. i am wating for this game since the release of Home of Light DlC. going to be Epic ! i worship Egosoft studio becoz they are by far the most concerned by delivering a product and polishing it through the years. and until today THERE IS NOT ANY studio that ever created a living breathing economy from primary ressources to refinement station and ship making, every ship in the system is coming from a station there is no random respawns.
On the last game "Dual Universe", is there a Midget standing on the spaceship, or the devs have a very poor sense of proportions? xD
space Mechanic simulator, well, its better than car mechanic I guess. Occupy mars, can maybe work. intersteller prime and Stars End seem to try to be an FPS space game and very similar. Avorion is known and I don`t much care for it., but I wonder how it has grown? now X4 foundations looks interesting. they're an older studio, so they could deliver something really great. Osiris New dawn has had really great early access and they seem to deliver pretty solid gameplay already. will probably become no.1 in planetary space survival game for people who don't like subnauticas wetness. Pantropy: oh look another open world crafting survival game. but they have mechs as gimmick. yawn. Genesis Alpha one: whats this. Station building strategy FPS with actual attacking aliens and an Xcom style research? oh you got me interested. Dual universe. thats allot of ambition. and rather interesting Server tech. kinda spaceminecraft? hopefully it won't flop or be stuck in development hell like StarC
None of these trailers tell me anything about the games. I want to know what your gameplay loop entails, not how big your world is.
Only ones that interested me were Occupy Mars and Genesis Alpha one, the rest seems like generic space shooters, which there are tonnes of already. I've already played EvE online, Ascent, Space Engineers, Kerbal Space Program and Empyrion. Seriously, give us something NEW! Where is the creativity in this genre? Why not terraforming or colonisation, building trade routes, exploration? The average age of gamers is over 30 now, please create something a bit less braindead than some childish pew-pew game.
Is it just my computer, or do most of the trailers in this video have terrible image quality? Like some of them are unwatchable, is it really that much to expect 1080p resolution for a video game trailer?
Geez they are all the f*cking same.. Like anyways for a good list! But you forgot Space Engineers. It's getting a big multiplayer remake at the 20.7. so prepare for that.
Tfw you will never collapse enemy stars by synchronised slamming planemos at relativistic speeds into them. Mind the spoilers whoever gets this reference.
Look! the sky is full of vapor/scam ware. Except for X4 which will be glorious everything else is space debris
X-4 may be best option here, but no Boron in this game (yet). Lore is that all gates shut down and races are back to square one.
ive got DA its a pretty fun game, lke space engineers but more... combat and building an empire/eve like then what SE was.
I kinda doubt it - or like to hope I won't be proven wrong, that is. Time will tell. DU just needs it's "framework" done right and have the right set up and initial content offered to players. The good thing compared to some other games (like Star Citizen) is that the devs do not have to hand craft every world, (NPC) faction, etc. Or have a very complex technical framework that needs a lot of fine-tuning over years as more content is added. My point being is that once the necessary objects and mechanics are in place, the players run the show. We'll see if they can manage to pull it off. I like to think it'll end up becoming good. And it doesn't even matter if they fail in the grand scheme of things, someone else will pick up the idea and make it happen. I just have to wait.
Someone should try making a new and different game, like Alien where you get to run the alien. You are on a ship that crashes on a human planet and you must do whatever it takes to survive. You could make it open world where people can run humans or aliens but to make it fair for humans only allow one alien per 100 people or give the humans advance technologies so that it does not become .
I generally long for some kind of open-end grand simulation game. Think of like all those modern (4X) strategy games but with a ground based component or the ability to do all of that from a first person or simulated perspective. For example something you described, but also applied to other settings or lores or stories. Universes. You get the idea. For example, starting as low Joe and working your way up, potentially creating your own nation(s) or state or Empire, through very hard work. It could take IRL weeks or months to rise to the ranks or form it from nothing - and then it would not just stop there but maybe really start as you try to expand or defend yourself from other threats. I think as technology increases and as we see better AI incorporated into games or used to develop games, we'll see grand worlds and huge simulated universes or planets, perhaps even online with VR or actual senses incorporated. With average life expectancy I still have to face a few decades on this Earth and chances are good I get to see something grand and great in that regard!
Great video, some truly competetive space games upcoming. I am an indie game developer working on a low poly space exploration game called "Beyond The Horizon" and would appreciate it if someone checked it out. Many thanks, CubicUniverse studios
I feel none of these games have as much building freedom as a game like space engineers for example. If they're called space simulation BUILDING games then why is there not much building going on with some of these? If it considers these simulation games, I don't think a visible spectacle impresses a lot of people anymore, not me at least.

LEWISTON, Maine - Three Bates College skiers finished among the top five competitors in individual events at the Dartmouth College Carnival Feb. 9-11 at Hanover, N.H., helping the Bobcats to a sixth-place finish for the third straight week on the Eastern Intercollegiate Skiing Association (EISA) circuit.
Junior alpine skier Kyle Hildebrand of Waitsfield, Vt., led the way for the Bobcats with a second-place finish in the giant slalom. Hildebrand missed out on his second career race victory and his first in the giant slalom with a time of 1:53.58 for two runs, just 0.14 seconds behind the University of Vermont's John Minahan. Hildebrand posted the fastest time of the day on the first run at 56.61 seconds. His previous career victory came in the slalom event at the University of New Hampshire Carnival in 2000. Hildebrand won All-America honors in 1999, when he placed seventh in the slalom at the NCAA championships hosted by Bates at Sunday River in Newry, Maine.
On the women's side, sophomore skier Kim Rogers of Charlestown, Mass., finished third in the women's GS with a two-run time of 2:00.20. The result matched her career-best finish in the giant slalom achieved at the 2000 Williams College Carnival. It also marked just the second time this season that a skier not from the University of Vermont cracked the top three in the GS. Rogers' previous season-best performance, a fourth-place finish in the giant slalom, came a week before at the Vermont Carnival. Rogers qualified for the 2000 NCAA skiing championships, hosted by the University of Utah.
Sophomore Nordic skier Justin Easter of Jay, Maine, was Bates' top cross-country performer for the weekend. He finished fourth in the men's 10K classical race with a time of 29:48.8 on Feb. 9. In the men's 10K freestyle pursuit the next day, Easter finished in sixth place with a time of 56:33.1 in a staggered-start race based on the performances from the previous race. Easter's performance in the classical race was his highest finish of the season after placing 10th a week earlier at the Vermont Carnival. Also a member of the cross country and outdoor track and field teams, Easter is looking to qualify for the NCAA championships for the fifth time in as many seasons of competition at Bates.

Some background info: Michael Dick is a professional photographer who dedicated seven years to fire photography in preparation for the book
"New York's Bravest - Their Lives on the Line" which was published in 1987. During this time he concentrated his efforts on Harlem and the South Bronx
and created approximately five thousand color slides. In this long out-of-print book all the photographs were taken by Michael Dick and the text
was writtenby Lt. Thomas Barry, L-42 (Ret.) . Many of these photos were reproduced in black & white, this is the first time they are being shown in color.
Some of the best of these were used in the book and many more will be showcased here. This was in the 1980s and the slide film used then
has now been replaced by a memory card in a digital camera. This technological advantage would have made photography a lot easier
back thenbut it seems that things always seem to be changing. There have been numerous changes in the equipment used to fight fires, too.
These include new engines, rear mounts, tower ladders and rescues. There were also advancements made in personal equipment such as
bunker gear, Scott Air-Paks, handheld thermal imaging cameras and the partner saw. Some items remain basically the same, however,
In spite of all the changes that have taken place in the last 25 years the dedication level of the members
of the FDNY remains the same. It is in their honor, and memory, that these photographs are presented to you.
10:12 Genesis Alpha One looks bloody brilliant, I hope they have that style of music through out! Aw man ridley Scott mods
I got into the X series at X2. If they can avoid having any characters speak, or bother spending money on real voice actors; if they can use a FP camera without making everyone feel seasick; if they can keep scale, so that your pilot doesn't feel 9' tall coming into the ship cabin (XR, specifically); if they bother to have more than two lines of dialogue shared amongst the 100s of NPCs... There's a lot to love with the X games, but there's also a *lot* of "WTF?" moments too - and not the kind written in intentionally.
tar citizen have a roadmap , you can play it now land on moons etc. it will never be finished because its an mmo, they will keep adding new stuff just like rust, but they will offically announce its release date for sure. bye
I'm looking forward to X4 getting back to its older play style of commanding any ship not just one. Can't wait
Finally a list which isn't promoting Star Citizen. The first 2 are sick. Can't wait. :) Plus Dual Universe is getting more and more intersting. I didn't like the concept back then they 1st introduced it. But they are attrecting me more and more :)
The Otum why is that sad? Are you die hard fanboy of SE? I guess SE borrowed some ideas from Minecraft then. Don’t see people cry about that... Plus SE don’t have exclusive rights on Voxel building games. THANK GOD. Cause we would never get anything new then... Imagine if only one shooter game existed. Hah how boring would that get... Plus more space games= a good thing. Don’t sniff sniff about it. Just play your SE if that is the only thing you can accept. 😎
Hey man there are hundredsof people putting out upcoming game videos but yours stand out above the rest. Great quality and always up to date, great job.
Well, i am sorry, but i find all these games ugly! Like if they are from 10 years ago !! Not appealling for me !
Stationeers is a real space station building game in early access.... crap i see here is just another shit shooters stuff
Many full fledged games are released full of bugs, half complete and without bringing anything new to the genre, they are still games. Also, the Pantropy you backed a month ago is 90% of the game that will be released Q3 because €75k is basically an insignificant sum of money for a 12 paid member team with office space in Germany.
Cody correct, i also backed the second one, but at the time of writing the above, it was nothing but a failed kickstarter. So hardly a game. Let alone one worty of any top 10 of games no? Id give it another year to show us what it has in store for us ... Now it brings nothing new to the genre (yet) ... Except maybe mechs
Huh? The plan ever since the kickstarter failure was to keep going which they have. They redid another kickstarter late april/early may which was successful.
QuickestFoxy101 DU is still in alpha stages of course its not gonna look as good as beta stage/released games....
occupy mars or Mark Watney simulator. Genesis Alpha One has a very strong aliens vibe i like it. Osiris New Dawn and Pantropy look very generic like planet nomads and grav and many others.
Dual Universe is never coming out. Star Citizen is never going to be finished. Elite Dangerous will always make you a space-paraplegic
Do you remember CitizenCon when they showed a 20 min trailer last year with all sorts of wizardry only to cancel it indefinitely the following day?
Isn't star citizen the game where you can buy all this ships for the low, one-time price of 28000$ USD? Yeah, that doesn't sound like a money grab or anything.
SC is a cult of the worst kind. Blind indoctrinated followers who have sinked too much money into it to turn around. As it stands it's nothing less than a glorified slideshow. By the time they optimize it to where it's playable, Frontier will have released an entire new Elite game.
Ok, man. Look. I apologize for my remarks. I was referring earlier to being confined to a chair in Elite. That is all.
but cosmoteer is not even remotely close to what avorion is, other than build your own ship. it's like saying cosmoteer is a copy of Reassembly or space engineer. liek comparing minecraft with terraria.
Bro thanks you helped me a lot 1st anyway you are my favorite YouTuber and I will help you in times of need
Dwayne your right. I actually played it for awhile, it has potential but nothing to keep you engaged... at least for the long run. Short term, I was enjoying the bounty hunts and ship progression. The faction stuff is meh. The mining was cool but the trading was meh. When Horizon came out that was interesting but very short-lived, was in and out of the game faster than the first F-bomb in an episode of Hell's Kitchen. Game is great wide just not great deep. And before I hear the cries of Star Citizen being the best thing sinced sliced bread, At least Elite:Dangerous officially released. Star Citizen will finally officially release in like... 2 more decades or something.
Jagdpanzer 1944 ite too boring and buggy, and you cannot make any money in ED...i played since beta..

It was Heidegger who observed that our everyday lives were merely distractions in order to avoid the ultimate encounter with our own mortality — a revelation too profound to contemplate, and thus we engage in meaningless and monotonous projects in order to shift our focus away from the stark reality of life and death.
It is indeed the human species which continually and perennially embraces various acts of futility, despite irrefutable evidence that such actions lead to no fruitful or purposive outcome. But to cease such engagements would be to stop and think; and reflection would mean a forced quietude in which contemplation upon the state of one’s being would be unavoidable; and from there, the vast void of nihilism might encroach, and so perhaps resumption of purposeless, repetitive treadmill-like engagements are best for sanity and survival.
For Federal and Postal employees who suffer from medical conditions such that one is prevented from performing one or more of the essential elements of one’s job, however, contemplation in filing for Federal Disability Retirement benefits from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management is a necessity which cannot be avoided. Further, the greatest singular act of futility in preparing a Federal Disability Retirement application is to wait upon an agency to act; for, as agencies exist in order to appear to act with purpose, but where inaction allows for greater exigencies and justification for existence; as such, agencies rarely act, and when they do, they do so to the detriment of the Federal or Postal employee.
Thus, the hard rule should always be: be proactive and do not wait for an agency to accommodate or otherwise assist you. Distractions and diversions are fine in life; but when the necessity arises to attend to one’s medical needs, you need to act, and act in the best interest of one’s own being.

Injuries are sadly a professional hazard for athletes. Many of them have had their careers cut short because of these pesky niggling injuries. But Roger Federer had been able to avoid them for much of his career. His style of play is not only artistic and elegant, but also light on his body. But lately, he has been dealing with a spate of injuries that are somewhat unnerving for both, him and his fans. Here’s a look at Federer’s long, still continuing career with respect to injuries.
Mononucleosis in early 2008: He got a bad bout of Mono during the Australian Open which took a huge toll on his health for the rest of the season. But he did manage to win the doubles gold in Beijing Olympics and his Fifth US Open.
Back Injury in 2013: Federer struggled with back injuries sustained in March and again in July and saw his ranking drop from No. 2 to No. 6.
Knee Injury, Flu and Back problems in 2016: Federer started his season by participating in the Brisbane International as the defending champion, despite having a flu when the tournament started. However, in a rematch of the previous year final, he lost in the final to Milos Raonic in straight sets. Federer then sustained a knee injury and in early February, he underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his knee and missed the tournaments in Rotterdam and Dubai in February and in Indian Wells in March. He was scheduled to return to action in Miami. Due to a stomach flu he had to withdraw from Miami thus prolonging his time on the sidelines. He did however, make his comeback at the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing in the quarterfinals to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in three sets. Federer then announced that he would be entering the Madrid Open, after arriving he announced on May 2, that he was withdrawing after suffering a back injury while practicing. He played the 2nd round and the 3rd round in Rome masters, but lost in the 3rd round to Dominic Thiem because of his back injury. He has been taking baby steps to get his fitness back up to a 100%. He will be back to playing in Roland Garros in ten days hopefully.
Federer’s ball striking is so fluid that his muscles go through very less damage as compared to many of his peers. His swings and his feet movement are as gentle and fluid as a ballet dancer. He does not utilize raw power which reduces the stress to his body. No matter what the surface is, be it grass, clay, or hard court, he seems to glide and hover rather than run. There is real fluidity in everything he does, making him relatively injury free no matter how long he plays. He has played long 5 setters without breaking any sweat. And it not just because of pure athleticism, it is also a result of him listening to his body. He always knows what he can do and what he cannot do. He knows his body so well, he is very well synced with it. This is the primary reason for him having avoided a very serious injury most of his illustrious and long career. As Kathryn Bennets, of the Royal Flanders Ballet, discussed in a well-circulated article with the New York Times in 2009, “He has this smoothness to him–an ease that makes him special. He’s an artist, so refined. Like how dance transports you to a different place, so does he.”
Here is the most impressive stat of Roger’s Career: In his 1070 plus matches, he has never retired mid-match. He has withdrawn before a tournament or before a scheduled match, but never in the middle of a match. That is an amazing feat and this is just one of the many reasons he is considered to be the Greatest of All Times.
In 2016, as Federer is going through his most difficult year because of a string of injuries. His health matters the most and we all hate to see him down in pain. He has been amazingly brave to test the waters so to speak, to see how his back is faring. Anyone else would have quit mid-match but not Roger. He played on till the end of the match. Let us all hope and pray he gets his health back on track in time for Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the Rio Olympics. And that he suffers no pain and comes back to doing what he loves most, playing tennis; once again gliding and hovering like the ballet dancer that we have come to love and admire since so many years.
We at Federerism.com and his millions of fans from across the world are praying for him to have a speedy recovery and bounce back absolutely healthy and fit. All the best Roger! Allez!!
You will get back Rog, if anyone can it’s you. Just make sure you prioritize on Wimbledon and Rio for this season.
Get well soon Roger. I only watch when you are playing. I love the artistry of your movements and your whole attitude to tennis and your millions of fans. I am one of your greatest fans…….long may you play tennis xx
This is our hotel the Quianmen Jianguo Hotel in Beijing. It is VERY ornate and beautiful. Below are two pictures of the lobby.
We rode around in rickshaws to several places, one of those was the porcelan factory where Glen found a very large clay soldier. The one next to Glen's that is not in the picture has a detachable head which one of our fellow group members (John) took off to take a picture with. We are with some GREAT people.
Glen pushed me out into the center of the bus to introduce us to the group when it was our turn. He's such a chicken. I think he just wanted an excuse to take MORE pictures.
Glen and me in our rickshaw. I felt bad having the little old man pedal us around. I seriously thought about making him get in the seat with Glen and I would pedal them around. In any case I asked Glen to tip him every time we stopped, so needless to say whenever we would come out of one of our stops he would be there waiting to guide us back to his rickshaw with a huge smile on his face. Glen tried to ask him his name but he didn't speak any english and our Chinese is very bad.
We also stopped at the Silk factory to see how silk is made and look at all the beautiful things that can then be made from the silk fabric.
Glen said this was a jackalope. Chinese version. It was standing guard in front of the silk factory.
Those little bean shaped things are silk coccons with little dead worms in them. The cocoons with ine worm in them get fed into this machine, where they find the end of the strand of silk and then use the machine to unwind it and put it on a spool.
You can see the spools at the top. The cocoons are soaked in water to make them easier to unwind and spool.

Amsterdam is best known for its risqué Red Light District, where working girls pose in neon-lit windows and “coffee shops” sell substances substantially more mood altering than a Starbucks’ triple venti no foam latte.

Hello blogosphere! It’s been far too long. My life has been crazy the last few months, or 5. I’ve lost a very beloved family member, rekindled an old romance, moved yet again and started some other great ventures.
Now that you’re all caught up, I’ve decided to regain my passion for blogging and get my literary brain ticking again by doing the #blogtember challenge outlined here. I am about a week and a half late but I just figured I would catch up and only do the topics that interest me. It may seem lazy to some but I like to call it selective. I see no point in writing about topics I’m not interested in, wouldn’t you skip those too?
Over the past few weeks I have made the mistake of using my credit card *shrill*. I have been planning some upcoming trips and using my card to go ahead and purchase everything I’ll need in advance but with it has come that terrifying bill in the mail. I did plan ahead and already have worked out how I will quickly pay it off but it made me sit down to consider what I would do if I did have major debt looming overhead. Here are a few tips to help anyone pay off debt.
There are plenty of sites out there that will talk about credit card churning for the points and for the benefit of improving your credit. I agree with them for the purpose they serve but there is also a danger to doing so. If you are not someone who immediately goes home and pays off your credit card you are likely to end up paying interest on those charges. Once you have a decent amount charged up on your card and it starts taking the interest hits your debt can go spiraling out of control. Take charge of your charges and get them paid off as quickly as possible. My suggestion if you have multiple is to pay off the card(s) with the highest interest rate while paying the minimum and then roll all of the extra money you were paying off the initial one to the next one until you have them all paid off. This is a Dave Ramsey method and has worked for tons of people.
Do you have car insurance? A phone bill? Cable? These are all bills that you could potentially have lowered in order to put towards debts that you cannot. If your contracts are running out soon, call around or skim the internet for better prices. If you are adamant about staying with your current provider call them and ask to speak with a manager and tell them you’re a loyal customer and would like to see if they have a better rate they can offer you. The savings from doing so for any of these contracts can be used to pay down your other debts.
There are a multitude of ways to bring in additional income. You can go get a second job at a store or food establishment you like. Doing so would not only benefit you in bringing in additional income but also save you money on purchases you would have already made thanks to employee benefits. Any additional money you earn could be automatically deposited into your savings or you can make an agreement to yourself to pay at least a portion of your additional earnings towards getting rid of debt.
Do you really need that latte? If you’re spending $5 a day on a fancy latte that means you’re dishing out an extra $1825 a year. $5 a day might not seem like much but little purchases truly add up. If you were to make the same beverage at home for around $1 or less you would save $1460 to put towards your debt per year!
If you have been with a company long enough and in good standing you should have no issue with getting them to lower your interest rate. I say so because I have done so recently. All you have to do is call and ask. The worst they can say is no and you can call back in a few weeks or months and try again.
If you only have a small amount built up in your savings I would suggest by-passing this option. However, if you are like me and have a surplus beyond what you would need in the case of an emergency then borrow some of that money and pay off your debts. You are going to earn far less interest in your savings than you will be paying on your debt so pay off your debt first and you will be able to quickly replenish any money you have borrowed from your savings.
Today’s tattoo is another one of my own. It is a pirate skull with Floridian flowers and butterflies. Florida is my home away from home. I have spent entire summers there and vacationed there my entire life. A good portion of my family is from there and we have friends that we have made over the years as well.
Most of my tattoos unless otherwise stated were all done at Black Cat Tattoo in Panama City Beach, Fl. The following tattoo wasn’t done by my usual artist Darren, but by a gentleman that was filling a guest spot for the time being.
If you have a tattoo you would like featured for Tattoo Tuesday, please send me an email with a photo, description and background information. My email address is heather@20somethingsyndrome.com

The following 2000 Calorie meal plan was designed for myself in particular by a nutritionist but it can be applied to anyone with the same caloric needs. To give an example I am 5’8″, weigh 118 lbs and am a 26 year old female who performs moderate workouts for an hour 3-4 times a week. The goal of this meal plan was designed to maintain weight and build muscle.
Egg whites, chicken breast, turkey breast, extra mlean ham, and fish such as chunk light tuna, tilapia, cod, and shrimp are lean proteins and are interchangeable (3 egg whites; 3 oz servings meat)
Fattier meats (between 5 to 10 g fat per serving) such as lean ground beef, lean roast beef, lean cuts of steak, pork chops or pork loin, and fish such as salmon, sardines, anchovies, and trout are interchangeable (3 oz servings)
Ø I recommended having more fatty fish per week versus red meat in order to increase Omega 3 Fatty Acid intake
Ø melon and tropical fruit (minus the kiwi) are very sugar dense and so should be treated as 2 fruit servings
Light mozzarella cheese stick can only be traded for lactose free yogurt if one daily fruit serving is eliminated (not the
Ø cheese has little to no sugar and is thus lactose free but the lactose free yogurt comes equipped with added sugar so watch out
Greens such as collard greens, turnip greens,mustard greens, green leaf and romaine lettuce, Swiss chard, and kale are interchangeable
Ø 2 tbsp of natural peanut butter or almond butter can be used on vegetables or on a sandwich in place of nut serving
The selected flavors of protein bars above are interchangeable since they were similar in Calories, PRO, and fiber
Ø try and choose those with 5 grams of fat or less since fat is undesirable in a pre and post-workout meal due to it slowing digestion
Ø also think of it as your multivitamin supplement plus Calories; since it’s jam-packed full of added vitamins coupled with lower fiber content, the micronutrients should absorb well
Ø beans (legumes) contribute a lot of fiber to the diet and you may have some intestinal discomfort at first with this food
Serving of cauliflower can be replaced with other white vegetables such as 1 cup white cabbage, ½ cup turnips,1 cup white mushrooms, and ¾ cup white onion
Broccoli can be traded for any other green vegetable such as 1 cup green beans, 1 small cucumber, 1 cup Brussels sprouts, ½ cup artichoke hearts, 1 cup of any of the above leafy greens, 1 cup watercress, 1 cup bok choy,1 cup arugula, and 1 cup zucchini
I attempted to decrease the amount of fiber in this diet to closer to the 25 grams per day as recommended for woman but trying to achieve this while maintaining nutritional integrity was a real chore. I did follow up research and learned that there are several individuals (even credentialed health professionals) that follow diets upwards in the 40 to 60 gram range without adverse effects. This seemed to be the norm especially amongst people follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. To prevent any discomfort, it is VERY important that you drink the amount of water daily as stated above. If the amount of fiber is giving you digestive issue, you can decrease it by peeling off the skins of fruits, subtract beans from the diet, get a juicer and juice your veggies, or change to white bread or refined grains (do this last). To maintain nutritional content of your vegetables, steam or use the microwave instead of boiling, pressure cooking, or frying. Vegetables where the nutritional content actually improves with cooking include tomatoes, carrots, asparagus, mushrooms, spinach, peppers, and cabbage. Also, you may have noticed that PRO is well above the 80.5 grams daily that we discussed but it still falls shy of the 30% marker for overall Calories from protein and therefore no big deal (you will just use the excess as an energy source and it won’t strain your kidneys as long as you have a healthy pair). I hope you find the above template customizable enough based on the substitutions list. To prevent burnout on your new diet plan, I recommend that you allow yourself 2 to 3 cheat meals per week (meaning that you treat yourself to something not on the nutrition plan). Now go and put it to good use!

China for centuries lived in a culture where walls were very important for protection of its citizens. The Great Wall of China was built to keep invading armies out of China, and in Beijing the citizens also built walls around their dwellings for protection. Today a modern Beijing is fast overtaking the ancient past. New modern high-rise buildings and apartments are fast replacing the traditional dwellings within the walled hutongs, but a few remain and can be visited by tourists. Within these walled hutongs you'll find individual residences and courtyards where thousands of Beijingers still live, many without modern conveniences. Many have opted to move into the more modern apartment buildings, but many still prefer the community style living of the hutong. On our tour we rode in a modern-day rickshaw ... powered by a human on a bicycle.
During our tour of the hutong we would ride trough the back streets and alleyways viewing what life is like for the residents, visit an American sponsored kindergarten, a bell tower, and, finally, have tea with a local family.
In the midst of our ride through the hutong, we stopped to visit an American sponsored kindergarten ... the Beijing Royal Bilingual Kindergarten. Arriving and entering the courtyard to the school we were immediately met by a group of children who greeted us and then began to perform a song and dance welcoming us to the school. Again, we found ourselves in the company of children and the photo opportunities were numerous. Enjoy the pictures ...
The children, as you can see from the pictures, were wonderful. After their short song and dance we toured the school passing through the bathroom (left). Straight shots (as I call them) are common throughout the world but not in the United States.

Why? Because it mentions GROs (prostitutes), and more specifically, how depressing they are. So people searching for information about/pictures of hookers in Manila routinely stumble across that page. You guys are gross.
The prostitution here is nothing new for a lot of countries, but I still find it really weird. Weird because Filipinos are fairly devout Catholics, or at least that's what they'll tell you. High school aged girls can't even look at me, let alone talk to me, because they're so shy. Dating doesn't really happen in the sense we're all familiar with, and usually around 18-20, out here at least (not in Manila), it's time to make babies and get married. There's very little birth control (I guess we have the Pope to thank for that one), and the vast majority of people are church going, Jesus-lovin' Catholics. And yet a common expression here is "when two are apart, four are happy."
I'm in a relationship where I wouldn't consider cheating, but I don't find it morally objectionable or anything. I'm not going to slap a scarlet A on anyone, but it blows my mind sometimes that not only is it acceptable in a certain sense to cheat, but if you're going to cheat, then if it's with a prostitute that's something people can live with. The problem is, of course, that these are desperate people being sometimes literally forced into these roles. This isn't "single mom who starts stripping to pay the bills" desperate, this is truly desperate. A lot of the girls who end up in these situations, especially in Manila and Angeles, are lured there with promises of jobs, etc and then are stuck there because they have no way to get back.
But hands down the worst part of the whole thing are the guys who come here as sex-tourists. They contribute nothing, exploit people, and then return to whatever they came from, all because they're too fucking pathetic to get a girl they don't have to pay for in their own country. It makes me mad, and then it makes me sad.

MEEEE of course! These days I like to fly my DESIGNER flag high. (Don't be mistaken, Im just HIGH on life! No need to know how I achieved this magical predicament of circumstances ) For 11 years I have stayed content and complacent with living under a rock. My head in the sand. What can I say, a lot of really good things happen there. To include, but not limited to reasonable, and rational thinking. Thinking,...... thinking.... and well, more thinking. You'd be amazed at all the great things you can conjure up with SO MUCH thinking; (unequivocal dumbfounded stupidity). All the while staying low key, quiet and satisfied. Too busy getting sand out of crevices, of which the particulars of such intelligence won't enlighten any of us. BUT the tranquility of my dumbness is soon to be over turned by the Queen herself. My fortress will no longer be hushed by silence.
So why the sudden change in egotistic, self centered, boastful behavior? Call it modest pride, but more than likely it's my participation in what I like to call old age, a-hem, I mean experience. Ok, so Im gloating. But I cannot feel but a little proud and glorious ( why won't this damn flag go any higher!!) with my new found perspective/enlightenment/shear stupidity.
I made the mistake of watching HGTV last night. Now, don't get me wrong, this is a fundamental and impressive network with BIG important people; especially if you need to learn mad skills like Mcgiver. Like an Engineering mastermind, I have learned how to properly use fishing line, wire and a pair of pliers like nobody's business! Very important in these FRUGAL times. But you would be mistaken to think that the context of such a show is actually real. Disregard the blatant fact that the budgets never include all the labor but manipulate you into thinking that you can tear down, rebuild, reupholster, renovate, restore, reassemble, glue, screw and undo, all for $1000. The amplified puppet master, I mean host, with an accentuated smile, and embellished hand gestures over gliding the lily pond ten fold, you can HAVE ALL THIS and more!!!!!!! (clapping, music, and Bob Barkers beauties filled with JOY and EXCITEMENT!!! YAY!!!)
Ok so I understand that these ground breaking, pivotal shows are addictive. They throw stars in your eyes telling you that you too can achieve undeniable, alluring, spell binding elegance and beauty, all with a pair of pliers, fishing line, and wire. Don't get me wrong, you can, as long as you have the village people (jingle~young man are you listening to me, No man does it all by himself, it's fun to stay at the Y-M-C-A~jingle) I mean a village to help put it all together for FREE. But who cares. The charisma of the puppet master slams you with mystique, thrill, a little glitter, and with a monumental SHAZAAM, the fairy godmother waves her wand and you have your self a beautiful room!
So why all the hatred? Never mind the fact that I have been trying to get my ground-breaking, pivotal, unprecedented and innovative show since 2006. That's irrelevant when Im trying to make my very pertinent and valuable point. Besides, I've moved on, I have TARGET now. ( I HEART TARGET!) No hatred. I've got nothing but love for HGTV. Really I do. I think they have some well celebrated and noteworthy shows. With about 80% garbage sprinkled in, but the other 20% is good enough material to carry the show, and make me tune in.
I have stupidly succumbed to the idea that each show was respectfully infected with high quality, superior design. These designers being the chosen ones. A blueprint of exceptional and accomplished design. Like a drooling servant I would gaze at the TV safeguarding my new found knowledge of calculated insight, waiting until I too could be an exceptional accomplished designer; a chosen one. Well no more. I have removed my head from the sand (still shaking my pant legs out; how on God's green earth did sand get in there....) I reject and object my thoughts of being an incompetent, substandard designer. The 80% garbage they call a show is nothing more than a vehicle for filler. (of which I will gladly help you bring that down to 75% with my ground breaking, pivotal, unprecedented show; F-O-C-U-S AMANDA!!)
I am good at what I do. It has taken me a LONG time to get to this level of confidence (old age and shear stupidity) But after seeing this show, no need for particulars, I realized that I can do better; all without hesitation or reluctance, I can confidently say this out loud. I am no longer indecisive. Never did I think I would exercise the thought of burdening myself with the responsibility of TRUSTING and INVESTING in self-confidence. After all a women finds self assurance through her husband right? HAHAHAHA! (No thanks I will do it on my own!!) But my husband is my biggest most discerning fan. However, I have decided that I AM the fairest of them all. I have to be. Why else would TARGET choose me? I refuse to stay quiet, but rather candid about how I see it. My flag will continue to fly high ( if I could just figure out how to get this damn contraption to work; where are my pliers?!!) I am shrewd, clever and wickedly talented.....(deep breaths, in out, in out; Holy shit! For the love of GOD, Good GOD did I just say that out loud??!!) But I can't help but feel a little proud and glorious for my new found perspective/enlightenment/shear stupidity. After all I am a DESIGNER, a mystical, creative, creature; the thing legends are made of ....or at least that is what I will tell myself until I pass out from hyperventilation or get stabbed by a pair of pliers trying to get my flag to fly, all because I am in a halfwitted self absorbed state of obtuse ignorance.(Designer is DOWN! I repeat Designer is DOWN)
Amen, sister! I concur wholeheartedly...BTW, don't forget to swing by and celebrate Sx3 with me today. A Tar-Jay Gift Card is at stake!
You are so funny! Love this post. Thanks for stopping by my blog. As a designer I bet you were horrified with one look at my closet. Designer or domestic, I am neither. . .wish I was.

You are just so funny and cute...I love everything you wrote...and thanks so much for coming by to see me today. I appreciate it, SITSA!!
haha! Great post, love your honesty. You know... I don't buy those shows either, haha. I know I can't make the stuff they make #1 cause I'm not that talented #2 I can't make anything and #3 it's more expensive than it looks!
I must tell you though... My friend is on the next season of The Design Star... You should try out for that show!! :)

We are living in an age where ever-increasing and cheaper possibilities in digitisation and imaging are steadily putting academic resources in higher education institutions further and further beyond the access capabilities of visually-impaired students and academics.
We have already arrived at a situation wherein by far the majority of literary and historical resources now available on the internet and on e-learning environments are not accessible because they exist only in image format.
Witness the Google books project as the archetypal example of this. But where is the pressure upon organisations that generate this material to do something about this coming from?
The answer is that no-one is doing it, and why not? Because everyone knows that nothing can now be done. It's already all too late, so we concentrate instead on the same old same old.
Once you've put your project beyond the use of a certain group of individuals, that's it. There is no going back, nor any alternative on offer.
Visually-impaired academics are now many, many times worse off than they were ten years ago, and the major digitisation projects of the future--such as the British Library's project to digitise all British newspapers--are slowly ensuring that the final nails are being hammered into the coffin.
And where are the voices concerning inequality of access being raised? Does anyone hear them, because I can't. The truth is that, like so much in disability culture, in the end we are only interested in changing what we know we can change, and as for the rest, heads are just buried in sand.
question: when the British Library project is finished, why can't I have the same access to the newspapers as my fellow historians? It's as simple as that.

This is one question that everyone must think once in lifetime. Most often we are so occupied in life such that we tend to forget to live. If you are a lifestyle entrepreneur, you will be overloaded with work. Here are some tips to live a sorted life and work for your dreams:
Being a lifestyle entrepreneur, you must also focus on your life. When you choose to take work, always ensure that you lead a life. Once you are done with this you can think how can you fit the work love into life.
You cannot directly jump into work before knowing the reason behind it. You can do a thorough research and analyze your ideas rather than attempting and failing into it. If you are into particular niche, you can ask questions such as:
You need to have a base to promote your business and what better way than a website. Renting a place becomes too expensive. You can create a website that has a Homepage, About Page, Resource Page, product/service page and Contact Us page. These Pages will suffice your purpose.
There is no use of creating a business page and not promoting it. People must be aware that you are a lifestyle entrepreneur and have best of the ideas to assist them. Create a facebook page and keep updating it. Tweet about your latest work and other products and services that you offer.
Thus, being a lifestyle entrepreneur is not easy. However, this is the best way to work into the field that you have always desired for. Do share your feedback with us.
We were up against very powerful forces on the left, and from the corporations and the neoconservative right.
It is a real shame that the neoconservative right did not take up this blog's #NO WAY ESEA banner until virtually the last minute.
Had those groups become involved with our blog right after HR 5 was tabled in February, it is very likely we could have killed this bill hands down.
Let us hope that "they" will not continue to involve themselves in the dialectic (working with the enemy) in order to accomplish their tax-funded school choice and charter schools with unelected boards agenda, which originated with the left many years ago and which has always been the plan to take education decision-making away from the citizens. (Taxation without Representation.)
The United States of America is, we believe, the lone nation which still has true school choice (private education paid for with private money, not tax money). What the government funds the government controls.
The internationalists MUST bring the United States of America on board with tax-funded school choice/charters w/unelected boards in order to implement global workforce training and TOTAL INTERNATIONAL CONTROL OF EDUCATION.
Maybe now, once those well-funded tax-exempt groups have finished licking their wounds, they will join with us to kill S1177.
We are happy that homeschoolers joined with us to try to kill HR5, understanding that "they" also have been targeted by those who want to use ALL our children to spin off profits for the global elite.

Dating back to 1750 Hutchison’s Spiced Ginger Wine has been exported across the globe. It has been used in religious festivals in parts of South America for well over 100 years, and is today available from Australia to China to Canada.
The result is a beautifully balanced ginger drink at 13.5% abv with the mouth feel of a wine yet the aroma and taste of ginger and spices. Produced on a batch to batch basis Hutchison’s differs from lesser ginger wines because of the steeping process which captures all the goodness of this herb in liquid form.
It may be consumed in a variety of ways, from an aperitif to a cocktail to a Hot Toddy. Although tradition suggests ginger wine is a winter warmer, a glass of Hutchison's blended with cranberry or apple juice and soda makes a wonderful summer drink. Being all natural it may be also used in any number of recipes to add the goodness of ginger.
Today Hutchison’s Spiced Ginger Wine is the only commercially produced ginger wine in Scotland and remains consistent with the principles set out by James Hutchison so many years ago.
Toshiba's UK withdrawal puts Cumbria nuclear plant in doubt | | All the news of the world, England, Europe, US on the news portal
Toshiba aims to wind up its UK nuclear business after failing to find a buyer, dealing a potentially fateful blow to plans for a new nuclear power station in Cumbria.
“After all in all the additional costs entailed in continuing to operate NuGen, Toshiba recognises that the economically ratiocinative decision is to withdraw from the UK nuclear power plant construction throw, and has resolved to take steps to wind-up NuGen,” the Toshiba statement bid.
Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) had been a preferred bidder to settle over the nuclear power plant project, but those talks floor through after more than a year of negotiations.
Toshiba conveyed it expected to take a 15bn yen ($131.8m; £100.5m) hit from the withdrawal, but shares in the limited company jumped 12.7% in Tokyo.
“Relying in this way on foreign companies for our country’s essential energy scarcities was always irresponsible,” said its national officer Justin Bowden.
“A new atomic power station in West Cumbria remains vital for the UK’s future pep security and requires urgent action.”
In September NuGen announced it was decrease its team at Moorside from more than 100 to fewer than 40 – primary to speculation the plant’s development was in jeopardy.
NuGen was initially co-owned by Toshiba and the French steady Engie. Toshiba was subsequently forced to buy the remaining 40% of NuGen it did not already own via a bankruptcy train related to Engie.

Le Ballon rouge is a 1956 fantasy featurette directed and written by French filmmaker Albert Lamorisse who is best known for his award winning short films which he began making in the late 1940s.The thirty four minutes short film was about a story between a little boy and a red balloon features their one day adventure.
The film won numerous awards, including an Oscar for Lamorisse for writing the best original screenplay in 1956 and the Palme d'Or for short films at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. The film has also become one of the most popular with children and the educators.
Following the adventure with the boy, ironically we saw the indifference between kid’s world is full of curiosity and love, and on the other hand the adult’s world is cold and mean. Is that because we all lost our innocence and purity along the process of growing up? From the eyes of red balloon, it gave us a preview of the pain that we much go through while entering the adulthood and then question raised, have we already forgotten about how to be curious and what to dream about?
In 2007, referenced by Le ballon rouge, French-Taiwanese film director Hou Hsiao-Hsien directed Flight of the Red Balloon. And, what would we expect to see the world through the red balloon in 2007? We are inquisitive.
We believe that theater and society are closely related. We hunger and seek for the new thinking through different approach of text, we question and explore the present world through the play, we hope and search the way to a be a better man through the reflection between theater and the audience.

But, when you are in a relationship, you take every decision keeping your partner in mind.Whatever you do, you do to make sure you two have a bright future ahead.When two people are dating, they are not on the same page as far as priorities and love are concerned.It might be that one of them is planning to get rid of the other person as soon as the date ends and the other person is head over heels in love with the not-so-interested one.Two people who are in love are passionate about each other not just in bed but even outside it. While a couple is dating, they are not committed to each other.
Then you won't have to check your list of priorities because you will know that any day, on your priority list, your love will be on the top.
You constantly stay in touch and make sure that you are up-to-date about your partner's whereabouts.
Whereas, when you are dating, you are not too much into communication, unless you are free or have started developing feelings for your date.

The history of the automobile holds a special fascination for all age groups. The Mercedes-Benz Museum offers numerous special amenities and services tailored especially to families with children and school classes – from the children’s audio guide through children’s birthday parties to free children’s dishes in the restaurant.
Before they embark on a tour of the museum, children are presented with a “discovery book” at the ticket counter. This free little guide provides children with a fun way to explore the exhibition in keeping with their age. The free audio guide with a special children’s profile is recommended as an alternative for visitors aged six and over. This electronic guide recounts exciting stories in German and English spanning the history of the automobile from its invention to the present day. Alternatively, special guided tours of the exhibition and the “Fascination of Technology” section are available for children, subject to prior appointment.
160 vehicles and a good 1500 exhibits illustrate the history of the Mercedes-Benz brand at the Mercedes-Benz Museum. Apart from the sparkling silver Formula 1 vehicles and fascinating gullwing door models, the star attractions for children are everyday heroes – from refuse trucks through fire-fighting vehicles to the police car. Visitors are free to clamber into various exhibits – a chance for toddlers to play at grown-ups and have their photograph taken with their dream car. A further highlight for the slightly older kids is a trip in a driving simulator, which is available to museum visitors of over 1.40 m (4′ 6”) in height.
Admission to the Mercedes-Benz Museum is free for all children up to the age of 14. Schoolchildren aged 15 and over receive a 50% reduction on the admission price. Groups of schoolchildren enjoy free admission to the museum, subject to prior notification. Family parking spaces in the museum’s multi-storey car park, a barrier-free exhibition and buggies for hire demonstrate the Mercedes-Benz Museum’s child-friendly approach. Mothers’ and babies’ rooms and sanitary facilities are also available on all levels.
The Club at the Mercedes-Benz Museum offers a particularly broad range of activities for children. Children’s workshops are available on a weekly basis, subject to prior registration – from the kids’ mechanics course through the Mini DTM to the museum rally. In the school holidays there are also children’s holiday programmes during which the little ones are looked after as they toy with interesting topics relating to cars and get to make their own airbags, for example. A popular option for girls and boys alike is the opportunity to throw their very own birthday party at the Mercedes-Benz Museum. Parents can attend to the decorations and catering themselves or call on the support of the museum’s staff. After the tour of the museum, kids are then able to set to work themselves and help deck out the premises. And anyone in search of the right gift will find just the thing for kids and adults in the museum shop, with its souvenirs and children’s collection.
Following a tour of the exhibits, the restaurant at the Mercedes-Benz Museum offers a special service, with a choice of three free children’s dishes on offer for children up to 7 years of age who are accompanied by a dining adult. Children’s toilets and high chairs round off the family-oriented amenities.
For school classes, the Mercedes-Benz Museum offers a unique educational service: Prior to visiting the museum, teachers are able to request detailed literature which will enable them to prepare for their visit and to incorporate it into their teaching curriculum. The literature is aimed first and foremost at primary and secondary school classes.
Teachers can use it to prepare their classes either in unabridged form or as extracts. On arriving at the museum, school classes are welcomed personally and shown a short introductory film. Schoolchildren are then able to explore the museum on their own, with the aid of various booklets dedicated to specific topics. The selected topics are based on the curricula of the state of Baden-Württemberg and cover the areas of Inventors, Motorsport and Safety. The literature for pupils and teachers is provided free of charge

In the early 1900’s, there was an organization known as the Ashbridge’s Sailing Skiff Club (ASSC). At one point, a family by the name of Brotherton presented a trophy to ASSC, which was named the “Brotherton Trophy”.
In 1934, two years after the founding of the ABYC, some of the members of the former ASSC presented the Brotherton Trophy to the ABYC. As a mark of appreciation for this gift, the ABYC decided to adopt the general configuration of the old ASSC burgee. Hence, our own pennant-shaped style, a gold field with a black diamond and our letters, “ABYC”.
A lifebuoy was the first symbol to be considered by the Club. This popular symbol seemed to be used by everyone to express anything nautical, whether for purposes related to sailing or to commerce.
Members, however, chose the seahorse as the club’s insignia, as it seemed to better represent the prognosis of the Club’s health at the time, in that:

Jackson was quick voice his distain for the amendment, saying the alteration will affect the dynamic of the game.
"It changes the game," Jackson told Tim Graham of the Buffalo News. "You're going to second-guess yourself when you're in the open field. When you're one-on-one with a guy who's going to lower his shoulder into you, now you can't lower your head.
"If you lower your shoulder and make the wrong contact with him, you're going to get the penalty. It's just going to play in the back of your mind.”
Jackson is a physical back. According to Pro Football Focus, he forced the most missed tackles of any running back between 2009 and 2011, and he did so despite ranking only 14th overall in touches. In 2011 alone, Jackson averaged 3.75 yards after contact, way more than any other back in the league.
Jackson acknowledged that changing his ways probably won’t happen quickly, and he’s planning on keeping some extra dough handy just in case his old habits are hard to break.
"I'm just going to set aside some fine money because I know I'll probably get fined a couple of times," Jackson said. "It's hard for a person to change who they are when they're running the football. I like to consider myself a physical back."
The Buffalo Bills' offense capped off the end of training camp with a little prank on its faithful leader Wednesday, posterizing coach Doug Marrone on camera inside the St. John Fisher facility.
Marrone was able to laugh off the joke, but that doesn't mean there isn't some retaliation in the mix.
" I think for the most part he’s (Fred Jackson) made great decisions, except one," Marrone joked with reporters when asked about the veteran's presence in the locker room. "We all know about it, we just talked about it. That was a poor decision for everybody on offense, not just Fred.
"It was embarrassing. So I told those guys, ‘Well you better watch out’ because as the coach I started thinking a little bit about is the practice going to run long or are they going to run more? I like going through the locker room, I don’t like getting dunked on."
Evidence of the caper was caught on tape by Stevie Johnson and posted online via Vine. Fellow receiver T.J. Graham had a main role in the prank as well, holding the basket over Marrone's head while Jackson soared over him from behind.
Retaliation aside, Marrone brought up the incident to illustrate the team building that's occurred over the offseason, particularly the role that veterans like Jackson and Johnson have taken in bringing the team closer in the locker room.
"If we can establish that closeness when we go back, obviously that helps and then when you get adversity, the senior leadership has to kick in," he said. "We as coaches can’t be around them the whole time."
The Bills are hoping their tight-knit offense can make some noise this weekend in what many tout as the most crucial game of the preseason, their third game against the Washington Redskins. With a day off Thursday, the team will hold a walkthrough practice Friday before heading to the District for a 4:30 p.m. kickoff Saturday.

Looking gorgeous every day is what any woman wants but, like all things in life, it comes at a price. Unless you have unlimited funds, you’ll probably have to make choices you don’t want to make when it comes to clothes and makeup. There are, however, tips and tricks you can use to save money on both. Here are some of them:
Mascara is a must for any beauty-conscious lady. To make it last longer, add a few drops of saline solution (contact lense wearers use it) in the bottle to make it look as good as new. Also, if it’s started to dry up and look clumpy, put the bottle in a cup of hot water for a couple of minutes.
Instead of spending money on pricey, branded makeup removers simply use a no-tears baby shampoo or baby oil (or you can also use such natural oils as olive oil, coconut oil or sweet almond oil). These products are gentle on the skin and just as effective as the branded products. Plus, if you use the baby oil, you wont’ need additional moisturising after removing your makeup.
To get more out of your liquid bronzer, buy a shade that’s a bit darker than you usually use, then mix it with some kind of moisturiser. This will get you the shade you want and it will make it last much longer. You can also get a few shades by adding different amounts of moisturiser.
Unless you live and work in a very polluted city, you don’t have to wash your hair every day. Washing it less frequently will do it good, as overwashing messes up the production of oils that keep it healthy and your scalp glands start producing oils excessively to compensate. Once every three days or every other day should suffice.
Coconut oil is a great multifunctional substance. So here is another one of best money saving tips: instead of buying lip balm, heel softener and makeup remover separately – and more expensively – get yourself a jar of Coconut oil and use it for all three things. You might be surprised with the results.
Applying liquid foundation with a makeup sponge is a wasteful practice, as the sponge absorbs some of the foundation. Using a brush or even a cotton pad instead will give you the amount your face needs with much less waste, so the foundation will last longer.
You can easily combine a few remaining lipstick shades to make a new one, using them more effectively. How? Cut them off, melt in the microwave, then put them in a suitable container and apply like lip balm. Lipsticks are mostly made from a type of wax, so you can experiment with colours easily.
When shopping for clothes, take note of the fabric – sensitive ones like silk and wool require frequent maintenance at the dry cleaner’s, so even if you get the item with a discount, the ongoing costs will make it much more costly in the long run.
We don’t usually think about clothes and supermarkets in the same sentence but many offer some pretty good bargains. You just need to keep an eye on them. By pretty good bargains we mean a good ratio between quality, style and price, of course.
Whenever you come across an item with the design and colour that you need, at a reasonable price, make sure you get more than one, just in case, and for colour variety reasons. After all, it may shrink in the washing machine, you can’t know this in advance.
We suppose you know it but it bears repeating. Second-hand shops are a great way to find a unique item of clothing cheaply. Of course, it also takes a bit of luck but finding like-new quality clothes in thrift shops happens more often than you may think.
There are hundreds of websites where you can offer for sale clothes you no longer want to wear. That’s especially suitable for those among us who feel the urge to completely change their wardrobe every season. Get a deal out of your old, or not so old, clothes.
If you take good care of your clothes, they will last you for years and years (provided they’re made from quality fabrics). So, make sure you wash them as instructions say on the label and don’t iron them unless you really have to.
While it’s true that you may not be fully aware of what you will want for the next spring season, shopping out of season can get you quality stuff at discount prices. If you think about it, unless you’re a blind follower of fashion fads, you’ll be pretty clear what boots you’d like for next winter.
With the right accessory, one dress can become several different outfits. Invest some money in things like scarves, jewellery, and belts, to combine as you like for different occasions. Accessories are as a rule longer-lasting than clothes, and they’re low on maintenance as well.

Can I just be the first to say, excellent work everyone. It's been great to see people putting in the effort and as just rewards we're an official LoCo again! Members of the council also wanted to pass on how excited they were about the activity starting to be generated from our LoCo and how happy they are that they were able to re-approve us. Now all we need to do is keep up the effort so our next re-approval is smooth sailing. An extra reason to celebrate at the Release Parties (come on Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra, Hobart and the rest, where are your parties going to be?).
Thus tweeted Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday, promptly sending the stock market, the internet, and business journalism into a collective tizzy. The markets even temporarily halted trading in Tesla stock until the initial dust settled.
Taking Tesla private is a pretty wild idea. Observers are still scratching their heads as to how exactly Musk could pull this off. No one has ever taken a public company private at this scale or under these circumstances before.
Public companies face profoundly different (and often worse) pressures than privately held companies do. With a public company, ownership stakes are constantly and speculatively traded on the public stock market. A big company usually has many, many investors — or big institutions representing many, many investors. The churn in ownership is tremendous, and the reason for buying or dumping a stock is often quite capricious. That creates enormous and often counterproductive volatility.
"As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla," Musk wrote in a memo to Tesla employees. "Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term."
Whatever you may make of Musk, he clearly has a vision beyond simply making a quick buck. He wants to revolutionize our energy and transportation systems and make them renewable and carbon free, so they no longer threaten the climate or the planetary ecosystem. That's a massive, transformative project — one that will demand big risks and investments that could only pay off a long way down the line.
The electric carmaker has been mired in a Herculean effort to begin mass manufacturing of the Model 3, Tesla's offering for the middle-class market. The company is burning through mountains of cash, and its stock is laden by more and more predictions of doom.
Musk owns about 20 percent of Tesla. Insiders and individual investors own another 17 percent. The rest is owned by major investment institutions. In other words, most of Tesla's owners likely don't really care about Musk's mission and are just there for some payouts. A lot of Musk's cantankerous and erratic behavior can probably be explained by the frustrations resulting from that collision.
Obviously, no shareholders are going to put up with no return on their investment forever. But insiders and direct private investors — rather than drive-by stock buyers — are much more likely to have bought in, to some degree, to Musk's vision, and thus to give him a lot more patience and leeway.
The details of Musk's plan haven't really been fleshed out yet. It sounds like he'd prefer that all of Tesla's public shareholders voluntarily switch over and continue as private shareholders. That seems highly unlikely. And offering $420 per share would be a serious bonus over Tesla's current stock price of roughly $380. Obviously, the hope here is that anyone who's just in it for the payout will take the money and run. That would leave Tesla's ownership comprised entirely of those who, like Musk, are true believers in Tesla's mission.
The buyout he's proposing would cost tens of billions of dollars, and no one's quite sure where he's getting the money (though Saudi Arabia has been reported as a possibility). Musk will also need to get the current owners to vote in favor of the move. That won't be an easy sell, though the generous $420-per-share offer should help with that.
Furthermore, these sorts of buyouts usually rely on loans from banks — and they usually demand evidence of regular positive cash flow before they'll sign on. But Tesla's in the red right now. (It lost more than $700 million last quarter.) Its sales are rising, but it's also plowing massive amounts of money into its Model 3 efforts. Various individual investors may well be willing to take the risk regardless. But the banks are another story.
Musk had better be right that the funding is lined up somehow. Because if he's wrong, the fact that he tweeted out "funding secured" could very well open him up to charges of securities fraud. There will almost certainly be lawsuits regardless.
This is a risky gambit, to put it mildly. And frankly one in keeping with Musk's, shall we say, less-than-grounded demeanor. But if Tesla is to be run in the name of a transformative mission, not just raw profits, it probably has a better chance by going back into private hands.
Let’s be real, Mondays are usually the worst. But they’re a whole lot better when you have a fresh crop of new songs to jam to! Meet this week’s additions…
I challenge you to try not to dance to this the next time it pops on in the car…it simple can’t be done. (Not for me, at least) Have we found this summer’s “Despacito?” Looks likely and I’m 100% down with it.
This is Ari’s first new track since 2016 and since the horrific bombing during her “Dangerous Woman” tour stop in Manchester. While I really want to root for her, I’d be lying if I said this track didn’t underwhelm me. The girl has some serious pipes, but they’re not really put to much use in this one.
Move over “God’s Plan,” this might actually be my new favorite Drake song. The music video alone is a phenomenal showcase of women of all varieties being their amazing selves and living life. Not to mention this song knocked his previous single off to take the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Not bad, Drizzy.
I’m not sure what to say about this one other than that if you were even a small fan of the Cranberries, it’s probably going to gut you right in the feelings. The song was originally meant to be a collaboration with Bad Wolves and singer Dolores O’Riordan. Tragically, O’Riordan passed away on the very day she was set to record her vocals on this cover. None the less, Bad Wolves have done a tremendous job of honoring her with this one and I’m thrilled to have it on the airwaves. Listen. Have deep feels. Repeat.
Lastly, the Weeknd lives up the theme of his latest album with this one. Melancholy is an understatement. For real, I haven’t quite decided if I dig this one or not. I’m pretty sure we’re all thinking the same thing though…Hi, Selena?

Woodberry Learning Centre (WLC) was established in 2007. It is a school for up to 21 students between Years 5-8 who have been unable to be maintained in their mainstream schools due to their inappropriate and unacceptable behaviours. Students usually arrive at WLC feeling disenfranchised and disengaged from their learning. They have low self esteem and failure identities. Our job is to create positive relationships with our students so we can help them to improve educational outcomes and, just as importantly, to believe in themselves and to realize that no matter what has gone on before, their future is spotless, it starts at this moment and is in their hands to choose what it will be.

Nuit de Longchamp, a 'night at the races'. Longchamp is the famous Parisian race course in the Bois de Boulogne, venue for the greatest French horse race of the season, the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe
This fragrance was first created in 1934 to celebrate the famous horse race at the Longchamp racetrack in Paris, followed by a sumptuous soirée. In pre-war days this had been one of the most exclusive evening parties of the year, to which the international set flocked in their numbers. Its crowning was a huge firework display which inspired the original bottle. Nuit de Longchamp was released worldwide in 1937.
Nuit de Longchamp has graced the shoulders of elegant women since this time, like a magnificent garden of white flowers blooming in the twilight. From the African shores of the Mediterranean and the Ottoman gardens, Lubin has used only the most precious flowers and balsams which capture the hearts of women everywhere.
"Fragile but whole. Its name hints at a break but before the fissures show, its first two syllable conjure Orpheus, a poet who could charm even stones."
L'Orpheline ('the orphan' - perfumer: Chris Sheldrake) indeed hints at perfume split in two. It opens with a fresh mint, herby almost lavendar green fougere derived from a blast of aldehydes and coumarin, but this is quickly followed by a warm musky churchy incense cloud of woody cedar, patchouli and ambergris. The juxtaposition of these two contrasting notes - fresh and warm - perhaps continues a theme started earlier by Serge Lutens in his Serge L'eau offerings of mint and musk, but has evolved and become fuller in concept. As always with Serge and Chris, there is also then the twist - a hint of flint, metallic like a little jolt of electricty running through the woods. Like a mint tea on his Moroccan terrace, after recent floral explorations, Serge has returned to North African themes - a big warm woody scent with hints of fresh greenery.
Visitors to our Sidmouth shop often ask the provenance of our perfumes, noting the dominance of French and Italian houses on our shelves. "Have you no English perfumes?" they ask. Well, as a matter of fact we do: we have Grossmith of London (founded in 1835 and relaunched in 2008), and we have Ruth Maestenbrooke, and then there's Mark Buxton, the British perfumer in the trio of perfumers behind Linari, and of course Chris Sheldrake is British and responsible for some of Serge Luten's greatest hits. But compared to the overwhelming preponderance of French and Italian perfume houses, hasn't England a rather poor showing?
We explain to our clients that the reason for this is that our climate is against us. With the exception of Yardley, who made his name promoting English (Norfolk) Lavender perfumes at the end of the nineteenth century (Norfolk lavender was always considered superior to French because the cooler climate made better oils), we have no tradition of growing the ingredients for perfumes; hence no tradition of making them. That stock answer, however, is about to change.
Product development A new venture called Parterre is redefining our preconceptions. Parterre launched in October 2017. Working from a 50 acre estate in Dorset, England, Parterre sow, nurture, harvest and distill on site the key ingredients for their perfumes. And the results are astonishing. The cultivation of almost 2000 aromatic plants has been overseen with expertise from the Royal Horticultural Society, and after small batch distillation of the flowers when they have reached peak condition, the oils are then transported to France for blending. The inspiration behind each of the first three perfumes produced by Parterre is uniquely English, but it has been interpretted by Jacques Chabert, the top French 'nose' behind Chanel's "Cristalle" and Guerlain's "Samsara", among many others.
Perfumer Jacques Chabert We read in the press of the increasing success of the British wine producers of Kent who are creating sparkling wines to rival the French producers of premier cru Champagne. Well, it has just happened with perfume too. Parterre's first three perfumes are truly outstanding. They are in a class of their own and if you haven't visited the shop yet to get these under your nose, a special trip will not be unrewarded. Vibrant, deep and rich, capturing the very essence of the English meadows by the river, and of the locally cultivated flowers grown there that went into them, these perfume are truly an olfactory sensation. You can read more about this exciting range here, but better still, get down to Sidmouth this autumn; summer in the English meadow has been captured and preserved.
Since discovering Woodforde & Co in Sidmouth, I know where to go to find my perfect perfume. This charming emporium is located in Church Street and is run by husband and wife, Jon and Jane Brewer, both of whom have an encyclopaedic knowledge and an enthusiastic passion for perfumery.
Practical Woodworking is a 50 hour comprehensive course that focuses on the necessary skills, tools, techniques, and safety to successfully enter the world of woodworking and furniture making. Beginner, intermediate, and advanced students learn about furniture design, construction, and finishing as well as wood behavior, hand tools, machines, milling from the rough, squaring, and joinery. It is an intensive class for folks who want to continue woodworking in the future. It is a week of hard work with a lot of fun mixed in. Watch the video and read below for a more in-depth look at what we're all about.
Isn’t this amazing that instead of having to throw that old furniture piece away, you can now reuse it to build something even more beautiful? If you do not like this particular idea, there are many other re-purposeful furniture items you can build from an old dresser. Just search the internet for other DIY project ideas. Here is a link to the video tutorial that explains the same procedure in a more practical manner that you can easily follow through.
Chris I blame you for all these altars that are being built today and now you thinks we over thinks ’em–huh. You whipped the masses into a frenzy— now Woodworkers are trying to out pretty each other–out wood species each other –out Rube Goldberg each other. I made 2 benches in 30 years neither had a through dovetail but many were made on them and I have no idea but I would bet a dollar that neither weighed 280 pounds but they both had tons of wood on them. If you want the bench as a destination god bless but it was intended as a mean. Thats my rant I could be wrong
Put the upper panel of MDF on your glue-up surface, bottom side up. Put the bottom panel of MDF on your other surface, bottom side down. (The panel with the holes drilled in it is the bottom panel, and the side that has the your layout diagram on it is the bottom side.) Chuck up in your drill the appropriate driver bit for the screws your using. Make sure you have a freshly-charged battery, and crank the speed down and the torque way down. You don't want to over-tighten the screws, MDF strips easily.
I made a low table out of a couple of step-stools, my hollow-core door, and one of the MDF panels that would eventually form part of my top. I was concerned that any oil that dripped on the door might interfere with its glue adhesion, when I finally get around to the project for which I'd purchased it. The top side of the top sheet of MDF, though, I planned to oil, anyway. (Ditto for the bottom side of the bottom sheet.
Our instructors work out of a 27,000 square-foot facility, where over 100 stationary and portable woodworking machines are available. We emphasize hands-on training and real-world experience, and all classes are project-focused. Over forty different classes cover topics including faceframe and frameless cabinet construction, CNC woodworking, architectural millwork, table and casegood construction, hand tools, woodturning, and veneering.

It’s easy to get started–just select your new shed style, color and options, complete the online application here, schedule delivery and you are ready to begin the journey to your storage solution today! * Elite style sheds are not part of Rent-to-Own Storage Sheds. Rent-to-Own Sheds can be chosen up to $10,000.
Can you believe that this amazing wine rack the image below has been built using old wood pallets? Perhaps you can. Isn’t it wonderful that your old wood pallets can be reused to build something so beautiful and useful? I am not a drinker but I liked the idea so much that I just couldn’t resist making myself one. Although later I gifted it to my parents, who totally loved it.
On completion, you will graduate with a set of self-made tools, fixtures and storage units (not to mention the skills required to build them) that will serve and last you the rest of your life. You’ll be amply prepared to continue your woodworking education into specific trades such as architectural woodworking (finish work); custom door and window construction; solid-wood furniture and cabinetry; and boatbuilding. Over the course, we invite guest lecturers from the community to share their experience of becoming vocational woodworkers in these trades.
The procedure is very easy to understand and follow for anyone with a little woodworking knowledge. Make sure to collect all the items you need before you start with the project. You may even ask Tracy your queries directly in the comment section of the tutorial post. Or you can ask them here. Either way, I hope that you manage to build this one nicely.
Our programs prepare our students to open their own woodworking business or become employed by a high-end woodworking related business. We currently offer an Associate of Science Degree as well as a Certificate of Achievement in 8 different Program Areas. Students may also take coursework to complete a Certificate. Our courses range from Furniture Design and Instrument Making to Production Cabinetmaking.   Our graduates are highly employable with the diversity of courses available.
You can transfer a graphic on any wood piece of your choice, including a frame, top of a table, etc. The surface should be clean and big enough for the graphic paper. I am also sharing a video tutorial here that explains in detail the process of transferring any graphic to a wooden surface using a freezer paper. Just gather the items you need and follow this video to carve your favorite designs on your favorite wood items.
Put the countertop on the base, put the MDF on top of the countertop, and line up the marks you drew on each end of the MDF with the countertop below it. When you have it lined up, clamp things down, and route the edge of the MDF using a 1-1/2" or longer flush-trim bit, with the depth adjusted so the bearing rides on the countertop. I clamped a couple of scraps of doubled MDF at each end to give the router base something extra to ride on at the ends.
With the inner jaw fastened to the bench, I used the router to flush-trim the jaw to the benchtop, across the top and down the sides adjacent to the top (stopping short of the discontinuity between the top and the legs). I'd thought this would be the best way to match up the jaw against the top, but I'd not do it this way again. It was very difficult to hold the router tight against the face of the jaw, and the result was a surface that wasn't as even as I had hoped.
Traditionally woodworkers (joiners) learnt their craft working as an apprentice in the Master Craftsman's shop doing the grunt work and learning by assimilation over many years. Our approach is a little different. We're making the assumption that you're smart; are developing or already have a passion for woodworking; and can devote three months to intensive learning.
This class is open to novice woodworkers and to more experienced woodworkers who would like to broaden (or simplify) their approach to woodworking. What do we mean by novice? We think it means you are a person who has decided to commit to learning new skills; to growing a passion for the craft of working with wood; and has a strong sense of the limitations of your own knowledge.
Of course, few benches can be ideal, and this one does have some drawbacks. That being said, most of the disadvantages of this bench are minor annoyances rather than deal breakers. For instance, this bench does not include any kind of storage whatsoever. Though, it does have the option of adding numerous additional features like a storage area. Still, for the bench, you would expect a drawer at the very least, maybe a shelf below the main table area.
This particular tray is made using reclaimed barn wood but the author of the project Beyond The Picket Fence surprised everyone with one fact: reclaimed barn wood has often some areas turned pink due to cow urine. If you check the project more closely, you’ll also notice some areas of the tray being almost bright pink. That’s something you don’t see every day!
All-in-all, the Windsor Design workbench is a nice companion, especially if your budget is limited. It is not as deeply designed and perfected as the other two benches, as there is only one vice, the bench dog holes are drilled through the surface (allowing debris to fall to the top drawers) and the drawers can be a little flimsy if you are not using glue for assembling it, but for the price they offer, there are plenty of perks.
I wanted the left edge of the jaw of the front vise to be flush with the left edge of the top, the right edge with the left edge of the left front leg. So the amount of overhang on the left depends upon the width of the front vise jaw. The width of the jaw is, at a minimum, the width of the plate that supports it, but it's normal to make the jaw extend a bit beyond the plate. How far? The more it extends, the deeper a bite you can take with the edge of the vise, when, for example, you are clamping the side of a board being held vertically. But the more it extends, the less support it has. I decided to extend by 1-12", which gives me a 2-1/2" bite, and which should still provide solid support, given that the jaw is 1-1/2" thick. This means the top needs a left overhang of 12-1/4".
Turning an old door into a photo frame is another easy woodwork project. All you need is an old door and some woodworking tools and items. I am here sharing the link to the source tutorial that explains the step by step procedure for building a picture frame from an old wooden door. This tutorial was originally written by Tracy Snyder at athomewithsweett.blogspot.com who also tells you what items you may need and where to find them. If you haven’t already got an old door, you can purchase one from websites like Craigslist.
I marked out the one hole location, drilled a shallow 1/16" hole into the top. I then put a 1/16" bit through the hole in my template and into the hole I had just drilled. I lined up the template, and drilled a second hole, then put another bit through that. From then on, I worked entirely from the template. With two bits through the holes pinning the template in place, the other holes in the template would be precisely located (or so the theory goes) on a 4x4" grid.
Cut 15 top boards 5 ft. long and rip them to 3 in. wide with a table saw so the top will glue up flat without the typical rounded edges of 2x4s. For the leg slot, cut two of the top boards into three pieces: a 39-in. middle piece and two 7-in. end pieces. Glue and screw the top together, one board at a time, with 3-in. deck screws, keeping the ripped edge facing up and level with the adjoining boards. Use a corded drill so there’s plenty of oomph to drive each screw below the surface. Note that the third glue-up from each end is where each leg notch is inserted. You can also create a nifty tool tray in the top by notching the three top pieces with a jigsaw. Clamp every 8 in. or so before driving in the 3-in.deck screws. Predrill the screw holes near the ends to prevent splitting. When you’re screwing on the 7-in. long 2x4s to create the leg slots, use a scrap piece of 2×4 as a spacer.
There is a mandatory safety class you have to take where they walk you around the shop and make sure that you know how each major machine works and general shop safety. You also have to sign a waiver saying you are participating at your own risk. You DO NOT have to take that safety class if you are signing up for one of their classes. They will cover those basics during the class.
I live in the second rainiest city in the country, Pensacola, so I am used to dealing with wet. I literally work out of my garage (read storage area, small woodwork area, washer/dryer...car? ). I wheel bigger tools and table out to the little covered area in front of the garage. I have an 8 x 10 aluminum shed that is strictly garden stuff storage. I mention this for two reasons.
Okay, at that point, we'd only been married a few weeks, but I didn't except the namecalling to start so soon!
It was a sort of reverse-endearment that I'd heard Mirax call her husband, Corran. Corran didn't really care for it, and his wife brought it out when she was irritated at him. She called him other things if she was really peeved.
As for my wife, she does as many women do to their children, and refers to me by my full name when I'd committed a heinous misstep. "Wedge Wyns Antilles!" she'd holler. It always made me cringe, since I hadn't told anyone my middle name. (For those of you who hadn't realized, that's how I managed to find my sister, Syal Wynssa Antilles ...)
So to refer to me as a "thing" as opposed to a "who" was a large shift. What's more, she seemed to be emphasizing the relationship of this "thing" relative to her ... that can't be good, right?
She was pointing to a holo above her desk, showing our credits accounts. She has a complex way of figuring out where money goes and from where. When we had decided to get married  albeit not very long ago  I had happily surrendered by meager earnings to her care; I was never good at looking after credits.
I tried to track where her finger was leading my eye. Not that it was easy to follow a line, her hand was shaking! Of course, that meant she was really, really pissed off at me. I tried hard to remember if I'd spent anything I shouldn't have ...
"Twenty thousand daktaris ... did you think I'd be blinded by the amount and not notice??" The shaking had translated from her quivering finger into her voice.
I kept staring at the floating numbers, trying to locate the number "20,000" somewhere in the general area where she was pointing.
"It's a payment that dates back from before Adumar, nothing to do with you," I explained, referring to the mission where we'd run into one another and had, in the face of death, decided we were in love and couldn't live without each other. Was it only weeks ago? At that moment, it felt more like months!
She had stopped pointing and was standing with her arms crossed before her. I think she was still shaking. "It's to Dr. Qui Xux." She pronounced each syllable as if they were undesired fishbones.
"Like I said, from before 'us'." I was having trouble understanding why she was being like this. It had nothing to do with her and me!
"We couldn't afford to have a proper wedding, and you're paying a debt to Qwi?? Couldn't you have waited?" I could see that Iella was really working herself up. "Couldn't you have told me about it so I could budget?"
"No," I replied, trying to sound logical and matter-of-fact. "I thought it'd be a good idea to get it paid out. You know, start fresh with you."
"I didn't even know you owed her money! Why on earth would you borrow so much from her?" Iella was not giving this up.
"Um ... I didn't borrow it from her," I tried to defend myself, but I knew I'd made a mistake because Iella's fair skin was transmogrifying alarmingly through the red-end of the visible light spectrum.
"Oh? Did you buy something? And what would the great Wedge Wyns Antilles have bought from an impoverished Omwat?" I hated that Iella worked for Intelligence and knew anything about anything she wanted to know about. If she said Qwi was impoverished, it was likely the case. In fact, I knew it to be true.
"That's the point, Iella. Qwi has nothing to her name other than her skills and what the New Republic had given her "
Iella interrupted me with a loud sniff and perfectly enunciated words. "Including giving her a body guard!"
As clueless as I can be sometimes, even I understood that Iella was talking about me. I had been assigned as Qwi's bodyguard. I could not pretend it might have been someone else.
"Please, sit down," I tried to use a technique to calm people captured in the heat of battle. Of course, Iella hadn't been recently promoted to Director of Intelligence for no small reason.
"If you do not explain this to me this VERY instant, I will not only divorce you, I will beat the crap out of you!" This was no idle threat; Iella could kick the crap out of me without so much as trying.
She looked more furious, so I did as my fellow Corellians had told me to do  talk faster! I figure any advice regarding handling a wife, as offered by Han Solo or Corran Horn, had to be useful.
"Iella, please ... there is nothing untoward about that payment! She had nothing after Kyp had destroyed her memories ... I mean, she only had me. People said she was taking advantage of me, but I have to tell you, that's not true. I got as much out of my relationship with Qwi as she did from me, and before you accuse me of being a cad, it was that she totally needed me. Truly and wholly, I was her whole world, and it was a wonderful feeling, after destroying and killing for nearly half of my life ... she was life to me. Surely, you must understand." I was babbling like a cretin; I was babbling to save my life!
It must have been working, because the tic in Iella's cheek was slowing. She seemed less full of vitriole, so she didn't seem so enormous! So I kept talking:
"She and I, it wasn't in the cards though. She knew it from the start I think, and eventually I knew it, too. But I wasn't ready to let go, and neither was she, so we let things be. And one day, she said to me, 'I don't know what will become of me when you leave. I have nothing, no memory of what I once knew  I'll have to return to school. I've registered for some courses at a local institution. They're cheaper than the university.'
"I realize now that this was the first step she was making to become independent of me. But I wasn't ready for that. I needed to have her cleave to me ... so I made a promise: I told her that I'll always care for her, regardless of the future. And to prove it, I would pay for her education till she got to a point where she was the learned genius she was before her memories were destroyed.
"She didn't want to accept it, but she also admitted that it was an offer she couldn't refuse ... and she promised to work toward regaining her learning, and to not waste my faith in her."
Iella had stopped crossing her arms at his point, but I didn't know that it was an improvement. She was staring hard at me, her mouth agape, as if she was looking at a particularly offensive and stupid animal. "Cleave her to you, why you " she sputtered. So I kept talking:
"It was the most generous gift I could think of ... because I wasn't willing to marry her. I knew it then, I think. That was when I started to think of you, Iella ... I realized that I couldn't spend my life living with one woman ... when I was in love with another."
Iella's mouth was closing slowly and her lips had less of that tautly pulled look. I was doing pretty well, I thought!
"It wasn't just daktaris, don't you understand? I wanted to be responsible for recreating something the galaxy needed! I had been working as a builder and architect then, remember? I thought it was something I had in my blood, but I found out the hard way that I sucked at it. No building I designed remains standing; I was arrogant to think it was something which could be done by a former pilot.
"I was desperate to ensure I left something to the galaxy that was positive in a purely altruistic way. I wasn't going to marry Qwi, I knew it then. And even if I did, we could never have children ... so there was nothing I could leave to the galaxy.
"You have to understand at the time, I thought for sure I had lost you. I hadn't seen or heard from you since ... well, really since Diric died. I was sure you didn't want me. That's why I started dating Qwi in the first place, because the torch I held for you had been extinguished. The memory of what I'd lost with you ... well, I thought I should try to light another, even if the light it produced was nothing compared to the smouldering ember left by your rejection ..."
It was working  Iella's featured had softened and her intense stare had become bright. A sure sign that tears were forming!
"But it's impossible to extinguish the truth, isn't it? It's why I've fought for so long. Because the galaxy deserved truth over tyranny ... and in dating Qwi, I not only realized that I loved you still, but that I had loved you always.
"So ... I hope you understand ... I had to give her the credits for her education. It was the least I could do, but the most I could afford. She was good to me, and I wanted to be responsible for her success and her contributions to the galaxy. Even if that meant she'd leave me behind forever. I didn't know I could win you back ..."
It worked! Iella was crying. I moved in to embrace her  softly! Han has warned me about grabbing too fast or too hard when a woman was acting unsettled about you. Han is a wise man.
"But," she sniffled, "promise me this is the end of your investment in her ... or in any other woman, you generous swine!"
She said it in a beautiful, loving way, so I promised as she asked. "And remember," I added, whispering in what I hoped was a husky, romantic manner, "I promised on our wedding day that, 'I forsake all others, and cleave only unto you ...' I meant it then, and I'll mean it forever, Iella."

My love of brown eggs goes way back to when I was a little girl and lived next door to a man who raised chickens in his backyard. My sister and I would often feed the chickens. Mom would give us each a handful of dry dog food and we would drop it one piece at a time through the fence. The chickens loved it and the man didn't mind.
Occasionally he would come to our house with a carton or two of fresh eggs--always brown. The eggs we bought at the store were white, so in my young mind, fresh eggs were brown and store-bought were white.
Still to this day I prefer brown eggs. They are more special than white ones to me, so that's what I buy. Even though nutritionally and taste-wise there is no difference, I'll pay extra for them just because of a happy childhood memory.
Around here brown eggs are all that's available unless it's Easter and then the stores are loaded with white ones. I buy my eggs from my friend Sharon and her chickens lay blue and green ones!
My Grandma Josephine always had chickens and they laid mostly brown eggs too. I prefer them to this day as well.
We buy mostly brown-egg laying hens for this exact reason - people tend to associate white eggs with the grocery store and brown eggs as more fresh and wholesome. Plus I think they're pretty, they tend to have variations in color and such.
ps. I FINALLY got your pattern that you won in the mail a couple days ago. I threw in a few little goodies for you as well. : )
I like brown eggs, too. We used to buy them fresh from a local farmer when we lived in NY, and in VA a friend sold us brown eggs from her hens.
I guess that explains my preference for brown eggs, too. My daddy always raised chickens when I was young, as did one of my grandmothers. There was nothing quite so thrilling to me as a tot as to get to collect the eggs from the henhouse. There was something almost magical about finding those eggs, especially the ones laid somewhere other than than on the hen's nests! :-)
Ha Ha, another connection between us. I pay a little extra to buy brown eggs too...cagefree ones, although I'm not so sure that that means they're as happy as I imagine they are.
The Edelweiss Restaurant does sound like a fun experience. My husband's family is German, so I always want to incorporate a little German culture into our lives, but German food is sooooo heavy.
I'm partial to brown eggs too, they don't show up as well after dark when your trying to sneak some out of the chicken coop.
I like your pretty blue bowl ;o) I prefer brown eggs too! But I also like the blueish green ones that are from local family farms too :o)
Nothing better than farm fresh eggs. We used to have chickens and I would get at least a dozen per day. Because I had so many my family and friends always had a fresh supply.

Volvo Driverless Future, are we Ready? The history of autonomous vehicles dates back to the 1970s in Japan, and various projects are currently underway at universities, research institutes and high-tech companies around the world. Volvo's vision of combining a well-trained professional driver with increased automation is being realized through the SARTRE (Safe Road Trains for the Environment) project. The idea behind the project is to develop a technology for vehicle platooning -- that is, a convoy where a professional driver in a lead vehicle drives a line of other vehicles. Each vehicle in the convoy measures the distance, speed and direction to the car in front, and adjusts accordingly. The vehicles are not physically attached to each other and can leave the procession at any time. But once in the platoon, the following drivers can relax and do other things while the platoon proceeds towards its destination under the expert guidance of the lead driver. Platooning is expected to deliver a number of benefits: road safety will improve as the human factor is minimized; fuel consumption -- and therefore also CO2 emissions -- will be reduced by up to 20 percent; Additionally, road congestion will be reduced as vehicles will be only a few meters apart; finally, the drivers of the following vehicles will be able to rest, work or eat. The technology has been successfully tested with one car following the lead vehicle. However, Public acceptance and the relevant legislation may be longer in coming.

"A turn toward the northwest is expected on Wednesday, followed by a turn to the north-northwest on Thursday". Storm surge is also likely to be an issue, but which locations see surge, and how high it is, will depend on the exact track of the storm. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months, and most of an area hit by a Category 5 hurricane will be uninhabitable for weeks or months, the weather service added. It's possible Oahu and Kauai may later be included in an advisory for the hurricane.
Heavy rainfall associated with Lane is expected to affect portions of the Hawaiian Islands from Wednesday into the weekend, leading to flash flooding and landslides.
Honolulu, the state's largest city and capital, is on the island of O'ahu. "Large and potentially damaging surf" will affect exposed shorelines facing the west, south and east, the NWS said.
With maximum sustained winds of 160 miles per hour, Lane was upgraded to the highest level on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale as it surged westerly across the Pacific Ocean toward the Big Island.
In other words, Lane is likely to maintain hurricane strength when it makes a close approach or direct strike on the Big Island on Thursday.
According to the latest forecast track, Lane is slated to remain a unsafe hurricane when its center moves very close or over parts of the state Thursday through Saturday.
Regulators can conduct studies of their own volition, or will do so at the request of Congress, the president , or the public. Trump said the issue was brought to his attention recently by Indra Nooyi, the chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc.
The long and short of it: It's still too soon to know the impacts, if any, the storm will have on any of the islands. Remember that life threatening weather conditions can extend well away from the center of the hurricane. It will weaken over the next few days but it will still be capable of causing catastrophic damage.
NASA satellite imagery shows Hurricane Lane in the Central Pacific Ocean southeast of the Hawaiian Islands at 2:01 p.m. local time, Monday, Aug. 20, 2018. Deep tropical moisture associated with Lane will spread across all islands.
"Regardless of what happens in the eye of the hurricane, there's going to be the potential for a lot of rain - 10-15 inches, perhaps even higher than that", Doll said.
But Klemetti does point out that there could be a threat of heavy rain "remobilizing some of the loose debris and ash" left in the recent lava flows.

The Benefits of Shared Property Ownership: Renting a House Vs Buying a house Vs Homebuy Schemes | 3333 Main
The house deposit required with shared property ownership schemes is also reduced. As two-thirds of current mortgage deals for those wishing to buy a house outright require a house deposit of 25%, a homebuy scheme can prove extremely helpful in terms of getting on the property ladder.Shared property ownership or homebuy schemes are an affordable way to get a foot on the property ladder. They allow someone to buy either a 25%, 50% or 75% share of a house. The percentage of a property owned can be changed. Homebuy schemes involve paying a mortgage on the part owned and rent on the remainder.
Homebuy schemes are normally run by Housing Associations. Access to shared property ownership schemes is based on affordability, with preference given to those on priority housing lists. Homebuy schemes allow someone that can’t afford to buy a house outright to own a share of one instead.
Many mortgage lenders won’t allow someone to borrow a sufficient amount to buy a house outright. In the current financial climate few lenders will go beyond 3.5 times annual income. Whilst Nationwide reported that property prices have come down by 16.6% since their peak, prices are still prohibitive for first-time buyers.
Once someone has chosen to buy a house under a homebuy scheme they are allowed to perform home improvements. When renting a house, it doesn’t make financial sense to do work on a house. A further main advantage is that shared property ownership allows partial owners to keep family pets.
The terms of the lease will outline the responsibilities of each party in terms of maintaining the property. Most leases will state that the cost of home repairs will be paid for on the basis of ownership share. Whilst home repairs will never be as cheap as they are for those renting a house, they are cheaper than outright home ownership.
Shared property ownership or homebuy schemes provide someone on a lower income with a chance to buy a house. Those wishing to take advantage of homebuy schemes will have to check with Housing Associations to see if they are eligible.

Ancient archers needed to protect their hands from the power of their own longbows during battle, and wore these rings on their bow-thumb, to protect it when drawing the bowstring. The bow was drawn by hooking the thumb around the string just under the arrow, and bracing it against the first finger. The ring would protect the thumb and the bowstring would zip right across it upon release.
These specimens were recovered from ancient battlefields in former Thrace/Macedonia, near the Black Sea.

Identifying and exploring emerging trends, disruptions and convergences which might signal significant future challenge or opportunity
A colleague ‘Skyped’ me (made an Internet call) from 30,000 feet recently. He was aboard a Singapore Airlines flight back from Signapore to Australia. Amazing! This ‘Connexion by Boeing’ wireless broadband Internet service is now provided to passengers on selected flights of ANA, Austrain, Asiana, China Airlines, El Al , ETIHAD, JAL, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, SAS. The The cost of accessing the Internet is determined by each carrier (Lufthansa, for example, charges $9.95 per hour or $26.95 per flight).
A recent survey of 3,200 passengers who have used the service, reported in-flight Internet is changing traveler behaviour: 83 percent of those surveyed said that the availability of the Connexion by Boeing service will have an impact on future travel plans and their choice of airline carrier.
Thoughts: If you travel often then battery life is finally going to mean something. Le t’s also hope that this innovation might drive the seats a bit further apart in 'cattle class'. The combination of most ageing baby boomer bellies and cramped space generally means the only possible viewer of your laptop screen currently is likely to be your crotch!
My passion is ANTICIPATION ~ a continuous Internet hunt for emerging weak signals of potentially significant change and opportunity. My colleagues and I are particularly focused on designing better futures. Globally, humanity is confronted with extraordinary opportunities (e.g. the accelerating rate of technology advance, rapidly increasing green consumer awareness), and challenges (e.g. climate change, water and resource scarcity, peak oil, disease, loss of biodiversity, global financial crisis). Unless we can successfully design and implement some transformational and sustainable global solutions within the next 10 to 15 years, our species and planet’s co-inhabitants will be in big trouble.
In this episode, I have the pleasure of chatting with the very funny and talented Alison Becker. Her credits include: "Parks and Recreation," "Mayne Street," "The Newsroom," "The League," and "The Colbert Report," just to name a few. We talk about everything from playing a detective on several versions of "Law And Order" to apple boxes to how delightful it is to work with Amy Poehler.
Alison Becker is a comedian who plays Shauna-Malwae Tweep on NBC's Parks and Recreation. She can be seen as Sarah Morton in the Emmy-nominated ESPN webseries, Mayne Street, and she played Becky on the IFC improvised comedy Z Rock.

Books, food, friends, and Virginia Woolf. "I spare you the twists and turns of my cogitations, for no conclusion was found on the road to Headingly, and I ask you to suppose that I soon found out my mistake about the turning and retraced my steps to Fernham."--Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own
Virginia Woolf’s novel Mrs. Dalloway was published on May 14, 1925. It takes place on a single day in June, 1923, and follows the lives of two Londoners who never meet: Clarissa Dalloway, a society hostess, and Septimus Smith, a shell-shocked WWI veteran who commits suicide. Mrs. Dalloway and Septimus are connected through shared thoughts and through plot: Septimus’ doctor arrives late to Clarissa’s party, delivering news of the young man’s death.
You might not notice it at first, but Mrs Dalloway is an anti-war novel. Woolf was a lifelong pacifist and all of her sympathies are with the veteran, Septimus. Furthermore, Woolf herself suffered from occasional but severe bouts of mental illness, and knew, too well, the cruelty and inefficacy of early-twentieth-century mental health care. One of the novel’s key insights is that war has ongoing effects, years after its conclusion, on both veterans and civilians. At the end of the novel, when Clarissa thinks “in the middle of my party, here's death,” Woolf means us to hear more than just the shallow concern of a hostess; she also means us to hear Clarissa’s empathy.
If this were the book’s only lesson—that war is bad, that its damage spreads beyond the battlefield—we might all agree and congratulate ourselves that we now do slightly better by our veterans than we did a century ago.
Mrs. Dalloway has a much harder lesson to teach us, however. In contrast to Clarissa, two young women in the book take a more sanguine attitude to war. There we can find a lesson about how civilians are complicit in encouraging a culture of war. First, Clarissa’s daughter Elizabeth passes a street band and the march she hears bring her thoughts immediately to war and death. Elizabeth imagines a deathbed scene in which an attendant opens the window, lets the music in, and a dying person finds consolation in the “triumphing” march. Elizabeth’s meditation comes just pages before Septimus’s death: there, we see him struggle to open a window to leap to his death. There is no music; there is no consolation.
Elizabeth’s naivete retains some charm even as it gives us pause. By contrast, Woolf makes Septimus’ teacher complicit in his death. Miss Isabel Pole “lecturing in the Waterloo Road upon Shakespeare,” as Woolf herself had done as a young woman, encourages Septimus in his ambitions, “Was he not like Keats? she asked … and lit in him such a fire as burns only once in a lifetime.” Here, Woolf depicts something much more dangerous than a crush, for in encouraging Septimus to admire Keats and read Antony and Cleopatra, she is encouraging him towards martyrdom.
When Virginia Stephen taught at a working men’s college, she, too, had an enthusiastic young student to whom she taught Keats. But a 1907 letter describing the scene, is all jest and avoidance: “I can tell you the first sentence of my lecture: ‘The poet Keats died when he was 25: and he wrote all his works before that.’ Indeed—how very interesting, Miss Stephen.” Mocking her inane remark—and her students’ bland acceptance of it—the young Virginia refuses an authoritative voice.
Where Woolf eschewed authority, her character seeks it, down to her very name: Isabel, so queenly, and Pole, so erect. And Miss Pole’s teaching has the desired effect: it creates of Septimus a young patriot, “one of the first to volunteer. He went to France to save an England which consisted almost entirely of Shakespeare's plays and Miss Isabel Pole in a green dress walking in a square.” The fire that she has lit in him conflates poetry and a crush on a teacher with England itself. When Septimus returns from the war, traumatized and unable to feel, literature has turned to poison, and all he can think is “How Shakespeare loathed humanity.”
Mrs. Dalloway shows that music and literature can as easily be brought into the service of violence as of peace. The lessons Elizabeth and Isabel Pole draw—and teach—about music and literature feed the culture of war. However, the lesson Woolf asks us to draw, is far different: in a world at war, as animals full of violent impulses, we must refuse to be complicit in encouraging young people to martyr themselves. In 2010, as the United States continues to fight two wars and as each season brings us a new young person, inspired to do violence in the hope of martyrdom, we would do well to reread Mrs. Dalloway, and look again at what we teach and how it can work on behalf of peace.
Your words bring back memories of the summer of 2008 when I took your beyond-wonderful course. Thank you again.

ADOPTIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY Adoptive immunotherapy utilizes NK and cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells for autologous cells reinfusion immunized with cancers epitopes. NK cells are immune system lymphocytic cells resident in reticuloendothelial organs with an integral role in immune system and anti-tumor protection [34]. Thirty-seven HCC sufferers treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) demonstrated a phenotypic and practical activation of autologous NK-cells [35]. Presently, adjuvant autologous NK cell reinfusion has been examined in 2 ongoing medical research in transplant and resected individuals (“type”:”clinical-trial”,”attrs”:”text SRT 1720 manufacture message”:”NCT01147380″,”term_id”:”NCT01147380″NCT01147380 [36] and “type”:”clinical-trial”,”attrs”:”text message”:”NCT02008929″,”term_id”:”NCT02008929″NCT02008929 [37]). CIK cells certainly are a heterogeneous cell populace comprising Compact disc3+ Compact disc56+, Compact disc3+ Compact disc56? and Compact disc3? Compact disc56+ cells, which have the ability to both identify tumor antigens and destroy cancer cells straight [38]. Several research reported a better end result, using CIK cells as adjuvant therapy after liver organ SRT 1720 manufacture surgery treatment in HCC individuals. Specifically, a stage II study analyzing the adjuvant part of CIK cells SRT 1720 manufacture regarded as 127 HCC radically resected individuals that have been randomized in to the pursuing 3 hands: 3 or 6 programs of adjuvant CIK cells infusion immunotherapy or observation just. Disease free success (DFS) price at 1, 3, and 5-12 months was 83.1%, 31.7%, and 23.3% in 3 programs CIK cell infusion, 84.7%, 30.5%, and, 19.4% in 6 courses CIK cell infusion, and 82.6%, 20.9%, and 11.2% in the control group, respectively. A statistically factor between 3 programs CIK cells (= 0.001) and 6 programs CIK cells (= 0.004) when compared with the control group was seen in the lack of a statistically difference between CIK cell organizations [39]. Similarly, a big retrospective study evaluating surgery only (206 individuals) with medical procedures accompanied by CIK cell transfusion (204 individuals) demonstrated a considerably better prognosis in the CIK group. The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-12 months OS prices of CIK group had been higher than medical procedures only group: 93.6%, 83.3%, 76.6%, 71.1%, 65.9% and 84%, 69.2%, 61.6%, 56.9%, 50.2%, respectively, with a big change between your two Ets1 organizations (log-rank check; = 0.0007). Furthermore, individuals treated with an increase of than 8 cycles of cell transfusion demonstrated significantly better success than those treated with significantly less than 8 cycles (= 0.0272). CIK group shown significantly better Operating-system than surgery-alone group in individuals with an increase of than 5-cm tumors (p = 0.0002) [40]. Another retrospective research compared 85 individuals treated with adoptive autologous CIK cell transfusion in conjunction with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus RFA, versus 89 sufferers treated with loco-regional therapy by itself. Despite equivalent response prices, the TACE+RFA+CIK cell group demonstrated a substantial improvement with regards to longer progression free of charge success (PFS) (17 a few months versus 10 a few months, = 0.001) and OS (56 a few months versus 31 a few months, = 0.001) set alongside the TACE+RFA group [41]. Lately, within a multicenter stage III research, 230 HCC sufferers treated by medical procedures, RFA or percutaneous ethanol shot were randomized to get adjuvant autologous CIK cells infusion or not really, displaying a median DFS of 44 a few months and 30.
Modifications in gene medication dosage because of copy-number variant (CNV) are connected with autism range disorder (ASD), intellectual impairment (Identification) and other psychiatric disorders. therapies open to medically modulate MeCP2 great quantity. In this research we utilized a forward hereditary display screen against all known individual kinases and phosphatases to recognize druggable regulators of MeCP2 balance. Two putative modulators of MeCP2 amounts, HIPK2 and proteins phosphatase PP2A, had been validated as stabilizers of MeCP2 decreased MeCP2 amounts within the anxious program and rescued both overexpression and electric motor abnormalities within a AV-951 mouse style of MDS. Our results reveal potential healing targets for dealing with disorders of changed medication dosage and set up a potent technique to recognize druggable applicants for the broader group of neurologic disease caused by CNVs. Launch The individual brains requirement of precise gene medication AV-951 dosage can be clear through the over-representation of copy-number variations (CNVs) in people with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as for example autism range disorder (ASD), intellectual impairment (Identification) and schizophrenia (1C3). A excellent exemplory case of this medication dosage sensitivity can be embodied by (Duplication Symptoms (MDS)and a reduce or lack of the proteins in ~50% of cells, taking place in females with Rett symptoms (4). MDS makes up about ~1% of X-linked Identification and is additional recognized by epilepsy and early loss of life (5, 6). Mouse versions recapitulate individual symptoms, as man mice expressing double the normal degree of MeCP2, locus in human beings (7C9). Conversely, traditional Rett syndrome can be caused in a lot more than 95% from the situations by loss-of-function mutations in and happens in 1/10,000 live feminine births (10, 11). Man mice with a good 50% reduced amount of MeCP2 show phenotypes similar to Rett (12). Therefore, although it is usually medically and experimentally obvious that the dosage of MeCP2 should be exactly regulated allowing appropriate neural function, there are no FDA-approved strategies to modulate MeCP2 amounts (11, 13, 14). MeCP2 binds preferentially to methylated DNA but localizes broadly over the genome (15, 16). In adult neurons it really is present at near histone-octamer amounts (15). Lack of MeCP2 outcomes in a variety of chromatin adjustments including disruption of chromatin structures, as noticed by mislocalization of transcriptional regulator ATRX (17C19) and improved linker histone H1 (15). Expectedly, lack of MeCP2 also leads to misregulation of several neuronally significant transcripts, such as for example those encoded by (18, 20, 21) and (8). Nearly all these molecular modifications are oppositely misregulated in gain-of-function versions. At the mobile level, neurons missing MeCP2 are hypofunctional, exhibiting reduced soma size (22C24) and decreased dendritic branching (25C27). Alternatively, neurons from your MDS mouse model screen increased synapse denseness and dendritic arborization (28, 29). Significantly, neurological phenotypes are mainly reversible in both Rett and MDS mouse versions by normalization of AV-951 MeCP2 amounts (30, 31), in keeping with the lack of neurodegeneration and gross anatomical abnormalities. Earlier attempts to improve particular molecular abnormalities determined in mutant mice, such as for example normalization of BDNF or CRH amounts, have led to only incomplete phenotypic recovery (8, 32). We posit that provided the broad range of the chromatin protein regulon, chances are a constellation of misregulation drives the phenotypes in both reduction- and gain-of-function syndromes. Hence, we suggest that one of the most efficacious treatment of the disorders calls for modulating the degrees of MeCP2 proteins itself. To get a proteins whose amounts must be firmly regulated, little is well known about elements that influence MeCP2 turnover or balance. While governed post-transcriptionally by different microRNAs (33C35), the influence of MeCP2s many post-translational modificationsincluding phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitinationon its balance are largely unidentified (36). Provided the exquisite awareness of human brain cells to the quantity of MeCP2, we hypothesized that we now have multiple endogenous regulators of MeCP2 balance. Thus, the purpose of this function was to execute a forward LSP1 antibody hereditary screen to discover possibly druggable modulators of MeCP2 balance. Results Id of post-translational regulators of MeCP2 balance To build up a reporter cell range in which we’re able to monitor MeCP2 amounts we chosen Daoy individual medulloblastoma cells for testing for their high siRNA transfection performance and their endogenous appearance of MeCP2, raising the likelihood of regulatory circuits getting present for perturbation. Daoy cells had been transduced using a lentiviral vector that expresses DsRed-IRES-hMECP2-EGFP. This bicistronic transgene AV-951 permits unified transcription, but 3rd party translation, from the fluorescent proteins DsRed and hMeCP2 with EGFP fused to its C-terminus (Fig..
The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 (BCRP and MXR) is mixed up in absorption, distribution, and elimination of several medicines. R482G substitution blunted the inhibitory aftereffect of candesartan cilexetil and telmisartan in this respect. On the other hand, the ARB-ABCG2 conversation was not modified in cells expressing either the M483F or the Y570A variant, respectively. To conclude, our data indicate that the 3rd transmembrane helix and adjacent parts of ABCG2 could be of main importance for the conversation of ARBs using the ABC transporter. Furthermore, we conclude from our data that folks transporting the F489L polymorphism could be at improved threat of developing ABCG2-related drug-drug relationships in multi-drug regimens including ARBs. gene have already been described which might donate to the substantial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability of medicines that are transferred by ABCG2 (Erdem et al., 2012; Ieiri, 2012). AT1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) represent a greatly prescribed band of first-line antihypertensive medicines that will also be of main importance in the treating patients experiencing heart failing or diabetic nephropathy (Deppe et al., 2010). We’ve previously demonstrated that this ARBs telmisartan and candesartan cilexetil can become relevant inhibitors of ABCG2 function, at least (Weiss et al., 2010; Deppe et al., 2014). Nevertheless, candesartan cilexetil represents a prodrug that’s rapidly changed into its energetic metabolite, candesartan, after intestinal absorption and, therefore, most likely just gets the potential to impact the function of ABCG2 indicated in the luminal part of intestinal epithelial cells. As ARBs are generally found in multi-drug regimens including ABCG2 substrates, ARB-induced inhibition of ABCG2 function may donate to medically relevant drug-drug relationships and altered medication disposition, thereby possibly compromising drug security and efficacy. Furthermore, in earlier investigations we could actually demonstrate that hereditary variability in the gene affects the 3UTR-mediated rules of ABCG2 manifestation and was also in a position to impact the interaction from the ARB telmisartan using the ABC transporter (Deppe et al., 2014; Ripperger and Benndorf, 2016). 72-48-0 supplier In this respect, we could display that this F489L polymorphism 72-48-0 supplier mainly improved telmisartan-induced inhibition of ABCG2-mediated pheophorbide A (PhA) transportation apparently both with regards to inhibitory strength and effectiveness ABCG2 homology modeling and molecular conversation analyses of chosen ARBs to forecast amino acidity residues with relevance for the ARB-ABCG2 conversation and consequently validated the effect 72-48-0 supplier of many amino acidity substitutions (Y469A; M483F; Y570A) recognized by the research. Only recently, the entire structure of human being ABCG2 in complicated with two antigen-binding fragments of 5D3 (5D3-Fab) was effectively decided (Taylor et al., 2017), which offered an even more accurate understanding into the framework of the transporter. This framework was, hence, utilized to rationalize the herein acquired results also to additional research the molecular relationships of ARBs by docking research. Materials and Strategies Materials Unless mentioned otherwise, chemicals had been bought from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany). Cell tradition press and transfection reagents had been bought from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). The pTRE-Tight-BI-AcGFP1 vector was from Clontech (Hill View, CA, USA) and doxycycline was from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany). Oligonucleotides had been from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). Pheophorbide A (PhA) was from Frontier Scientific European countries (Carnforth, Lancashire, UK). The AT1 receptor antagonists (ARBs) candesartan cilexetil, irbesartan, losartan, and telmisartan aswell as the dihydropyridine calcium mineral route blocker nisoldipine had been from Sequoia Study Products (Pangbourne, UK). Site-Directed Mutagenesis For manifestation of human being ABCG2 (“type”:”entrez-nucleotide”,”attrs”:”text message”:”NM_004827″,”term_id”:”62526032″,”term_text message”:”NM_004827″NM_004827) in HEK293 Tet-On cells, the ABCG2 coding series was used in the pTRE-Tight-BI-AcGFP1 vector as previously explained and validated (Deppe et al., 2014). The pTRE-Tight-BI-AcGFP1-ABCG2 vector framework is usually depicted in Supplementary Physique S1. Naturally happening ABCG2 variants R482G and F489L aswell as 72-48-0 supplier amino acidity substitutions with expected relevance for the ARB-ABCG2 conversation (Y469A, M483F, Y570A) had been inserted in to GRK4 the ABCG2 cDNA series in the pTRE-Tight-BI-AcGFP1-ABCG2 plasmid using the QuickChange?.

A-928605 can be able to offer additive results when found in mixture with medically approved agents aimed against 944328-88-5 manufacture EGFR in non-small cell lung and individual pancreatic tumor versions. Conclusion These outcomes claim that a selective IGF1R inhibitor such as for example A-928605 might provide a useful scientific healing for IGF pathway affected tumors and warrants additional investigation. History Insulin-like development factor signaling has 944328-88-5 manufacture an important function in advancement and adult homeostasis by helping development and success of multiple cell and tissues types [1]. These essential functions certainly are a immediate result of the power of IGF signaling to activate both anti-apoptotic AKT pathway as well as the mitogenic extracellular sign governed kinase (ERK) pathway [1]. Nevertheless, when this elegantly well balanced multi-component signaling program can be perturbed, the dual jobs of IGF signaling in both success and proliferation get this to pathway a most likely contributor to tumor biology. Aberrant IGF signaling continues to be implicated in multiple areas of tumor development including oncogenic change, cell proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, tumor cell invasion and metastases [1,2]. Additionally, IGF signaling continues to be implicated in level of resistance to multiple current medical therapeutics [3-8]. These central functions in tumor initiation, development and development make the IGF pathway a perfect candidate pathway to focus on therapeutically. IGF pathway transmission transduction is usually thought to happen specifically through extracellular ligand activation from the insulin-like development element-1 receptor (IGF1R) as well as the insulin receptor (IR) [9]. These plasma membrane protein are members from the receptor tyrosine kinase family members and are made up of two extracellular -subunits disulfide bonded to two solitary move membrane spanning -subunits which contain the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase activity. The receptors can be found either as homodimers or cross receptors made up of IGF1R and IR heterodimers, and so are triggered by binding from the ligands IGF1 and IGF2, aswell as insulin when the cross receptor exists [10]. The insulin receptor offers two on the other hand spliced variants referred to as IRA and IRB. IRA is usually lacking exon 11 which encodes a supplementary 12 proteins for the alpha subunit from the IRB type of the receptor. IRB binds to just insulin while IRA may associate with both insulin and IGF2 [11]. IGF1 functions both like a circulating hormone so that as a cells development factor and it is expressed generally in most regular cells, while IGF2 is usually mainly a pre-natal growth hormones in human beings [1,12]. Binding of the ligands towards the receptors initiates numerous signaling cascades that eventually result in the anti-apoptotic and proliferative indicators through the AKT and ERK pathways, respectively. After ligand binding the receptors become autophosphorylated and activate downstream signaling pathways that eventually result in proliferation through results on cell routine protein like Cyclin D1 and p27 [13]. Furthermore, success is usually improved, for 944328-88-5 manufacture example, by phosphorylation from the pro-apoptotic proteins Poor by AKT and ERK, which leads to its sequestration and inactivation by 14-3-3 [14]. The ligand-dependent activation of IGF sign transduction and several pathway players escalates the complexity from the role of the pathway in malignancy. Multiple studies show the current presence of improved circulating degrees of IGF1 in the plasma of individuals with prostate, breasts and colon malignancies [15]. Several research also implicate over-expression of IGF2 in cancer of the colon and in ovarian malignancy [15]. This upsurge in IGF2 manifestation in digestive tract and ovarian malignancy is likely the consequence of a lack of imprinting as both maternal and paternal types of this gene have emerged in a substantial number of the individuals [16,17]. Furthermore, several research also claim that there are a variety of tumors that display a higher manifestation degree of IGF1R aswell as an elevated percentage of IRA to IRB [15,18,19]. With this research, we report around the em in vitro /em and em in vivo /em activity of a book pyrazolo [3,4- em d /em ]pyrimidine little molecule inhibitor of IGF1R,.
The neuropeptide galanin and its own receptors are localized in mind pathways mediating learning and memory. part of galanin in cognitive features. Galanin materials and terminals hyperinnervate the rest of the cholinergic neurons from the nucleus basalis of Meynert in middle to advanced phases of Alzheimers [1 C 5]. Further, galanin receptor densities in the nucleus basalis and amygdala nuclei change from age-matched settings at specific phases of Alzheimers disease development buy 5608-24-2 [6C8]. These medical results prompted the hypothesis that buy 5608-24-2 galanin is important in the memory space decline this is the main behavioral sign of Alzheimers disease. To check the part of galanin in memory space, galanin was given centrally to rats. Impairments in overall performance were recognized on multiple learning and memory space jobs. Acquisition of the traditional Rabbit Polyclonal to ANXA1 Morris drinking water maze job, a starburst radial maze spatial job, unaggressive avoidance, buy 5608-24-2 and track cued dread conditioning were clogged by pharmacological dosages of galanin, given before teaching trials [9C14]. Functioning memory space on T-maze postponed alternation and operant non-matching to put operating memory space tasks had been impaired by galanin pretreatment [15C22]. Memory space loan consolidation after Morris drinking water maze teaching was avoided by galanin administration 30 min following the teaching tests [23]. Further, galanin reduced long-term potentiation in rat and guinea pig hippocampal pieces through inhibition of cholinergic Schaffer collaterals, highly relevant to synaptic plasticity involved with learning [24, 25]. The contribution of endogenous galanin was looked into in rats using galanin receptor antagonist remedies. Three galanin receptor subtypes have already been identified to time [26C28]. Peptidergic sequences and non-peptidergic substances with moderate selectivity for every from the three subtypes have already been created [27C29]. Administration from the peptidergic galanin receptor ligand M40 by itself didn’t alter functionality in regular rats on postponed nonmatching to put, although M40 obstructed the inhibitory activities of galanin within this operant functioning storage job [21]. M40 potentiated the helpful actions of the cholinergic agonist in cholinergically lesioned rats on postponed non-matching to put [30]. The peptidergic galanin receptor buy 5608-24-2 ligand M35 facilitated spatial learning in the Morris drinking water maze when provided by itself in a single unreplicated research [31]. The contribution of endogenous galanin to cognitive procedures was further looked into in mice with targeted mutations in the galanin gene. Two lines of transgenic mice overexpressing the galanin gene, one on the dopamine -hydroxylase promoter (DH), that confers specificity to adrenergic neurons [32, 33], and one on the platelet-derived growth aspect promoter (PDGF) with a far more popular distribution in the mind [34C37]. Both have already been examined on cognitive duties. Galanin-overexpressing mice using the trans-gene within the DH promoter shown deficits within the more difficult the different parts of many learning and memory space tasks, including faltering the probe trial check within the Morris drinking water maze, impaired learning of sociable transmission of meals preference and decreased dread conditioned freezing within the more challenging track fear conditioning job [14, 32, 38 C 40]. On the other hand, the DH buy 5608-24-2 galanin transgenic mice weren’t not the same as their wildtype littermates on quantity of days to attain criterion on acquisition of the Morris drinking water maze and an operant appetitive job, and were regular on attentional systems in the 5-choice serial response time job [32, 41, 42]. Galanin-overexpressing transgenic mice using the transgene within the PDGF promoter shown acquisition curves and selective quadrant search in the probe trial that didn’t change from wildtype settings [37]. Nevertheless, when examined during later years, at 19 weeks, the PDGF galanin transgenic mice had been slower to understand the location from the concealed platform teaching within the Morris drinking water maze job, spent less amount of time in the qualified quadrant through the postponed probe trial and shown even more thigmotaxis, while swim rates of speed didn’t differ between genotypes [43]. Conversely, galanin null mutant mice lacking in the galanin gene and galanin peptide also shown a little deficit within the Morris drinking water maze at old age groups, and on a spatial object acknowledgement job, indicating that inadequate galanin could also possess deleterious effects on cognition, maybe related to the consequences of galanin at early developmental phases [41, 44]. A crucial question in restorative development is definitely which receptor subtype to focus on. In the lack of extremely selective galanin receptor subtype antagonists that are soluble in automobiles befitting behavioral research, knockout mice with targeted mutations in galanin receptor genes present a chance to evaluate the specific contributions from the GalR1, GalR2 and GalR3 receptor subtypes in cognitive features. Galanin receptor knockout mice with standard mutations in the GalR1 and GalR2 receptor subtypes have already been tested on many learning and memory space jobs. GalR1 null mutants weren’t significantly unique of wildtype littermates on Morris drinking water maze acquisition and probe trial overall performance, social transmitting of food choice, standard delay dread conditioned freezing or track dread conditioned freezing [40, 45]. GalR2 null mutants weren’t significantly unique of wildtype littermates over the Morris.
Bacterial little RNAs perform many regulatory roles, including operating as antitoxic components in toxinCantitoxin systems. the trimeric complicated. Inhibition and self-assembly are both mediated completely with the ToxIPa RNA, without requirement for CC-4047 mobile elements or exogenous energy. Finally, we describe the roots of ToxI antitoxin selectivity through our crystal framework from the ToxINBt complicated. Our results present how a prepared RNA pseudoknot can inhibit a deleterious proteins with beautiful molecular specificity and exactly how these self-contained and addictive RNA-protein pairs can confer different adaptive benefits within their bacterial hosts. (hereafter ToxINPa), which originally was uncovered through its capability to confer bacteriophage level of resistance as an abortive an infection program (12, 13). ToxINPa includes a proteins toxin (ToxNPa) and a little RNA antitoxin (ToxIPa), that have a eliminate/recovery phenotype when overexpressed in (hereafter ToxINBt). The transcript and it is inhibited by ToxIPa in vivo. cells filled with individually inducible ToxNPa-FLAG and ToxIPa plasmids had been grown to log stage, and the result of ToxNPa appearance and following coexpression of ToxIPa on transcript amounts was examined by North blot (transcription during the period of the test. ToxIPa is normally a rare exemplory case of a normally occurring little RNA which features to counteract the experience of the enzyme. The crystal structure of ToxNPa sure to ToxIPa provided main insights in to the mechanism of the antitoxic activity: three ToxIPa RNAs, that are themselves cleaved off their recurring precursor by ToxNPa, are sure head-to-tail by three ToxNPa monomers to create a heterohexameric, triangular set up where the ToxNPa energetic site is normally occluded (Fig. 1were performed pursuing overexpression of ToxNPa and the next co-overexpression of ToxIPa. As proven in Fig. 1transcript, and following overexpression of ToxIPa restored transcript amounts. The degradation had not been noticed when an inactive, frameshifted ToxNPa variant, (ToxNPa-FS) (12), was portrayed, and RNA amounts weren’t restored in the ToxIPa vector-only control stress. The same design of ToxNPa-mediated RNA degradation and ToxIPa-mediated recovery was seen using the and RNAs (Fig. S1). Overexpression of ToxNPa also created a wide size distribution of ToxIPa items, displaying that ToxIPa is definitely prepared by ToxNPa in vivo. These outcomes confirm the ribonuclease activity of ToxNPa in vivo aimed both to general mobile targets also to its CC-4047 antitoxin transcript and the CC-4047 capability of ToxIPa to suppress this activity. ToxI Antitoxins Are Selective. After confirming the ribonuclease activity of ToxNPa in vivo as well as the actions of ToxIPa to neutralize this activity, we wanted to explore the specificity from the ToxI RNA antitoxin. To take action, cross-inhibition tests were performed using the RNA sequences are unrelated. Within an eliminate/recovery assay, ToxIPa counteracted ToxNPa however, not ToxNBt, and vice versa; each ToxI RNA antitoxin was energetic only against its toxin partner (Fig. 2DH5 pursuing induction of ToxNBt or ToxNPa appearance as well as either ToxIBt or ToxIPa. Outcomes shown are suggest and SD for three natural replicates. ToxIN Systems Promote Plasmid Maintenance. Many TA systems can mediate plasmid stabilization by postsegregational eliminating, where the fast degradation from the antitoxin after plasmid reduction leads to the unaggressive activation from the toxin to eliminate plasmid-free segregants (10). To determine whether ToxINPa and ToxINBt likewise have this activity, we performed long-term plasmid-loss tests. ToxINPa completely avoided lack of plasmid pRBJ200 in W3110 within the duration from the test, whereas Rabbit Polyclonal to SUPT16H ToxINBt got no impact (Fig. 3YB886 (Fig. 3test vector is dependant on the low-copy amount pBS72 replicon (19), this stabilization activity will probably connect with ToxINBt in its indigenous framework on plasmid pAW63 (20). This plasmid-stabilization function may represent the natural function of ToxINBt, which, unlike ToxINPa, didn’t have got a detectable phage-resistance phenotype. The explanation for the web host dependence of the activity probably can be that ToxNBt isn’t toxic enough directly into mediate postsegregational eliminating when portrayed from its indigenous promoter on the single-copy vector; ToxNBt demonstrated lower toxicity than ToxNPa in (Fig. S2W3110. The percentage of cells keeping the plasmid before and 24 h after development without selection can be proven for ToxINPa, ToxINBt, as well as the vector-only control. (YB886. The percentage of cells keeping the plasmid can be plotted being a function of the amount of hours of development without selection. Both and display the mean and SD for three natural replicates. ToxNPa Is usually Inhibited by both Processed and Precursor ToxIPa. In theory, toxin inhibition by ToxI RNA could need cleavage from the repeated elements, for example by linking the power of cleavage with steady assembly. To check this probability, stop-point RNA degradation assays had been performed in vitro using purified ToxNPa ribonuclease with RNA like a substrate, and ToxIPa RNA was added either as the lengthy repeated precursor, that was transcribed in vitro, or as precleaved, 36-nt.
Tumor Necrosis Aspect- (TNF-), a secreted cytokine, has an important function in inflammatory illnesses and defense disorders, and it is a potential focus on for drug advancement. The active substances discovered from the display screen had been verified in the AlphaLISA TNF- assay utilizing a bead-based technology. These substances had been also verified in a normal ELISA assay. Out of this research, many beta adrenergic agonists have already been defined as TNF- inhibitors. We also recognized MK-4305 several book inhibitors of TNF-, such as for example BTO-1, CCG-2046, ellipticine, and PD 169316. The outcomes shown that both homogeneous TNF- assays are powerful and ideal for high throughput testing. a pintool function train station. The assay plates had been incubated for 17 hr at 37C. MK-4305 By the end from the incubation period, 5 L of CellTiter-Glo? reagent was added, plates had been incubated at RT for thirty minutes, and luminescence strength identified in the luminescence setting utilizing a ViewLux dish reader (PerkinElmer). Dimension of TNF- Using ELISA Technique THP-1 cells had been plated in the cell denseness of 4.8 104 in 200 l culture moderate per well inside a 96-well dish. Twenty-five L tradition moderate with or without substance was added into each well, accompanied by addition of LPS at 1 g/ml last concentration in tradition. The ultimate concentrations from the substances in the wells ranged from 1.6 nM to 30 M. After 17 hr treatment at 37C, the cell tradition supernatants had been removed and assessed for human being TNF- using human being TNF- immunoassay package (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Quickly, 200 uL of test or known regular (0-1000 pg/ml) was put into wells of the microplate that was pre-coated having a monoclonal antibody particular for TNF- and incubated at RT for 2 hr. After cleaning aside any unbound chemicals, an enzyme-linked polyclonal anti-TNF- antibody was added as well as the dish incubated for 1 hr at RT. Pursuing four washes, a substrate remedy was added and incubated for 15-20 min, accompanied by the addition of an end remedy. The optical denseness of every well was identified at 450 nm with 570 nm like a research filtration system using an EnVision dish reader. The uncooked data was normalized to LPS (1 g/mL, 100%) and assay moderate with 0.1% DMSO (basal, 0%). The MK-4305 inhibition curves for every substance had been examined using the nonlinear regression analysis system in GraphPad Prism (Soft-ware). qHTS Data Evaluation Data normalization, modification and fitted of focus response curves had been performed as previously explained [16]. Briefly, uncooked results for every titration point was initially normalized in accordance with the LPS control (1 g/ml, 0%) and DMSO just wells (basal, -100%), and corrected through the use of a pattern modification algorithm using compound-free control plates (DMSO plates) to reduce the dispense and reading mistakes. Concentration-response titration factors for each substance had been suited to the Hill formula yielding concentrations of half-maximal inhibition (IC50) and maximal response (effectiveness) values. Focus response curves had been categorized into four main classes using the group of requirements listed in earlier studies [17]. Substances which demonstrated inhibition in both ratiometric and 665 nm readings, and experienced potency significantly less than 5 M and effectiveness higher than 50% in the ratiometric reading had been considered as mixed up in HTRF individual TNF- assay. These substances had been further prioritized predicated on their activity in the cell viability assay after 17 h substance treatment. Twenty-six energetic substances that were not really evidently cytotoxic (6 situations stronger in the HTRF individual TNF- assay than that in the MK-4305 cell viability assay) had been cherry-picked for verification and follow-up studies. Outcomes Assay Marketing and Miniaturization of HTRF-Based TNF- Assay We’ve optimized and validated a homogenous HTRF-based TNF- assay within a 1536-well dish format you can use to screen substances to recognize potential TNF- inhibitors (Fig. ?11). LPS, a known TNF- stimulator, induced TNF- creation within a concentration-dependent way after 17 hr incubation using the THP-1 cells (Fig. ?4A4A). The EC50 of LPS was 0.84 MK-4305 g/ml, and the utmost induction of TNF- creation by LPS was a lot more than 8-fold from the basal level. Open up in another screen Fig. (4) (A) Period span of LPS-induced TNF- creation. THP-1 cells had been treated with Rabbit Polyclonal to Collagen III several LPS concentrations for 5, 17 and 24 hr. By the end of various period points, TNF- creation was assessed in THP-1 cells utilizing a homogenous HTRF-based TNF- assay. Data are from an individual test performed in quadruplicate, representative of many experiments. (B) Marketing of cell thickness. THP-1 cells had been dispensed at.
Soft-tissue sarcomas certainly are a heterogeneous band of tumors due to connective tissue. lowers VEGF appearance in tumor cells using a corresponding reduction in microvessel thickness. Taken jointly, our results start using a major tumor model to show that sarcomas could be produced by lack of NF1 and Printer ink4a/Arf, and these tumors are delicate to MEK inhibition by immediate results on tumor cells and the encompassing microenvironment. These research claim that MEK inhibitors ought to be additional explored as potential sarcoma therapies in sufferers with tumors including NF1 deletion. in Lycopene manufacture tumor quantity from baseline for tumors giving an answer to treatment. Tumors that didn’t react Lycopene manufacture to treatment are proven as biggest percent in tumor quantity from baseline during the period of the treatment. Within this display of the info, modification in tumor quantity can be capped at +100%. Statistical Evaluation Graphs and figures had been performed in Graph Pad 4.0. A nonparametric learners t-test was performed to determine distinctions between treatment groupings. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In vitro research The mouse sarcoma cell lines 1863 and 3017 had been derived from major sarcomas in NF1flox/flox; Printer ink4a/Arfflox/flox mice that created after intra-muscular Ad-Cre shot. These cell lines had been authenticated by PCR genotyping. The cells had been cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. For colony development studies, cells had been seeded at 500/well inside a 6-well dish and treated with DMSO or 50 nM PD325901 (Sigma) for 3C7 times. The amount of existing colonies was dependant on crystal violet staining. Each test was carried out in triplicate, as well as the test was repeated 3 x. Data demonstrated is representative of 1 independent test. For colony development studies with previous PD325901 treatment, cells had been cultured over night in 50nM PD325901, accompanied by splitting the cells into DMSO control or PD325901 for colony development. Experiments were examined as explained above. Cell proiferation assays had been performed with cells cultured in either DMSO or 50nM PD325901, with the amount of cell doublings determined daily. For quantitative RT-PCR analyses, cells had been treated with 50 nM PD325901 for 4 hours, accompanied by RNA harvest into TRIZOL. Data demonstrated represents the common of 4 impartial experiments. Traditional western blot evaluation 1863 cells had been treated with 50 nM PD325901 for either 1 or 4 hours ahead of harvest. Cells had been cleaned once with chilly PBS (Sigma) and lysed for ten minutes on snow with RIPA buffer (Sigma), supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, P5726 and P0044). Proteins focus was performed with BCA Proteins Focus Assay (Thermo Scientific). MiniProtean TGX gels (BioRad) had been used in PVDF by damp transfer. Quantitative RT-PCR RNA was isolated from tumors and cells by TRIZOL. cDNA synthesis was performed with iScript (BioRad). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with an iQ5 device (BioRad) using the delta-delta Ct technique. Primer sequences are available in Supplementary Desk 2. RESULTS Producing inducible NF1-erased sarcomas in the mouse As NF1 mutations have already been recently detected in a number of human being soft-tissue sarcoma subtypes (3, 4), we wanted to see whether lack of NF1 as well as the Rabbit Polyclonal to ARNT tumor suppressor Printer ink4a/Arf was adequate to create soft-tissue sarcomas inside a p53- and NF1-crazy type history. Furthermore, we wanted to generate an inducible mouse style of NF1-erased sarcoma that could reveal the diverse spectral range of NF1-connected sarcomas within patients. Consequently, we generated mice with conditional mutations in both NF1 and Printer ink4a/Arf (NF1flox/flox; Ink4a/Arfflox/flox). These mice had been injected with an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) at 1 of 2 sites: intramuscular (IM) shots to model tumors arising in the skeletal muscle mass, and sciatic nerve (SN) shots to model tumors arising in the nerve sheath. Mice had been injected into either the hind limb muscle mass (IM, n=10) or sciatic nerve (SN, n=12) of the low left leg. Pursuing shot, Cre recombinase can delete both alleles of NF1 and Printer ink4a/Arf (Body 1A). Mice created tumors 3C12 Lycopene manufacture a few months after Cre publicity at the website of shot. We successfully produced two cell lines (1863 and 3017) from sarcomas produced after IM-injection of Ad-Cre. Using these sarcoma cell lines, we’ve verified recombination of both alleles of NF1 and Printer ink4a/Arf by PCR (Body 1B), furthermore to lack of both mRNA and proteins for p16, p19, and NF1 (Supplemental Body 1ACompact disc). For clearness, we refer.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have already been used extensively to regulate inflammatory pain. (indicate = 1.050 6.436?g), diclofenac (mean = 6.675 1.368?g) and indomethacin (mean = 2.85 5.01?g). Hence, cannabinoid receptors usually do not appear to be mixed up in peripheral antinociceptive system from the NSAIDs dipyrone, diclofenac and indomethacin. with 9-THC as prototype, the related band of artificial drugs and lastly the endogenous eicosanoids, with anandamide as the substance most extensively analyzed (1). In the peripheral level, cannabinoid receptors are regarded as involved in main afferent neuron modulation, inhibiting membrane excitation and Ca2+ conductance and in addition raising potassium conductance, inducing an identical antinociceptive impact. The antinociceptive aftereffect of the endocannabinoid program continues to be implicated in discomfort models (2). non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) like dipyrone, diclofenac and indomethacin are broadly prescribed for his or her antinociceptive and analgesic activity (3). The seek out different systems of NSAID-induced antinociception offers greatly improved after investigators noticed that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the swollen tissue isn’t the just pathway because of this response. Earlier studies have shown the opioid program as well as the NO/cGMP/KATP pathway could possibly be mixed up in antinociceptive system of NSAIDs (4,5). There is certainly proof indicating that the cannabinoid program can donate to the pharmacological ramifications of ibuprofen and indomethacin (6). Ghring et al. (7) possess recommended that indomethacin may enable an elevated synthesis of endocannabinoids from arachidonic acidity by obstructing cyclooxygenase (COX). The same researchers show that vertebral pretreatment with AM-251 blocks the antinociception due to indomethacin. However, there is absolutely no evidence of participation from the endocannabinoid program in the peripheral antinociception induced by NSAIDs. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to research the participation from the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in the peripheral antinociceptive aftereffect of the NSAIDs dipyrone, diclofenac and indomethacin. Materials and Methods Pets All tests had been performed on male Wistar rats (160-200?g) from CEBIO-UFMG (Universidade Federal government de Minas Gerais) housed inside a temperature-controlled space (23 1C) Ivachtin IC50 about a computerized 12-h light/dark routine (6:00-18:00 h). Water and food were freely obtainable until the start of the tests. Animals were utilized only one time and sacrificed following the tests. All animal methods and protocols had been authorized by the Ethics Committee for Pet Experimentation (CETEA) from the UFMG. Dimension of hyperalgesia Hyperalgesia was induced with a subcutaneous shot of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 2?g) in to the plantar surface area from the hind paw and measured using the paw pressure check described by Randall and Selitto (8). An analgesimeter was Ivachtin IC50 utilized (Ugo-Basile, Italy) using a cone-shaped paw-presser Ivachtin IC50 using a curved suggestion, which applies a linearly raising force towards the hind paw. The fat in grams necessary to elicit the nociceptive response of paw flexion was driven as the nociceptive threshold. A cutoff worth of 300?g was used to lessen the chance of harm to the paws. The nociceptive threshold was assessed in the proper paw and driven as the common of three consecutive studies documented before and 3?h after PGE2 shot. The hyperalgesia was computed as the difference between both of these averages ( of nociceptive threshold) and MGC5370 reported in grams. Medication administration All medications were implemented by injecting a level of 50?L/paw, apart from PGE2 (100?L/paw). Diclofenac (Purifarma, Brazil) and dipyrone (Sigma, USA) had been dissolved in isotonic saline, while indomethacin (Sigma) was dissolved in Tris-base buffer. The CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptor antagonists, AM-251 (Tocris, USA) and AM-630 (Tocris) had been dissolved in 10% DMSO in saline. PGE2 (Cayman, USA) was dissolved in 2% ethanol in saline. Experimental process NSAIDs had been injected in to the correct hind paw 2:55 h after regional shot of PGE2. AM-251 and AM-630 had been given 10?min before the NSAIDs. The nociceptive threshold was evaluated 3?h after community administration of PGE2. Statistical evaluation Data had been analyzed statistically by one-way evaluation of variance (ANOVA) as well as the Bonferroni check for multiple evaluations. Probabilities of significantly less than 5% (P 0.05) were considered.
Tongue muscle groups innervated from the hypoglossal nerves play an essential role to make sure airway patency and dairy suckling in the neonate. space junction blocker carbenoxolone. Pacing of sluggish oscillations evidently depended around the procedure of KATP stations in view from the stop by tolbutamide or glibenclamide. Under current clamp, oscillations produced even more regular spike firing of motoneurones and facilitated glutamatergic excitatory inputs. These data claim that neonatal motoneurones from the nucleus hypoglossus have a very formerly undisclosed capability to communicate synchronous electric oscillations, revealed by activation Rabbit Polyclonal to CSFR (phospho-Tyr809) of mGluR1s. In mind areas just like the thalamus or the hippocampus, neuronal electric oscillations symbolize a signalling procedure vital that you communicate and consolidate info within systems (Kirk & Mackay, 2003; Steriade & Timofeev, 2003). Since oscillations varies in shape, rate of recurrence, regularity and stage distribution, it appears likely that unique oscillatory activities reveal particular modalities of network signalling. Learning their source and function consequently represents a good method of understand the computational properties of particular neuronal networks. So far as engine systems Vorinostat are worried, rhythmic activities are usually indicated by locomotor systems. The foundation of engine rhythms is typically designated to interneuronal circuits (Grillner 1998), although additional studies have got reported that vertebral motoneurones themselves can generate oscillations reliant on NMDA receptors (Schmidt 1998) and propagated via distance junctions (Kiehn 2000). Rhythmic actions may also be portrayed by brainstem neurones (Oyamada 1999; Wu 2001; Leznik 2002; Rybak 2003) and will be looked into using being a model hypoglossal motoneurones (HMs) which convey the only real electric motor result to tongue muscle groups. Thus, HMs exhibit rhythmic electric motor commands together with features like respiration, swallowing, mastication and vocalization (Jean, 2001). It really is, nevertheless, uncertain whether HMs can generate intrinsic oscillations and if indeed Vorinostat they do this, the functional effect of oscillations on engine output. We’ve recently noticed how selective activation of subtype 1 receptors owned by group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1s) facilitates glutamatergic excitatory inputs onto HMs from the neonatal rat brainstem (Sharifullina 2004). Because this Vorinostat receptor subtype is basically indicated in the developing hypoglossal nucleus (Hay 1999), it appears likely that it might play a significant part in HM-dependent pursuits like respiration and dairy suckling that are essential for the neonate. Because mGluR1s can stimulate the introduction of oscillations in forebrain systems (Whittington 1995; Beierlein 2000; Cobb 2000; Hughes 20022004). For voltage clamp tests HMs had been clamped within the number of ?60 to ?70 mV keeping potential to reduce the drip current at rest. For current clamping, cells had been in the beginning kept at their relaxing degree of membrane potential without injecting intracellular current that was applied for particular tests only. Evaluation of an example of cells voltage clamped having a Cs+-packed pipette gave the average keeping potential of ?62 1 mV (insight level of resistance = 148 8 M; Vorinostat = 62), while for any pool of cells documented with intracellular K+ answer the corresponding keeping potential was ?67 2 mV (insight level of resistance = 163 13 M; = 26; = 0.35 between cell organizations). For double-patch recordings two neighbour cells had been concurrently patch clamped (common range 30 m). To elicit synaptic glutamatergic reactions we electrically activated premotoneurones in dorsomedullary reticular column (DMRC; Cunningham & Sawchenko, 2000) as complete previously (Sharifullina 2004). Solitary stimuli were used at 10 s period (0.1 ms, 10C100 V Vorinostat intensity). All electrophysiological reactions had been filtered at 3 kHz, sampled at 5C10 kHz, obtained and analysed with pCLAMP 9.0 software program (Axon Instruments). Solutions and medicines The external answer for trimming and maintaining pieces included (mm): NaCl, 130; KCl, 3; NaHPO4, 1.5; CaCl, 1; MgCl2, 5; blood sugar 15 (315C320 mosm), and was constantly oxygenated with O2 95%CCO2 5%. In the documenting chamber slices had been superfused with gassed answer made up of (mm): NaCl, 130; KCl, 3; NaHPO4, 1.5; CaCl2, 1.5; MgCl2, 1; blood sugar 15 (315C320 mosmol l?1), pH 7.4. Unless normally stated, all tests were carried out in the constant existence of bicuculline (10 m) and strychnine (0.4 m) to stop GABA and glycine-mediated transmitting (Donato & Nistri, 2000; Marchetti 2002) in order that glutamatergic results could be noticed in.
The Decision handed down yesterday has come about as part of the Review of Modern Awards. As part of the Review process several areas of interest have been explored.
In the area of casual employment there has been much media coverage and speculation but it is important for all fuel industry operators to understand the current and coming requirements.
As part of the Review unions, individuals and employer organisations have petitioned the Commission to make (or not make) changes in the area of the operation casual employees across the fuel industry and across the whole employment market. In general the union submissions centred around calls for all regular casuals to be automatically deemed to be permanent employees after a qualifying period of employment (most setting this at 12 months). The arguments put forward largely assume that casual employees are casuals solely at the determination and desire of the employer. This argument discounts or ignores the fact that in many cases casual employment is the preference of the employee based on financial, study, family and other commitments and concerns.
Had the Commission granted an automatic deeming of all casuals to be permanent / permanent part time, the result would have been drastic changes to wage structure and payroll systems across the employment market. ‘In fuel retail particularly, where many small family operated site already struggle with payroll the management of the shift loadings that apply to permanent staff in a myriad of complex possibilities and combinations depending on the operation of the whole roster, such a unilateral change would likely have resulted widespread cost and confusion’ said Elisha Radwanowski, Executive Manager for Employment and Training for ACAPMA.
‘In the Decision handed down yesterday the Fair Work Commission has stopped short of acceding to these calls for automatic deeming of casuals as permanent staff. Rather the Commission identified that there are legitimate situations where casual employment is the preference of the employee and the employer and to create a situation where employees were automatically converted from casual to permanent status, regardless of their personal circumstances and preferences, would be a perverse outcome’ continued Elisha.
The Commission has however, identified that there are a number of Awards that do not have any provision for casual conversion discussions to be facilitated between employees and employers, that there is not a prompt for both parties to review their choices and assess their appropriateness long term. To address this the Commission has developed a model casual conversion clause that the decision has outlined will be placed in all modern Awards that do not currently have a casual conversion clause. The model clause is open for discussion and comment until 2nd August 2017 after which time the Commission will finalise the clause and fold it into all modern Awards that currently do not have a casual conversion clause.
The characteristics of the model clause include a requirement for employers to provide casual employees with a copy of the casual conversion clause within 12 months of their start date and a requirement to consider and approve an election by a casual employee to convert to permanent status unless, such conversion would result in significant adjustment to hours currently worked in order to meet the permanent employment provisions of the Award, it is clear that the position will soon cease to exist, it is clear that the hours currently worked are likely to significantly change in the next 12 months, or any other reasonable grounds.
There is likely to be some finessing of the model clause in the coming weeks as part of the comment period until 2nd August 2017, however the Decision makes it clear that those Awards that do not currently have an established casual conversion clause and process will soon have them inserted.
The Decision has also highlighted that it is open to the review of current casual conversion clauses in line with the model clause. Final Determinations on any changes to existing casual conversion clauses will likely be released soon after 2nd August 2017.
What is important for operators in the fuel wholesale and retail industry to understand is the current provisions in the Awards and the impact of the recent Decision on the future operation of these provisions.
Under the Road Transport and Distribution Award 2010, which applies to fuel wholesale transport workers, clause 12.6 outlines the casual conversion process, whereby a regularly engaged casual working regular systematic hours for a period of 12 months, is entitled to elect to convert to permanent. There is a requirement within the clause that the business remind the employee, in writing, within four weeks of their right to elect to convert upon the right accruing (after 12 months). If the employee elects to convert to permanent they must do so in writing within four weeks. Once the business receives an election to convert to permanent it must be either accepted or refused but must not unreasonably be refused. If the election is refused the refusal must specify reasons and be discussed with the employee.
Under the Vehicle Manufacturing, Repair, Service and Retail Award 2010, which applies to fuel retail workers, clause 13.3 outlines the casual conversion process, whereby a regularly engaged casual working regular systematic hours for a period of six months, is entitled to elect to convert to permanent. There is a requirement within the clause that the business remind the employee, in writing, within four weeks of their right to elect to convert upon the right accruing (after six months). If the employee elects to convert to permanent they must do so in writing within four weeks. Once the business receives an election to convert to permanent it must be either accepted or refused but must not unreasonably be refused. If the election is refused the refusal must specify reasons and be discussed with the employee.
Under the Clerks – Private Sector Award 2010, there is not an existing provision for casual conversion, as such the model clause will apply in its final form.
As ACAPMA has outlined here, here and here the operation of casual conversion is not new to the fuel wholesale and retail industry having been in operation for many years. The Decision handed down yesterday has not drastically altered the operation of this element in the fuel wholesale and retail industry, rather it has highlighted that the Commission is keen to facilitate some streamlining of the notification process and to extend this requirement for dialogue on the employment relationship to other industries and Awards that do not currently have these requirements.
‘If the Commissions model clause is applied to our Awards, the requirement to notify employees of their right to elect to convert will be much more streamlined process for businesses, replacing the requirement to notify employees within a four week window around the time that the entitlement accrues, with the requirement to notify anytime within 12 months. This would be a positive step’ said Elisha.
In a change made specifically to the Vehicle Manufacturing, Repair, Service and Retail Award 2010, which applies to retail fuel site workers, a new minimum engagement period for casuals will apply of 3 hours. This is a completely new requirement. ‘The area of the decision that may effect many fuel retail operators now is the new requirement to provide a minimum shift of 3 hours for casuals. While most operators are running rosters that far exceed this and will not be too effected, some operators run with unique rosters based on specific time of day offerings’ continued Elisha.
ACAPMA advises all retail fuel site operators to review their rosters to ensure compliance with this new requirement.
Also included in the Decision handed down yesterday is a Determination that part time work will be allowed, with specific circumstances under the Road Transport (Long Distance) Operations Award 2010. Whereas part time work had previously been precluded it will now be allowed in one, two or three fixed working days per week in a written part time agreement provided that a minimum of 8 hours or 500km (depending on the pay approach selected out of hours of km), is guaranteed per day/shift. The Commission has further stipulated that an employee on a part time agreement under this Award may not work any other days or times than those specified under the agreement. If the employer requests other days or times and the employee agrees that work is to be paid for at casual rates. The final wording of this clause will be released after a comment period ending in mid August 2017.
‘The implications of the Decision handed down yesterday are going to be widely reported in the coming days. We are urging all members to familiarise themselves with the current operations and requirements and to remember the final wording of any changes has not yet been released. ACAPMA will keep members posted once the final Award changes are published’, closed Elisha.

The RAA has predicted fuel prices could drop below 130c/l, following a large reduction in wholesale prices
I will never forget this year’s holidays. At first I thought these holidays would be very boring, because I was going at the seaside with my family. I fought I would be looking forward to come back to school, but I was wrong. I can say my holidays were one of the best in my life.
The beginning was quite boring, but on the 15th of July I went with my parents and my family by the sea. We spent 3 weeks there! We lived at nice, but quite expensive hotel, I think. Our accomodation was in a really good condition. There were two rooms, huge bathroom, terrace with jacuzzi and a swimming-pool in the front of the builing. The hotel was near the sea, it was really comfortable. Sometimes we were going back from the beach late at night, quite tired and hungry. During those three weeks I met a lot of interesting and kind people. In fact, I spent with them most of the time. They have become my friends. We were building sandcastles, we were swimming, we visited many interesting places and we were sunbathing. We were also doing many wild things, it was unforgettable. The weather was great- every morning I was waking up to a deep blue sky and blazing sun. Only one day it was raining, but the rain was quite warm.
I enjoyed my holidays. It was great for my health. I was lying on a beach and relaxing... All tensions disappeared. This year’s holidays were worth remembering.
During my last school holidays, I spent a few days at my cousin’s house at Morib, a well-known sea resort. I shall never forget that visit.
On the day I arrived at Morib, my cousin told me that he would do to make my stay there a very interesting one. He said that he would make a raft to use it in the sea. Then he would buy fishing net to catch some fish in the shallow water near the coast. When I heard all this, I was very delighted because it was one of the reasons that I had decided to visit my cousin. We then walked up to the beach which is near his house.
While we were there, sometime in the evening, the sea looked extremely beautiful. I saw the islands and hills in the distance, the birds in the air, and a few boys and girls playing on the beach. I also saw some fishermen coming out of the water with their catch. All this was indeed very interesting to look at.
On the next day, my cousin and I collected some tree trunks from the forest nearby. As my cousin’s house is close to the sea, we decided to make the raft on the beach itself. It took us almost the whole morning to make the raft. We then had our lunch and went to Banting, the nearest town, to buy fishing net. After that we returned to my cousin’s house.
In the evening we put the raft on the sea. The water was still high, but the raft floated quite well. My cousin and I sat on it and began to row it by using the oars that we had made ourselves. We felt very happy indeed and continued to row it. We remained on it for a long time, but as it was already getting dark we did not go far. We returned to the shore and tied the raft to a tree.
On the next day, we went out to catch some crabs and fish. We used the net that we had bought and caught a lot of fish. Then, we had our lunch and went out again on the raft. We continued to row it as far as we could. It was really a pleasure to be away from the shore. The sea was calm and we could row with ease. My cousin told me many interesting things about Morib. We then returned to the shore.

It wouldn't hurt the kids' development for me to take a class one night a week, and it wouldn't hurt you to have to fix them dinner while I'm doing it. Make spaghetti. Jesus, how hard is that?
I let Dwight Horseman kiss me once, in a weak moment, while you were away for work, and hated myself for years. That's why we stopped going to that church; I couldn't bear seeing him.
Go to the doctor. Every year. No stalling. If you don't, you'll get colon cancer and die and I'll be alone.
Love this. I get the feeling that I'm reading entries from a woman's diary with just such a title. So much bitterness harbored in one heart! And yet so familiar.

Should certainly you decision her fantastic away, on the other hand wait the device out on a 24-hour interval or 2? Is one too soon to face the following this day ( blank ) and is actually it as well late to call your girl after many different days?
Once upon a time, men thinking that buyers had so that it will wait needed for a relatively few number of days before calling, other than them they’d risks looking all too eager to get which has her.
So here’s how it all works room ) in the type of modern dating world nearly anything happens thoroughly fast, and people produce very trivial attention covers. Honestly, waiting more compared one night or and as a result is a major mistake, mainly a lot of teens would think the partner forgot them entirely. These kinds of products might assume that you’re no any longer interested, and as well their concentration will fade too.

Picture about the concept – however, if she afforded you a genuine number number, in which obviously she’s got interested found in you, use why will she browse down inside you calling her at a fast rate. On the contrary, she might be holding off with bated breath for you name. Believe me, it’s quite likely true.
Make likely that you’ve thought more some helpful hints for workable dates, rather than if you let her near to data about the you yearn from that this call.
Keep your current phone call short and / or don’t drag it along with. All you’ve really got to definitely is generate the basics and solicit her directly on a go out with. It’s urgent not – sound properly enthusiastic, prove relaxed but also just at it come naturally. Again, keep here in mind the idea you i can’t run them out too long.

We live in a world of constant movement, and our day-to-day lives seem to get busier by the hour. Our days are full of information, full of obligations, full of friends and family, full of everything . . . except fulfillment. And rushing has become a national epidemic. Even when we’re rushing to and from the good stuff—like a rewarding job with wonderful colleagues, or quality time spent with loved ones—we can still end up feeling drained and exhausted, overwhelmed by the sheer volume of life.
In Full Cup, Thirsty Spirit, psychologist Karen Horneffer-Ginter helps you understand that it is this volume, this busyness, that creates a disconnect between your outer life and your inner self. This separation can cause your soul to wilt, preventing you from experiencing joy and hearing your own wisdom about what needs priority in your life.
With an elegant narrative voice that inspires both laughter and compassion, Horneffer-Ginter shows you how to live a fuller life rather than simply filling your time. She focuses on six shifts to make in your daily life—teaching you to honor your rhythms, turn within, fill up, fully inhabit your days, remember lightness, and embrace difficulty.
Through a weave of personal stories, client experiences, and practical exercises, she shows you how to find balance in the swirl of daily life, so you can reconnect with what matters most.
I don't think that anyone will argue when it's said that in today's world, life has become more stressed. Where we used to be able to get in the car and we were away from phones, we are now always available. Wifi has even made it so that it's not necessary to be near a computer to access email. Our lives are busy and sometimes that busyness is good things. But that busyness affects our souls and our peace of mind.
When I had the chance to review Full Cup, Thirsty Spirit, I jumped. This is a practical book filled with insight and suggestions to slow down and nourish our souls. The author addresses six areas to look at in your life and each chapter is filled with insights and suggestions. This isn't a book that you quickly skim and come away enlightened. It's a book that you take some time with and a book that you take time to reflect on and mark passages or pages. My copy is full of post-it tags from pages I want to reread or refocus on.
There was some surprising profanity, but nothing that really detracted. As it was used, it seemed to fit the situation or example. Something I really appreciated was how the holistic and spiritual elements of life were discussed and merged together: meditation as a way of turning inward and offering kindness and forgiveness as you embrace difficulties; and finding lightness in frustrating moments and seeing God's hand in your life and surroundings.
Thanks to Trish at TLC Book Tours for the opportunity to review this book. You can learn more about Karen Horneffer-Ginter here. You can purchase your own copy here . You can see other reviews and tour stops here.

Cheaper, Better, Faster: Over 2,000 Tips and Tricks to Save You Time and Money Every Day by Mary Hunt (for review, from Baker Publishing)
7 Years Younger: The Revolutionary 7-Week Anti-Aging Plan by The Editors of Good Housekeeping (giveaway win from Suko's Notebook)
Looking outside...it's cold. There is still Christmas snow on the ground and a chance of more snow tonight.
Listening...to The Boy as he works his way through Star Trek Voyager on Netflix. Love that he has become a Trekkie like me.
Loving...that we had a wonderful, quiet Christmas. I loved seeing the joy my children had as they gave their gifts to each other. So grateful for the blessing of Jesus Christ and the opportunity to celebrate his birth.
Thinking...about what this new year will bring to us: experiences, people, blessings, opportunities.
In my kitchen...probably grilled burgers for dinner. After all, it is snowing and our family tradition is to have Snow BBQ.
Needing...to finish the Cousin's Book. Each Christmas my sister and I put together a Cousin's Book. The grandchildren (14 living) are asked questions (same questions each year:) and we include a new photo. Each family gets a copy. My children love to look at the Cousin's Books. I love seeing how my nieces and nephews change each year and how some of their answers stay the same.
Today...some family time. We got a couple of new family games for Christmas and we're dying to play them. Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Monopoly and Star Trek Scene-It.
Hoping...for The Doctor to work on my back some more. I sprained/strained my sacroiliac region (backside) on Christmas Eve and it's a really nice perk being married to a chiropractor who has the equipment and knowledge to treat me at home. It's much better now, but still has some residual achiness.
Planning...for New Years. The Boy will be attending a big youth New Years Eve dance at church and he's looking forward to it. I'm not sure what the rest of us will do. We're not big party people. Perhaps a rewatch of the Doctor Who Christmas Special is on order.
From my world...Les Miserables was wonderful. Absolutely amazing. I am still reflecting on it. I loved it the first time I saw it on stage 23 years ago. I loved the film and what they did. So beautiful, so raw, so moving. I sobbed during Valjean's death scene. Well cast. Well done. I will be seeing it again next week with The Doctor.
Lady Eliza Sumner is on a mission. Her fortune was the last thing she had left after losing her father, her fiancé, and her faith. Now, masquerading as Miss Eliza Sumner, governess-at-large, she's determined to find the man who ran off with her fortune, reclaim the money, and head straight back to London.
Mr. Hamilton Beckett, much to his chagrin, is the catch of the season, and all the eyes of New York society—all the female ones, at least—are on him. He has no plans to marry again, especially since his hands are full keeping his business afloat while raising his two children alone.
Eliza's hapless attempts to regain her fortune unexpectedly put her right in Hamilton's path. The discovery of a common nemesis causes them to join forces and, before she knows it, Eliza has a whole retinue of people helping her. Eliza's determination not to trust anyone weakens when everyone's antics and bumbling efforts to assist her make her wonder if there might be more important things than her fortune and independence.
When all of Hamilton's and Eliza's best-laid plans fall by the wayside, it will take a riot of complications for them to realize that God just might have had a better plan in mind all along.
Sometimes you read a book that just makes you laugh. Sometimes you meet a heroine who is simply a joy to get to know. Sometimes you meet a hero who is not only handsome and charming, but generous and kind. And when all three of those things merge together in one book, you have a delightful story and one you hate to see end.
Lady Eliza is on a quest to discover the whereabouts of the cad who stole her family fortune and title. That quest brings her to New York City from England and into a job as a governess. When Eliza's antics get her in trouble, her path crosses that of Hamilton Beckett who comes to her rescue and their adventure begins. With fantastic supporting characters and two adorable children, this is a delightful story. Witty and humorous, it's a comedy of errors and was a story that I didn't want to see end.
A terrific debut from a promising author and I am anxious to read more. I'm thrilled that the next story involves the Hamilton family and I hope that there is a future story planned around Zayne!

A deceptively easy question for this week (easy to ask but possibly hard to answer): What are/were your favorite book(s) of the year? (Bonus points if you know how many books you read.)
Currently, I'm at 108 with 2 DNF, I will have a couple of more books read before the end of the year. That's less than normal (last year I read 160), but I had major surgery this summer and it disrupted every aspect of my life. I keep track of what I read, but I don't have any real goals, nor is it a competition. Too many challenges and deadlines make reading less fun for me. So 108+ books for the year is fine by me.
I've already received their mailing information. Thanks to all who entered! Check out the sidebar for other giveaways.
I tend to keep my private family blog separate from my other blogs and I don't often post personal things here. But, I thought it would be fun to share some of our family Christmas with you.
There are certain traditions to Christmas and one is that our tree goes up the day after Thanksgiving. It's just what I do.
Another tradition is that we each get a new ornament for the tree. My mom always gave my sisters and me a new ornament every year, often commemorating an event or trip. While we all lived at home, we'd have a girls day trip to San Francisco for lunch and to see all the Christmas windows on Union Square. Back in the day, that was the thing to do and those windows were spectacular. Macy's always had a Christmas store on their top floor and it was so fun. Those ornaments went with us when we moved out.
I have kept the tradition of new ornaments and my boys look forward to choosing a new ornament each year.
Because of that ornament tradition, our tree is very eclectic, but it's also very much us. We have dinosaurs on our tree and a pink flamingo. We have world monuments like a pyramid, L'Arc d'Triomphe and Colosseum. We have a star fish and a coke can. And we love it!
I have collected Christmas stories for years. We read them all season long, but on Christmas Eve, we each share our favorite story and then we read the biblical account of Christ's birth.
On March 18, 1990, thirteen works of art today worth over $500 million were stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. It remains the largest unsolved art heist in history, and Claire Roth, a struggling young artist, is about to discover that there’s more to this crime than meets the eye.
Making a living reproducing famous artworks for a popular online retailer and desperate to improve her situation, Claire is lured into a Faustian bargain with Aiden Markel, a powerful gallery owner. She agrees to forge a painting—a Degas masterpiece stolen from the Gardner Museum—in exchange for a one-woman show in his renowned gallery. But when that very same long-missing Degas painting is delivered to Claire’s studio, she begins to suspect that it may itself be a forgery.
Her desperate search for the truth leads Claire into a labyrinth of deceit where secrets hidden since the late nineteenth century may be the only evidence that can now save her life.
From an art perspective, this is an educational novel. The portrayal of how modern forgery is accomplished with methods and techniques was fascinating and I loved that Degas was the artist in question. The author has definitely done her research and the story reads as authentic, although I do not have an art history background. I didn't love the characters and found them somewhat stereotypical. The story wasn't a quick one for me and it took a long time to get through this one. The art history standpoint was terrific.
Bottom line: I liked it, I didn't love it. I could have done without the moderate, unnecessary profanity. I hate the "F" word.

Any books you’re particularly hoping to be gifted this year? Any that you’re giving as presents this holiday season?
It's actually a lean book year when it comes to Christmas presents. I have one specific book on my list. Banana Split by Josi Kilpack. It's part of her culinary mystery series and I received the one after it for my birthday. My son has been wanting two books on reading facial expressions (think Lie to Me) and he will find those under our Christmas tree. Other than that, books are the one thing we tend to get and give year round.
Breaking the Code: A Father's Secret, a Daughter's Journey, and the Question That Changed Everything by Karen Fisher-Alaniz (giveaway win from CMash reads)
Thinking...about the tragedy in Connecticut. As a parent, it just hits you right in the heart. I hate seeing headlines that autism was partly to blame or that gun control is the answer. Connecticut has some of the most restrictive laws and gun bans won't stop senseless violence and autism isn't a mental disorder. My heart is very tender thinking about those children and families.
Gratitude...for the ~200 lbs of beef I picked up from the butcher that is now in my freezer and I am grateful to my mom for her help in defrosting it today.
I'm just at the beginning of my HVLP experience and couldn't find starting points for many finishes. If you email the HVLP or finish manufacturer you'll get good recommendations, but none seem willing to provide their complete list, just one answer at a time. So with this post, I'm starting a list. @Peter Halle agreed to sticky this at the top of the finishing forum to make it easier to find.
My request to all of you is, please reply with the combinations that have been recommended by the manufacturer to you, and whether you found that sufficient, or if you had to modify it. I will compile the answers into the table below.

Last week I asked my first question about finishing. I mentioned I was not yet ready for HVLP or any spray painting. On the weekend I asked one of my good friend "Youtube" to show me some videos to help understand. I first found video from Easwood Company. Of course they try to sell their products, but that particular video was really informative to me. From that viseo I learned some techniques and that you can use bottom feed and gravity feed spray gun. If I was to order a spray gun before viewing those videos I would have no clue what the difference is and what to look for.
Great start!!! Now, if we could just get @tjbnwi, @JCLP, and a few others with considerable expertise to compile their experiences in a similar table with appropriate notes and suggestions, we'd really be off to a good start. I, for one, truly admire their expertise and wish it could be more available as I start into the world of HVLP.
@Sparktrician @Mario Turcot Thank you! My hope is to take the tables others post and integrate them into the one I started so that there is a single source of "truth" for everyone. I suspect that attaching an Excel spreadsheet might be a better option though.
When I can find the time I will contribute to this. One of the biggest issues would be some of the equipment I use and environmental changes. Not to many here have 10K in finish sprayers set up.
Always listen to what the spray is telling you. You will hear changes before you’ll ever see a finish flaw.
Below are 3 sprayers and 4 guns I’m using on the current job, each one is set differently to adjust for the machine and product it is delivering. The Triton I had to decrease fluid pressure on from the start at 7 AM to the temp change at 1 PM. It was just a 2 psi change, but I had to make the change to keep the finish consistent. As the day cooled I had to add the 2 psi back.
Applicator: Fuji Q5, power adjusted to the 4 o'clock position, 3M PPS, T75 Gravity gun. This may will need to be adjusted if you are using the T70 Siphon gun
Aircap: 1.5 mm for cabinet door size panels. For large panels ( fridge size ) I use a 2.5 mm to get a better fan with full power on the Q5
This paint is very forgiving as long as you apply the correct wet mils. I thin this 10% with distilled water. Do not exceed as I have done this and it does affect the film and hardness. Some people use the Extender product from BM. I have tried that and found the paint does not dry as hard. Use WATER only. Make sure you fan width is about 5-6 inches and that you are not putting too much paint as it will affect the level of atomization. Keep the gun about 7-8 inches away from the surface, overlap 50%. It should take you about 2-3 seconds to do a 16" pass.
As many of you know, I have been spraying PPG Breakthrough, #V51-410C, tinted to a medium to dark grey. As I have had great success in laying down a very smooth coat I thought everything was going well until I looked at it uner an LED light. You see from the photo below that the colour turns out blotching and not smooth looking. It was smooth to the touch, but looked like crap when you look at the panel under the LED light at an angle. So I started doing a lot of testing with thinning, air pressure, needle size and spraying technique to rectify the situation, but had no luck. After much research, on the web and talking to paint experts and PPG support, I came to the conclusion that the colorant used to tint the base was not compatible.
Found out that some PPG dealers, who were also BM dealers, are using BM colourants to tint the paint. Now many think that because Breakthrough is an acrylic paint and the BM colourant are also acrylic that it would work. WRONG.
After many discussions with PPG, they informed me that the only colourants that are compatible with Breakthrough is their 96 line of colorants. So off I went looking for a PPG dealer that used their colorants. To my surprise, it proved very difficult as many of their dealers our also BM dealers. So they gave me a location of one of their corporate stores, not a BM dealer, and I purchased a gallon using their tints. Guess what, it works perfectly.
As a warning, the acrylic that BM uses and PPG uses for their paints is not the same. Many people also use BM extender to thin Breakthrough. Do not, as the acrylic resin of BM Extender is not the same as the acrylic used in Breakthrough. Only use water to thin the paint. Also, be careful. Some PPG dealer will use the Glycol version of their colorants to tint Breakthrough. They are not compatible. You never put Glycol in an Acrylic based paint.
The two additional photos below illustrates the compatibilty of BM Colourant in Breakthrough. This can has been sitting for 2 days. The can tinted with PPG colorants did not do that after 2 days.

Now, it may sound a bit awkward and somewhat corny, however, it is one of the amazing ways to enjoy physical pleasure without actually getting physical. Well, no need second guessing; we are talking about phone sex, and it is a great way to spice up your sex life.
Well, are you feeling shy and unsure about initiating phone sex? Then the following tips should help you steer the ship perfectly.
While phone sex should come naturally, first timers are advised to do a little prep-up beforehand. The main aim is to have a memorable experience, so maybe prepare a list of things you want to do. Also, let your sex toys and erotic outfits be ready for that call.
Make sure that you and your partner are equally prepared for it and you can also discuss what you are expecting to happen during the phone sex before you even start.
Privacy is extremely important during phone sex. You wouldn't want anyone storming into your room or listening to your conversation. This can ruin the mood, make you extremely uncomfortable and eventual eliminate the benefits of engaging in the act.
Phone sex is an extremely safe option to satisfy your sexual urges, but can die off more quickly than you thought. To get the most out of it and avoid killing the vibe, establish enough trust with your partner and utilize your brain in turning the experience into an incredible heated session.
Unlike physical intimacy, over the phone, you're free to say whatsoever you want, as the lack of physical contact breeds confidence.
So, never limit yourself by holding back on those fantasies. Phone sex gives you the green light to go all out with them and discuss all those things you wouldn't normally do with your partner.
Just like stated above, there are no restriction on words, giving you access to say whatever you desire. The more detailed and raunchy you are, the more vivid the picture you're painting in your partner's head becomes. Utilize everything in your word bank to amplify the sexual tension. Get dirty and erotic with your moans, pleas and requests. This would guarantee heightened pleasure from creating a more sexual experience.

It is better to do thine own duty, however lacking in merit, than to do that of another, even though efficiently. It is better to die doing one's own duty, for to do the duty of another is fraught with danger. - World Quotations
It is better to do thine own duty, however lacking in merit, than to do that of another, even though efficiently. It is better to die doing one’s own duty, for to do the duty of another is fraught with danger.
Valor, glory, firmness, skill, generosity, steadiness in battle and ability to rule — these constitute the duty of a soldier. They flow from his own nature.
The live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart.
When you move amidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike, there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you life in the wisdom of the Self.
O Krishna, the stillness of divine union which you describe is beyond my comprehension. How can the mind, which is so restless, attain lasting peace? Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent, powerful, violent; trying to control it is like trying to tame the wind.
That freedom came from inside, from his thoughts, from his soul; and nobody could take that from him.
The Superset idea was presented to World Ventures during 2003, and since then the dream has been turned into a reality. Apart from funding, we were able to help build a professional management team. World Ventures recruited Edward Freedman as Superset's CEO. Freedman is the man who was credited with taking Manchester United FC from a portacabin to what it is today. He is also the man who helped create the musical phenomenon that was the Spice Girls.
Superset is a one-day tennis tournament with prize money higher than ever before. Following a successful debut in the USA at Portland in 2003, and then the European launch at the Wembley Arena in the UK on the 3rd October 2004. Superset is a fusion of sport and entertainment. It is fast and furious with a team of 8 top world players battling it out in two sessions. The first being the eliminator leading to the final 4 players. The winner at Wembley takes prize money of £250,000!
Instead of alienating the tennis community as one might have expected, the biggest factor in Supersets monumental rise in just one year has been its ability to gain the support of not only the worlds top players, but also the games management and governing bodies.
Superset is similar to the one-day Cricket event which took the Cricket fraternity by storm. Superset is set to do the same!
World Ventures welcomes any interest in investment into Superset Tennis, or any of its ventures. Please contact World Ventures if you wish to express an interest.
AS THE crow flies, it is ten miles from Wimbledon to Wembley and there was one green and purple tie on display as Alan Mills  fresh from a cameo role in the new feature film based on the premise that love is the answer to an Englishman winning rather than the score most of them make there  moonlighted as the referee of the sports newest show, SuperSet. In every other concept, it was akin to playing tennis on the other side of the moon. Whether SuperSet is here to stay is in the lap of the admission-paying members of the public and whether television thinks it can move more people to watch tennis at an event in this country than those mesmerised by the All England Championships. Those enticed to northwest rather than southwest London on a wickedly wet afternoon, thoroughly relished the experience.
The format is simple: one set, one court, one chance and heaven help you if you drop serve. The contest at the Wembley Arena yesterday would offer £250,000 to the winner, but if you thought the other seven in the contest were simply attending on a whim and willingly gave their serve and services for free, that was not the case. Each of the participants received £50,000, only the winner collected five times that much.
Considering that Roger Federer, the world No 1, took home £602,500 for becoming Wimbledon champion for the second time in July, it is not a bad return for an afternoon/evenings work. The champion here would have to win three sets for, ostensibly, the event started at the quarter-final stage and was then played through to its gyrating climax. Federer yesterday defeated Andy Roddick, the world No 2, 6-4, 6-0 to win the Thailand Open on his debut in Bangkok  a crushing validation of his talents and his twelfth consecutive victory in a tournament final, which equalled the records of John McEnroe in 1984-85 when he played the finest tennis of his life, and Bjorn Borg in 1979-80, the height of his powers. You wont catch Federer SuperSetting for a while.
Borg doesnt go near a court these days other than the odd private hit in Sweden; McEnroe was at the vanguard of the crew who descended on a venue where he used to wow them in the days of the Benson and Hedges tournament. He knows most of the nooks and crannies of this musty stadium but even he never came on court to an umpire with HawkEye to help him to endorse any line calls he was not happy with.
McEnroe, being McEnroe hammed it up a bit but there was determination etched into everything he did in the 24 minutes that it took to provide Andrew Murray, the 17-year-old from Scotland, with a rude awakening into this venture. The veteran was cut and thrust, winning 6-1. I didnt play well, Murray said. He hardly missed a first serve, his reflexes around the net were excellent. I told him it was an honour to be on the opposite side of the net to him.
McEnroe knows what it is like to be a junior with the world at his feet, he coped the best way he could and became a great of the game whose star refuses to dim. Whether Murray can get that far, a lot of time will tell, but he has an idea of what lies ahead, even if it all went by in the bit of a blur.
The opening match lasted over an hour longer, Boris Becker playing the second longest set of his life. Losing 11-10 to Greg Rusedski, there were four attempts to change calls and only one proved that a linesmans eyes were the slightest bit suspect. The eyes of the judges had it rather than the players, but Becker often had more interest in those females walking around the court  and especially the two who accompanied him from the locker-room  as he did staring down the British No 2.
Indeed, Becker had four match points at 6-5 and missing the second brought a disbelieving rebuke from Goran Ivanisevic. I couldnt believe he didnt make that backhand cross-court pass, that is the best shot he has, Ivanisevic, the 2001 Wimbledon champion who lost to Tommy Robredo, of Spain, 6-4, said.

I think finding a homebuilder & remodeling services company like Worthington takes so much of the worry away from the homeowner. The employees are trustworthy, on-time, prideful of their craft and do fantastic work. Why would you work with anyone else?
Not only did Worthington do a great job, they finished it on schedule, significantly under budget, and everyone involved showed great concern for doing the job properly. If I ever decide to build another home… Worthington Custom Homes will be at the top of my list.

First up, monogrammed notepads! I’ve only made a couple of these so far, but they’re super fun. So far I’ve got A for aardvark (went to Anna) and T for turtle (went to Tam), but there’s a folder on my desktop full of animal pictures from a to z. At the top of the notepad is a row listing all the months of the year, directly above the numbers 1-31. Circle the month and day you’re on, and you’re set to make your to-do list for the day! Once i get a few more of these made, I’m thinking of creating an Etsy store to sell them. Thinking of calling it ‘aimee liz | creations’.
Another little kick I’m on is iPhone case design. I recently dropped my phone and the phone’s fine, but the case didn’t fare so well. I’ve been on the hunt for a new one, and finally decided to just design my own. I’ve created a few more just for fun, which can be ordered if you want, but I also would love to start doing custom designs for people! Anything you want, I’m down to try to make it happen. Email me at aimee@aimeelizphotography.com for pricing information or with other questions.

Ulrich Boser has written a piece on the FBI Art Crime Team for the recent edition of the US News and World Report; it will also likely be a popular citation for law students composing student notes on art theft and cultural property crime for the next few years. The piece discusses the work of the FBI, and how the special art unit was instituted after the 2003 Iraq invasion. For contrast, consider that Italy's Carabinieri has had a special Art Squad for 40 years.
The piece focuses on the reasons for art theft, and how the FBI has worked to combat these thefts. One of the most interesting recoveries was the theft of North Carolina's Bill of Rights:
During the final days of the Civil War, Union Army soldiers stole North Carolina's Bill of Rights out of the state Capitol. Commissioned by President George Washington, the document was one of only 14 copies created after Congress proposed the first amendments, and for more than 140 years, it remained missing. Then, in 2003, two antiques dealers tried to peddle the work for $4 million. A millionaire philanthropist showed interest in the document, claiming that he would buy the artifact on behalf of Philadelphia's Constitution Center. But the philanthropist was actually an undercover FBI agent, and investigators seized the document. "It was like touching history," one agent said.
It is an interesting piece, but one that has been written many times, without adding much new for those like me who read these kinds of pieces.
I found the comments of Mark Durney, who blogs at Art Theft Central much more interesting. It seems Durney was interviewed for Boser's piece, but his comments didn't make the final cut. That's a shame, because Durney had a lot of interesting things to say about why many art crimes go unreported; much of which has not been discussed before. As Durney argued with respect to attracting traveling exhibitions,
. . . I described how museums and cultural institutions are often wary of reporting thefts as it can discourage other institutions and individuals from loaning works of art for special exhibitions - the cash cow for many institutions. To confirm my suspicions that special exhibitions are a source of considerable income I examined the 2006-2007 financial reports of several high-profile art museums. For example, the Philadelphia Museum of Art reported an income of $1,839,449 from special exhibitions. This amounted to a shade over 29% of the museum's program service revenue ($6,281,637 - program service revenue is revenue from admissions, special exhibition ticket sales, concession sales etc., BUT not membership dues or government grants - usually the largest portions of an institution's total revenue). Another institution, the Wadsworth Atheneum reported that in 2007 its income from special exhibitions was more than double its income from regular admissions ($842,218 versus $401,527 respectively). Although special exhibitions can be great sources of income for museums, they are also instrumental in sustaining and attracting donors and grants.
Elisabetta Povoledo this morning has a piece in the New York Times on the ARCA Masters program. There is an interview with a couple of the students, and as I pointed out earlier today, this program is the first of its kind; and in a way it is surprising it took this long to create. I imagine a number of other organizations may have had similar kinds of ideas but never really got around to creating the program or getting it off the ground. Of course there are a number of other workships and education initiatives, but those can be scattered and frustrating to keep up with. As I told the students, I'm jealous of the opportunity they have to listen to the speakers and instructors they have lined up this summer.
Universities around the world offer individual classes on art crime and related subjects: fakes and forgeries; intellectual- and cultural-property protection; looting. But Mr. Charney maintains that his program is the first to provide an interdisciplinary approach, and several scholars of art crime concurred, including Ngarino Ellis at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, who said the group “could make some important contributions to the awareness of art crime internationally.” The degree is not formally recognized by an accredited university, though Mr. Charney said he was in discussion with various institutions. (Tuition alone costs about $7,000.)
The first class of students includes art historians, lawyers, museum professionals, art conservators, a private investigator, even a retired United States Secret Service agent, an array that suggests that the subject has broad appeal.
“I was always interested in art, and now I can incorporate that interest in my business,” said John Vezeris of Annapolis, Md., who retired from the Secret Service and opened a strategic security and risk management firm.
For his thesis he wants to apply an analytical approach to structures at risk, like churches, and find the best — and cheapest — way to keep them secure. It was, he said, an area with a lot of potential for business.
We have just returned home to New Orleans after a terrific couple of weeks in Amelia Italy where I was teaching a module on antiquities law for the first ARCA MA program this summer, and presenting at the ARCA Conference. I'll have more to say on the conference and Francesco Rutelli's comments tomorrow. Today I want to highlight the MA program itself, and what a treat it was to teach antiquities law in Italy.
It was a terrific experience teaching in that setting, where heritage is often just outside your door. We had a lot of fun, but I also came away impressed with the ARCA program and what the Director, Noah Charney and all of the students are trying to create. The students were a great bunch, and will no doubt go on to do some exciting things in the heritage field. We are at a point now where these laws and policies are increasingly complex and are playing more prominent roles in all fields from collections management, curatorship, archaeology, art history, conservation, and of course purchasing and selling of antiquities. Consequently, I think it will be increasingly important for all of these field to incorporate some component of heritage education and crime prevention into their body of professional knowledge.
Heritage issues and art crime are both under-examined I think; and the opportunities to study or even teach these important ideas are sadly far too rare. That is changing I think, and one of the real treats I had in Italy were some of the exciting ideas and discussions which the ARCA MA students were able to generate. One of the frustrating things about antiquities policy in particular is it often devolves into a set of entrenched arguments, and partisans on both sides often have difficulty acknowledging the gaps and flaws in their own reasoning. Teaching a course was terrific for me because it exposed some of my own gaps, but also reaffirmed some things, and helped to crystallize my thinking.
I think perhaps the best example of that may be this statute of Germanicus, located in Amelia's Archaeological museum, and located right next door to the public library where we had classes. This statue was found just outside the city walls in 1963, in pieces, where the Roman campus would have been.
One of the questions which we all write and think about when we discuss art and heritage is where do these objects belong, and this beautiful bronze was a great catalyst for that kind of discussion. Amelia is not a particularly big town with a population of perhaps 15,000, and it doesn't receive all that many tourists, because it doesn't have a railway station and there are other sights to see in Umbria. As a result, there may be some room to question whether Germanicus belongs in Amelia, as opposed to Peruggia, Rome, or even Paris or London or Malibu. After all, not as many people can view the statue in Amelia; and the conservation techniques may not be as sophisticated as at the World's leading arts institutions (apparently the conservators may have been a little too liberal with the green paint when they touched up the statue).
However all the ARCA students seemed to agree that there is no better place than Amelia for this Bronze. And they weren't a bunch of radical archaeologists, their backgrounds were pretty diverse. The reason they agreed I think is that they had become connected to the daily rhythym of the city, they knew the butcher, the guys who run the wine bar, the bar where the locals hang out on Sundays, the restaurant owners, and they can see I think how important heritage and culture is to this city; and as a result, when we discussed the bronze, we asked a number of questions that I'm not sure you would have asked if you saw this bronze in Rome, or Paris, or London, or even Malibu.
Germanicus was removed from this living and vibrant culture which clearly respects and values its traditions and heritage. Where was the statue located? Why was it located just outside this gate, the Porta Romana? Why was it cut up and buried? Why was Germanicus such a beloved figure? As we learned from the staff at the Archaeological Museum, this Bronze was apparently cut up and buried later when Christianity gained influence in the Roman Empire and these bronzes and statues were being cut up or destroyed to make way for other images. So you can see this remarkable bronze, just a few steps away from where it would have been on display hundreds of years ago.
These are a very different set of questions than would have been asked if this statue was on display somewhere else, and I had a very different visceral reaction on seeing Germanicus then when I saw the "Bronze Statue of A Victorious Youth" at the Getty Villa for example. So antiquities law and policy, which starts with the quesiton of where theese objects belong, and how they should be excavated; probably could not have been taught in a much better setting in my view. Context was all around us, and it was a terrific open-air classroom.
An Arkansas couple has been sentenced in federal court for looting stone tools, arrowheads and other objects from sites near the Buffalo National River national park. After a plea agreement, William Graves was sentenced to six months in federal prison, with one year of probation for a felony count of violating the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979; his wife was sentenced to a year of probation for a misdemeanor violation. They must also pay $4,613 in restitution. Why does looting continue? These are not particularly stiff penatlties, particularly when compared to other kinds of theft, and the monetary value placed on these objects is not really high, nor is there enough attention paid to the archaeological record which is distorted when these objects are removed.
The couple, William A. Graves and Misty Graves, were caught near the site in January, after park rangers were alerted to recent looting at a well-known archeological site in the upper district of the park, according to a news release from the National Park Service.
At the time of the arrest, William Graves was carrying digging tools and wearing boots that matched impressions found near the looting site, the park service said, while his wife was found with their vehicle at the trailhead in possession of several artifacts and a pick.
A search warrant at the Graves’ home turned up additional tools and evidence, the release said. After a six-month investigation, the Graves were indicted in federal court. William Graves, who subsequently admitted digging in the park, also turned in “71 stone tools, projectile points, or other artifacts” he said came from the site, authorities said.
An Italian appeals court this week upheld the conviction of Italian art dealer/smuggler Giacomo Medici according to a report by Steve Scherer for Bloomberg. Medici had been convicted of conspiracy to traffic in antiquities in 2004 and sentenced to a 10-year term. It seems to be a very stiff sentence when compared to most art and antiquities crimes. The Appeals court in Rome upheld the conviction and set the sentence at eight years, while upholding a 10 million-euro fine. Italian Prosecutor Paolo Ferri told the LA Times that this was a "very hard sentence. This is the first time in Italy that this type of crime has been given such a high punishment."
This is the most recent culmination of the 1995 raid on the Medici warehouse in Switzerland which uncovered objects, polaroids, and otherevidence which has resulted in a number of repatriations from museums all over the world, but particularly North American museums. Here of course is Medici, triumphantly posed next to one of his most notorious objects, the Euphronios Krater, when it was on display at the Met in New York.
This now leaves Marion True, former curator of antiquities at the Getty, whose criminal prosecution is currently ongoing. One question worth asking is, where are the other dealers, tombaroli, and museum staff? Where were those able to elude prosecution, not just in Italy, but in the United States as well.
I'll have much more on this, and Italy's cultural policy next week in light of Francesco Rutelli's comments at last Saturday's ARCA conference in Amelia Italy, including his thoughts on what other objects need to be returned, why they were sent back, and his thoughts on objects which had been acquired by Robin Symes.
This Saturday I participated in the ARCA Conference on the study of art crime in Amelia Italy. I'll have a lot more to say about my time in Italy, ARCA, and the masters course generally in the coming days, but I wanted to share one of the highlights.
One of the speakers, and the recipient of one of the ARCA awards was Francesco Rutelli, former Culture Minister of Italy. Following his short discussion there was time for a couple of questions, and I was able to ask about his thoughts on the current disposition and position of the Euphronios Krater, on display here at the Villa Giulia. Michael Kimmelman had an interesting piece last week in the New York Times, arguing "Italy’s biggest prize in the war against looting antiquities went on view recently at the Villa Giulia in Rome" but that "Italians didn’t seem to care much". I found that to be pretty typical, as an American visiting Rome, itis not really easy to see how or it can be quite difficult to find where the Krater, or many of the other returned objects are currently on display, particularly in a city and country with so many beautiful objects and heritage sites, wich which truly is an enormous open-air museum.
I asked Rutelli about that, about how Italian's don't seem all that interested in the Krater and how not many people are visiting it. He responded with what I thought was a pretty thoughtful answer. He stated that the piece is in "the correct place" and that in "scientific terms it is correct". It is an Etruscan object, and the Villa Giulia is the Etruscan museum—arguing that if the piece had been properly and legally excavated from Cerveteri, this is where the piece would have been displayed.
He did acknowledge though, that there may have been problems with "publicity and information", a problem he traces to the current government, which he argued "should do more", and these repatriated objects should all be displayed together as part of a meaningful message.
He had a lot of interesting things to say, and the presentation of the award, and the audience of ARCA Masters students, interested observers, and reporters gave him an opportunity to look back on the repatriations of the last few years; and of course he was the public face of much of the negotiations between Italy and many North American museums. Though he did point out that it was not just North American institutions. Repatriations were also reached with Japanese and other European institutions—a fact often overlooked. I'll have much more to say about his other comments, which included Robin Symes, and a kind of a response to James Cuno, in the next few days.

Besides the bridal gown, bridal accessories is definitely a very crucial and important detail to be put into consideration when it comes to dressing up the bride for her wedding day.
It is necessary to carefully spend considerable amount of time in planning, searching and shopping for the ideal bridal accessories that you will be wearing on perhaps one of the most memorable day of your life.
This is simply because all guests who are present during your wedding celebration will anticipate the moment when you walk down the aisle looking elegant, stunning and well-groomed from head-to-toe and catching sight of what you are wearing. Bridal accessories also must be able to reflect the sense of style, charm and personality of the bride.
There is a wide array of bridal accessories you can choose from to add a finishing touch and complement your whole bridal attire.
Wedding accessories above all include items such as bridal jewelries which include pieces such as necklace, earrings and bracelets; bridal veils and tiaras; hair accessories such as French combs, bobby pins, headbands and hair clips; wraps and shawls; bridal purses, clutches and handbags and also bridal footwear such as high-heels, stilettos and even bridal flip-flops.
Should you decide to put these accessories on, do ensure that each and every item you choose matches well with your bridal gown and also complement each other in terms of design and style.
It is wise to spend time in gathering information on the latest trends available before doing your shopping. It could save you precious time once you know what is available in the current market. Other than flipping through bridal books and magazines, perhaps another practical and convenient way to find information and obtain ideas is by browsing through the many bridal websites available on the internet.
Some of these websites can also give recommendations and answer any inquiries regarding their products. Should you happen to come across accessories that you like, you can even place your order and purchase the items online.
It is best to have a general guideline that you can follow in order to narrow down your choices of accessories. For instance, you may consider the type of wedding you will be having. For formal weddings, you can opt for lavish and elaborated accessories such as diamond studded necklaces and bridal tiaras, cathedral length veil, heavily beaded bridal purses and three-inches-high stilettos.
On the other hand, simpler and more minimal accessories such as a solitaire diamond pendant worn with a simple chain, a straw hat for outdoor wedding and flat pumps or bridal flip-flops are more suitable for semi- to informal weddings.
It is also a common practice nowadays that the bride will pick accessories according to the theme of the wedding. There are many choices of accessories available nowadays that are specially designed and crafted to suit numerous wedding themes.
For example, a starfish-shaped diamond pendant and matching sets of earrings can be worn during a beach wedding; bridal purses, shawls or bridal flip-flops with floral details or decorations are perfect for floral-themed garden weddings.
Also, select items that you can afford and sit well with your budget. There is no point in spending more than you can afford on the most expensive piece of item you can get your hands on but later to find out that it does not match the other details of your bridal attire.
For instance, it is rather inappropriate wearing such an elaborate set of accessories and jewelries but the style of your gown is actually rather simple and plain. When doing your shopping, it is a good idea to try out your jewelries and other accessories together with your bridal gown or even the hairdo you will be wearing on that day.
This way you will be able to determine whether all the details complement each other so that you will be able to make changes to either one if necessary. Most importantly, choose pieces that you simply like and feel comfortable when putting them on.
Last but not least, do keep in mind that bridal accessories must not be improperly flashy that it overshadows all the other details of your bridal outfit. Yet, they should look stunning and dazzling and reflects your unique personality and most importantly, the elegance of a bride on the happiest day of her life.
After the end of your ceremony, make sure that all these accessories and jewelries are kept properly in boxes lined with soft paper so that they can last longer and act as priceless mementos of a wonderful wedding to remember for years and years to come.

The first site is a simple site about Australian Parks. It shows how you can quickly and easily build a personal site with just the building blocks that are part of Joomla. It includes a personal blog, weblinks, and a very simple image gallery.
The second site is slightly more complex and represents what you might do if you are building a site for a small business, in this case a Fruit Shop.
In building either style site, or something completely different, you will probably want to add extensions and either create or purchase your own template. Many Joomla users start by modifying the templates that come with the core distribution so that they include special images and other design elements that relate to their site's focus.
April 8, 1997 at nursing home, formerly of Bexley. Dearly loved wife of Les (deceased) beloved mother of Phyl, Bob, Val, Elaine, Les and their respective families.

Whoops, good call. Point of safety for an Ancient Black Dragon then would be 880/6=146, which is a bit harder for a young mage to achieve.
It takes like 15 minutes to get to CL 15. If I had a high damage wand with sufficient charges and 20 squares between us with nothing else to worry about, I'd absolutely attack that dragon. They breath rarely, and with attenuated breath, even if they double breath right at the beginning, you're in no danger. I'd be worried about it making it to melee range--it has to die before that happens--I wouldn't worry about the breath attack at all.
Breath attenuation is nerfed in 4.1. It no longer does essentially zero damage at max range, so it's probably better to let it be. It's just one DL 40 monster. It's not likely to have a game changer artifact or anything.
Ancient Ds cast spells 1/6, and the breath attack is one of 3 (or 4) spells? As long as I can survive 1 breath and can kill it before it gets to melee range, I'll attack. This was true even pre-attenuation.
Breath attenuation is nerfed in 4.1. It no longer does essentially zero damage at max range, so it's probably better to let it be.
No idea when this changed, but yes I learned that recently. Thinking dracoliches were now xp pinatas, I engaged one in ranged combat from a big distance without nether resistance, and was surprised when my hps went down from 545 to 109 in a single nether breath. And that was with a dracolich at 70% health.
i'm getting contrasting opinions here. Some say sure, it's easy, go for it, some agree that it would likely have killed me. (rAcid, no temp resist)
It depends on how many HP you had and what the local terrain was like. If you had enough to survive one breath, and the ability to escape if that one breath did come out, and enough room to be able to engage in a ranged fight, and a source of temporary haste, then fighting the dragon would have been a good idea. That's a lot of ifs, but they're all things that you should be keeping in mind all the time anyway.

The Haywood County Arts Council (HCAC), serving as a Designated County Partner of the North Carolina Arts Council, is pleased to announce the 2018-19 subgrantees for the Grassroots Arts Program. These awards are for organizations producing high quality arts programming. The sub grantees for this grant period are:
In 1977, the North Carolina General Assembly established the Grassroots Arts Program to ensure that every citizen has access to quality arts experiences. The program provides funding for the arts in all 100 counties in North Carolina. A local arts council, like the Haywood County Arts Council, approved by the North Carolina Arts Council to receive and administer Grassroots funds is known as a Designated County Partner (DCP).
“As an arts council, one of our jobs is to support other great organizations that are doing programming well and I am thrilled to be able to share funding with our sub grantees this year.” said Leigh Forrester, Executive Director of the Haywood County Arts Council. “Our partnership with the North Carolina Arts Council is very important to the life of our organization and in the ways we’re able to serve our community.”
Editor’s Note: Melissa Fenton (creator of 4 Boys Mother) has written countless articles for a very diverse audience of moms. Some of those articles have been published on the website Grown and Flown, where topics cater to parents whose children have grown up and left home. Melissa knows what this feels like, and many of her readers do too. But what are the grown-and-flown children feeling? What’s leaving home been like for them?
Each day this week, we will post an article written by a current college student. These students were recently asked, “If you could tell your mom anything at all, what would you want her to know about you or your life?” These articles are their answers and offer moms a different perspective–a chance to see the world through your college-aged child’s eyes.
I’m sure you remember when I went to the psych ward, and that it took me five days to call you and let you know where I was. I didn’t know how to tell you that I had tried to kill myself, that I wasn’t okay even though I kept saying I was. I could not figure out how to deal with the constant voice in my head saying I had somehow disappointed you. With my younger brother being difficult to care for, and my Dad being long gone, I had always tried to be the easy kid. Yet in trying to hold it all together, I failed to realize how far apart we had drifted.
The things is, in therapy, I sit around and talk about my childhood and how various unhealthy situations in my past led to my depression. I know you (and other mothers) blame yourselves when your kid is depressed. You think, What could I have done differently? There was nothing you could have done differently. You did the best you could. You raised me well.
Who was it that taught me right from wrong? You did. And not the way my father did—by hitting me with a belt. You chose to let cooler heads prevail and showed me what was wrong with a simple “no” and a disapproving frown. That was all it took for me to never misbehave in front of you.
Who was it that taught me how to be happy? You did. Though my condition made it difficult to smile and sometimes caused me to sit alone in my room for days, you always pulled me from my isolation and made me feel like I mattered. Whether we watched a movie, played video games with my brother, or made fresh cookies together, you never failed to make me smile.
The hardest lesson I have had to learn, and the reason I have had such trouble dealing with my depression while in college, is how to be away from you. Because although I did my best to require nothing from you, you gave me so much that I never realized nor appreciated till this moment. My depression is in no way your fault, for you were always a perfect mother. It is a medical issue within me, and thanks to all you have taught me, I know I can face it straight on.
I want every mother dealing with a child who suffers from a mental disorder to know that it’s not your fault. This world we live in hurts children, scars them, and sometimes they won’t tell you what’s wrong. It’s hard for us to talk about, and we feel like we are disappointing you somehow. How would you tell your own mother that you wanted to kill yourself? She is the one who gave you life—how can you tell her that you want to throw it away?
Even though it is so hard for them to find the words, you’ll always know when they aren’t okay—just like my mom always knew—and you’ll get them through this. Because there is no force on earth, not even depression, greater than a mother’s love.
Melissa L. Fenton here! I am a freelance writer, mother runner, adjunct librarian, and sewing and knitting nut. You can find my writing all over the internet, but my work mostly on the dinner table.

"The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, especially when the man is a serial killer and the timid mouse soon turns out to be even more psychotic than he is".
To me, this movie really points to what a powerful (and devastating) effect an ideology can have on a simpler minded folk. I admit it is a bit biased as it is a Polish-made and it recounts historical events (1939) as seen primarily from a polish perspective (which made it controversial), but I think there is plenty of blame to go around on both sides (actually on all 4 sides). It is a good history reminder.
I tried to watch it on Youtube, but it is one of those where you have to sign up, otherwise the only version is in Polish? Did you see it at the cinema or online?
My Polish pal recounted stories of her family's near past, and they are scarred beyond belief as a family.. something their newer generations will probably help fade during their lifetimes. I will send my pal the link and attempt to watch it myself, but I am not a fan of heartstrings being pulled, so I will try not to get mad and persevere through it.
I also found it hard to watch at times, and maybe that's because I'm predominantly Polish by blood. The older I get, however, the more I am bothered by such graphic recreations of wanton cruelty and the gore of innocents. Especially when it portrays real groups of people and still-present political entities. I'm wary of the emotional strings being pulled in such a film. Still, I find Wolyn (Volhynia), both the film and the historical event, to have important, even timely, examples to learn from. I would say they pushed it too far in some places, although it is hard to judge what people need to see and what they don't. I also find it a little too real to be able to rate as a film, but thank you for sharing it here.
Realive (Proyecto Lazaro), (2016) - A young man with a terminal brain cancer decides to cryogenically preserve himself in order to be revived by the future medicine. After he is successfully revived in the future, he begins to question his life, and life in general, and whether he made the right choice. The idea for the movie is very interesting, and there are some good questions raised by it, but I do wish they flushed some of these ideas out a bit more. Though I believe the movie did make its point (and the end was good). 7/10
[I suppose hypothetically, it's possible to commit suicide in order to live and also in order to die]
Fearless (1993) - A bit older, but along the same lines. A man gets a second chance in life by surviving an airplane crash. He's good at helping other survivors but has difficulty readjusting back to his old life himself. It's a really well done psychological drama, and gives a good insight into someone who's going through a PTSD.

A great, low-budget independent thriller 8.5/10. Their budget was $30,000 and they made every penny count.
Into The Forest (2015) Someone got paid for writing this script and actors chose to be in it...LOLZ! 1/10 for sheer comedic idiocy.
The Girl With All The Gifts (2016) 7.5/10 A different take on the zombie phenomena that was quite enjoyable.
Documentary about the Communist regime working inside the USA government and calling themselves Democratic Socialists. 8/10
Manifesto. An artfully done overview of different contemporary art viewpoints. This movie is a visual treat. Good acting too. 8.5/10
The Square. Another art-related indie film. This one is a social satire, essentially pointing at people’s/society’s hypocrisy. (What happened to the square?) This movie is a little bit longer and less streamlined (plot-wise), so a bit of patience is needed, but it has a number of well-done ironic scenes, some of which are subtle (as with street beggars) and some quite powerful, as the noted “jungle” scene with Terry Notary. Okay for one time viewing. 6/10
This British drama tells the story of how an author created much loved children’s tales through interactions with his young son. The film aims to balance child-like wonder and imagination with the sadness and uncertainty of wartime and family tensions, and it gives an unusual biographical glimpse into the relationship of author, Alan Alexander Milne (Domhnall Gleeson) to his young son, Christopher Robin.
The film is as much about the negative consequences of stardom as it is about family and social disharmony. Teddy bears are soft and cuddly, the film says, but celebrity status has teeth that can hurt. This is a film that explores movingly the clash between reality and childhood innocence. In addressing that clash, Christopher Robin later describes his father as “climbing on my infant shoulders....(leaving) me with nothing but the empty fame of being his son”.
A Jungian-based short animated film about the collective shadow aspect of the West. Well-done and quite relevant.
"The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge." - Jung.
“Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is…if it is repressed and isolated from consciousness, it never gets corrected.” - Jung.
“Filling the conscious mind with ideal conceptions is a characteristic of Western theosophy, but not the confrontation with the shadow and the world of darkness. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.” - Jung.
“An individual’s shadow is invariably bound up with the collective shadow of his group, and as he digests his own evil, a fragment of the collective evil is invariably co-digested at the same time.” -Erich Neumann.

I am currently a college student. I am renting a 3 bedroom apartment with two other guys. Last year when we signed the lease the landlord showed us the place and it appeared to be in good condition.
Out lease started in June but because all three of us were home for the summer we are just moving in now for the semester. I stopped by the apartment this past Saturday to drop some things off and I’m planning on moving in permanently on 8/29. When I got there the floors were all covered in grim, dust and garbage from the previous tenants. The floor in the bathroom was so bad no one would go in there without shoes on. The shower was coated in grim.
Our kitchen sink isn’t hooked up either. It’s like its not attached to the plumbing. Also our landlord gave one set of keys to one of my roomates and when I asked for a set he gave me his and told me I had to return them and I would need to make a copy of my roommates for my own use. Is he responsible for providing us all with keys to the apartment?
I told the landlord and he said a cleaning crew was supposed to clean it and he will call them again. Its already been over 2 months since we have had the lease and he hasn;t bothered basic maintenance on the place. I’m wondering what the right course of action is to make sure the apartment is clean and working properly and that it will not be my responsibility to do so?
All i can say is keep calling until the cleaning crew cleans. Take pictures if you have to. Record all correspondence. It is the landlords responsiblity to maintain the place..
does this sound pretty reasonable (price-wise)? This is an apartment I’m really interested in, but I’m not sure if this is a good find or too much.
Please let me know what you think! I’m pretty clueless when it comes to apartments and prices. Thanks for all your help!
From what you are saying and from looking at the layout, I’d say your getting a pretty good deal. In fact depending on where your at I’d say it’s a very good deal. If it’s where you want, close to your work, shopping etc, I wouldn’t hesitate.
You and your newly-wedded husband move to Manhatten, NYC a few months after the honeymoon. You settle down in a 2 bedroom apartment and are job hunting when you find out you are expecting a boy!
You have your beautiful baby boy and want to name him something that starts with a C (two-syllables) and have a middle name that is one-syllable. You name him: 1.C_______ ______
Your baby boy soon turns into a toddler and is running around and playing all of the time. You want him to have a playmate but you aren’t ready to have more kids yet. So you adopt a puppy! She is an Australian Shepard named: 2.____________ . Her and your son play together all of the time. He loves to help you take the dog for walks and loves to play with him.
You have the twins and have been thinking that you want their middle names to be each of their grandmothers. Your mother’s name is Renee and your husbands is Quinn. So your two beautiful young daughters names are: 3. _________ Renee & 4. ________ Quinn .
Your son loves playing with the girls and the girls are fascinated with the dog. But you, on the other hand, are getting a little bit cramped. It’s time to move.
Moving day comes. You pack up your stuff and haul it to a 5 bedroom, 4.5 bath loft! It’s gorgeous with the open floor plan and ceiling to floor windows. You, your husband and the kids love it.
Shortly after the girls turn one, you are expecting again. Twins again! Wow! One boy, one girl. You want their names to be special, they should both start with the letter ‘ T ‘. When the due date comes you decide on: 5. T______ _______ & 6.T_______ ________ .
The kids are getting along great, most of the time, and you and your husband are enjoying your loft and your life in Manhatten. You decide not to have any more kids, but the dog is needing someone to keep her company when the kids go back to school and you are back working, so you get one more puppy. She’s a Laberdoodle. Her name is: __________
When we went to see the place the specific floor plan we would move into wasn’t available for showing so we saw a model room all furnished and nice. We were told that our apartment would come with 2 parking spaces.
Yesterday we came to the place with our stuff but the floor plan is different from the brochure (like missing a closet space and the bathroom isn’t attached to two bedrooms and it looks less than perfect)… Also now we were told that we only get one parking space.
We stayed the evening because we had nowhere to go and were beat. We also have to ‘wait’ until Monday to talk to someone who can answer our questions.
Nobody is available to talk because it is Sunday. We had nowhere to go so my roommate got the keys and gave rent and deposit which I think is the only act of ‘acceptance’ we have shown so far. What kind of attorney will I need? There is a form listing numbers I can call but I guess there’s nothing I can do until tomorrow morning.
Yes, it’s misrepresentation, which is covered in either a commercial code or a Sale of Goods Act. Also, if you don’t want to stay (for reduced terms only, of course), you’ve suffered an economic loss. It’s important NOT to act in any way that might be perceived as acceptance. And keep everything pertaining to original terms to bring to atty’s office first thing Monday.
So I’m looking for my first apartment for the big take off from the nest. I’ve got my roommate, some savings, and I’m ready to look into apartments. I’ve found one that is looking very nice, but I’m not sure how it is sizewise.
It’s Two bedrooms, one bathroom. Fully equipped kitchen and all that (doesn’t have any washing machines, unfortunately) but it says it’s 774 ft. Would that be enough for two people to live comfortably? I just got out of college, and the rooms were probably about 10×10, which was a bit too small for my comfort.
Thanks in advanced. ^.^ I can’t go visit in person because it’s half a country away (right now) and I’d like to be able to move into a place as soon as I get there, so I’m not homeless for a few days/weeks. My roomie is in that state, though, so she’d be able to visit at some point in time. I just want to get a good reference before I tell her.
EDIT: Yes, I know that it’s 774 Sq feet. v___v I’m asking for a size reference so I can picture exactly HOW big it is and how big the rooms are. I have a very bad distance judgement so I can’t tell how big that is. Is it the size of a two car garage, is is bigger, smaller, cramped for two people, large for an apartment, ect. ect. The number doesn’t mean anything to me. 774 sq feet could mean an apartment thats only a 13.5 x 13.5 square if you took everything out. And 13.5 feet has no visual reference for me. My spacial judgment is horrible at best. (I can’t even measure an inch accurately. )
My dorm was 10 by 10 which was 100 feet squared. This apartment is 7 times that, yes, but would the rooms be smaller or larger then that in estimate, according to the room plan?
Also, I’m horrible at math. ^^; My strong points are in reading and comprehension, with a dash of writing skill in there.
Ever hear of a measuring tape? Use one to measure a bedroom near you. How does it feel to you? If it’s big enough, multiply the width by the length. Example: your 10 by 10 dorm has 100 square feet. Then subtract that from the 774… Two bedrooms? Do that twice. Then do the same with a kitchen you feel good in…. Do with all the rooms. If you have space left from the 774? You will probably find it spacious. More important though is “are your lifestyles compatible?” Because if not even a football stadium won’t do.
I live in a three bedroom apartment with two of my friends, and in april, we had bed bugs in our house, but only in my room. I found out I had bed bugs because I am allergic to them, and was getting these enormous swollen bug bites, that were literally 6 inches in diameter. My roommates, friends and parents all thought I was nuts until i insisted on having a bed bug dog come in, at my expense, and the dog found the bugs in my room. I called the building’s management, and they sent in the exterminator that they have on retainer.
This exterminator seemed really incompetent compared with the other two exterminators I had spoken with. Both of the exterminators I spoke too described an extermination process that would require a very extensive cleaning and 4-6 hours of work on their part. The building refused to pay for either of their services though, and sent their exterminator in. He literally told me to “wash my sheets” and then spent about half an hour spritzing some chemicals around the house.
The problem seemed to be taken care of though, because it was caught early. Then, about two weeks ago, I was entering my apartment, and one of the girls who just moved in across the hall stopped me. She asked if we had ever had bed bugs, and i told her we had. She informed me that her apartment, as well as the other apartment on our floor (there are only three apartments per floor) had bed bugs. So do all the apartments below us, and all the apartments above us. She said the building knew of the problem, yet had not exterminated at all.
I woke up yesterday with the exact same bites that I got the first time around. I know they are not mosquito bites because I only ever have had bug bites that were this large when we had bed bugs the first time around.
But our building never contacted us about the bed bugs, and my roommate called to ask what the plan of action was. They said they would be exterminating all the apartments sometime last week. they never exterminated or followed up with us.
At this point, I want to move out of my apartment. My dad has offered to let me and my cat move in with him for a few months, and I would like to do that. I am planning to ditch all my furniture, including the brand new bed I bought after the last round of bed bug exterminations. Please advise me on whether or not it is possible to break my lease, especially given how negligent the land lords have been.
It seems like you may have to move to get rid of the bed bugs after reading material on the web about them. Just be sure to thoroughly clean anything you take so you don’t take hitchhikers!
Friends that brought bed bugs into the house in a piece of used furniture said that the exterminator they had sprayed all of their wood furniture in all cracks and crevices, all of the wood flooring because of the slight cracks between the boards, and especially the floorboards. It needs to be very thorough or of no benefit.
I suggest you contact the city in which you reside and ask if they have a housing or rental ombudsman. Because bed bugs have become a huge problem in some areas they may have a policy regarding their extermination or at least be able to inform you of your rights as a renter. They may be interested to learn that your building seems to be bed bug central.
We live in a small town 2 hours from the city we plan to move to in two months.. We have so many plans that require the other that we cant not go through with them. She just broke up with me though, We are really all the other has so we have agreed to stay friends and still move into an apartment together. My first question is that since we currently stay in one room at my grandparents house should I still sleep in the same bed? She just bought a queen so that we would have more room because we have 3 aniimals. But we are going to be here a bit longer and there is no room for a second bed here so what should I do? Sleep on the floor? The next question is when we move we can only really afford a one bedroom place and we already have the apartment picked out so should I get my own bed and sleep in the same room or like have a dresser and stuff in the bedroom but sleep in the living room? Its sorta of clear that I am all by myself in this situation. My friends here wouldnt answer their phone to be supportive and my other friends live too far away so I dont really know what to do. I know that especially when we move I dont want to be sleeping in the same bed as her. I dont plan to be dating anyone so that wont be a problem fyi. She was kind of my one and only so now all I have is my family. And what do I do about my family. They treat her like family. I dont want them to be mad at her its not her fault that she doesnt love me in that way. I’m not even sure if I would tell them but I dont know….I’m really sad right now, lost, and have no where to run away from this.
I live in oklahoma City. I live in an apartment complex at the 3rd floor. I’m always terrified about tornadoes and tomorrow we wait strong thunderstorms in this area. My apt complex has a plan that is not one of the best since you have to walk outside for 3 minutes to reach a church. I was wondering what should I do if I CAN’T LEAVE MY APT and I don’t find anybody else in the building(always think to the worse to be prepared). I have two internal bathrooms with bathtubs and a walk-in closet between the master bedroom and a bathroom. I really appreciate your help.
I know I should reach the lowest level of the building or basement. But we don’t have any basement. I’d really appreciate an advise in case I need or have to remain in my apt.
Without knowing more about your building’s construction it’s not easy to say. The biggest risk being in a building hit by a tornado is not getting sucked out but structural collapse or being hit by flying debris.
Get to the strongest part of your building. Ideally at least one wall in the room you’re in should be a load bearing structural wall. If your building has internal stairs (ie one’s without windows towards the middle of the building) they may be a good choice. Bathrooms tend to be the best room in a house due to the piping in the walls adding extra strength. One of your bathrooms may also be a good choice.
Get away from windows. Ideally the room that you’re in shouldn’t have any. You should also take further steps to protect yourself from flying or falling debris. If you shelter in your bathroom you should shelter in your bath and cover yourself with a mattress or something similar.
Purpose. A methodological approach was developed to facilitate expansion of clinical pharmacist-managed anticoagulation services across an integrated health care delivery network.
Methods. A stepwise approach to the development and implementation of ambulatory care clinical pharmacy services was used to facilitate expansion of pharmacistmanaged anticoagulation clinics in a university hospital setting and a community hospital within the same health network.
Results. The Health Alliance of Greater Cincinnati successfully created a care delivery model using clinical pharmacists to provide comprehensive anticoagulation management services at a university hospital and a community hospital. The incidence of thromboembolic events was significantly lower in the pharmacy anticoagulation service patients versus the patients in the usual care setting (p = 0.005). A statistically significant decrease in minor bleeding events was observed in the pharmacist-managed group (p = 0.038). Although a decrease in major bleeding events was observed, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.075). International Normalized Ratio values of the patients managed by the pharmacy anticoagulation clinics were within the therapeutic range approximately 75% of the time.
Conclusion. A stepwise approach to the development and implementation of ambulatory care clinical pharmacy services has facilitated the expansion of pharmacistmanaged anticoagulation clinics across an integrated health system. This may serve as a valuable template for other systems as they strive to develop medication therapy management services.

Customer Relationship Management or CRM, is a company's business strategy developed to minimize costs and improve productivity by strengthening customer support, commitment, satisfaction and dedication. Best CRM gathers information from all data centres within a company to provide one, natural view of each client immediately. CRM allows customer experiencing employees in areas such as marketing, customer support and sales to make fast yet informed decisions.
It's a technique used to explore more about clients' requirements and behaviours in order to create more powerful relationships with them. At the end of the day, better customer relationships are at the center of business achievements. There are many technical elements to CRM, but considering CRM in mainly technical conditions is an error. The more useful way to think about CRM is as a procedure that will help carry together plenty of items of information about clients, revenue, marketing efficiency, responsiveness and market styles.
CRM software solutions supports sales, marketing and service functions to companies in a wide range of service sectors including consumer, logistics and transportation, public sector, utilities, financial services and much more.
Excellent post. I was checking constantly this blog and I am impressed! Extremely helpful info specially the last part, I care for such information a lot. Thank you and best of luckLinux Support Services,
While both tout their desire to reduce the State’s carbon footprint and address climate change, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli have their differences when it comes to New York State pension fund’s fossil fuel investments.
The New York state pension fund (known as the New York State Common Retirement Fund) is the third largest pension fund in the United States, with an audited value as of March 2017 of $192.4 billion in assets. The pension fund holds and invests assets of over one million state and local government employees, retirees, and beneficiaries. At issue are holdings of at least 50 oil and gas companies with significant carbon-intensive operations. Comptroller DiNapoli is the sole trustee of the pension fund, and is advised by several independent advisory committees.
DiNapoli is under pressure from Cuomo, State Senator Liz Krueger, and certain environmental groups to divest the pension fund from fossil-fuel investments. DiNapoli has pushed back on immediate divestment on several grounds, most importantly, that as a fiduciary his first priority is to earn a good return for the approximately 1.1 million New Yorkers who rely on the state pension system for their retirement security. While recognizing that the effects of climate change represent a systemic risk to the returns of the pension fund, the economy and the welfare of the people of the State, DiNapoli believes that he can be more effective in managing those systemic climate change risks by the use of the significant power of the pension fund to influence the policies of oil and gas companies. That includes shareholder activism (i.e., filing shareholder resolutions), voting proxies, investor collaborations and corporate engagement programs.
On the latter point, Comptroller DiNapoli has cited ExxonMobil’s agreement to implement a shareholder proposal, co-filed by the state pension fund and the Church of England, which caused ExxonMobil to agree to assess how it might be impacted by the Paris Agreement goals to reduce global warming. Duke Energy has responded to a similar shareholder resolution seeking to require it to analyze how the Paris Agreement will impact its business and plans to produce a climate risk assessment in the first quarter of 2018. DiNapoli asserts that because these oil and gas companies will not go out of business as a consequence of divestment of the pension fund’s holdings, he can be more effective by having a seat at the table as a shareholder to influence companies’ actions and disclosures. Critics of this view, including State Senator Krueger, believe the shareholder influence is limited and that divestment sends a stronger message than does the Comptroller’s more nuanced and varied approach.
Another investment strategy recently employed by the Comptroller was to double the pension fund’s investment-- to $4 billion-- in a low-emissions index designed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. That index is more geared toward stocks, such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., than higher carbon-emitters, such as ExxonMobil and Chevron. DiNapoli has said that since 2016 the Goldman Sachs designed index has delivered returns comparable to the Russell 1000, thereby yielding strong investment returns with the benefit of significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated with that investment.
Although DiNapoli has expressed reservations about allowing pension fund investments to be influenced by political forces, he recently agreed to join forces with Governor Cuomo and others on decarbonization strategies for the pension fund investment portfolio. While there are no immediate plans to divest the energy holdings of the pension fund, DiNapoli and Cuomo have agreed to create an independent advisory committee to develop a low carbon future roadmap for the fund. In his January 2018 State of the State Address, Cuomo called for an end to fossil fuel related activities in the pension fund and stated his intent to work with DiNapoli so New York can “put our money where our mouth is.” Cuomo then asked for a round of applause for Comptroller DiNapoli and his efforts.
Regardless of whether DiNapoli takes immediate moves to decarbonize the portfolio, the movement towards divestment is gaining momentum. California ended its pension fund investments in coal companies in 2015 and is facing pressure to decarbonize its portfolio. On January 10, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Comptroller Scott Stringer announced that NYC plans to divest its five pension funds from fossil fuel investments, which will be the largest divestment of any municipality to date. Stringer stated, “[T]his a first-in-the-nation step to protect our future and our planet – for this generation and the next. Safeguarding the retirement of our city’s police officers, teachers, firefighters and city workers is our top priority, and we believe that their financial future is linked to the sustainability of the planet.” De Blasio and Stringer were praised by environmental activists after the announcement and by State Senator Kruger who continued her call for State Comptroller DiNapoli to follow suit with respect to the New York State pension fund investments.
Lots of good intentions, lots of ideas and a bunch of strange bedfellows--only time will tell if these investment (and divestment) initiatives will continue to gain traction and make a difference. And what about us-- shouldn’t we too be employing low-emissions/decarbonization investment strategies with our portfolios?
By implementing the Observe and Correct technique on a daily basis it will help me to quickly correct my behavior instead of wasting a lot of precious life force energy making up excuses of why I need to be “perfect” to feel safe, loved and accepted in the world....

It took years for me to find the courage to become a contributing writer. See, I didn’t want to just write. I wanted to offer my words in a way that encouraged thought-provoking insights and left readers feeling satisfied and inspired. I’m a girl who typically has a lot to say and one who carries a zest for childlike imagination; yet I spent years staring at a blank screen. I anxiously yearned for the right kind inspiration to “zing” me, but I always came up empty. I found this lack of creative space deeply frustrating.
Something shifted around the same time I decided to fully devote myself to yoga. As my practice deepened, I also began to notice subtle changes about me—a slow molding of not just a brand-new me, but a better version of me. I experienced a lot of personal and creative growth on the mat. It transpired in parallel with my practice.
I firmly attribute yoga as a direct influence to my ability to realize the kind of writer I wanted to be, and to start filling that screen with me. Here are three examples:
The creative writing process comes through a private and intimate connection with yourself. To create anything with “heart” requires you to look inward. What do you represent? What do you believe in? What message are you trying to convey? As a writer, I find that I am only effective when I have a clear idea of what I am trying to accomplish. Our judgment is often clouded by the fuss and stresses that we experience in our daily life. In yoga, you learn to let the mind untangle itself from the superficial noise of our external surroundings – and especially around the emotional turmoil we feel internally. Slowly, as we learn to detach from the noise, clarity presents itself. Clarity is simply that “zing” — a moment of truth. It is clear, transparent, and free. Only with clarity can you begin to seek and define your purpose.
My practice has enhanced my ability to grasp each thought with more clarity; thus, translating the messages creatively with more “heart” and truth.
When I wrote Letting Go of Self-Judgment (An Ashtanga Yoga Story), it was the perfect representation of how yoga facilitates the mindful connection between our physical and mental state. Through yoga, we learn to identify the negativity that hinders our ability to be great; recognize and acknowledge that these “differences” exist; and practice releasing them. Yoga simply provides an opening that nurtures these exercises with compassion. It is an exercise that has enabled me to understand my true essence. What am I made up of? What makes me, me? Consequently, I have learned to accept my “flaws” and imperfections as unique and individualistic, and as what sets me apart from the rest.
This realization has impacted not only the way I behave, but also how I write. I think it keeps my writing honest and relatable.
Our minds have the power to create the life we live. Yoga accesses that innate power. This way of thinking – gratitude – is deep within us. Yoga is just a means to get out what’s already in there. It promotes a heightened sense of connection with not just ourselves, but to everything and everyone around us. Once you can cultivate a balanced view of reality, you are less preoccupied with what’s missing or what’s not meeting your expectations. You can simply be present with what is already abundantly good. This act of gratitude creates the flow of abundance. This mental shift allowed me to realize that even the simplest of existence is a true miracle in itself. Now I naturally feel more joyful and appreciative.
This is what inspires me, motivates me, and keeps me grounded – it’s the foundation of all my writing.
When I’m on the mat, I feel free, focused, and thankful. Almost immediately after a yoga practice, the words are ready to flow; crisp and meaningful. Every day, I learn something new about myself and yoga facilitates that process.
When I was a little girl I had a random obsession with elephants (especially the pink stuffed kind). Ever since then, it has been on my bucket list to see real elephants in the wild. This was our first time in Asia and although it made our trip a little more complicated, I was determined to fit a few days in Thailand.
I had a lot of planning help from my friend Brooke who had just done a Thailand trip a year or so ago. Since time was limited we only visited Chiang Mai, rather than the south where all the beaches are (that will be our next trip 😜). We stayed at the cutest airbnb with an amazing host (you can book the same one here), and felt like a local walking all around the neighborhood. There’s a mall a few blocks away with the most amazing food court. Imagine every type of asian food packed into one little room with a million food stands. I was in heaven, not to mention that a giant plate of chicken pad Thai and a coke was about 150 Thai Baht, which is less than five dollars. And I had mochi ice cream every single day we were there! Of course we could not leave without getting a $20 one hour massage either.
Our day with the elephants was everything I thought it would be. I chose the Blue Elephant Thailand Tours because Brooke had experienced this organization and I wanted to be sure I was only giving business to an ethical company. We were picked up and driven about an hour north into the jungle of Chiang Mai. Our group was small, just three couples: One couple from Germany, another from Georgia who was doing a backpacking trip around the world (amazing), and Chris and I. We spent the whole day feeding the elephants, hiking with them, bathing them, and getting to see how they interact with their “humans”. When a baby elephant is born, one of the village boys is assigned to him/her. They grow up with them and are responsible for them during the tour. It was amazing to see the elephants come walking into the village from the jungle when they heard their “human” call for them. It is like a boy and his dog! Elephants are so majestic and after that day, I love them even more.
If your employer has an annual health fair, suggest ARC’s Vegan University as a vendor. Here’s a sample email you can use that resulted in ARC doing food sampling at a recent corporate health fair and also becoming a regular provider of literature on veganism to several personal trainers for their clients.
“Just saw an email about the upcoming health fair and wanted to suggest the organization I volunteer with for the fair. We have a program called Vegan University that promotes plant-based eating with food sampling and literature. We offer regular free grocery shopping tours at local co-ops and markets like Whole Foods, Byerly’s, and Rainbow, and regular free workshops about adopting a plant-based diet. We’ve been at several employee health fairs; for example, we had tables at the CIGNA and SGI employee health fairs, and regularly have booths at community events such as the Diabetes Expo and Healthy Life Expo.
We can do free plant-based food sampling. Items typically sampled include Beyond Meat Chicken-Free Strips (sold at mainstream grocery stores now), Primal Spirit Vegan Jerky, plant-based soy and almond milks, and vegan yogurt.
So am emailing to see if this would be of interest for the health fair. I’m sure you’re aware that there has been an explosion of interest in plant-based eating in the last several years, whether people are interested in reducing animal products in their diet for health reasons or in going vegan.”
Email chelsea@animalrightscoalition.com if your employer is interested in Vegan University being at their health fair.
4 out of 6 Paradise Car Washes in the Twin Cities surrounding areas keep a Macaw as a resident “pet”. The birds live at the Savage, Apple Valley, Eagan, and East Bloomington stores. Their names are Ruby, Peanut, Speedy, and Rainbow. According to employees, the birds are in the car wash 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and have been for their entire lives.
Knowledgeable observers say the birds show signs of stress, exacerbated by being handled by the public (despite signs asking they not be handled) and by the exuberance of children and dogs who come into the car washes. Issues range from behaviors demonstrating depression to excessive feather plucking (sometimes down to bare skin). There appears to be little to no enrichment such as toys and activities provided.
Macaws live in their natural habitat for around 70 years, and they mate for life. These birds deserve a better life, and the companionship of others of their species.
During the holiday season, popular gifts sometimes include donations to hunger relief programs that send live animals as gifts to be used for food. Learn how these programs harm not only animals, but often the families and communities they’re intended to help.
A Well-Fed World’s PLANTS-4-HUNGER program provides a more compassionate and nutritious gift-giving alternative, sending 100% of your gift to four hand-picked plant-based programs that feed people without using animals.
The four projects support vegan school lunch programs in Ethiopia, provide non-GMO soybeans to farming families in Guatemala, deliver warm meals to those most in need in India, and plant community food gardens in the United States. These programs provide both immediate assistance and long-term community solutions to improve food security and nutrition.
Join ARC at one of our tastiest events, the Annual Holiday Cookie Exchange. This is a great opportunity to find new recipes or get goodies to feed holiday guests. To participate, bake 4 dozen of one type of vegan cookie (vegan means no dairy, eggs, butter, or other animal products). Bring a copy of your recipe or email it to chelsea@animalrightscoalition.com. RSVP at Vegan Meetup or the Facebook event page. Event is at 317 W 48th St. on Saturday, 12/12 from 12-2 p.m.
Also this weekend is the ARC North Vegans Holiday Potluck on Sunday, 12/13 from 3:30-6:00 p.m. at the Parkway United Church of Christ Community Room, 3120 Washburn Ave. N in Minneapolis. RSVP at Vegan Meetup or the Facebook event page.
Note that the ARC office and Ethique Nouveau, our 100% all vegan store, will have special holiday hours in addition to our regular hours (Wednesday noon-8, Thursday and Friday noon-6, and Saturday noon-5). We will also be open Sundays on December 13 and 20 from 11-3. And we will be open on Monday, December 21 and Tuesday, December 22 from 1-6.
The Huffington Post did a great story about ARC’s Cuddle Coats program on November 25. Cuddle Coats committee chair Alexandra Beane was interviewed about how Cuddle Coats is a way to give fur back to the animals. Read all about how donated furs are turned into a source of comfort for orphaned and injured animals. We’ve received a ton of furs since the article, but we also have over 60 wildlife rehabs we supply with those furs. Consider coming to a Cuddle Coats prep session, held every Wednesday evening from 6:00-7:00 at the ARC office/Ethique Nouveau vegan boutique at 317 W 48th St. in Minneapolis. We will be prepping donated fur coats and accessories for shipment to wildlife rehabilitation centers by removing all buttons, zippers, liners, etc. All are welcome! This is a great, low-key, low-commitment way to volunteer for a little while and meet some of the other people in the group, while doing something concrete to save animal lives.
Thank you to Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation, Inc. in Texas for sharing this adorable photo of a bobcat kitten snuggled up in Cuddle Coats donated furs!
Join us for a full weekend of protest, starting on Fur Free Friday (11/27) from 9:30-11:30 a.m. at Ribnick Fur & Leather, 224 N 1st St. in Minneapolis. Then continue at the Target Center, 600 1st Ave. N in Minneapolis to protest the Zuhrah Shrine Circus with the first protest at 12:45 to 1:30 p.m.
Thanks to many generous donors, including many of you who also volunteer your time, and to everyone who shared or liked our posts, we came in well over last year for funds raised on Give to the Max Day to continue our work to help animals! This included contributions from nearly 40 brand new donors who committed to helping animals!
It’s moments like this when so many members of the community come together to take action that prove our power to incite change.
For 24 hours on Thursday, November 12, Minnesota-based non-profits will celebrate the work we do to make the world a better place by asking our supporters to donate to causes dear to their hearts.
Most of our lives are pretty comfortable compared to a duck on a foie gras farm, an elephant in a circus, a male baby chick tossed out like garbage, or a homeless cat digging in the trash for food. Donating to ARC provides the support to ensure we can advocate for these animals in need. Please donate now – even a small amount makes a big difference. This is definitely the time to hop on the bandwagon and join in the fun of giving!

becomes â€œpermittedâ€ to the other, and they begin the long journey of life in a spirit of love, cooperation,
This is the strongest of bonds, in which Allah (subhaanahu wa â€˜taâ€™aalaa) unites the two Muslim partners, who come together on the basis of love, understanding, co-operation and mutual advice, and establish a Muslim family in which children will live and grow up, and they will develop the good character and behavior taught by Islam. The Muslim family is the strongest component of a Muslim society when its members are productive and constructive, helping and encouraging one another to be good and righteous, and competing with one another in good works.
The righteous woman is the pillar, cornerstone and foundation of the Muslim family. She is seen as the greatest joy in a manâ€™s life, as the Prophet said:
â€œThis world is just temporary conveniences, and the best comfort in this world is a righteous woman.â€1 A righteous woman is the greatest blessing that Allah (subhaanahu wa â€˜taâ€™aalaa) can give to a man, for with her he can find comfort and rest after the exhausting struggle of earning a living.
Do you dream of having a great marriage? Itâ€™s a good dream to have. A great, forever marriage is a wonderful thing to be part of, and can enrich your life. The question is, though, how do you turn your dream into reality?
This book was written to help you bring your dream closer. In it weâ€™ve condensed everything weâ€™ve learned from our 25 years of marital research and experience into a 12-hour program that will help you develop and protect a loving relationship. Whether you are happily married and want to stay that way, having issues youâ€™d like help with, or planning to marry and want to know how to preserve all the great things about your relationship, the information in this book can help you make it happen.
Just 12 hours to a great marriage? We understand if youâ€™re a little skeptical. We want to say right up front that itâ€™s going to take more than 12 hours to develop a happy, deeply satisfying, loving, lasting marriage. In fact, you and your partner are going to have to commit to a lifetime of teamwork to have the relationship you really want. But the approximately 12 hours it takes to read this book and do the exercises can put you well on your way to making your dream come true.
If youâ€™re like most people, though, it might be hard for you to find even 12 hours to devote to this program. Life just keeps getting busier and busier. But if you want to celebrate your 50th wedding anniversary some day, carving out 12 hours now to help you make sure those 50 years are good ones doesnâ€™t seem like too much to ask.
Since the end of the cold war the United States is the single dominant naval power in the world. The emphasis of the last decade has been to reduce cost while maintaining this status.
As the Navyâ€™s infrastructure decreases, so too does its ability to be an active participant in all aspects of ship operations and design. One way that the navy has achieved large savings is by using the Military Sealift Command to manage day to day operations of the Navyâ€™s auxiliary and underway replenishment ships. While these ships are an active part of the Navyâ€™s fighting force, they infrequently are put into harmâ€™s way. The natural progression in the design of these ships is to have them fully classified under current American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) rules, as they closely resemble commercial ships. The first new design to be fully classed under ABS is the T-AKE. The Navy and ABS consider the T-AKE program a trial to determine if a partnership between the two organizations can extend into the classification of all new naval ships. A major difficulty in this venture is how to translate the knowledge base which led to the development of current military specifications into rules that ABS can use for future ships.
The specific task required by the Navy in this project is to predict the inherent availability of the new T-AKE class ship. To accomplish this task, the reliability of T-AKE equipment and machinery must be known. Under normal conditions reliability data would be obtained from past ships with similar mission, equipment and machinery. Due to the unique nature of the T-AKE acquisition, this is not possible. Because of the use of commercial off the shelf (COTS) equipment and machinery, military equipment and machinery reliability data can not be used directly to predict T-AKE availability. This problem is compounded by the fact that existing COTS equipment and machinery reliability data developed in commercial applications may not be applicable to a military application. A method for deriving reliability data for commercial equipment and machinery adapted or used in military applications is required.
Architecture is a structured relationship of physical elements in which use, experience and memory are integral to its sense of shelter. Beginning with the drawn and built conceptions of the House at Yellow Sulfur Springs, structural fragments of the project included cast concrete studies, a desired relationship between surface, physical structure and light, an indirect path of entry and pre-existing qualities of the site. These fragments coalesced as a house with varying degrees of enclosure, a structure defined by material distinctions and assembly details, and a sensual path between inside and outside.
This PDF Ebooks is an attempt to address the phenomenon of the sun in architecture. Particular use is made of the notions of warmth, light, shadow and energy as form generators. Of specific concern is how one structure can work in harmony within its environment and existing constraints.
An analysis of an existing building is performed, with an eye to its strengths and weaknesses as a residence. It is an interesting challenge for an architect to take an undistinguished building - one designed for a bygone age of surplus energy - to identify those substantive elements to be retained and reused, those which are to be eliminated or substantially altered, and then harmonize them, in conjunction with a new plan, in order to create a warm, energy efficient, aesthetically appealing, and ultimately livable family residence. The possibilities concerning the highest and best changes to be made to improve the use of an existing structure are first identified.
The literature on Ãžnancial stability often argues that increased competition causes riskier banking behavior and deteriorates bank assets, and therefore, financial liberalization is a source of Ãžnancial instability. Examples are Chan et al. (1986), Riordan (1993), Gehrig (1998), Schnitzer (1999), DellÂ’Ariccia (2000), and Hellmann et al. (2000). Despite such a consensus, the empirical findings regarding the effects of increased competition on risk are mixed.On the one hand, there is evidence of a link between financial crises and Ãžnancial liberalization1. On the other hand, among the European emerging economies, it seems that those banking sectors with better performances are those that greatly reduced their entry restrictions. Lifting intrastate restrictions of the US banking sector also contributed to the substantial improvement in loan quality, according to Jayaratne and Strahan (1996). This raises the issue whether the current consensus regarding the relationship of banking competition and risk taking is justified.
This issue is directly related to the on-going effort of building sound banking systems. In the past two decades, many Ãžnancial markets have resorted to Ãžnancial liberalization in order to foster Ãžnancial deepening. In the mean-time, the frequency and degree of severeness of Ãžnancial crises have increased. The question is whether there are inherent trade-offs between efficiency, indicated by lower loan rates, and safty of the Ãžnancial system, and between Ãžnancial deepening and stability. If there are such trade-offs, is increased competition a source, as has been widely accepted?
Today, tea sets are made from porcelain, glass, or pottery. The highest quality of tea set is from the porcelain capital JinDeZheng in Jiangxi Province and the pottery capital Yi Xing in Jiangsu Province, which are both in the southern region of China. A Yi Xing tea set can keep the scent and flavor of the tea. Since a pottery tea set is the natural clay color, it is not suitable for watching the change of the tea leaves and the color of the tea. The designs of porcelain tea sets show attention not only to styles, but also to the art of calligraphy and painting on the tea sets. The color of porcelain teacups is white and the size is large enough for brewing tea so that one can enjoy watching the change in tea leaves in the teacups and the color of tea (China Tea Association & China Tea Trade Company, 1990). The choice of tea sets is important, especially for traditional Chinese tea ceremonies.
