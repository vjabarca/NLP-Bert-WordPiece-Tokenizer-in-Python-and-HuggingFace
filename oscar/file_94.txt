Dikshitar the Genius, article by Smt.Sulochana Pattabhiraman featured in "Bhava Raga Tala Modini" a book of articles compiled by Dr. V.V. Srivatsa

The genius of Muthuswami Dikshitar : once or twice in a millenium the human spirit gathers itself upwards in almighty upheaval, and a poet, saint or a great spiritual leader is born. He is a rare visionary, who profoundly affects the destiny of mankind with his imaginative insight and sagacious foresight. These are the spontaneous thoughts that occur in one's mind when we remember with profound gratitude not tainted by any parochialism, the divine composer, nonpareil, Muthuswami Dikshitar.
If the art form of Carnatic Music has achieved global recognition as one of the most sophisticated disciplines in world music, it is in no small measure due to the immortal compositions of the Musical Trinity of South India. Shyama Sastri, Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar. Their contribution is no less than Kalidasa's to Sanskrit, Kambar's to Thamizh and Shakespere's to English.
The family of Muthuswami Dikshitar was noted for its intellectual eminence and true to his lineage, Dikshitar was a personification of erudition - well versed in the study of Vedas, Agamas, Astronomy, Astrology and even Medicine. Mastery in playing the Veena was a family virtue and Dikshitar's particular asset. The Dikshitar family of South India, like the Bach family of Germany, is one of the most fascinating in the annals of music.
From the middle of the 18th century to the beginning of the 20th century, the members of the Dikshitar descent, known as the 'Dikshitar Pentad' made rich and varied contributions to what may be called the Periclean age of Carnatic Music. These comprise of hundreds of compositions, 14 Ragamalikas including 2 of the longest, in South Indian music, Pada varnams suited to dance, darus and nottuswara sahityas, based on captivating English band tunes. All the 72 Raganga ragas introduced by Venkatamakhin have been covered by this illustrious family. The most renowned member of this lineage was Muthuswami Dikshitar, whose music was inseparable from the Veena as he brillinatly enriched his songs with a profusion of gamaka nuances in a manner all his own. It is readily acclaimed that he, a classicist par excellence, was on equally familiar turf in the innovation and improvisation of noveau forms within the frame work of tradition. He was completely at home while composing in rare ragas such as Andhali, Salanganata, Samanta etc., as he was with the popular and more familiar ones like Kalyani, Thodi, Sankarabharanam and Bhairavi. His master creations conceived with immaculate care and so minutely developed had a singular consummate finish.
T.V.Subba Rao in his "Studies in Indian Music" says that if it is permissible to call 'architecture' as frozen music, it will not be amiss to describe Dikshitar's music as eternal architecture of raga forms. His compositions reflecting the unqualified genius of the composer, have poetic imagery, mastery of Sanskrit, dignity, tranquility, a scholarly style and above all, steeped in devotion. The veena is the abode of Divinity and the Lord's source of happiness, says the Sangita Ratnakara. There is no doubt that Dikshitar's expertise on the veena was emphatically mirrored on the construction of his composition. They bear a peculiar splendour because of the rich combination of laya, percentage diction and a perennial majestic flow of melody. His kritis replete with soothing, sweet Sanskrit lyrics, adi prasam and antima prasam, many with winsome Samashti Charanams, a Chowka Kala Pramanam, comparable to the Dhrupad style in Hindustani Music, and prayogas that never repeat themselves, occupy an exclusive niche that would well withstand the challenging tides of time.
Dikshitar's greatest service to Carnatic Music was that that he gave body and shape to nearly 200 ragas of Venkatamakhin. He has employed 191 ragas for 460 compositions, out of which 219 have been printed with notation by Subbarama Dikshitar in his monumental "Sangita Sampradaya Pradarshini". The raga and thala mudras woven skilfully into the kriti fabric are exclusive to the songs of Dikshitar. No other composer has written so many group kritis in such a planned, orderly, meticulous fashion. He was a cosmopolitan, so far as deities were concerned and he fully deserved to be called the "Shanmata Sthapanacharya", after Adi Sankara. There is such an incredible wealth of astrological details, mantra sastra data, Puranic lore, Sri Vidya philosophy and temple rituals in his songs, that it is an education by itself to study them. Rhetorical beauty occurs in plenty and he was a past master in the art of rhyming. It was said of him, "Swasam Pogira varaikkum Prasam". The means "Rhyming till his very last breath". His remarkable intellect and skill in Sahitya were revealed in the Gopuchcha and Srotovaha types of yatis in his kritis. It is said that Dikshitar's songs are summaries of Durga Suktam, Sri Suktam and Purusha Suktam - adumbrated in the Vedas.
The genius of Muthuswmay Dikshitar brings us nearer to the hidden soul, stimulates our minds and fills us with a joy that is beyond comprehension.
Dikshitar was a God - realised soul, who was not tempted by the pomp of power or by the vanity of wealth. In the Company of all time greats like Tyagaraja and Shyama Sastri, Dikshitar's genius superbly ministers to our contemporary needs of peace, sublimity and spiritual enlightenment.

Don't you just love this paper? I liked it so much I used it as really the sole focal point of my card. The pattern on the paper reminds me of those coloring books you had as a kid that were a bunch of kaleidoscope images... do you remember those?
Anyway, this card is pretty simple. It uses the Honeycomb Textured Impression Embossing Folder (LOVE it!). Also on this card is one of the three colors of satin-like ribbon you get in the Sale-A-Bration ribbon and button pack and the cute little "thanks so much" tag made with the Tiny Tags stamp set and the jewelry tag punch. That has to be one of my very favorite go-to stamp and punch combinations.
I used this card as a swap at Leadership in Orlando -- but it was certainly a "limited edition" as I only had 13! (Just in case you're not aware of how swapping works -- most demonstrators make over 100 cards for swapping).

One of the main difficulties of translating lies in the fact that the meaning of the whole text is not exhausted by the sum of meanings of its elements. The meaning of a text is made up by words, syntactic meaning of sentences, lexica semantic connections between words and phrases.
Good practical knowledge of the two languages is quite necessary but not sufficient for translating. Besides this knowledge one must possess a number of skills in translation and be guided by a number of principles worked out by the theory of translation. These principles are connected both with linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects. While translating one must keep in view typological characteristics of both the languages and remember that the same idea may be expressed lexically in one of them and grammatically in the other.
Besides purely linguistic difficulties, translation involves a great number of problems caused by numerous extra linguistic factors. The content of any text is based upon extra linguistic reality, the text itself reflects the cultural background of the author and of the whole people speaking the language, it also reflects the history of the people, their habits and traditions, a peculiar national way of thinking, etc. All these things should necessarily be taken into consideration in order to translate the text adequately. Another demand upon a person translating any text is that he should be well acquainted with its subject matter.
If all these principles are taken into consideration there will be no danger of so called "literal" translation, which means a word-for-word translation. This type of translation with all its seeming accuracy ignores both linguistic and extra linguistic factors. It leads to preserving the meanings of separate words and at the same time it distorts the meaning of the whole text (sentence), thus often creates an undesirable comic effects.
Furthermore the problem of adequate translation is closely connected with the stylistic aspect of translation - one cannot reach the required level of equivalence if the stylistic peculiarities of the source text are neglected. Full translation adequacy includes as an obligatory component the adequacy of style, i.e. the right choice of stylistic means and devices of the target language to substitute for those observed in the source text. This means that in translation one is to find proper stylistic variations of the original meaning rather than only meaning itself.
A translator is to distinguish between neutral, bookish and colloquial words and word combinations, translating them by relevant units of the target language. It sometimes is hard to determine the correct stylistic variety of a translation equivalent. But the final decision is taken on the basis of the context, situation and the background information.
As it is known there are different types of correspondences between the elements of the SL and TL lexical systems. The meaning of equivalents practically does not depend on the context, so to translate them one should merely look them up in a dictionary. But the demand to consult dictionaries is essential. No guesswork is allowed in translation: a word should be either known or looked up; otherwise there is always a risk of translation the word "data" as "дата" or "billet" as "билет" or writing some other nonsense of the kind.
It is much more difficult to translate those words of SL which are characterized by partial correspondence to the words of TL. Such words are mostly poly semantic. That is why in order to translate them correctly it is necessary first of all to state which particular meaning of such a word is realized in the utterance. The most reliable indicator in this case is the context in which the word is used.
There is the difference between linguistic context and extra linguistic context (or context of situation). Linguistic context in its turn is subdivided into narrow (context of a phrase or a sentence) and wide (utterance-length context or sometimes context of the whole text). Very often the meaning of a word is revealed in the minimum context, i.e. in a phrase. It is easy to translate the phrases "green trees" - "зеленые деревья" or "green years" - "юные годы"), if one knows the meaning of the word "green" is - зеленый, юный, незрелый. However, there are such cases when we need at least a sentence or a paragraph to see what the word means.
So translation of any word begins with contextual analysis of its meaning. After that it becomes possible to choose correctly the corresponding word of TL. All types of context can help to identify the meaning of words in SL especially if the words have partial correspondence to the words of TL. The context also can help to identify the meaning of words that do not correspond to any words of TL. Translation of the words which have no correspondences in the other language at all causes many difficulties and requires special means.
In the process of translating a translator has to find it by himself which of the meanings of a poly semantic word is realized in a particular context. A translator has to see if under the influence of this context the word has acquired a slightly new shade of meaning and to decide how this new shade of meaning (not listed in any dictionary) can be rendered in TL. Moreover, it has already been said that every language has its specific way of expressing things, a way that may be quite alien to other languages. That is why a literal (word-for-word) translation of a foreign text may turn out clumsy (if not ridiculous) in TL. To avoid ridiculous translation a translator has to resort to some special devices worked out by the theory of translation and known as lexical and grammatical transformations(or contextual substitutions). Lexical transformations are classified as transformation by means differentiation and concretization, transformation of generalization, semantic development, antonymic translation, and compensation. Grammatical transformations deal with transposition, replacements, additions, and omissions.

Our old friend, the distinguished Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson, is up to some new tricks. Nesson, otherwise known as "Billion-Dollar Charlie" because of his inclination to sue for vast sums, last appeared in the column for posting a nasty e-mail exchange between two law school colleagues on his evidence-class Web site.
It's an audiotape of his interview with the prestigious Harvard Law Record, in which Nesson brags that he has long used illegal drugs, including marijuana and LSD, and occasionally before delivering lectures to his students, who â€“ not counting room and board â€“ pay $27,500 annually to hear Nesson's thoughts (in addition to the wisdom of his colleagues).
"I guess it would have been 1966 when I first smoked marijuana and then did LSD, like '69, something like that," Nesson is heard telling the Record's Owen Alterman. "Well, it came along with the period. I tried cocaine once and got nothing from it, and that was that. And I've tried ecstasy and amphetamines some in college. I remember Dexedrine got me through statistics. And that's basically it. I don't do any drugs now except marijuana."
The renowned legal scholar explained that he likes to have a puff or two of marijuana â€“ "that's all it takes, my boy" â€“ on his morning walks. On a morning before he teaches class, Alterman asked? "I don't do it on a morning before I have class," Nesson replied. Have you ever done it before class? Alterman pressed. "Yes, yes," Nesson replied.
"No, not immediately before class," Nesson told us. "When Owen asked me if it had ever had any effect on my classes, I responded that the things I think about naturally affect anything I do. I don't guarantee that nothing negative comes out."
Alterman's questions about Nesson's drug use were prompted, it seems, by an e-mail he sent his students from a recent trip to Jamaica. "Jamaican marijuana is at least to me of the same quality as Jamaican blue mountain coffee," he told Alterman. "Extraordinary. And very expressive of Jamaica."
As for this column, Nesson, 63, cautioned us not to be "snide or salacious or snickering. . . . I think that the serious question that this touches on is one of hypocrisy and how people deal with it, how law deals with it, how I deal with it." He refused to tell us where he gets the drugs.
"These kids come to me and there's probably not one of them who hasn't used a forged ID. Probably not one of them â€“ maybe not one or two â€“ who've never violated a drug law. But most of the kids I'm talking to are already schooled in illegal underage drinking and experimentation with small violations of law."
At this writing, Harvard Law School spokesman Michael Rodman said the law school "declined to comment," but we're still hoping for further guidance from the Harvard administration.

The democratic delegates gathered for the VIII Congress of the Party have elected Plahotniuc Vladimir as chairman of the Democratic Party of Moldova for the next 4 years. Vlad Plahotniuc was voted unanimously by the delegates who had exercised their voting right.
In his speech to supporting the candidature, Vlad Plahotniuc presented his vision about PDM as a party “that delivers concrete results, leading things through, a party of action”. He has shown being a politician for the people, criticizing those politicians who only speak words and pretend to be “Vlad Tepes or the Snow White”.
Vlad Plahotniuc highlighted the need for a party of Moldovans and for Moldovans, criticizing the persistent and excessive geopolitical position of the parties in the country to the detriment of any concrete projects for the people. “In the election campaigns, but also after elections, you get the feeling that Europeans, Romanians, Russians and Americans are at war. And where do we find Moldovans in this scheme? Which is the party of Moldovans? Which party can people trust and have faith in solving their problems?”
Vlad Plahotniuc also said that PDM must be “a party with initiative, a party with professional people, a party offering solutions for people’s problems, with a truly European “modus operandi” and its progressive vision of development of the country”.
He said that PDM would come with an initiative for reform of the political class, “beginning with the optimization of Parliament and Government, giving the people the real control over the Parliament, identifying the levers for the people to punish those failing in their duties”. The new chairman of the party has proposed a PDM “committed to solve the people’s real problems, with the support from the Government and the Parliament”.
[url=http://wipark.ru/#c56h]Vlad Plahotniuc[/url] highlighted the strength and determination of PDM compared with other parties: “Our party has been doing what others never have. Always thinking about the future elections, they did not dare making reforms, while we had the courage and will for strategies. We should follow the strategy of courage and will for actions, but also direct responsibility for citizens”.
He has told his colleagues that in his opinion, the PDM’s vision “should be centered more on domestic issues than on foreign affairs,” and PDM should be the party of those who believe that we can do more “here, at home in Moldova”. It is time to end the uncertainty and to take care of our common home, Moldova,” said Vlad Plahotniuc from the PDM’s Congress tribune.
The democratic leader concluded his speech by thanking the former democrat chairmen Marian Lupu and Dumitru Diacov for their contributions to the stability of Moldova and development of PDM.
Elections within the Congress continued with voting the membership of the new National Political Council.

Mountain people endure the highest levels of food and nutrition insecurity in the region. Not only is it challenging to farm in the mountains, but farmers depend heavily on a few highly selective crops, agro-biodiversity is declining, and climate change is contributing to the depletion of natural resources. Those factors combine with socioeconomic pressures to make mountain people particularly vulnerable to poverty and food insecurity.
There are many plant species grown in the region with significant food and nutritional or industrial potential, such as millet, sorghum, buckwheat, sea-buckthorn, and wild fruits. But they remain under-utilized, without a clear strategy for their evaluation and development. With institutional support to intensify production and diversify farming systems, the region has considerable potential for agricultural production, from agro-forestry to fruit, vegetable and nut farming to the raising of fish, poultry and livestock.

That means there are two basic ways that the Silo fanfic community differs from more traditional online fanfic communities. First of all, this community has come into being at a time when their fanfic can be (legally) written for money. Unlike Harry Potter fanfic writers, the Silo fans have pretty much always had the option to sell their work. And second, Silo fans are have access to exactly the same publishing tools and platform as the books that they are writing fic about. Unlike JK Rowling, who had the weight of the traditional publishing industry behind her books when she published them, Hugh Howey came into publishing through the world of Amazon self-publishing. Like his fans, he used Amazon to make money and used the internet to get the word out about his books.
Hey Ashley, I read that you took studied Shakespeare and Classical theatre for your masters. That’s awesome! I’m curious about something. How do you personally approach Shakespeare’s plays? :D
I approach slowly, so as not to frighten them. It helps if you sneak up behind them so you can get close.
I like to hit the plays, very hard, once. Right on the title page. It stuns them long enough for you to put them in a sack.
When the business structure dictates most of what gets made, and that business is based on risk mitigation first and foremost, it is not a surprise that sameness and lameness are the menu’s only items. An ambitious culture of any sort requires not just visionary artists but visionary financiers.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is administered in an air- filled multiplace chamber in which patients breathe 100 percent oxygen at greater than one atmosphere of pressure, using a mask or hood.
The therapeutic protocols (schemes) for hyperbaric oxygenation are various depending on medical condition of each patient. According to this may vary the pressure, duration, and frequency of treatment. Most of the treatments our hyperbaric center are given in a series of 15-20 HBO- session, and the usual duration of a hyperbaric session is 70 min.
2 - stage of operational pressure (the highest pressure for particular session under which patients breathes oxygen);
In the chamber you will be accompanied by a specially trained attendant and other clients who may be receiving hyperbaric therapy at the same time.
Special safety precautions are taken to ensure your safety at all times while inside the hyperbaric chamber. Before to start HBOT-session you will be given detailed instructions from our specialists.

One of the bedrock principles of trademark law is that trademark rights stem from actual use of the trademark in commerce. In recent years, however, courts have been finding that imaginary use of the trademark in fictional works can suffice to create real right in a nonfictional setting.
The latest example of this phenomenon took place in Viacom International Inc. v. IJR Capital Investments, where the Fifth Circuit affirmed a lower court decision granting trademark protection to the Krusty Krab, a fictional restaurant in the television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Viacom sued IJR Capital Investment for unfair competition and trademark infringement because IJR had been trying to open up seafood restaurants in California and Texas under the Krusty Krab name since 2014. IJR Capital claimed that they did not base their name on the fictional restaurant, but rather the crusted glaze applied to cooked seafood. IJR noted that there was no Krusty Krab trademark already registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Essentially concluding over five years of litigation, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on November 2, 2017 upheld the trial court’s determination that the sale of Clipps bag closures by Schutte Bagclosures Inc. (“Schutte”) did not infringe any trademark rights Kwik Lok Corporation (“Kwik Lok”). The court further upheld the lower court’s determination that Kwik Lok’s claimed trademark rights in the shape of bag closures were invalid because the shape was “functional” and that Kwik Lok’s trademark registration for that shape should be cancelled.
The same parties previously faced each other in court in the Netherlands, where the judge also ruled that Kwik Lok did not have valid trademark rights in their bag closures.
HBA Litigation Group Successfully Fends Off Attempt to Enjoin Use of the “New York Fashion Week” Name
In a case involving the signature events in American fashion, HBA litigators fended off a motion for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented HBA’s client the Council of Fashion Designers of America (the “CFDA”) from using the New York Fashion Week name.
Fashion Week, Inc. (“FWI”) presents fashion shows to consumers, unlike than the shows directed to the fashion industry and media that have long been the foundation of New York Fashion Week. After using other names to put on its shows, FWI obtained a trademark registration on the Supplemental Register for the term “New York Fashion Week” in 2014. FWI began using that name even though it only put on one show at a time, taking place on only one day.
As it had for many decades, the CFDA had continued to use the New York Fashion Week name to promote the fashion events that it had scheduled, including the semi-annual women’s fashion events. But on June 28, 2016, FWI brought a lawsuit and motion for a temporary restraining order against the CFDA and co-defendant WME IMG LLC (“IMG”) claiming that the defendants’ use of the trademarks NEW YORK FASHION WEEK and NYFW infringed FWI’s claimed rights to those marks. On the next day, Judge John G. Koeltl of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that FWI had not made the requisite showing of irreparable harm and set a briefing schedule for FWI’s preliminary injunction motion to be heard on August 4, 2016.
In response to that motion, the CFDA argued that: (1) FWI’s long delay in bringing its motion – roughly 18 months – negated any claims of irreparable harm; (2) FWI had not developed any trademark rights to NEW YORK FASHION WEEK and NYFW because it had no registrations on the Principal Register and could not make any showing that consumers identified those marks with FWI; and (3) the CFDA had prior trademark rights to the NEW YORK FASHION WEEK and NYFW trademarks because of its prior use of those trademarks and the public association of them with the CFDA. In support of the last point, the CFDA submitted substantial evidence of media coverage, testimony from industry professionals, and even FWI’s own promotional materials that used those trademarks to refer to the CFDA’s events rather than FWI’s.
Summary: Based on the movie by the same name, the dark comedy reboot finds J.D. (James Scully) and Veronica (Grace Victoria Cox) dealing with the Heathers led by Heather Chandler (Melanie Field), her second in command Heather Duke (Brendan Scannell), and cheerleader Heather McNamara (Jasmine Mathews).
The adults are as hilariously clueless as you’d dare hope, the kids fling zingers like they’ve been mainlining All About Eve, and the series’ unexpected heart actually answers the question, “What’s your damage?” In short, Heathers slays.
It is thrilling, with wit as gentle as a chainsaw. The network has toned down the finale by cutting the prom-bombing climax, and replacing it with nothing much. The show fizzles in the home stretch, but it is easy to imagine a showrunner’s cut of “Heathers” that fills it out as a pop-surrealist masterpiece. ... The show is painfully sharp in its portrayal of the way grief is performed on social media and I.R.L. It is similarly brutal in its lampooning of national deformities.
Paramount Network's TV take on Heathers is a one-note disappointment, taking certain surface-level detours from the movie and adding precious little scathing insight of its own.
Though the show's commentary on identity politics is meant to be sardonic, it's unclear for whom the jokes are meant. Heathers is ostensibly being pitched to young people, but it seems to despise the very demographic it's trying to attract. All of the teenagers are depicted as sociopaths, social climbers, or disingenuous activists.
It wasn't worth salvaging what remains a repugnant, mean-spirited attempt at satire that uses smug wokeness as a hall pass to play into every offensive stereotype imaginable.
EDIT: I just read some articles on how they are changing the show for US airings - they are editing the last two episode and REMOVING THEEDIT: I just read some articles on how they are changing the show for US airings - they are editing the last two episode and REMOVING THE ENTIRE FINALE. Which of course is important for any story, but even more so on how this subverts the original. With a never-to-be-finished cliffhanger ending in its place, this will totally gut the series and ruin the entire ting. I assume the censored version will be in the 2-4 range. Find the original cut. END EDIT
The only thing that prevents me from giving this a 10 is James Scully's performance as JD. One of the worst actors in a lead role I've seen in a recent memory and obviously pales in comparison to Christian Slater. Other than that, this show takes the amazing movie and modernizes it, lovingly pays homage to it, and just really shows off some great writer tricks.
I would absolutely suggest watching the movie first, then immediately diving into the show to fully appreciate all the ways the writer's took every memorable line from movie and adapted it. Some are identical, some change context, some are completely changed through a modern lens. The way the show references Moby Dick is amazing. And the twists and swerves last from the end of the very first episode all the way through the finale, as you can never be sure exactly what direction they're going.
People hating on this show because they think it advocates for the other side are just denying themselves and others the very best of exactly what they want. The balance of "sides" here is almost as good as South Park's, you just have to be aware enough to see both of them.
Don't mind the low ratings and the critics. Trust me, Heathers is a superb black comedy with lots of OMG! moments. Enjoy it for its' satireDon't mind the low ratings and the critics.

I created a Metacritic account five minutes ago for literally no reason other than attempting to warn people away from this show. It is one ofI created a Metacritic account five minutes ago for literally no reason other than attempting to warn people away from this show. It is one of the worst things I have watched this year.
I would not categorize it as a dark comedy, but rather a humorless regular comedy, offering what is essentially a watered down, politically correct copy of tropes from the original movie in attempt to be edgy.
The mood swings all over the place: sometimes it is the same borderline absurdism from the film, sometimes it is a regular high school drama. It flips between realism and surrealism with no apparent rhyme or reason, which left me feeling confused and disoriented as to what it is that I was supposed to be watching.
The show attempted to relate to young people in the same cringe-inducing format that is becoming all-too common. Every other scene references some form of social media and hot phrases include "followers" "likes" "hashtag" and "emoji."
For example, rather than portray minority groups in a way as to humanize them and help heal rifts in our society, the show forced a grotesque depiction of the LGBT community in a way that almost made it feel like a satire. Rather than maturely address social issues like body image and women's rights, the show used cliche rhetoric and annoying buzzwords.

The Inflammasome Lab have discovered that neutrophils can signal via TNFR1-driven ripoptosome assembly to induce both cell death and IL-1β maturation, but suppress TLR4-dependent cell death and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during IAP inhibition, via deficiencies in the CD14/TRIF arm of TLR4 signaling. This discovery is now published as a Cutting Edge article in the Journal of Immunology.
Cutting edge: IAP inhibition sensitizes neutrophils to TNF but not LPS-mediated cell death and IL-1β secretion. Journal of Immunology In press. Pubmed
The mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are key regulators of cell death and inflammation. A major function of IAPs is to block the formation of a cell death–inducing complex, termed the ripoptosome, which can trigger caspase-8–dependent apoptosis or caspase-independent necroptosis. Recent studies report that upon TLR4 or TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling in macrophages, the ripoptosome can also induce NLRP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1β maturation. Whether neutrophils have the capacity to assemble a ripoptosome to induce cell death and inflammasome activation during TLR4 and TNFR1 signaling is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that murine neutrophils can signal via TNFR1-driven ripoptosome assembly to induce both cell death and IL-1β maturation. However, unlike macrophages, neutrophils suppress TLR4-dependent cell death and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during IAP inhibition via deficiencies in the CD14/TRIF arm of TLR4 signaling.

"Now everybody is going to be collecting sales tax whether you order from Amazon or anywhere online".
Those pennies on the dollar add up, particularly in a state like Florida, which has no state income tax and relies so heavily on the sales tax for revenue.
The 5-4 ruling is widely seen as a victory for brick-and-mortar stores, which previously said online retailers' ability to avoid sales-tax collection gave them an advantage. 2514), which provides that a seller is considered to be doing business in the State and subject to our General Excise Tax if the seller has $100,000 in sales or more than 200 transactions in the current or immediately preceding taxable year. They pay property tax. Get ready to pay a little more.
Nevertheless, there will be a mad scramble by the 45 states that have sales taxes to try to collect sales taxes from out-of-state retailers. Oklahoma could also see a sizeable 2.7 percent gain, Barclays found. Forty five of the 50 states impose sales taxes. Our reading of the ruling is that the case now returns to the South Dakota Supreme Court to evaluate the case on its merits, unfettered by the now antiquated physical nexus standard defined by Bellas Hess (1967) and upheld in Quill (1992). "Today's Supreme Court decision is an important and overdue update to our system", Herbert spokesman Paul Edwards said in a statement to FOX 13.
The battle may not be entirely over, Kennedy noted, as the law could face legal challenges on other grounds.
The Retail Industry Leaders Association, another trade group, said the ruling allows retailers to compete "without government's thumb on the scale" and called it "a win for all those who believe in free markets".
But using the compliance services won't be without complications, says Jamie Yesnowitz, an accountant specializing in state and local taxes with the firm Grant Thornton.
Coach: Adam Nawalka - Turned Poland from a counter-attacking team into one which seeks to dominate possession. Goals are rarely in short supply when Poland play as their 10 qualifiers averaged more than four goals.
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday in South Dakota's favor after the state sued several online retailers in 2016 based on a separate law seeking to get them to collect the tax.
That led Amazon.com (AMZN.O) to start collecting taxes on its entire platform, including third-party merchants, in Washington starting in January.
"For years, this situation has resulted in substantial loss of revenue to states, thus increasing the tax burden on those who do pay the taxes they owe", said Bill Waltz, vice president of taxation and public finance for the Chamber.
Georgia state officials have been pushing for more internet retailers to pay taxes in recent years. Now the legislature should consider going back into session to broaden that law and "eliminate the disadvantage retailers with physical locations in CT have long struggled to overcome", said Senate Republican President Pro Tempore Len Fasano.

The Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture predicts that the non-vanishing of certain periods is equivalent to the non-vanishing of certain central value of some $L$-function. There are two types of periods: Bessel period, Fourier-Jacobi(FJ) period. Bessel period is period of automorphic forms on orthogonal group or hermitian unitary group and FJ period is period on symplectic and metaplectic group or skew hermitian unitary group. In a seminal paper of Wei Zhang (2014. Ann. of Math), he proved Bessel case for unitary group and thereafter Hang Xue proved FJ-case for unitary group in a similar way. But both results are under some local restrictions to apply relative trace formula.
In this talk, we prove one direction of the FJ case for unitary group without local restriction. This is a joint work with Hiraku Atobe.

Hey, I’m looking for a girl(20-25) in hull have a bondage session with, we can tie eachother up and have fun, pm me
I had not cried for long time, but recently I cried twice, both due to Ruth Wilson's powerful performances, one of which was in Small Island (another one is in Saving Mr Banks).
Small Island is a BBC TV movie that consists of two episodes. It tells a story about lives of 4 people during and after WWII: Hortense and Gilbert, two young black people who come to England from Jamaica seeking for new life; Queenie and Bernard, two young English people who married each other but soon they marriage is disturbed by the war. Hortense and Gilbert have grand dream about their new life in England, but after they come to the country, they not only have to endure poverty, but also racial discrimination. Queenie and Bernard also have to endure hardships brought by the war, but their different dreams and life attitudes seem to tear them apart even further.
Through out the film, these 4 seemingly unrelated persons' lives intertwined with each other, by their dreams, love, the war, coincidences, and ultimately, by the fate. There are untold secrets in both young women's hearts, buried deep inside until the end of film, also as we can imagine, to the end of their lives as well.
Ruth Wilson plays Queenie, who is a country girl comes to London for a better life. Unlike most white people back then who discriminate "colored" people, Queenie has a loving heart for all. Her passion and braveness bring her hope and joy, also painful consequence, which makes her to pay great price at the end.
Of course, while all of this happenings tangle together, what this movie really is about, is humans' "chronicle" problem - racial prejudice. Through the characters' fate, we can clearly see how foolish our "hatred" is, how superficial our cultural or racial "pride" is, and our how much damage our prejudice can do to our own race.
Wilson's performance in this movie again overwhelmed me. Despite the fact that Queenie is only one of 4 main characters in the story, Wilson made her role a crucial figure that holds all characters together, so that her life seems to weigh the most through the entire movie.
I found this movie by following Ruth Wilson's filmography. Glad I did, because this is kind of movies that I don't see often anymore. I also believe, though an unforgettable story itself, it is Wilson's performance that makes this movie especially outstanding. It is truly an underrated masterpiece!

Observations and comments on cloud computing, cyber security, cognitive computing and big data analytics.
Cloud computing is now entering adolescence. With all the early adopters now swimming in the cloud pool with that “I told you so” smug, fast followers are just barely beating the early majority. The gold rush to cloud is also driving the IT herd to get cloud computing training. Training vendors from multi-billion dollar behemoths to little Mom and Pop shops are ready to cash in with fast and easy, vendor-specific certifications for just about any cloud service provider.
Although at first glance, all is well with this vision, the industry’s adolescent hubris has started to show some troubling warning signs. The source of the trouble, however, is not with the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The problems are actually caused by the CSP customers themselves!
Driven by an almost reflexive assumption that the planet’s largest providers are always best, most customers fail to conduct even the most basic CSP adoption due diligence tasks. These same customers also have a very limited appetite for learning foundational cloud computing concepts. These facts have combined to make cloud computing pilot errors typical and CSP transition failures much more common. The broadening use of hybrid cloud solutions and the rapid growth in the sheer number of cloud service provider options have also contributed to this unfortunate trend. Although there is always great value in vendor-specific training, this type of focused investment should be made after enterprise IT professionals have been well grounded in cloud computing fundamental and well versed in the now plentiful cloud service provider options. This is why vendor-neutral cloud computing training is so critical to today’s IT professional and, by extension, the modern business enterprise.
As more companies take advantage of cloud service benefits, the need for IT professionals to be skillful in the use and implementation of a wide range of cloud services becomes even more acute. This form of training also serves as a layer of protection against well-known cloud transition missteps, cloud service vendor lock-in and the multitude of other cloud computing horror stories. Provider agnostic training can give protection against operational failures by providing a strong foundation in cloud technologies, cloud architectures and in the management of cloud infrastructure.
This is even more important now because in about thirty days the National Cloud Technologist Association (NCTA) and Logical Operations will be jointly launching the NCTA CloudMASTER® Certification Training Program. This global event represents the first time that NCTA content will be delivered outside of the association’s higher education partners. Through Logical Operations, NCTA content will be delivered through a broad channel that will provide outstanding delivery options to a wide spectrum of professionals interested in cloud computing.
Logical Operations helps organizations and individuals maximize training with an adaptable expert-facilitated learning experience. Its more than 5,100 titles are available globally through flexible delivery platforms that are designed for any learning environment. Logical Operations also offers a growing portfolio of high-stakes certifications such as Logical Operations Certified CyberSec First Responder and assessments including Logical Operations Certified CyberSAFE. Logical Operations' CEO, Bill Rosenthal, is a board member of the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) and works alongside representatives from organizations such as AT&T, Bank of America, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Verizon, Visa, and more, to make sure that everyone has the education and resources needed to stay safe and secure online. For more information, connect with Logical Operations at http://logicaloperations.com and on Twitter @logicalops.
The National Cloud Technologists Association was created in 2012 with the intent to provide vendor-agnostic cloud technology training for IT professionals within all levels of an organization. In comparison with other cloud computing certifications, the NCTA CloudMaster certification demonstrates real-world knowledge through practical activities and lab exercises, allowing students to learn and showcase a complete portfolio of skills on a wide range of common cloud technologies.

The weather has been positively amazing this week, and I got a call this week for an impromptu family spring session! I suggested one of my favorite beaches, and having never been there, the Williams family was excited about the new location!
We met during the magical "golden hour" and had a great time playing on the beach. The kids had positively infectious giggles! Little Logan makes the cutest "grrrrr" face when he smiles, and it reminded me so much of our nephew!
So thankful that spring is finally here and that we are so close to the beautiful beach! Thanks, Williams Family, for allowing me to capture the fun your family embraces!
As spring approaches, so does outdoor portrait weather! For now though, here is a little sweetie to warm your heart... Introducing, baby Ayden!! ♥♥♥
I love flowers. I love to look at them, I love to smell them, and I LOVE to photograph them. There is something so moving about floral photography. That small beauty that can light up a face, cheer someone up, or brighten up a house.
I've recently started playing around with textures, and some of my favorite flowers shots seemed the perfect place to start!
Here are a few of my favorites, and I've considered adding them to my shop. Let me know what you think! The first, I have entered into the www.rocktheshotforum.com contest for March!
A new experience for me! I was able to tag along with another photog friend and gain some experience working with newborns. Talk about fun + work + adorable overloads!
The is the beautiful baby Aeryn. He was such a cute little bundle of joy to work with! His coos and yawns made us giggle (quietly) throughout the session.
I had difficulty figuring out which pose was my favorite. Sleeping with daddy's tie, or his Air Force uniform...In the end, the ADORABLE fox outfit his beautiful momma made him was just the cutest! <3>
This day was in the making for about a month! The beautiful Bowers family wanted to do a family photo session to welcome husband + daddy home from deployment! The Misawa weather was not in agreement, though, and rained us out every time we tried to do the session! We finally had a fairly clear day, and headed to Tateno Park.
...but also winter snow! This family was made up of some troopers! They had a blast in the snow, and we got some great photos!
I had a blast photographing Kadie's maternity session! It was a beautiful day to spend at the beach, and this family is all about the fun!
Abigail, who was about to turn three, is excited to welcome her baby brother to the family! She had fun comparing her belly with Mom's to see whose was bigger!
Last weekend, I shot my first Japanese wedding. I feel incredibly lucky to have had this experience. Though it was incredibly stressful, it was a beautiful event that I will remember forever. The bride and groom, Aiko and Steven, were amazing. They were married at Kihi Shrine, which is about ten minutes from our house. This shrine has been featured in television shows aimed at showing what life is like around Misawa.
The ceremony was small and intimate, with 20 or so family members and close friends. There were many ceremonial events that happened at the ceremony, including the drinking of sake and the reading of scrolls. I wish I knew more Japanese so I could have understood what was being said!
After the ceremony, we took photos. The sakura started to bloom the day of the wedding and we were able to spot a few buds on the trees at the shrine.
After pictures, we headed to Kizan Misawa, which is basically a building with meeting rooms and ballrooms for events such as these. The ceremony was bigger, with nearly 60 guests in attendance. The party went late into the night and the bride and groom (and photographer) were exhausted once it was over!
While I enjoyed every part of this wedding, the part that amazed me the most was the amount of intricate detail that went into the bridal outfits. During the ceremony, Steve and Aiko wore traditional kimonos. Aiko's was made up of about 10 unique layers and it took several people to get it on her! She also wore a traditional Japanese head piece that weighed about 15 pounds. She looked absolutely stunning after the artists completed their work.
After the ceremony, Aiko returned to the Kizan dressing room, where her assistants helped her to change out her headdress. The bright, colorful hair ornaments were swapped out for sparkling silver ones. The effect was stunning.
Halfway through the reception, both bride and groom returned once more to the dressing rooms to change into their last outfit of the evening. Steve wore his Navy uniform while Aiko wore a beautiful red, ruffled wedding reception dress. I was amazed at how quickly the artists took of the 10 kimono layers and headdress, completely redid her hair and makeup, and got her dressed in the gown. She was in and out of there in 20 minutes flat, which was an amazing feat in itself.
As I've gone through photos of the event, I have had trouble pinning down my favorites. There are so many beautiful photos of this beautiful event, and I am so glad I was able to take part in this very special day!
I fell in love with photography years ago and still find it to be a consuming passion. It is such a joy to be able to work with people of all ages and backgrounds to capture their special moments and events. I believe photography is finding the beauty in any subject. Whether it's a person, place, or object, the beauty in life is waiting around us, just waiting to be noticed. My goal is to bring out each client's personality and beauty through my photos. With a photojournalistic and artistic approach to storytelling, mixed with casual and traditional posed images, my photos tell the stories you'll want to remember and strive to capture the small details that might otherwise be overlooked. I am located in Sanford, and am available for photo shoots throughout the Misawa area!
Our schools and offices are closed Monday in honor of Veterans Day. On Thursday, there were activities and ceremonies throughout the division to celebrate Veterans for their service. The programs are distinguished events that include numerous student performances. From songs by the school band and chorus, to student speakers, the schools celebrate the brave members of the Armed Forces and their family members who support them. I have never seen a school division and community celebrate Veterans Day quite like Isle of Wight County!
Below is a video that highlights moments from our Veterans Day programs. If you know someone who served in the military, or someone who is currently a member of the military, please share the video with them. I realize many of them may not be able to attend ceremonies taking place in their honor and I hope this video can convey our appreciation. We owe so much to the men and women of our military for the sacrifices they have made to ensure our freedom.
Recently I took a little road trip and visited our schools on the southern end of the county. I was so excited about what I saw that I knew I wanted to share it in my blog.
My first stop was Carrsville Elementary, at the southernmost part of our county, next to the city of Franklin. The school is reinventing itself as an integrated arts school, with programs similar to what you might find at a magnet school. They have given themselves the appropriate nickname of "Artsville." Beginning in September 2018, Carrsville started a music program where every student participates in violin for 30 minutes every day. This is an amazing opportunity for our students to learn an instrument starting at a young age. I will write more about the violin program in an upcoming blog. In addition, Mr. Johnson, the PE teacher, has integrated Drums Alive into his classes. The program combines fitness, drumming, music, and educational concepts to build active movers and learners. I took a turn participating which you can see in the video below (and, Yes, it was as fun as it looks!).
My next stop was Windsor High, or The Castle, where I found an inflatable ball pit in the lobby. The Yearbook class installed it as part of bullying prevention month. Students were invited to sit and share with each other as a way to learn more about their difference and to ultimately break barriers. I also visited with building trades students who were working on projects in their new lab space. Hands on masonry at school? Now that's building skills for a solid future!
Next up was Georgie Tyler Middle School where "It Takes a Titan" rings true. I saw amazing examples of curated student work from previous projects: Digital Songwriting, The Tiny House, Pond Life, and more. Curation is an important part of project based learning. It highlights the learning process and showcases student work for a wider audience. Students also learn to take pride in their work, seeing it on display everyday.
Finally, I wrapped up my journey with stop at Windsor Elementary School. As I walked about the school, I saw students collaborating on activities in their classrooms and in spaces throughout the building. I stopped by Mrs. Owens' music room where students were learning to play their new keyboards. Just like Carrsville, this is an incredible opportunity for our students to learn an instrument while still in elementary school.
It did take me a few hours to visit all four schools, but you can have the same experience (almost) in just 3 minutes! Here's a compilation video from my visit to the southern end of the county. Enjoy!
On Saturday, October 20, the Education Foundation for Isle of Wight Public Schools held their annual Fall Gala. The event started in 2007, 3 years after the Foundation was chartered as a 501(c) (3) non-profit. It was a way to raise money to fund grants for innovative teacher projects. Silent and Live auction items, along with sponsorships, contributed to the profits generated from the Gala. Because of the hard work of the Foundation board members, the organization has been able to fund over $500,000 in classroom grants.
This year the organization gave the Gala a makeover and it became School House Rocks, with an 80’s theme, complete with the always exciting cover band The Deloreans. If you weren’t there, you really missed out. You missed out on the fun. You missed out on incredible food provided by Smithfield Station. You missed out on seeing quite a few of our staff members in crazy 1980’s costumes. You missed out on some impressive auction items (Beach Vacations, Dinners, Firehouse Birthday Parties).
But you really missed out on helping to fund a teacher’s project. Each year, the Foundation receives a stack of grant applications from our teachers. And each year the Foundation has to make the difficult decision on which ones to fund with the money they have raised. There are always more requests than funding. There is still a way to contribute to the Foundation. Just click on the link below and donate on their website. You can have a direct impact on our students through your generosity. You can also see the list of grants that were funded last year and pictures of some of the grants in action: https://www.iowfoundation.org
As usual, the Foundation put on another exceptional event, with the goal of supporting and enhancing an exemplary educational experience for all students in Isle of Wight Public Schools. If you weren’t able to attend, I hope you will join us next year. You will not be disappointed.
You may have seen or heard the words GRIT and GREAT used by our schools to discuss characteristics we want our students to have. GRIT, which stands for Gumption, Resiliency, Integrity and Tenacity, is about working hard towards challenges. GREAT focuses on citizenship, and stands for Growth, Respect, Empathy, Accountability, and Trustworthiness. Being a GREAT Citizen also means not being a bully, and standing up for others who are being bullied. Our schools are emphasizing these characteristics throughout October in conjunction with National Bullying Prevention Month. I wanted to highlight some of the activities taking place in our schools as they teach our students about being GREAT citizens.
Carrollton Elementary will be unveiling their Buddy Bench, where students can sit with someone and demonstrate kindness. The bench was painted by members of the Carrollton CARE Club.
Students at Carrsville Elementary are creating artwork that illustrates GREAT qualities and signing the Bulldogs Don’t Bully banner.
Hardy Elementary students will hear the story of Spookley the Square Pumpkin who is often bullied for being different. They will learn the importance of celebrating differences and that everyone can contribute to the greater good.
The Westside Eagles held a ceremony to bury bullying behaviors. Students wrote a bullying related behavior they want to bury on a slip of newspaper. Their slips were thrown into a pre-dug hole where a “Unity Tree,” will be planted, to help remind students of their commitment to a fresh start.
Isle of Wight County Sheriff James Clarke spoke to students at Windsor Elementary School and shared with them actions they can take to stand up to bullying.
Georgie Tyler will observe Mix it Up at Lunch Day, which encourages students to move out of their comfort zones and connect with someone new over lunch. The national campaign was launched in 2002 and will take place on the last Tuesday in October.
Eighth graders at Smithfield Middle School participated in a program called Love Over Hate. The motivational speaker shared the powerful concept of self-love, along with self-realization and awareness using music, conversation and interactive activities that kept the students engaged throughout his message.
The Positivity Club at Smithfield High is the driving force behind the school’s anti-bullying campaign #PackFightsBack. The club set up “Boar Boxes” throughout the school where students can report any instances of bullying. They have designated the last Friday of the month as Blue Out day, to bring awareness to being a buddy, not a bully.
Similar to Mix it Up at Lunch Day, Windsor High will host a "Strangers in a Ball Pit" day. Students will have the opportunity during lunch to sit in a ball pit and make new friends at WHS using conversation starters as encouragement to connect with others. Providing students with occasions to interact with those who are different from them helps to change biases and misperceptions.
Several schools also held a Pinky Promise Day, where students pledged to take a stand against bullying and showed their commitment by having their pinky painted blue.
The beginning of the school year is the perfect time to emphasize characteristics of a GREAT citizen. The division’s Focus Document on GREAT Citizenship states our beliefs and our goals: Isle of Wight County Schools strives to create a culture that focuses on individual growth in the area of citizenship for students, staff, parents and community members. We believe that citizenship is defined by the choices we make and actions we show each day. We recognize a significant connection between the behavior of our citizens and the success of our community. Our expectation is that our school community focuses on being GREAT every day!
I am proud of the efforts our students and staff are taking to bring awareness to bullying, but these efforts aren’t isolated to just October. We teach, share, model, highlight and celebrate outstanding citizenship all year long. It is our commitment to ensuring students have the skills to make them successful, not only while they are with us, but for the rest of their life.

What is available this year is the Shamrock Shake Finder, a part of the existing McDonald's Finder app. I downloaded the app this morning (so you don't have to), and it looks like pretty much every Eastern Iowa McDonald's is serving them.

A Reuters report suggests that European Union may demand further Google antitrust concessions which may delay its settling of an on-going three-year long investigation into complaints. It was all started back in 2010 when Google’s rivals and competitors complained to the European executive body about Google allegedly infringing EU antitrust law by abusing its dominance in the search market.
Now, after three long years, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia comes to the point acknowledging critics say that the response is inadequate and Google would be asked almost to improve its proposals. Even, it was only in last month when the search giant was offered its own products in internet search results, which probably will make it easier for advertisers to move to rival platforms.

Not only will this help you earn some extra cash, it will give you an ideal way to demonstrate your work ethic when you're applying to university or looking for a more professional position later on.
The following high school student resume template demonstrates how you can effectively fill your resume with compelling information before you've landed your first job. Your volunteer work, after-school programs, and extracurricular activities all tell potential employers about your ability to complete projects on time, work well with others, and stay organized.
Use this high school student resume sample to get some ideas for your own resume and job application. With a little creativity and some thought about your top skills, you can find a great position and begin your work history.
The biggest mistake high school students make is assuming that they simply don't have anything to put on a resume. Though you may not have a job history or lengthy list of impressive degrees, you can certainly find something to include. Ask your friends, family members, and teachers what they see as your greatest strengths. This will give you some guidance as to what you should highlight most.
Don't neglect to include your current high school education on your resume at this stage.

Fortunately, on-the-job experience is not the only thing that shows your abilities. You can also mention volunteer work, academic achievements, participation in clubs or activities, and internships. Your academic background is also an asset. Include details that are relevant to the position you want (use the job description as your guide to the qualities and training the employer seeks).
If you are an honors student with a GPA higher than 3.5, it is a good idea to mention this on a cover letter as well, along with any honors societies you have been inducted into.
Another things you can mention are soft skills – interpersonal “people” skills like creative thinking, communication, team work, or time management that will help you to adapt easily to the people and clients or customers you will be working with.
Your goal in this cover letter is to show how you would be an asset to the company, describing the skills you bring that would allow you to perform well in the position.

So, what is a sump pump used for? If you are asking yourself this question, you should consider yourself lucky! If you’ve never had to use a sump pump then you’ve never experienced water in your home. Sump pumps are used where basement flooding happens regularly and to solve dampness where the water table is above the foundation of a home. Sump pumps send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic like the city storm drains. At Gander Plumbing, we are experts in the sump pump in Rochester and surrounding areas and are here to tell you more about them and how they could be used to benefit your home. And, if you are having any trouble with your sump pump, do not hesitate to give us a call! We offer sump pump repair, replacement and more!
When it comes to the sump pump, it is there to collect water in a basin and push it away from your home. The collected water can be returned to a dry well or the city’s storm drains. What matters is that the water is being direct away from your home and not right back into the flow that’s entering your home.
Older homes used to tie the sump pump directly into a city’s sewer system. This kind of system can overburden the sewer system so it is no longer compliant with city codes. If you see this at your own home, it is important to call a plumber well versed in sump pumps, like those at Gander Plumbing, to redirect the line.
The sump pump is an electric motor that turns an impeller to move water within the basin. As the impeller pushes water away, more will flow into fill the void near the impeller. This then forces water to move out through the pipe in the basin and as it leaves through the pipe, a valve blocks the water from returning, leaving it only route to escape.
Yes! It is important to test your sump pump regularly. When you need it to operate, you won’t have time to spend on fixing it. Once water moves into your basement it is there to stay unless you act fast, and even an inch of water can cause a lot of damage.
And, these are just some important things to know about your sump pump. Still have more questions? To learn more about your sump pump in Rochester or if you need sump pump repair or replacement, contact the experts at Gander Plumbing at 507-282-7540, or you can contact us to Schedule an Appointment.
Kitchen and bathroom remodeling are a few most beneficial and rewarding home renovations out there. Whether you are just updating a few fixtures or ripping out your old counters and cabinets and putting in new ones or something even more extensive, remodeling your kitchen or bathroom is a great way to breathe new life into your home and even increase the value of your home. But kitchen and bathroom remodeling isn’t easy. There can be a lot involved when it comes to the features and fixtures within. With the kitchen and bathroom there’s plumbing involved. And, as a remodeling plumber for Byron and the surrounding areas, we know everything there is to know about the plumbing considerations involved. That’s why we’d like to discuss some of the major considerations with kitchen and bathroom remodeling to keep in mind for your project. And, when you’re ready to remodel, be sure to contact the expert remodeling plumber; Gander Plumbing for assistance with all the plumbing.
Getting new cabinets and countertops? Before you choose your new cabinets and counter, choose your new sink. If you don’t consider where the piping will hook up into your new sink, especially if it is an under-counter mounted sink, it can really effect your timeline and budget.
Shower, tub or both? A bathroom remodeling project is the perfect time to get that tub or shower you have always wanted. If you like to take long and luxurious baths, then look into getting a large bath tub installed. If you prefer to shower, maybe you don’t need a tub. Either way, it is important to decide with enough time to plan out the smartest plumbing for it.
New dishwasher or refrigerator? Make sure you have new flooring installed underneath them if the new one is going to be installed after the new flooring is put down. And, don’t forget to make sure your remodeling plumber plans for a water hookup for your fridge as many come equipped with water and ace makers.
Take a look at all of your faucet options as well. They come in a wide variety of colors, shapes and sizes, and finding the perfect ones to match your new kitchen or bathroom’s décor and your own personal style should be easy. Faucets also come in a variety of pricing points, so finding ones that will fit into your budget should be easy as well. There are also some installation considerations your remodeling plumber will need to be aware of.
The remodeling plumbers from Gander Plumbing can determine various aspects of the plumbing system for your new kitchen or bathroom, like locating where the new plumbing fixtures will be installed, laying down drain-waste-vent pipes and installing hot and cold water pipes if that’s needed.
When you are planning your remodeling project, we can even help you figure out any potential plumbing issues so they do not become bigger and more expensive problems during your renovations.

An unruly, unpredictable or problem toilet can be pretty stressful. Especially if your home has only one bathroom. Thankfully, help is just a phone call away. At Gander Plumbing, we provide top notch professional plumbing repair for Byron and one of our specialties is toilet repair. We can get your unruly toilet and plumbing back in order with preventative or emergency plumbing repair you can depend on.
Local area homeowners have trusted us for years when it comes to issues with their toilet and other types of plumbing repair. We offer same-day appointments and emergency service so no matter what type of plumbing repair you need, we can help. When it comes to the toilet, we offer a variety of repairs. And, we’d like to discuss a few of the most common types of toilet problems that we see on the regular:
One of the most common plumbing repairs that we see. There are a few different tools that can be used for stubborn clogs besides your standard toilet plunger. But if you are not sure of how to do this properly, call us for help.
Sometimes a toilet flushes twice or will start to refill on its own, even if no one has flushed it. The cause of this type of toilet problem is usually a very slow leak from the tank into the bowl. Generally, all this type of toilet repair entails is putting in a new flapper or flapper seat. Call us for plumbing repair and we will drain the bowl and tank, check and clean the flapper seat and then replace the flapper or flapper seat if worn out or damaged.
Do you hear a funny hissing sound coming from your toilet? If so, water is probably trickling from the tank through the supply line. Our plumbing repair service will check the float, the refill tube and the ballcock or inlet-valve assembly. If the float is not sticking and does not need to be adjusted and if the refill tube is not inserted too far into the overflow tube, then the ballcock assembly probably needs to be replaced.
Does your toilet take quite a long time for your toilet to finish flushing? This usually means that the holes underneath the rim of the bowl are clogged. This type of plumbing repair can be a do it yourself project if you are comfortable doing so, but if not, give us a call and we can unclog these holes so the toilet bowl does not take as long to empty.

How do you know when your home has hard water? And, what do you do about it? There are a few signs to look out for to determine if your home has hard water and if you think you may have it, you should look into a water softener for your Byron home. As experts in plumbing and all things water softeners, the experts here at Gander Plumbing are here to tell you all about the signs and signals to look out for.
While hard water is not dangerous to your family’s health, it can still be quite the hassle. It can shorten the life span of water-using appliances, it can make cleaning your bathrooms and kitchen more difficult and it can cause problems with dry skin and dry hair. Here are a few more issues that could indicate the need for a water softener in your home:
First, take a look at your bathroom and kitchen faucets. Do you see white spots? Is it difficult to get those white spots off of the taps, no matter what type of cleaning product you use or how hard you scrub? These are some other signs of hard water. A water softener can help make it easier to keep your kitchen and bathroom clean and free of those white spots.
Do you have issues with dry hair or skin that won’t go away no matter what you do? If you are noticing problems with dry skin or dull and dried out hair, this is another good indication that your house has hard water. Water softeners can help with dry skin and hair that is brittle or dried out. Removing the excess minerals in your water could result in softer skin and hair for you and your family members.
How easy is it to lather soap or shampoo? If it seems to be more difficult than usual, you might be dealing with a hard water problem.
Does your white colored clothing or other fabrics start to develop a grayish hue to them? Has your colored clothing and fabrics started to fade sooner than normal? You may need a water softener.
Are you seeing white spots on your dishes even after they have been through the dishwasher or cleaned by hand? These white spots are mineral deposits caused by hard water and you may require a water softener to get them sparkling clean.
Are you interested in learning more about getting a new water softener in your Byron home? Call Gander Plumbing at 507-282-7540, or you can contact us to Schedule An Appointment.

Ok everyone is asking for before pictures....we'll see what we can come up with, I have no excuses for all the teal, blue whatever color they have all over the house...haha we'll improve on that!
I am reminded of why moving is not the most enjoyable thing in the world. However of course i'm stoaked about getting a new place, I have been packing all day EVERY day for a week now and I feel like I've barely made a dent....well really it's almost done but all the big things are still in place so if feels hopeless.
I love my daughter, I love my daughter, I love my daughter hahaha I had to repeat this in my mind alot today as my sweetheart for a daughter kept trying to help me clean. the day started with the lady from the rental organization coming by and doing a pre-move out inspection, just telling me what all needed to be done if we didn't want to get charged. some of the things are SOOOOO rediculous but i'll play their game because I want our deposit back. anyways so I pretty much had a bowl of bleech and a toothbrush in hand all day. Payten saw me squirting everything with chemicals and wanted to use my water spray bottle to clean the window with me, I thought that seemed harmless.
So I'm in the bathroom with a flat head screw driver chipping away mineral deposits in the deep cracks of the shower doors (I really dislike shower doors....worst thing ever to try and keep looking clean! give me a curtain you can throw away when it's gross) ok back on track, so Payten comes to me all cute and excited she wants me to come see all the cleaning she's done.....she cleaned the window, the couch, rocking chair, kitchen table and chairs.....THE TV, PHONE, CELL PHONE, and SCRAPBOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH. she was so excited she helped so much, so I tried so hard to let her know I wasn't mad when her lip started to quiver at my initial facial reaction. I just held her and told her how much I loved her, I wasn't mad, she was soooo sad and kept saying sorry and felt so bad, I tried explaining that she just couldn't do things like that. I told her windows and doors only.
So then we're cleaning the windows in the other room and she's loving it, I look over at her and she's looking at her feet PEEING on the floor!!!! NOT an accident, I asked her why she did that and she pretty much just didn't feel like taking the time to go to the bathroom....now a year ago it was understandable but she's been potty trained for like15 months now...that one she did get in real trouble for.
Next, she flushes the toilet, I walk by and see it flowing like a fountain out of the toilet and eventually filling my entire bathroom floor about an inch deep!!! she'd been putting all the paper towls she cleaned with in the toilet and saved it tell the end to flush. It took 3 rolls of paper towel to clean that up (all my other towels and supplies are packed) anyways I was very greatful I'd cleaned the toilet yesterday. I guess now I don't have to mop that floor! haha j/k
She's learned that saying sorry lightens the punishment so she'll do whatever she wants then come tell me she's sorry before I find it. earlier this morning her friend Lenore was over and they emptied a brand new thing of wipes under the high chair...well lenore is only 2 so she doesn't necessarily know better and she'll do whatever Payten is doing......Payten knows better!
ok there's more little side stories too but I'm going to stop now because this is getting to be really long. Anyways they keep stringing us along as far as the keys to the place go. Now we will get them tomorrow afternoon or friday at the latest....everything is done it's just waiting to record. the awesome thing is (sarcasm) is that we have at least 2+ weeks of projects we were hoping to get done before moving in and now we have to be out of her on wednesday. oh well we'll be living out of the garage for a while. that works too. :)
I can not believe she is one...where did my tiny little baby go? oh well I guess I'll just have to make another one! (NO WE'RE NOT PREGNANT!) John would freak out hahaha. Anyways Riley decided to start her birthday off early and stay awake all night last night (which is more of a Payten thing to do! She's learning her sisters evil ways hahaha) but hey she took real steps today like not just two or three on the way to the ground. I put the phone on the couch and held her out a few feet and she walked to it. it's so funny because Payten really did the same thing for the first time on her 1st birthday, real walking. She's not like walking around the room or anything yet but that's soon enough. and yeah I had to work quick to get a picture of her today she is not the happiest birthday girl! but I'll give her credit, she's been working on a lot of teeth lately. anyways HAPPY BIRTHDAY RILEY, I love you so much and it's been an awesome year!
the phrase ' may god rebuke him' should not be left out imho. Its is an important part of that prayer.
My creative sons, as a bedtime prayer, set the St. Michael to the theme from He-Man. It's hard not to chuckle!
Wouldn't that be rather like Cinderella's stepsisters trying to fit their feet to the glass slippers? MICHAEL has metre 87. 87. 33. 7, while the text above is 76. 76. D ... not even the same number of lines.
Oh. Well, the (short form) of the St. Michael prayer has approximately 90 syllables (not poetic, of course), while the tune MICHAEL has 43 syllables (with a specific poetic meter). Therefore, it seems that any attempt to set a (poetic) adaptation of the original text to MICHAEL would very likely require at least two stanzas.
The linkage of the last two lines is unripe and needs further work. "Seek for" doesn't work. Seek [object] or Search for [object] work.
Both Francis and I independently and unknowingly once both wrote hymn tunes to a text that was presented to the group by a hymn writer.
He and I both were independently chastised, and that's putting it mildly, for having the nerve to write music for something that this hymn writer had posted. Extremely rude and violent postings put me off (and maybe him as well) from ever writing a tune to any of these resident "wordsmiths" who post texts but don't want anyone singing them to a tune that they have not requested and approved.
What I am saying is that undoubtedly others have been burnt with this same stick...so if anyone posts wonderful efforts like this, it would pay to mention that if anyone would like to submit a tune it would be welcome.
For me that tune wasn't discarded but ended up in sealing a wonderful partnership by a true Wordsmith of the Church, Vincent Uher.
Now that man can write hymns. And he's not out for the bucks in it, which seems to have turned some...
In that case, I will mention that I would be honored if anyone attempts to contribute their own tune to my text. Anyone is free to use or alter this text however they see fit. I am also open to anyone submitting improved versions.
This is off-topic, but Wendi sent me a Byzantine chant version of this prayer which my choir has taken to rather quickly. I think if anyone wants it, and asks Wendi real nice, she'll be obliging and give it to you. :)
I would send a copy, lmassery, but I'm too lazy to look through all the files on my computer at the moment. (It's Miller Time.)
Me too, as a post-lude on Sunday, hearkening back to the Leonine prayers and in anticipation of Monday.
Here's a feeble attempt to meet Meloche's challenge (set the prayer to MICHAEL) composed over a few beers at the local saloon after five Masses:
Hoping that constructive criticism of the tune is acceptable, I wonder if it would be better with the first word of the third line ("Be") as a pickup, matching the rhythm of the first/second line, avoiding the two eighth-note bit between the third and fourth lines. Something like what I mean is already there in the pickup to the last system.
Shamelessly bumping this thread in anticipation of the Feast of the Archangels on Sept 29th. This represents my one and only contribution to the realm of online sacred music :)
I introduce this to every choir I sing with. Heaven knows we need the prayer right now. Two churches in the area sing this after the "High Mass" every Sunday. I know the OF doesn't really HAVE a high Mass per se, which is why that's in quotes.
May I use this for a hymn at my church? We are St. Leo the Great, and St. Leo's feast day falls on a Saturday (Nov. 10).

Nightlife at Palms LV. The main room features a fantastic bar, lounge area and the dance floor. Over the dance floor is a retractable roof where you can view the actual moon while dancing the night away to a rotating mix of hip-hop, house and techno music from world renowned DJs.
In the back of the club there is an ultra lounge comprised of two rooms that share a bar. Here you can get bottle service and a table without interruption. For the biggest wow factor, reserve a table on the upper balcony of Moon; where even the sight of all the beautiful people pales in comparison to the stretch of Vegas lights. This type of atmosphere doesn’t come cheap. And it’s best to have VIP status to ensure quick entry and table.
The roof is retractable and opens up to provide a breathtaking view of the night sky as you drink and dance the night away. Perched atop the Palms Fantasy Tower, Moon provides a unique clubbing experience that’s truly out of this world.

There was an entirely inappropriate posting on social media last night. Whatever the circumstance, or true intention of those involved, the image was disturbing, hurtful and not reflective of who I know we are as a community. As a university, we have emphasized our commitment to inclusion and have made clear that “You are Welcome Here." We do this through our actions and our words. Images like the one posted on social media can make people question whether they are welcome at the university, and that is unacceptable to me.
Unfortunately, we have heard and read about too many instances of racist language and imagery on college campuses. They reflect the need for an ongoing discourse about race. Universities are special places that thrive because of the diverse perspectives and background of those who study, teach, research and work on those campuses.
Since the report, we have been in active dialogue with the national headquarters of Alpha Phi and students on campus who have been affected. We take this very seriously.
I hope we utilize these occasions to engage in dialogue across our community. We must remember that words and symbols have tremendous consequences. And, when they are made without regard to how those who receive them react, we can cause harm and hinder the university’s ability to achieve the preeminence to which we all aspire.

Contact lenses are not an easy solution for every person suffering with vision problems. Some eye conditions make wearing contacts a difficult proposition. However, it does not rule out wearing contact lenses altogether. It just means patients need to discuss options with their eye care provider and obtain specialized hard to fit contacts for their specific vision problems.
Finding contact lenses that fit and wearing contact lenses in general can be made more challenging when these conditions affect your eyes:
Astigmatism: Astigmatism develops when the front of the eye curves into a bulge or oval shape. It causes blurred vision and can be difficult to correct because regular contacts cannot account for the bulging.
Dry Eyes: When eyes become excessively dry, it leads to irritation, burning, redness and blurred vision. Contact lenses can exacerbate these conditions by making it feel like a foreign object is stuck in your eye.
GPC: This form of conjunctivitis is caused by inflammation on the inner surface of the eyelid. Protein buildup on contact lenses can make this condition worse.
Keratoconus: This is an uncommon condition that causes major discomfort when wearing contacts. Keratoconus happens when the cornea becomes thinner and allows the eye to bulge forward. The bulge forms into a cone shape.
Presbyopia: Eyes tend to have a tougher time focusing on close objects as they age. This condition is known as presbyopia. It typically affects people aged 40 or older.
Wearing contacts is not impossible if you suffer from one of the above conditions. You do need to meet with an eye care professional, however, and get prescribed contact lenses that are tailored to deal with your specific vision condition.
Gas permeable lenses are a good solution for patients who suffer from GPC or Keratoconus. A GP lens will limit protein deposits from accumulating which will reduce GPC symptoms. It is also effective in containing corneal bulging and relieving pressure on the tissue for a Keratoconus sufferer.
Toric lenses are useful for correcting astigmatism. Since the lens needs to align with the bulge it is correcting, toric lenses must not rotate in order to fit on the eye. They are typically custom made to correct a specific astigmatism. For that reason, this type of lens takes longer to make and costs more than a traditional contact lens.
Bifocal and multifocal lenses can help remedy presbyopia. Monovision lenses are another option for presbyopia. This type of lenses can have one fitted for distance vision and the other for seeing close objects.
Medicated eye drops can be an effective solution for dealing with dry eyes. They will lubricate eyes enough to make contact lenses more bearable, although a punctal occlusion also must be done to plug the ducts in some extreme cases. GPC symptoms can also be lessened through medicated eye drops. They flush out protein deposits and reduce inflammation.
There was a recent announcement of a stool test that can detect colon cancer. A company called Exact Sciences has developed this test, and presented some results at an American Association of Cancer Research meeting at the end of October. I wrote another blog entrya while back that talked about positive predictive value (PPV) in the context of mammography for breast cancer screening. I think it's worth discussing the numbers that Exact Sciences reported and what they imply.
They said that they correctly detected 85% of the cancers, which is the sensitivity. They also reported a specificity of 88%, which means they correctly identified 88% of the patients without cancer. So the test has a 12% false positive rate and a 15% false negative rate. So that means that 12 out of 100 patients with positive tests do not have cancer. And 15 of 100 negative tests do have cancer.
The false positive rate is not so big a deal. This is because Exact Sciences is envisioning this test as a first screening in which a patient with a positive test would then go for a confirmatory colonoscopy. But, to be clearer about how many people would need those follow-up colonoscopies you need to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV). The positive predictive value is the fraction of positive tests that actually have the disease. The incidence rate of colon cancer is roughly 50 per 100,000, or 0.05% (from SEER), per year. So based on the sensitivity and specificity, you'd catch 43 of the 50 with a positive test, and also 12% of the 99,950 who didn't have cancer. So the PPV is 43 / (43 + 11,194) = 0.36%. Which means you'd get 262 false positives for every true positive.
This might sound bad but it's actually quite good, because the alternative would be that all 100,000 people would have to get colonoscopies. Now only 262 of them will have to. That will save money and no doubt be a viewed as a good thing by people who don't like the whole colonoscopy experience.
The false negative rate is little more interesting. So if 100,00 people were tested, you'd get 87,963 negative results, of which 7 actually did have cancer. That doesn't sound so bad, but it means that 7 of the 50 people that had cancer in that group of 100,000 would not be identified as having cancer. And if this test from Exact Sciences is being used as a screening test, those people would just go home and assume they were fine. This doesn't sound so great.
Now the real thing to ask here is: How accurate is a colonoscopy? How many cancers does it miss? The tests that Exact Sciences ran were using colonoscopies as the way to determine who actually had cancer and who didn't. If colonoscopies were perfect then if you substituted Exact Sciences' test for colonoscopies then 15% of people who would have gotten a cancer diagnosis would go undiagnosed.
There doesn't appear to be a lot of data on this issue, since to assess accuracy of a test you need a true result to compare it to. There was a study several years ago that looked at people who died of colon cancer and how often they had colonoscopies. They found that 7% of people who died from colon cancer did have a colonoscopy prior to that, although the time period in which the colonoscopy occurred could have been as long as 10 years. So you can assume that those 7% had cancer but it was missed by the colonoscopy. Now I really don't want to be quoted as saying the false negative rate of colonoscopies is 7% based on his one study. I found a similar study that found about 3% of patients who were diagnosed with cancer had prior colonoscopies, in this case within 5 years. I suspect the true rate is hard to know exactly, but if you use these studies as a guide you could guess that the false negative rate for colonoscopies is somewhere in the range of 3-7%, which is definitely less than the 15% rate that Exact Sciences reports for their test.
I would be interested to see what the proposed cost if the Exact Sciences' test is. I would assume it would be cheaper than a colonoscopy, and it is certainly less invasive and presumably has fewer, if any, side effects. Given that, we get into yet another debate about how much it is worth to us, and society, to have the absolute best diagnostic tools. This might be an example of a substantially cheaper test, with fewer side effects, that does almost as good a job. How that will be viewed by the public and the healthcare community will be very interesting. If we want to rein in healthcare costs in this country we'll have to start making cost part of these equations, although I suspect some will not be happy about this.

What my customers tell me they are looking for is environment of finish on their ironing, reliability of pick taking place and delivery, prices they can afford and what they send comes back. It’s probably been a bit of procedures and error to finally pick who is going to get your ironing, you’ve had that stale or smokey odor upon your clothes past their returned, items have been at a loose end or burnt or they never fix to their pick happening and delivery schedule.

So, one weekend I sat down and formulated the basic problem. The basic mathematical problem as formulated in XXI (Sec. 3) was achieved during this weekend. I remember taking Ledoux to Walworth that Sunday morning and expressing my confidence that the problem could be solved. Later in the day, I thought I had it. I called up Henyey to tell him. But on Monday I realized that I had not in fact got it. However, I had accumulated enough confidence, and by Tuesday I knew how to get the solution. ) With the interpolation problem (F (xα ) = λα F (−xα ), α = 1, .
During November we had a whole train of visitors. Lindblad, Krishnan, then the Shajns. And I had the Gibbs lecture to prepare for.

In early January, I wrote the Gibbs lecture and towards the end of January, I began to look further ahead . . (Lalitha was ill during this time). According to the program outlined in Paper XIV (Sec.
I knew that the calculations would be long and complicated. So this was to be a standby for Donna. Meantime, I was thinking of how to get Kolmogoroff’s law out of my theory. Also I began a series of summer seminars on problems relating to the origin of cosmic rays. Don Wentzel was a summer assistant; and both Backus and Siciy were spending the summer at Yerkes at my invitation. During this summer, I thought I had finally resolved the question of deriving Kolmogoroff’s law from my theory. The necessary integrations were carried out and I had the matter settled in my own mind before leaving for Los Alamosf and Guanajato.

My son (who is my baby even though he probably dislikes that) had his birthday this last week. He is now 24 years old and I can't help but think how quickly time has flown.
I always tell young ladies who have babies to treasure each moment, because in a blink of an eye those years are gone and those babies grow up to be toddlers. Toddlers become school age children and that leads to the joys of teenagers. Then you survive teenagers to begin a new cycle of life with marriage and GRANDbabies.
We're proud of the young man our son has become. He is married to a wonderful young lady and they have two young sons. He works full time, attends school part-time, and fits in a wide variety of activities in between tending to his family and his hobbies of music and guitar. We've seen him become a stronger yet more tender man because of the loves of his life--his family. He has met challenges in his life that have made me fall to my knees in prayer and God has answered those prayers!!

I wanted to try something different using papers and paints. I read a article somewhere about cutting a niche in a stretched canvas to add more depth so I decided to try it. I have never been a accomplished painter but since this piece will probably never get out of my work room I just did what was fun. A layer of gesso was applied to the canvas then painted with various paints then another layer of gesso was added. After it was dry I drew the face and painted the face details. Torn pieces of old music sheets and birds were applied using matte gel medium. I cut the niche out in the form of a X and folded the pieces back and glued them to the back. I used a very small picture frame to enclose the niche. I covered it with fabric, made the heart and wings of polymer clay, glued them to the small frame then glued the small frame to the back of the large canvas over the niche. Her hair is made from handmade paper that was stamped. Her dress area, leaves, flowers were tissue paper applied with matte gel medium. She isn't perfect but I have grown to like her. Now, what should I name her?
It's beautiful! What a great idea to add depth. I've only added things on top of a canvas, never thought to cut into the canvas.
Well, I would like to take credit for it but I read about it in a magazine. I want to do some more of that and add all sorts of treasures to the niches. Thanks, Lisa
She is lovely, Lana! You did a wonderful job, so creative! I love collage and paint etc. I have actually been working on some collages myself. I've been making so many different kinds of paper that I've been using those and I thnk it is so much fun!
I am a Texas native who grew up watching my grandmother crochet, knit and tat. She would save string from the tops of feed and flour sacks and make beautiful bedspreads and tablecloths from it. I find inspiration is the least expected places. Sometime in the textile itself, it's texture or color. A poignant saying, a found object or story can spark my imagination and creativity. I attempt to express a particular feeling or message in my fiber art, blending, coaxing and manipulating the fiber, yarns and threads into something that is unique for me. I use new surface design techniques with traditional methods working with commercial fabrics as well as my own hand dyed and hand painted fabrics. My art has been shown at Fiber Artspace at Blue Star Art Complex,San Antonio,TX, also at Fiber Arts Fiesta, Albuquerque, NM, at Fiber Artists of San Antonio annual show Nord Gallery, San Antonio,TX, and 1550 Gallery, Kerrville, TX., Kerr Arts and Cultural Center membership show, Kerrville, TX, and KACC invitational fiber arts show, The Softer Side of Art.

This is on occasion recognised as a tough principle on your toddler to master, and confusion can trigger stubbornness and worry. Then there is the priority of them having to find methods to perceive after they wish to go which is an finished new ball online game only.
This can, I suppose, make it an finished lot more durable for todays infants to have in intellect of their personal physically applications, and the business between feeling moist and dry that they wish to have in intellect of to make this system show up totally and it presumably why childrens actually arent organized to pop out of diapers as early as possibly our fogeys or grandparents are telling us we and our fogeys have been.
We have been impressed to get out of our diapers in a maximum most likely that todays infants arent we understood moist and smelly and squelchy! Interestingly ample in less neatly-off offers of the international the place they nevertheless use linen diapers and dont use disposable nappies childrens are potty skilled much extra more youthful than our childrens are organized to be irrespective of that isnt a options of the two manner. Things are what they're and the maximum principal factor to develop into extensive awake of beforehand you can be searching and develop into a diaper free family is no matter if or now now not or now now not you can be all wholly organized for the problems that permits you to be nervous to make that show up. ny green
ALL signs and signals of being organized, and oldsters now now not taking into interest the outcomes that lifestyles movements which is happening would neatly also have within of the technique. Make it convenient for you and your toddler wait until you do. Save yourself the heartache of failed attempts, and feeling like you truly arent doing an moderate ample task as a guardian you can be. parenting teens blog
Though 3-days potty coaching system is a wholly sought after and mostly amusing venture, if which is undertaken too early and with out absolute best plans in crew for this finished technique you can be environment yourself up to fail and neither you as a guardian, nor your toddler need to have this make you totally feel that manner. Failure actually makes you similarly miserable, and promises a long drawn out agony for you similarly searching to take transport of your purpose.
When a toddler is worked up, or over drained it would be convenient to make errors very like we reap this go convenient on them and yourself within of the match that they arent 100% dry and extremely-modern straight!
A permanently potty skilled toddler is one which will admire after they wish to go and is in a concern to forcing the potty or toilet, and get dressed and undress themselves to harvest this. This doesn't, except the confirmed reality that, mean that they would possibly be able to now under no circumstances have injuries.
Especially for these of you who've been driving disposable diapers your toddler has presumably now under no circumstances totally even felt the end result of being moist thank you to the extremely-dry surfaces and the brief diaper adjustments that you as fogeys can undertake this current day.
Stop correct kind there, and wait. Though here is a sudden truthful technique, whichever of the platforms you go for, many dad and mom have failed on the 1st hurdle therefore of confirmed reality that they didnt rely on to make great that similarly they and their toddler have been in authentic reality organized to make this monumental amendment.
Bearing this in intellect, potty coaching do now now not appear like organized to be achieved until great key strategies have been reached as an aspect of the childs exact physical advancement fail to be aware of about about this caution at your peril many an take a investigate at this has failed thank you to inadequate preparation, now now not waiting until your toddler unearths
When I was once extra more youthful, the most productive opportunity was once a terry toweling diaper, and I have vivid thoughts of it trailing within of the back of me whilst sodden, and it being a maximum ugly sensation (I would love to denote that my Mum transformed me very inevitably, irrespective of I had an inclination to get lost on adventures and so after they at remaining stuck up with me I would mostly be in exactly a little of a state!).
Remember, you can be likely to probably be wholly converting the manner a child does their commercial college you've got been telling them for months, presumably even years that the crew to pee and poop is of their diaper, and impulsively you can be now telling them that they wish to do it someplace wholly dissimilar.
Any word on the NIF format 'improvements' from Jon or anyone else? I'll assume there won't be much of a difference being the old models work perfectly fine.
No, PS4 users are getting mods. Bethesda recently announced that PS4 is getting mods, but they won't be able to use any external assets.
So am I missing something here? In the article they say their creation kit is "available here". Clicking the link just has to installing the Bethesda Launcher, which I already have. There is a CK there, but it says it's for FO4. Are they the same or it simply not released yet?
By the sounds of it, SSE mods will be limited to 5GB on the Xbox and 1GB on the PS4. That's not much room for mods consider my mod folder is 20GB...
Also, looks like it'll be available today for most USA users from reading the region unlock section. That's how it reads anyway.
Maybe the 5GB limit is something to do with Microsoft being worried about texture mods because that is the bulk of my LO, 30 something GB of them. Some textures are redundant but they're still there.
yes 1 am on the 28th here is England but starting from 5pm on the 27th PST plus Tech haven't you heard that the USA is the centre of the known universe and everything revolves around them.
Yeah, I started the pre-load a little while ago. I was just surprised to see the unlock for today instead of at like...midnight.
Our country shouldn't be the center of anything. It's not as great as it used to be. I totatlly agree with this: https://www.youtube....h?v=VMqcLUqYqrs
I was specifically curious about the CK for SSE, but I seen some mods going up on Nexus already and wouldn't mind getting a jump on converting a few mods over (Jaggarsfeld and WATER, mainly).
It took me some time to stop being angry at Bethsoft for not remaking Morrowind and/or Oblivion. Oh well...it`s better than nothing I suppose.
-do you think old mods will be compatible? This is something they claim, and yet it seems improbable (at least for the mods related to gfx)
-any chance the engine will be improved regarding the Vsync-on malarkey? I really wish they unlocked the framerate so it doesn`t break the game - I discovered that "safe" threshold is 85 Hz, above that I see dead chickens and other bad stuff happens.
-in general, do you think minimum framerates could improve with this remake (or whatever you call it). Atm I go from ~55 in cities with lots of NPCs milling around to 85 (capped) fps. That`s on 980 Ti/2600K with about 30 mods (no heavy gfx).
Old mods...depends on the mod. Texture, mesh, and most animation mods (that don't require FNIS) should work out of the box with SSE. Mods that rely on third-party tools (FNIS, DynDOLOD, etc) and those that require SKSE will have to wait until those tools and SKSE are released for SSE.
I don't expect framerates to improve. In fact, the recommended requirements are even higher than that of the original 32-bit game. It should be more stable memory-wise simply due to the move to 64-bit, though. This means tools like the memory patch and ENBoost should no longer be required.
Nif format has changed but old format is still supported except for some legacy options like NiTriStrips.
I kind of do expect frames to improve cause DX11 and memory restriction removal... at least for Win10 users.
Can't wait to try it out. I think early obstacles to modding SSE are lacking of proper mod manager, SKSE for SSE, and SkyUI (MCM).

Would You Pay $30k to Withdraw $1m? What You Need to Know About Bitfinex’s New 3% Wire Withdrawal Fee
Every cryptocurrency venture is worth exploring. While not all ideas turn into viable projects, the opportunities cannot be overlooked. Blue Frontiers, a company looking to build a floating city, will not issue a native cryptocurrency. It is unclear what will happen to the issued Varyon currency in circulation.
Several months ago, Blue Frontiers surprised the entire world with its plan to build a floating city in French Polynesia. An active and ongoing dialog with local officials can make this venture happen in the years to come. The idea of a floating city is not new, but Varyon is different for a specific reason. It was slated to use a native cryptocurrency to fund the economy of the floating city.
During the pre-sale in 2018, the project raised $600,000. In exchange for contributions, investors were set to receive the native currency. That plan has now been scrapped altogether, with Blue Frontiers acknowledging that the time is not right to launch this native currency. All investors are set to receive a refund over the coming weeks and months.
Launching a new cryptocurrency is a very risky and time-consuming process. Thousands of such currencies exist at this time and most of them do not serve a specific purpose. Blue Frontiers is keeping the Varyon reserves in their back pocket, for the time being. It may be used or distributed at a later date.
It is not the first time Varyon faced a setback. Earlier this year, the floating city plan had to be altered in a significant manner. Blue Frontiers intended to build this structure in Tahiti but that plan fell through after discussions with the local government officials. The search for a new location has been ongoing ever since.
Maintaining an open dialog is vital for this project. Building a floating city is no easy feat. Although Varyon will be its own jurisdiction, the development stage needs to adhere to existing regulations. It appears that discussion is going according to plan in French Polynesia, for the time being. Finding the correct location for a floating city is anything but straightforward.
The cancellation of the native cryptocurrency has had no immediate impact on the project’s progress. It is an unfortunate development, but its launch has to be timed perfectly. Tying an entire micro-economy to such a currency requires a lot of careful thought and consideration. For now, the utopian dream of a floating city with a cryptocurrency-based economy remains well out of reach.
Do you think that the Varyon project will get back on track? Will they be able to adhere to their ideal of a cryptocurrency-based economy? Let us know in the comments below.

A lot of changes are happening in the world of cryptocurrency. Most of those developments are kept under close wraps, for obvious reasons. The GDAX platform we know today will undergo some big changes. It will be renamed to Coinbase Pro and mainly targets on streamlining the overall trading experience. An interesting decision which raises plenty of questions.
Most cryptocurrency users have gotten acquainted with the GDAX platform. This second trading solution is operated by Coinbase, next to their more novice user-friendly trading platform. Even so, it was always evident there would be some changes coming to GDAX in one way or another. As of right now, the plan is to rebrand this platform to Coinbase Pro.
It will be a newer version of the existing platform with a focus on more intuitive trading. There will also be a new chart system for experts to benefit from. Additionally, the consolidated portfolio view will also be interesting to keep an eye on. All of these features will give customers options to perform in some less traditional features found within the cryptocurrency ecosystem system.
Coinbase briefly touches upon staking and protocol voting, among other things. The company acknowledges decentralized solutions are on the rise in terms of popularity. As such, centralized trading platforms need to keep tabs on new developments. Remaining competitive will be pretty difficult for centralized platforms in this regard. Decentralized platforms directly connect buyers and sellers with no intermediaries.
How Coinbase Pro will be received, remains to be seen. The features will be offered to users outside the US first. This is primarily due to concerns over enabling new cryptocurrencies on the platform which may violate SEC guidelines. A lot of interesting developments will be on the horizon in this regard. All things considered, it appears to be a positive change for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.

I have an totmc EZ-Cap, to go from VHS TO muh file, but I have a problem with the sound match the spoken words? It seems to be a few seconds off. Is this a software issue or an EZCap issue? How do I solve it? What type of capture device would you recommend? John
Stop trying to capture to MKV. Try capturing a lossless codec first.....then encode that file to whatever you need.
What capture devices aren't take? How much should I expect to pay for a decent one? Lossless codec (avi?)?
"avi" is not a codec. The codecs most often used for lossless capture are huffyuv and Lagarith, some use UT Video codec. Huffyuv uses less CPU power.
EZCap, EasyCap, aka "Easy-Crap" (a nickname that should tell you something) aren't so great. A similar but better long-time budget favorite is Diamond Multimedia's VC500 USB.
@stivo Dzięki za info. Ostatnio nie śledziłem zmian, ale patrząc po ostatnich wpisach na forum, to wiele osób skarży się, że w wersji 1.14 jest dużo błędów. O ile dobrze się orientuję, to ma to związek z poważną luką bezpieczeństwa, którą wykryto niedawno (dotknęła też inne przeglądarki). Aby ją jak najszybciej załatać, zdecydowano się nieco wcześniej wypuścić wersję 1.14, kosztem drobnych błędów, których nie zdążyli wyeliminować z wersji testowej.

This new edited collection brings together leading scholars and activists to explore how varieties of activism are mediated through communication technologies, how activists deploy strategies for changing the structures of media systems, and how governments and corporations seek to police media activism. From memes to zines, hacktivism to artivism, Media Activism in the Digital Age considers activist practices involving both older kinds of media and newer digital, social, and network-based forms.
Victor Pickard and Guobin Yang have assembled essays by leading scholars and activists to provide case studies of feminist, technological, and political interventions during different historical periods and at local, national, and global levels. Looking at the underlying theories, histories, politics, ideologies, tactics, strategies, and aesthetics, the book takes an expansive view of media activism. It explores how varieties of activism are mediated through communication technologies, how activists deploy strategies for changing the structures of media systems, and how governments and corporations seek to police media activism. From memes to zines, hacktivism to artivism, this volume considers activist practices involving both older kinds of media and newer digital, social, and network-based forms.
Media Activism in the Digital Age provides a useful cross-section of this growing field for both students and researchers.
Guobin Yang is a Professor and Victor Pickard is an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication. Both are IAMCR members through the institutional membership of ASC. Many of the authors are also members of IAMCR.

Nominating Committee Seeking Candidates for IDPF Board - Apply by Dec. 3 | International Digital Publishing Forum
The IDPF Board of Directors has formed a 2014 Nominating Committee, which is soliciting candidates for Director positions. Every primary representative of an IDPF member organization is eligible to serve on the board. Interested individuals should send a candidate statement by December 3, 2013 to boardcandidates@idpf.org. Typically, a candidate statement would include a brief biography, and potentially reasons for running for the position and/or general vision or ideas for the IDPF. The Committee will also consider as candidates those current board members who wish to continue their service to the IDPF but whose term runs out this year.
The IDPF Board's core responsibilities include representing member interests in developing the vision and strategic plan for the organization and providing oversight and guidance to staff and volunteers carrying out the work of the organization. Being a board member of the IDPF entails a not insignificant commitment of responsibility and time. The Board and executive staff currently meet monthly via teleconference, and at least once a year in a face-to-face meeting. Board time and expenses are not reimbursed. Prospective members should be leaders in their organizations and have a clear understanding of one or more segments of the digital publishing industry. Board oversight responsibility extends to the governance process involved in the approval of specifications so familiarity with EPUB and related technologies is helpful; however technical expertise is definitely not a requirement. As with other activities of the IDPF, board meetings are generally conducted in English but with an expectation that as a global organization not all participants will necessarily be native English speakers. Meetings are scheduled to facilitate participation across multiple time zones, but which means they cannot be at convenient times for all participants.
Seven of fourteen seats on the IDPF Board will be elected in this cycle, for two-year terms. The Nominating Committee and IDPF Board anticipates recommending to the membership a slate of five or six candidates, which will leave at least one seat open for at-large election. The slate will be selected to foster a diverse board in the interest of providing representation across our global organization with members from all parts of the value chain. A subsequent call for formal nominations will be made and elections are anticipated in January. Other than the addition of a Nominating Committee, as provided for in the IDPF Bylaws, and adjusting election timing to be after the New Year in order to avoid maximize participation, the overall IDPF Board election process remains unchanged: assuming seven seats are open, the seven candidates receiving the most votes will be elected (whether or not they are part of the slate).
The 2014 IDPF Board Nominating Committee is comprised of board members Mark Bide (Chair), Pierre Danet, Masaaki Hagino, George Kerscher, and Adam Witwer.

While interpretations of the term big data vary across different stakeholders, there is no denying the fact we live in the era of big, complex, and rich data. This presents obvious opportunities to visualization for tapping into the analytical value of the data. Being a relatively nascent field compared to its exploratory data analysis siblings: statistics, machine learning, data mining, etc., there is a need for introspection into how visualization can best fit into the big data analysis pipeline. In this pipeline, while infrastructure building for big data has received most of the attention, much less focus has been on devising ways to improve interpretation of such complex data. We believe, by introspecting on the role of visualization in the big data era, we can achieve a two-fold purpose: i) highlight the visualization-specific challenges for handling big data and chart out a roadmap for the immediate future, and ii) establish visualization as a first-class citizen in the big data pipeline and thereby make a significant impact on the state-of-the-art of interpretation and analysis of such complex data.

Over her career, Jennifer Garner has sported a number of different hairstyles. Some augment her personality, while others are more suited for the personality of her characters she is playing at the time. Below are some of her most notable hairstyles. It is common for people to ask their hairdressers to design their hair similar to one of Jennifer Garner’s styles, so hopefully this will help some of you to give you an idea of the options available.
Ghosts of Girlfriends Past featured Christa B. Allen as a young Jennifer Garner. She is the same actor used to portray young Jenna in 13 Going on 30. Christa looked remarkably like a young Jennifer Garner in 13 Going On 30 and it appears she does so again in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. Above you can see a picture of Christa B Allen now, and a picture of Jennifer Garner taken approximately 5 years ago. I wonder if in a few years Violet Affleck will be playing a young Jennifer Garner in a movie? Who knows, we’ll just have to wait and find out.
It seems that everyone these days wants to know where Jennifer Garner lives. Luckily for you, we’re here to give you what you want. We respect the privacy of celebrities, but it comes with the territory that fans that love you are going to want to drive by your house.
Until August of 2008, Jennifer Garner lived in Brentwood, Los Angeles with Ben Affleck and her child, Violet. Jennifer Garner purchased the house for $5,500,000 in 2004 through her Gee Family Trust. The house was built in 1929, has 3,850 sq. feet and contained 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. When Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner married in 2005, it was rumored that the couple was looking to purchase a new home together. However, Ben ended up moving into this home and they remained there until 2008.
In 2008 Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck purchased a new home, also in Brentwood. The home is 9,900 square feet and has an acre of property. The home itself has 7 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, a wine cellar, 6 fireplaces, a library and a large garage. They had the house built, and it also features a pool, poolhouse and outdoor fireplace.
Aside from the question of how tall Jennifer Garner is, readers also ask us how tall she is. As you’ve probably noticed in her movies and in Alias, she’s a tall and athletic woman. She is 5’8″ tall. This has been confirmed by multiple sources.
In an Australian magazine she was quoted as saying that she looks for a man at least 5’8″ because that is what she is.

Last week I posted a review of yoga at Yoga Heights. Now it’s time for Pilates. I’ve done three different Pilates classes and they were all a bit different. Here goes.
I went to Yogalates with Michelle as often as I could. That class is great. The Pilates portion is challenging and usually goes through the first half hour or so of class. I like the yoga portion too because, though it’s not restorative, it’s only half an hour so it’s more manageable. (Except the day she decided to do hamstrings. That was just terrible.) I highly recommend this class. It’s fantastic! The biggest problem with this class is that it’s so late! 8:00 pm (actually now it’s at 7:45 pm) but that means I don’t get home until 9:15-9:30 which is too late for me.
By far the hardest class I’ve done has been Pilates on Sunday with Sarah. The first time I did this was the day after an 18 mile run. I think the Pilates was harder. For real. I don’t even remember a lot of what we did, just that it was.so.hard. I did this class twice with Sarah and it was insane both times (I did it a third time but Michelle from Yogalates was subbing for Sarah). I would say this class is my favorite I’ve done. I spend most of it thinking it’s impossible and I probably shouldn’t have gone. At the end of the first one, I didn’t know if I’d be able to get up from my mat. When I have a job and a paycheck, this is definitely a class I’ll consider going to regularly. Like Yogalates, though, the time is a bit of a deterrent. It’s at 4:30 on Sunday which is usually okay for me but it would be hard to make it if I had other Sunday plans.
The other class, which I only did a couple times, was a Tuesday evening class and it was fine. I don’t think it’s anything truly amazing nor terrible. It was an okay class and a good option if it fits your schedule.
Overall, I really enjoyed going to Yoga Heights and would like to continue going. The first class is free. After starting my 30 day pass (which was $21), I went to 18 classes. That comes out to $1.16 per class. Pretty good deal. I should not that the current special for new students in 3 weeks for $30.
I think these classes really helped my marathon training and I’m glad I did them. Hopefully soon I’ll figure out how to go back (probably a bit less regularly…) or find another place to occasionally do Pilates.

After the announcement that Agony Unleashed was closing its doors for the last time, we were humbled by the forum, video, and reddit posts saying how important a role Agony Unleashed had played in your own personal enjoyment of the game, and the content we had provided over the last 12 or so years.
Many of the comments received asked if we would be holding any event – and so by popular demand, we will be hosting an event on 8th April at 2000 eve time, in Berta.
In time honoured tradition, we will form up in frigates taking x’s out of “Agony Public” in game on the night around 30-minutes beforehand.
We will then head to an undisclosed system, where we will have a Frigate Free For All, and fight until the death [no podding].
Once the battle is over, and gfs are exchanged, you can either travel back to the staging system in your pod, or take the pod express and grab new ships and go out again!
Kept some of the comms in, but sped up some of the action - some pretty funny comms at various intervals.

Ok, I said I was waiting for an official announcement to make a thread, and could it be a better one than the final screen of the last episode itself ?
Hayate no Gotoku gets its our greatly anticipated, hoped, wished and of course deeply appreciated Season 2 !
I need to remind you all not to post manga unseen contents here. Please use the existing Hayate no Gotoku manga (raw discussion only) or the Hayate the Combat Butler manga (Viz Edition only), or also the Hayate no Gotoku - Spoilers & Speculation (for experienced Combat Butlers only) threads.
The shounen manga Hayate no Gotoku! (Hayate the Combat Butler) will be getting a second season anime adaptation. The news is unconfirmed as of now.
Next week's Shounen Sunday: Shounen Sunday No.18 that will be released on April 2nd, 2008 will be announcing the second season anime adaptation of Hayate no Gotoku!
Even though I haven't seen any Hayate since episode 32 I'm happy to see that a second season will be on the way. Now I just need to find some time to catch up!
Not only i, but a good number of members here for a long time now have been saying how badly a second season should happen. They still have plenty of manga material to come across, together with the anime original material which seems to balance perfectly together with manga material.
*Hopes for 26-ep manga storyline adaptation* Though its more likely we'll have more of the same hijinks they gave us...
taking SR for example, how long did they take to announce a 3rd season? 3 years? i just hope that the apr 2 announcement will have something concrete (and hopefully in this year^^), and not just "We proudly announce that we have begun working on Hayate no Gotoku Season II, fans out there please wait for further announces", then they release a 1 episode OVA sometime round fall, and we dun hear from this show again til 2k9 ;/
somehow waiting a week - 3 months - 3 years til a new episode/chapter/stupid licensing finally catching up etc, wracks my nerves
It's impossible for Jagirinawa to be a thin snake otherwise Araragi's fight with snake won't going to make any sense at all.
I just don't like how they did that. No matter the reason, there is an underlying connotation in it all. But I suppose it fits since fetishes were part of the humor with the Nadeko arc.
If I remembered correctly, the novel didn't have his sister waking him up too since he have to stay at Oshino's place. It's already morning when went back home. For the snake part, Jagirinawa's setting is to kill the victim by crawling into their mouth so I'd say that scene is just being loyal to the novel.
Well, after he stayed over and went home, he went to bed again. His sisters woke him up again shortly after that and that's why I said there was a sister waking scene in this arc too. This scene actually had some importance to it since while Araragi was changing into his uniform and preparing for school that he figured out it was the boy who confessed to Nadeko that released the second snake. In the anime Araragi figured it out during the fight but in the novel it was the mourning after.
And quite shocked on all the correction they made. The 2nd half feels different at all from tv version.
MM, Nadeko does absolutely nothing for me, but this episode had very good pacing which led to good drama. Koyomi and Kanbaru form a great team to save this unfortunate moeblob, which helps build his character a little more. First episode that I actually managed to not stare away due to flashy crap, and it looks rather decent compared to previous episodes.

Jennifer Lopez, who was hailed last spring by Us Weekly as Style Icon of the Decade, won the title very much over her ex-husband’s head. Marc Anthony, arguably the best Latin salsa singer of our time, had been trying to gain a whip hand over what J Lo should (and shouldn’t) wear throughout all the seven years of their marriage.
A source close to the couple told Us that Anthony, 42 this year, had always been opposed to his wife being a sex symbol. He had wanted her to wear inconspicuous, “wifey” clothes and would get at her for sexy and provocative outfits. “He would make her feel terrible about herself,” the source said.
Another source recounted that Anthony had raised objections to some of the photos made for her 2010 Us Weekly presentation, reasoning that a 40-year-old woman and mother of two children shouldn’t look “too sexy and unbecoming.”
It may have been one of the reasons behind the couple’s last week split, for other sources also spoke of the singer as a dominating and controlling person who tried to interfere with many spheres of Lopez’s life.

But this time I will be able to make it, and to make publicity for an artist that I like a lot, and who is also my friend.
The 2nd of June, at 19:00, the designer artist Krste Gligoriadis will present his exibition: “Vanitas”. Based in Skopje, this experimental artist decides after the success of his first exhibition: “Les veux de la mama”, to reiterate and to propose to us a very new exhibition. When I asked him how he could describe it in a short way, he explained me that it will be an artistic spectacle composed of visual arts with a new way of conveying the concept. In this exhibition, you will find many different artworks of modern conceptual abstract art, with different techniques.
It promises to be a very cool moment, so if you have the occasion to go to Skopje to this date, don’t hesitate to come to see “Vanitas” in the Macedonian Opera and Ballet.
Do you want to delete all occurrences of the recurring appointment "Parent Teacher Conferences - Conferencias de Padres Maestros ", or just this one?
This year I wanted to make something special for my Nana. She is a great lover of birds, nature and the countryside. She also loves to garden. I wanted to get her something she would really appreciate, but it also had a be budget friendly as I just don't have the funds for big gifts this year. I decided to hand decorate a scarf with a seasonal bird - a cute robin!!
I started off with a scarf from the pound shop (I know - I am cheap-o this year!), which is basically black fleece material that has been hemmed. I chose this because I knew the fleece would be super easy to stitch on.
I grabbed some felt and embroidery thread from my stash in appropriate robin colours - red, brown and white. I also had a sheet of black for stitching the robin on - and to hide my stitches on the final product!
Step 4: Stitch each piece onto a piece of black felt, make sure there is space to cut around the robin (about 1/2 cm). Use co-ordinating thread for each coloured felt piece. Don't forget to add a beak!
Step 5: Carefully trim around the black felt (you will need enough space to stitch this onto the scarf!)
Step 6: Stitch your robins onto the scarf! If you have time you could add leaves / berries - it would look so cute! Modeled by my lovely mum before I wrapped it up :)
I’ve been to Seven Stars in the south lanes once before. Four years ago on a busy Saturday night, the place was filled with football on the TV and loud drunk men everywhere. Not super pleasant. More recently, the pub has been taken over and had a swanky revamp, now prominently featuring craft beer and all the meat by Little Blue Smokehouse (a favourite at Street Diner).
We head there after work on a Wednesday. I’m first to arrive (standard) and have a wander along the bar looking at the beers. One of the lovely girls behind the bar asks if I need help (big mistake) and I launch into a monologue about how I’m just starting to drink beer and I like lager and I want to try something new and what can she recommend. She gives me some tasters (Curious IPA and another IPA that I really wish I had written the name down because it was lovely – for those interested, it is the first tap you get to when entering the pub). I pick the latter and find a corner to hide in (meeting me for dinner is a challenge). When my companions arrive we start drooling over the food menu.
After much umming and ahhing we chose our food: One pulled pork roll, one chopped brisket on sourdough (with fries) and one Trash Can fries.
All of the portions are generous. The pulled pork is heaped into a bap and the brisket comes layered inside two large pieces of crusty sourdough. Both come with a bowl of ‘slaw – a crispy fresh accompaniment with enough may to bind it, but not enough to make it a soggy mess. My trash can fries arrive – a bowl loaded with fries and topped with pulled pork, cheese, fried pickles and hot sauce (to which I add more hot sauce).
We dig in and don’t speak for a few minutes with the exception of “ohhhhhhhhhh myyyyy god this is good”. The pulled pork is soft and flakey and smoky – ever so slightly dry but that is what hot sauce is for. Personally, I would put more cheese on the trash can fries in the future as it didn’t melt particularly well, but the fried pickles are great. Basically a normal pickle but with a crispy crunch outside. Wonderful stuff.
The menu is short but sweet, offering a handful of options (not many options for vegetarians….) but the beer selection at the bar (along with spirits and cocktails) certainly means you won’t get bored here. From our short meal, I’m fairly confident when I say that the menu is going for quality over quantity. This is something that is repeated on their website
We smoke, we pickle, we spice, we brine and we smoke. We smoke a lot. We smoke meat, we smoke fish and we smoke vegetables.
We love food and want to enjoy it, food should be fun, food should be interesting and food should be respected.
And we did. We loved it a lot. This pub has jumped up the list of places to go in my mind. The bad memories of the past are wiped out in a haze of beer and hot sauce.
All in all, a solid evening out. With food coming in under £10 and half a pint of tap beer for £2.50 it is both good quality and you definitely get your money’s worth. We were all stuffed by the end of our meals. The downsides of this place are that the music is rather loud (but nice and varied) and some of the seats and stools aren’t the most comfortable so get there early to grab a booth. It does however win major points for nice large clean toilets. A very important factor when you have a tiny bladder and are permanently thirsty.
You can check out the revamped Seven Stars website here along with their Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and show Little Blue Smokehouse some love here, here and here.
Alternatively, if blurry photos of food and Brighton is your thing I am also on Instagram and for bite-sized reflections into my mind, check me out on Twitter.

Kooks opened in the North Laine’s recently and I’ve been intrigued by the name, menu and frontage. Due to Dan’s inability to make a decision, I told him this is where we were going for dinner.
Describing themselves as “Brighton’s boho bistro, home-from-home for the creative types”, this is normally the kind of sentence that makes me loudly sigh and hate Brighton a little bit. How can a bistro be boho? Drawn in by my lust for a steak, we stroll in just before 8pm on a Wednesday to a fairly empty restaurant. 90 minutes later when we leave, the place is packed with barely a seat spare.
We settle down and order the two lagers on the menu – although Dan gets served the wrong one but it isn’t explained what we got instead… I get a Camden Town Brewery lager and whatever Dan was served was flavoured with lemon and thyme which was nice and zesty against our evening of meat.
I order my steak medium rare and with sweet potato fries instead of twice cooked chips. That steak though. I finished eating it nearly two hours ago and I’m still thinking about it. I imagine it will be the only thing getting me through work tomorrow as well. Beautifully pink in the middle, I have finally found somewhere that understands how to correctly cook a steak. Nice and juicy and seasoned with black pepper to perfection. The sweet potato fries weren’t too soft or too crispy, a good size – certainly a chip but not quite a wedge. What makes this so incredible was that chimichurri sauce. Heavy on the garlic and vinegar, it’s potent but not overpowering. Basically. I was in heaven. To the extent that I repeatedly said how happy I was. I’d had a bad day and was a bit grumpy but this turned my mood around.
Dan’s burger was huge. The brioche bun just held it together as meat juice dripped out onto the serving boards. I didn’t try any (we don’t really share food) but his review was “yeh, it’s a burger and it’s pretty good”. I really need to start dining with more eloquent people. They certainly didn’t hold back on the bacon, although the streaky bacon didn’t look as crispy as it could be.
We didn’t think we could manage dessert as the meat sweats were kicking in so we paid our very reasonable bill (£37.50 – £17 for the steak and £11 for the burger) and strolled out [side note: tonight was the night I chose to wear my new leather jacket, I left with a chunk of cow in my belly and the incredible smell of soft new leather wrapped around me. I still can’t believe I used to be vegetarian].
Would I go back? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes. I liked the look of everything on the menu – I nearly went for the lentils which says a lot! They have a wide variety of wines and cocktails, as we were leaving the bar seats were filling up and I can imagine hanging out here of an early eve (because I’m a creative Brighton type…). But order the steak.
Kooks is on the corner of Gardner Street and Church Street and is open everyday with special breakfast and sandwich menus to keep you going throughout the day. You can check out their website here, and find them on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Santiago isn&apos;t our favorite city, but this (our third time) we&apos;re much enjoying our stay here. We&apos;ve been resting up from the strains brought about by our long days of walking, recovering from a sore knee gotten in a spill (in town, believe it or not!), and connecting with friends from years past in the city, and new friends met on this year&apos;s adventure.
Tomorrow we&apos;re planning to head out toward Finisterre and Muxia, with the rest of next week rounded out by an unexpected adventure. Our original plans featured a return to Porto and a tour of the Duoro Valley, but the town is booked up for next weekend, and with the help of a kind young woman at our hotel, we&apos;ve found an alternative destination to discover. Stay tuned; you can be surprised along with us.

I uploaded my file two weeks ago. After five days its soft reject because it has apple logo in preview image. I removed the apple logo from preview image and upload it againand mentioned to reviewer tha it has been changed. But reviewer keep rejected if for the same reason and the sad part is that he doesn’t upload the new preview image that i sent two times. How to resolve this problem? Can anybody help me?

So I've finally decided to stop hoarding my maps and set them loose on the public. "Trailzz" is my very first map. I've had it completed for some time, but wasn't confident enough in my skills as a mapmaker to release anything publicly. As always, feedback is welcome however this will be a FINAL release of this particular map (barring any game-breaking issues with it).
My second map, "FlyingBlind" is now live on the workshop as well. What started out as an experiment with Photoshop ended up being more interesting than I expected...
I've deleted my Mudrunner folder and now reinstalling Mudrunner to give it a good, clean reinstall. I'll resub to the map to see if that fixes the version issue and I can play. I'll edit this if successful!
I have left modding Spintires and Mudrunner permanently. If I do continue later in life they will be private/friends only.
This is the last of my completed maps (see OP for workshop link), but I've got another one in the works. Thinking this next one might be a while getting out though, I didn't have a whole lot done on it when I started making trucks, but hopefully I'll get back into the mapping groove and smash it out soon enough...

Here are the maintenance scripts we run to help keep our database lean. They are all pretty simple but have helped keep us below a 40GB Database with 8k + agents
As Curtis mentioned during his presentation we can not take responsibility for coming up with these. Most of these were gathered from suggestions and posts from LT Geek members and the labtech community as a whole.
One Additional Script I included(Pending Script Counts.xml) emails myself every hour to give me the count of all pending and running scripts as well as a csv of everything in the running scripts table. I mostly use this to help me to determine when scripts are scheduled and making sure we aren't overloading the script engine at any give time. Also, works as an indicator of script engine problems if I don't get it or its delayed.
Already tried all of that. I really think it's dead. Do you think the install of the airport card had anything to do with it?
Maybe the airport card is just bad (I'm skeptical about it ruining your entire iBook but it could happen I suppose).
Yes, after installing the airport card and trying to turn the iBook back on and seeing that it wasn't working I turned it off and took the airport card out. I tried the resetting the pram, vram, I tried removing the keyboard and restarting, i tried removing the battery and restarting, nothing at all worked. I hear something engage after I hit the power button but thats where it ends. The lcd stays black and you dont hear those usual start-up sounds. The machine gets warm after a while, like it does when it's running. But nothing is going on. I fear the worst and am completely heart-broken over this. I HATE using my pc...as I type I'm getting error messages...grrr....I don't know what else to do but swallow the lump in my throat and save up for my next iBook. Thank you all so much for trying to help but I really do think it's a lost cause.
Just wanted to update this situation, for anyone who might have a similar problem. What happened in my case was I improperly installed the airport card. I took the iBook apart, thinking maybe I messed up some contacts where the card goes. Sure enough, a few of them were tweaked. I had my boyfriend go in and straighten them out (his hands are steadier than mine) and voila!! My dead-for-a-week iBook came back to life! Just wanted to post this in case someone else has the same situation. I was really close to throwing in the towel on this issue. Phew!!
Yeah, well, see that's the other thing. IT WAS THE WRONG ONE!! I listened to a very uninformed friend of mine and ordered what she said instead of doing the right thing and researching it first. I have an older model iBook and I need the original card...not the airport extreme. Sucks, 'cuz now I'm out the $80 I paid for the card and I don't have the loot for the right one. I'm currently looking into a cheaper alternative, maybe usb if possible. I have an airport express too, but no card to go with. I'm dumb for taking someone elses word instead of going with my gut and researching it. If anyone knows of any cheap alternatives to the original airport card that is compatable with the airport express PLEASE let me know for I will be eternally grateful. What IS the point of using a laptop with this damned ethernet cord trailing me???
Yeah, well I'm sad to admit how dumb I am. I took a chance with my precious iBook...Perhaps I'm being too dramatic, but it's this or the Dell, and I ADORE my iBook and barely tolerate the Dell. I just wish I hadn't made such a dumb mistake.
Don't be so hard on yourself, be proud that you were able to figure it out and fix it...plus you did learn something from this temporary mistake so be happy .
Yes. I hope some other person in my situation can benefit off of my mistake. They do say, you learn the most from your mistakes! I ordered the wrong card on my friends advice (she had a G4 while I had a G3), and I should have researched before taking her word that THAT was the right card. I hoping another newbie can benefit from my mistake. And thanks for the vote of confidence

I very rarely watch "Jeopardy." But I will be very anxious to hear the answer to your question. My only real connection to the show is that my father-in-law was a contestant on the show in the 60's.
My only connection is that I watch it occasionally and that I once went to a taping of the college edition of the show. The school I was rooting for lost.
i saw a question once about the first graphical interface or something or other... and the answer was mac...
I'm going to apply (at the insistance of my friends, who once watched me answer about 90% of the jeopardy answers correctly before the contestants, while I was drunk) to be on college jeopardy this year...
My wife said that the show was taped and so she got to watch it with her father at home. She thinks that he won less than a thousand dollars.
I considered taking the test for the teen tournament like my brother did, except I would have had to go to Baltimore to do it. Maybe I'll go for the College tournament myself next year...
On the same show yesterday, there was a not-quite Apple reference. The category for the "Final Jeopardy" question was "Jobs". But it turned out to be about employment, not CEOs! So we didn't get TWO Apple references in one show.
I saw the episode last night, and was pleasantly surprised by the Apple reference. I was glad that he answered correctly too!
Not very, although he did take the opportunity to look at some flutes when he was in NYC for the day.
A guy from my town won 5 days in a row and he got to go the Jeopardy Championship, he won like $200,000 it was insane, the whole town went nuts!
i definitely saw an answer on jeopardy once that was one of those picture answers. They had a picture of an original iMac ("Bondi Blue") and said something about Apple and 1998. The question was, of course, "What is the iMac?"
It often surprises me that Jeopardy answers about technical topics seem so easy, while Jeopardy answers about, say, history and geography are much harder. But I know it is just my impression based on my areas of knowledge (techie stuff) versus subjects I'm not as good at.
so I moved the monitor to suit my needs and unplugged the cables and once they where in the right spot I plugged it all back in and now its just not working. I know it works though because when i plug the cable into my mac it turns blue for a second like it does when there is a external monitor plugged in.
yes :/ thanks for your response but yes I have tried it. it sucks because I have a really good setup finally and it just stops working. I have gone and unplugged everything and replugged it all. I have checked every cable is right and everything.
Maybe it's really the external display port malfunctioning. Do you have any other monitors at hand to test it with?
Are you using gfxcardstatus? If so, make sure you have it set for dynamic switching prior to plugging in the external monitor. I've gotten bit by this when prepping for a presentation.

My game plays a bit like Mario Bros, except that to attack enemies you hit them with a block ( thrown with B ) to stun them, and you can make your own levels.
Yeah, if I hold any direction and jump, I go into a blockand get somewhat stuck. Fun though! Glad to see the progress on this.
The code for detecting when the player is touching a block isn't very good. I wanted it so the blocks would be treated a certain way ( you'd be able to jump through them somewhat without being stopped, but act solid in other circumstances like trying to walk through them horizontally ) but this in combination with the poorly written code for stopping the player from moving left and right through walls meant you'd wouldn't be able to move left and right while jumping through a platform.
As a nifty side effect you can latch onto a block from the side and press the opposite direction you're facing to kick off the block. Maybe I can rework the way collision with the blocks work without getting rid of this neat effect?
The player/enemy and block/enemy collision isn't very well written either, and you often have to touch the left side of the enemy to have the collision trigger. ( This happens on my TI-83+ game too, since I pretty much reused the way collision works )
Aside from fixing these bugs, eventually I want to add music ( if I can find a tiny music engine to fit in the ~6kb I have left along with other things I want to add) and a 2-player mode.
ctrl + shift + n to open a private window. Test in it. Log into Google. Then, try to log into other sites with it. Does it work there at least?
@mumrha Are either one of those set to run in a private window? Either way, disable them for a sec and try again.
You could also download the Opera installer, launch it, click "options", set "install path" to a folder on your desktop, set "install for" to "standalone installation" and install. Then, try in that Opera. to see if it works. If it does, then it's a setting/extension or something with your Opera profile.

After looking in the manual, it appears that the 100 picture folder is what you get. Doesn't mantion anything else.
I believe there is a standard on how the camera wites to the card, as every camera seems to do it the same way. Group 100 photos in a single folder and then rotate to the next folder.
Well I just plug my card into a card reader and download into a file that I choose in photoshop so I never see the folders. Much less annoying that way.
The new Fuji F-70 EXR camera is due out this month with some very interesting features. I have one on pre-order. Is anyone else intersted?
I wouldnt buy one of those just on principle that it doesnt feel or look like a camera. The word Mickey Mouse comes to mind although it has come to mean expensive these days. If no one bought these kinds of (and I use the term loosely) cameras then they would stop being made and more real cameras would see the light.
I think this type of price aren't much interesting for a compact camera despite is a good compact camera.
I regret a lot the absence of a model with some less feautures (but with the possibility of shoot in raw) that was present in the past ...
Now there aren't alternative in Fuji or you buy the top bridge or you haven't the possibility to shoot in raw.
Also part of the cost of the EXR sensor has already been amortized in the previous compact so why start with a price so high?
I understand your qualms very well. However, the camera will probably appeal to a lot of folks out there with it High ISO capabilities and 10X optical zoom it will make a dent in that camera niche.
I just pre-ordered mine from Amazon. I've been researching point & shoots extensively and have decided this is the camera for me. Now the waiting begins....
It has become an all out battle between Canon, Sony and Fuji on the 2009 Christmas Market. I too, have pre-ordered a Fuji F-70 from www.amazon.com.
However you cannot realistically ignore the challenge put forth by the Canon S-90 and the Sony WX-1 cameras. Fuji might not be the winning horse in this race.
Those were all brands I considered, along with Panny, and I actually didn't want another Fuji because I wanted to try something different. I've been using the same Fuji FinePix 3800 for more than 7 years now. It's been a great camera but I'm so tired of the bulkiness, I want something ultracompact that I can carry everywhere. The F70 meets all my needs (and BTW I love the way it looks - something about that shiny gunmetal finish).
I'm not a pro, amateur photographer, or anything like that, just a regular guy who wants to take great photos with a P&S. And I could care less about the video quality. I have a good camcorder for that.

As they go on, more and more creepy extraterrestrials pop up, with features both familiar and alien. And this is what I am all about right now. Designing creepier and more 'alien' aliens, along with more badass marines, following the ideas of the 'Colonial Marines', or rather, create an entirely new, class based set of human soldiers.
-Introduction: Now, I don't want to make this game exactly like an ALIENS movie, just to replace the horrible 'ALIENS: Colonial Marines', but rather make a more mature, scarier and darker experience. Due to my designs (which I will upload at a later date), some of the gameplay in NS2 will have to change, and therefore new maps, with new artwork needs to be done, and I will look into that another time. But here are my first few ideas for the alien race.
This will probably work as a skulk replacement. Just like the skulk, the Serpent has a powerful bite. But also, it has a special 'Launch' ability, which will launch the Serpent towards a human target, and if it is in range, the human will catch it mid air and cause a quicktime event. Either sine will have to mash spacebar to win. Whoever manages to press 'space' the most in a time span of 15 seconds. If the human wins, he will throw the Serpent away and pull up his rifle, while the Serpent will suffer from slowed down movement. If the Serpent wins it will slip out of the humans hands and thrust itself down the victims throat. This is an instant kill. The Serpent will then use the body as a host to cocoon itself. As a result, the upper chest will burst and the cocoon will be sticking out of the dead body. This is to show human players which dead allies pose a threat and which don't. After the cocoon the next stage of alien starts becoming a problem.
Much a work in progress. I am missing an idea for a simple attack, but I know it's special attack: By pressing 'E' it's large, slightly transparent 'wings', open up and reveal a mouth, type thing. This is an extremely vulnerable spot, but if the Hugger is close enough it can 'embrace' the human with its wings and subsequently kill the victim. The Hugger lays an egg in the human and dies, but stays wrapped around the dead body, for the other human players to spot the threat. This is the dawn of the final stage of the alien life cycle.
Work in progress. Basically the most powerful alien evolution. Big, deals a ton of damage and has a big health pool.
-There are a couple of other evolutions, including a suicidal, acid spewing slug and a crab like creature, possessing skills similar to the Gorge. These Designs are coming soon.

True, true, but then......., my last Xb1 cost me 195 € - Forza Horizon 3, DLC and Forza Motorsport 7 included. My i5 with Geforce 960 was 1.000 € 3 years ago-nothing included
You are talking about the far SW entrance to the LR (600M); about 300M from LP2; stay on the East side of the cave, or move to the acid-fall and hover. Use Exo to gather materials. The ghost will keep attacking the Exo or the moth.
Hi Joseph, the Ghost Leviathan, is a pain, but, you can use decoy torpedos to lure the GL, off, and as long as you travel slowly and stick to the edges of the biome, you should be fine. Following the left hand edge of the biome, past the skull of the dead leviathan, you'll come to a big waterfall; now for ease of access if you are above and behind the waterfall, just as it flows over the ledge, turn 90 degrees to the right, move towards the cave wall, and you should see a steady slope leading down and to the left, this will lead you under the waterfall. Now I'm presuming you've got all of the depth improvements for the Cyclops and PRAWN suit, as you'll need them. This is your easy access point for the PRAWN suit, and leads you to the Lava biome, where you can get Kyonite. Hope this helps. Oh yes, don't forget to use Silent Running, module, this too will help with avoiding the GL.

I usually take the southern blood kelp entrance. Yes, its a nightmare getting down there, but, if you hug the edge of the cave, and avoid the head of the gargantuan skeleton, you can avoid the Ghost Leviathan altogether.
Life is a window. It is just a scream into the darkness, passing the time until all of you, your memories, and all of humanity slowly fade into the void that is death. As your window closes, you will know that life is just the fight against it, even though it is just a constant in life. Death is the Impending Doom, the one force that always prevails, the true entity that connects and binds us all. All problems, either big or small, amount to nothing. The one possible savior to this world and everything in it is our own universal mortality. Once we realize this, society might finally become true and pure, and all will be at peace.

The Markov chain Monte Carlo method is based on a simple idea, and works powerfully for samplinghard objects. Recently, it appears in many areas such as statistical physics, economics, statistics, and so on. There are some technical points when to use it practically, and in this talk, we focus on a topic of convergence rate of Markov chains, with some examples such as contingency tables, Ising model, and permanent. We also talk about perfect sampling.

Mumbai, Sep 6 (IANS) Actress Kriti Kharbanda, who was last seen on-screen in “Yamla Pagla Deewana Phir Se”, feels that pressure and audience expectations are great for her forthcoming film “Housefull 4”.
Asked if she is feeling the pressure of being a part of the film because the last three parts of the “Housefull” series have been immensely successful, Kriti said: “I think the pressure is on the producers and not on me as an actor.
“I also think it is a great thing for the film because ‘Housefull’ as a franchise has set a benchmark where we already have a good fan following for the film. Having said that, the producers and director is making sure that if the first three parts of the franchise have been superhit, then the fourth part should go beyond that in terms of success.”
Revealing the shooting schedule of “Housefull 4”, Kriti said: “I am leaving for Jaipur in a week’s time to shoot for ‘Housefull 4’ and I am feeling very nervous and excited to be a part of the film. We are going there for a month-long schedule. So, let’s see how it shapes up.
“At the end of the day, it is very important for all of us that the film does well not just for the actors but also for an industry because when a film does really well, you can make more films.”
“Housefull 4” is a romantic comedy film directed by Sajid Khan, and produced by Sajid Nadiadwala under the banner of Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment.
It also features Akshay Kumar, Bobby Deol, Ritiesh Deshmukh, Kriti Sanon and Pooja Hegde. The release is slated for Diwali 2019.
The Information theory of everything (InfToE) is a cosmological theory, based on the idea of the universe as a closed information system. The universe is represented by a hierarchical set of observations of entities by entities, which itself are the results of observations. Because observation is only the acquisition of information, and information is a description of something, the universe in InfToE is entirely consist up of information only.
The methodological basis of InfToE is materialism, refined to meet the requirements for the Theory of everything.
In refined materialism, the concept of matter becomes definiteness in the abstraction of the Information continuum (IC). Combining the elements of the IC generates all the complex diversity of entities of the universe.
The objectivity of the theory of complexity is complemented by the communicative nature of the theory of observation: a pair of these components forms a complete closed Information theory of everything.
Realization is an applied part of InfToE, representing the transition from abstractions of theory to the forms of the material world that are familiar to us.

New data shows that more families are now living in multigenerational households and with grandparents younger than ever it’s important to establish that deep bond with grandkids at a young age—and especially so if you live apart. Often, however, it’s hard to find common interests to bridge the generations. One fun way is through GrandCamp Adventures, entertaining and educational storybooks, music, games and activities carefully designed to stimulate conversation and connect families through the grandparent and grandchild relationship, bring family members closer and create lasting and unforgettable memories.
To better understand how to nurture the grandparent-grandchild relationship we asked Patricia Babuka, the CEO and co-founder of GrandCamp Adventures, to explain the benefits to all the generations of making these important family connections. Coming from a childhood filled with family, love and laughter, Patricia wanted her children to experience the same fortune and admiration for their grandparents as a child as she did. The original “grandcampers” were inspired by Patricia’s in-laws, Margie and Reuben, and continued to be the motivation for 10 years while she and her partner Scott Schaefer were creating GrandCamp Adventures.
Grandparents are often a grandchild’s strongest connection to family heritage. Grandparents are free from the day-to-day parenting, so they are able to provide a special time of uninterrupted play. Grandchildren especially enjoy hearing about the “good ‘ol days” and what their parents were like when they were little. By telling fun family stories and singing silly songs, grandparents are treasure troves of happy memories, actively passing down their family heritage to this curious generation.
Grandchildren represent the future to grandparents. Grandparents want to share their legacy with the grandchildren and enrich the children’s growing up experience with special time spent together. Grandparents like spoiling their grandchildren in a way that they never would have imagined doing with their own children. We believe it goes back to the grandparents not having to be as involved in the day-to-day parenting, so their time with grandchildren is all about fun. Spoiling isn’t necessarily about material things. The lyrics of our song “Nobody Loves Me Like My Grandma” on the “Here We Go!” Music CD convey this sense of indulgence: “Mama makes me oatmeal for breakfast, but grandma let’s me eat ice cream!”
Grandchildren love to spend time with their grandparents because grandparents make them feel like they are the center of attention and there is no one else more special. Parents like knowing that they’re children aren’t just with a “babysitter,” but that time with grandparents is a special time in which grandchildren are learning more about they’re family stories and unique value system. Our storybook, music and games within the “Here We Go!” product line provides a simple “recipe” for sharing family stories and creating new, “sticky” memories through play. This helps grandparents easily bridge the inter-generational gap and make their time together a special, sharing time.
Today’s grandparents fill a true need for the American family. In most families either two parents are working or a single parent is trying to do everything on his or her own. Grandparents represent a tremendous support resource for the parents. For example, in one family we know, the mother is on call as a doctor at least one weekend a month. Her parents come to stay with her husband to help with the three preschool children on those weekends. Even in families where there would seem to be no urgent need for the support of grandparents, parents find that involvement of the senior generation nourishes the children with a different kind of learning and sharing experience. Grandparents also can step in and give the parents a little together time away from the demands of the children.
For the grandchildren, being around grandparents provides an important learning experience that is unhampered by the constraints often in place when they are with their parents. By being with grandparents, they learn to value their elders and respect what they have to offer them. Through grandparents, they can come to understand firsthand the power of family, their own family legacy and a grandparent’s love.
Long distance grandparenting keeps getting better and better with the help of technology, but it is still not quite the same as being there to wipe away a tear or cheer a hit at a Little League game. Long distance grandparents are simply not there, can’t respond to situations when their help would make a huge difference, and, because spontaneous visits are often out of the question, have to schedule time with grandchildren. Long distance grandparents are challenged to be more creative, make the most of every physical visit, use everything within their power to establish a connection with each grandchild and then stay connected.
With huge percentages of the grandparent population online, the Internet has emerged as a key was to stay connected. Grandparents we know email grandchildren often, have frequent Skype calls and telephone for quick chats about what happened that day. We find that grandparents who keep long distance communications short, fun and frequent end up with great rapport with their grandchildren. By communicating frequently about real things that are happening, the grandchildren and grandparents get to really know one another and build solid relationship. Another great way to connect is for the grandparents and their grandchildren to share time together at a destination away from both of their homes.
Yes. Despite how sophisticated communications are these days, there is still the magic of getting something in the mail. Letters, cards, photographs sent by mail are tangible and often get saved much longer than electronic communications. A grandchild who mails a picture drawn in school to his or her grandmother is sending a real gift. Likewise, grandparents who send their grandchildren pictures of the grandchild’s parent at various times in his or her childhood, give their grandchild a treasure that’s likely to be saved for a long time.
Absolutely! Communicating frequently boosts the familial bonds between these two generations. Grandparents and grandchildren should communicate as often as they can.
Many members of today’s grandparent generation have the energy and resources to do extraordinary things with their grandchildren. Often grandparents will sponsor a trip or rent a vacation home big enough for their children’s family to visit and spend fun time with their grandparents.
However, staying connected does not have to be expensive or elaborate. At GrandCamp Adventures, we believe strongly that it is the simple things, spending playtime with grandchildren rather than entertaining them, which make the difference. Sitting on the porch talking about the bird in the tree or playing a game together is much more important to building the relationship than putting the grandchildren on a carnival ride and waving as they pass by.
Sometimes it can be something as simple as a gift that a grandparent gives a child. One grandmother we know gave her granddaughter a little flowered heart and told her that she wanted her to know that she was in her heart every moment of every day. The grandchild keeps that heart by her bed and touches it every night. Another grandparent sends her grandchildren books with a tape of her reading the book. Our GrandCampers tell us the key is discovering things both ages enjoy doing. They want experiences vs. ‘things.’ These experiences should be meaningful, alive with happy memories, continuous and frequent, full of joy, fun and laughter. They also want to pass down a family legacy and value system. It isn’t about big fancy trips. Anything can be an adventure. We recommend that grandparents actively involve their grandchildren in planning their outings, aka “adventures.” Whether it is playing board or card games, reading books together, baking cookies, going to the movies, on a nature walk or a museum, we find spending time together is the most important thing.
How does GrandCamp Adventures help grandparents and their grandkids strengthen their bonds & relationships?
GrandCamp Adventures gives grandparents and their grandchildren avenues to share time with each other, learn, and have fun. Every one of our offerings is creatively designed for interaction and sharing. All create great memories.
How will these adventures and activities engage kids and help kids and their grandparents strengthen their relationship?
When we did focus groups with eight-year-olds, they all were excited about the magic compass in the storybook and had their own ideas as to where they would want the compass to take them and their grandparents. They loved the vibrant illustrations in the book and the idea of an around-the-world adventure. Similarly, when we introduced the “Here We Go!” music CD at an outdoor event on Grandparents Day, all the kids loved dancing and wiggling to its lively tunes, and many began singing along on the choruses.
Grandparents and grandchildren “play their way” to getting to know each other through their shared experience with GrandCamp Adventures. The bonds get stronger every time they greet each other with their own unique family handshake created with our Shake It Up secret handshake game. In a like way, grandchildren and grandkids share memories, feelings and ideas as they uncover family treasures through our “Search for Longbeard’s Treasure” treasure hunt.
GrandCamp Adventures’ focus is to create beautiful, high-quality products that deliberately celebrate and build the grandparent-grandchild relationship. Each product within the “Here We Go!” adventure line gives our GrandCampers all the ingredients to encourage simple and easy sharing of family stories and creating of new memories through play. This deepens bonds and has kids begging to go to grandma’s house. Because these experiences are rooted in play, they become what we call “sticky” memories.

I was at the Maritime Museum in London yesterday giving a revved up version of my 'Can Museums Save the World' presentation which I blogged about a few weeks back; after suffering a train cancellation and moderate level ticket barrier carnage at Euston, I got there a wee bit late but in time to deliver my pitch. A fascinating group of senior people from National museums had been assembled, and all had a keen eye on what the future may hold for their institutions.
Much of my pitch is about sustainability, but blended with a bit of futurology. The basic question is: What will museums be like in 20, 30 or 40 years time if they are truly sustainable? Will they be embedded in their communities, treading lightly on the planet and financially thriving?
In terms of the futurology slice of my pitch pie, I've leant heavily on some superb work being done by the Center for the Future of Museums in the United States. They've produced a superb paper on what 2034 might look like for the museums sector, and for the California Association of Museums they've pulled together a full 'futures' resource guide complete with five 25 year scenarios, suggested worksheets and some guidelines on how to hold a futures-focused session in your own organisation or network.
The sustainability part of my pitch however, is all the product of my own chunterings over the last couple of years. I genuinely see the world I know well (sustainability) and the world I am getting to know better (culture) as natural collaborators, if not wholly intertwined players in creating a better future. These two gorgeous worlds, bastions of progressive thinking, are of course arrayed against a third universe of infamy: the world that thinks economic growth and perpetual materialism are the only things that make life worth living.
Culture creates the places and spaces that people want to be in, fostering a more compelling and competitive identity.
Innovation must no longer be the preserve of consumerist ‘novelty’ and desire but has to become part of how we craft our collective future.
Therefore, it's clear to me, that culture can (help to) save the world. Not least because just like the sphere of creative communications (design, media, advertising, film etc) that Creative Concern operates in, culture is an antidote to the idea that it is all about selling shit to sleepwalkers. I use this quote from Raymond Williams' 1962 book, Communications:
Our commonest economic error is the assumption that production and trade are our only practical activities, and that they require no other human justification or scrutiny.
We need to say what many of us know in experience: that the life of man, and the business of society, cannot be confined to these ends; that the struggle to learn, to describe, to understand, to educate is a central and necessary part of our humanity.
I know to many, particularly in the current climate, the notion that economic growth is a futile and unsustainable pursuit probably comes across as a piece of sideshow prattling; but it is those that still pursue this ultimately self-defeating course of 'growth at all costs' that are, to use the vernacular, 'off their rockers'.

It was a busy weekend for the Creative Concern PR team. On Saturday (9th) we handled the global PR launch of a European Peace Monument gifted to Liverpool by the Global Peace Initiative (and created by artist Lauren Voiers) on what would have been John Lennon’s 70th birthday. We were commissioned by Liverpool’s Beatles Story attraction and also worked with the City, and with Liverpool One.
The event centred around the 18ft monument which was unveiled by Julian and Cynthia Lennon in the city’s deeply lovely Chavasse Park (one of my favourite bits of new green infrastructure across the region). The launch was attended by dignitaries from all over Europe and captured by the world’s media.
Unveiled live worldwide on BBC News 24 and Sky News the broadcast was syndicated nationally by CBS in the USA for live transmission on the popular ‘The Early Show’ reaching a global audience of millions. NBC in the USA, Russia’s NTV channel, Japan’s KGL, China’s CNC, Germany ZDF and Italy’s RAI attended creating packages of interviews from the live event.
In addition the story and images received blanket coverage around the world in print media from The Sunday Times and News of the World through to USA Today and the Wall Street Journal. The team here at Creative Concern also engaged directly with a global audience through social media.
I don't often do blatant trumpet blowing on this blog, but I'm dead chuffed by this one, and by the efforts of our super, fabulous and quietly dapper media team.
I've recently been called upon to explain myself. Quite right too. Embedded below is a trolley dash through the chaos that is my head. It starts with a bit about why and how we do what we do at Creative Concern, before moving onto some of our bits of work 'out there' in the real world that we love so much.
As is ever the case, it's an evolving pitch so if there are any bits that could do with improvement, please send your thoughts in now on the back of stamped addressed envelope.

I'm off to deliver a 'provocation' tomorrow morning at the annual Museums Association conference here in Manchester. My pitch – no huge surprise here - is whether museums can help chart our collective course into the future, deliver greater levels of environmental sustainability and deliver major societal change. Not asking too much there, then!
With the rest of the team at Creative Concern I've been lucky enough to work with loads of cultural organisations over the last few years, such as the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry and Renaissance Northwest. They're all amazing institutions and people, and I'm genuinely in awe of their potential to reach out and touch people, to open minds and, possibly, help us create a better world. Even in the 'Age of Austerity' there can be no other mission with such singular importance.
In putting the pitch together for tomorrow, I found myself particularly absorbed by the work of the Center for the Future of Museums in the US. They've done some great 'futurology' work recently and I think that they're a fine model to follow; the 'Tomorrow in the Golden State' report is worth reading, if you have the time.
I'm co-founder and CEO of Creative Concern. I do a lot of writing, brand-related work and help make campaigns happen for organisations working on sustainability, climate change, regeneration, culture and a whole bunch of other issues. It's not a solo effort though... I work with a talented team of 20+ people at Creative Concern and with a host of other gifted lovelies across England and the rest of the world.

The voice of the self suddenly liberated, freshly sprouted, sings mi-mi-mi, or more appropriately, me-me-me.
"Me, listen to me. Only me. I am here. Speaking to you there looking at this, reading this, listen to my voice. I am a prisoner in a human body. I am told I don't exist and the world is an illusion. But I feel things in my hands, I get hurt, I have energy, I like coffee, I fear death, I want sex, me, its me we're talking about. I get mad and have a short temper, prone to sulking, telling jokes, teasing others, who else but me? These feelings are real, right? Whew, it is good to say shit like that, to take off the robes, to own my body again. I want things, good food, comfortable bed, lots of money, dinner parties, vacations, a Buick, an ivy league education, my name in magazines and books; I own this life, I own my ambition. I can't stand it when my work doesn't sell or I don't get a show, I don't pretend, I try not to let things bother me but how can they not? Who doesn't want attention, admiration, respect, and to be wanted. I am surrounded by my life and the history of my decisions, the clothes I wear, what I do every day, what I prefer to eat, what I read, and who my friends are; they all mirror the places I've lived, the TV sitcoms I've endlessly watched, the high school, the girlfriends, and every tiny choice I ever made. It is obvious who I am, right? How could it be otherwise? This is the natural outcome! I want things, I do things, so I am clearly a person on Earth, an American, a jew, a New Yorker, a southerner, a dad, a son, a brother, a husband, a poet, a painter, a computer artist, a programmer, a driver, an eater, an animal, a mammal, a right handed person, a person who meditates, a person with a bank account, a mortgage, a credit card, a debit card, an ATM card, a train ticket, an airplane ticket, a swimming pool, a barn; I am all those, that is who I am, all those, and so many more, an endless number of subtle ways to describe me, all ending in a huge equation, an identity, an infinitely regressing series, a summation that equals me. Isn't it clear that someone lives here? Someone is talking? Someone is alive?"
And finding itself so suddenly liberated, the Ego continues on like this, in a search for itself, for many, many more hours and well into the next day.

George showed the Clippers why he deserves MVP consideration. George complete on 12 of his 17 shots, finishing with 36 points. He single handedly carried his team to victory. Lance Stephenson pitched in a near triple double but after all the cameras were on George. The Clippers had no answer for the stud. The Clippers had no spectacular play from anyone. They had solid contributions from four of the players that saw playing time. De Andre Jordan outplayed Roy Hibbert in a marque matchup between the bigs. Jordan put up big numbers, who finished with 12 points, 17 rebounds, and 2 blocks.

It was damp when I took Marble out, but no rain. Just as we got back to the house, the skies opened up making an outdoor backyard session a bit impractical.
One part of my brain was about to give into the idea of “oh well, unexpected bonus rest day” when another part of the same brain decided that a slightly modified session could be held indoors. Not sure when that part of my brain appeared – must be quite recent!
The session was pretty simple – exactly what I usually do outside only with step-ups replaced by crunches.
I have to say, I was quite pleased with myself for not giving into the temptation of skipping training…

Each Chartered Street is a critical cartography of the poetics of space. The city of Philadelphia is the source of semiotics for this collection of poetry; this book maps, imagines, builds, and evokes the city as a city in its period of time. As a speaker with the eye of a Renaissance man, Agudelo captures contemporary Philadelphia and remixes the everyday of its citizens, neighbors, commuters, students, children, and families.
In Alice Notley’s Waltzing Matilda the narrator reads a friend’s poems, contends with the ambivalences of marriage, tends to sick children, gets hammered, makes an ass of herself, worries about making an ass of herself, reads the news, frets about money.

As a kid, you might have made a new pal on the schoolyard—over a game of kickball, say, maybe even after you'd kicked someone, or they kicked you. Such are the strange shifts of human relationships. The friendship of Sarah Stickney and Diana Thow began far less traumatically, though impelled by a similar desire to connect—if not on a playground, far from their respective home turfs.
In her essay, "Translating Writing/ Writing Translation," Cole Swensen articulates the sensation of palpable contact brought about by the process of translation, "the collision of … deep structures, assumptions, and traces" that simultaneously inhabits the translator and influences the yet-to-be-written. "The foreign here is the agent that prevents stagnation."
On December 23, 2015, in San Diego, Jake Marmer interviewed David Antin and Jerome Rothenberg.

Here is Jake Marmer's introduction to the interview:
Last November they published Tom Penfold’s review of Metelerkamp’s eigth collection, Now the World Takes These Breaths, for which she was shortlisted for the Glenna Luschei prize. Penfold sees Metelerkamp as part of a group of South African writers he calls “The Poets of No Sure Place because of the apprehensive and unstable nature of their work. A diverse group, which includes poets as varied as Lesego Rampolokeng, Seitlhamo Motsapi, Angifi Dladla and Mxolisi Nyezwa, they are united in combining the public with the private; juxtaposing the regional, national and international; and in cathartically probing the often controversial nature of South African society.”
This week to follow up on my post about Kobus Moolman, winner of the Glenna Luschei prize, I’m sharing some fine posts about Moolman’s fellow finalists, Joan Metelerkamp and Togara Muzanenhamo, and about contemporary African writing more broadly.
[The recording of the deformance described in this commentary is here.] When Jed Rasula and Steve McCaffery assembled an anthology of historical avant-gardism called Imagining Language (1998), their goal was to find, “along the canonical spectrum, within the regulated normality of literature,” the various “occasional protuberances of another submerged order.” Wallace Stevens is nowhere to be found here, perhaps not surprisingly, among selections from the writings of Stein, Joyce, Whitman, Madeline Gins, Hugo Ball, Max Ernst, Lupino Lane, Armand Schwerner, Zora Neale Hurston, Marcel Duchamp, Jackson Mac Low, bp Nichol, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and others.

I am so upset about our huge annual deficits and rapidly accumulating debt that I entered the 2012 Republican Primary for Nebraska’s Second Congressional District. My platform in that contest was to “Eliminate the Deficit.” Large numbers of voters agreed with me but I still lost in the Primary.
In November 2012 I began writing a blog, “It Does Not Add Up” (http://itdoesnotaddup.com) addressing the debt problem and the related problem of slow economic growth. Now five years later, in early 2018, our debt problem is worse than ever.
The national debt, 77% of GDP (for the public part on which we pay interest), is the highest it has been since WWII, and is predicted by the Congressional Budget Office to get steadily worse without major changes in public policy. Right now our huge debt is almost “free” money because interest rates are so low. But this will change soon as the Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates to head off inflation. When this happens, interest payments on the debt will skyrocket, crowding out spending for education, medical and scientific research, infrastructure and social programs, etc. all of which enhance our quality of life.
Just a few weeks ago, in December 2017, all of the Senate Republicans, including Nebraska’s Deb Fischer, voted (with the new tax law) to increase the debt by $1 trillion over the next decade. The best features of the new tax law could have been enacted without increasing the debt. It was therefore highly irresponsible to make our debt problem worse in this way.
When elected representatives ignore their most basic responsibilities to the people, they need to be challenged in the political process. This is what I am doing. And I hope you will join and support me.

After a series of choices the small sets of instructions are saved on the computer. These are now drawing programs build to produce an image or a sequence of images. I can open such a set, change only one parameter and save it as a variation. Endlessly.
Here again, the absolute human necessity to make choices saves me from the horror of infinity. I do not much care about the reasons behind a particular choice. I try to get in a certain trance by not thinking or feeling anything in particular. Just getting lost in the pure motion of playing with colour and forms and the choices being made.

Biomel is a diary free probiotic, which promises to “Love your gut”. A proposition that we crafted for our client and which formed the springboard for a powerful creative idea.
We were keen to disrupt the category. Adding in warmth and emotion to take on the “big boys” with a new fresh, approach.
It was a true labour of love involving regular meetings in Wholefoods, at the start of the project, to finesse the proposition and adjust the pack. We collaborated closely with the client, continually testing and fine-tuning our work against the competition on shelf in real-time, to get fast actionable results.
We created a visual language designed with social media in mind, to encourage click through and purchase, helping the brand work hard on-line as well as on shelf.
The feedback has been fantastic. Biomel has achieved national listings in Sainsbury’s, WholeFoods and Planet Organic. All in the space of 6 months.
A perfect example of working with clients from start to finish and leading with a strong idea. Everything from strategy, design, copywriting, advertising and launch; even working closely with the printers and managing the selection of materials and finishes.
It’s been a fantastic project to work on - great to see this challenger taking on more established brands.
Our client had ambitious plans to design a new watch brand, from scratch, for the Global Travel Retail market.
Everything was needed: brand creation, positioning, naming, brand identity, product design, packaging, sales materials, photography, manuals, warranty cards, point of sale and web look and feel. A full brand world.
Shoreditch fit with the desire for a contemporary feel, underpinned by British craft and detailing. The district has a rich legacy in design: Clerkenwell for watchmaking, Hackney shoe-making and Brick Lane brewing. Shoreditch is where London’s history and the innovative worlds of modern art, design and technology come together.
Overseeing the whole design and branding process we liaised directly with the best watch manufacturers. Supplying them with technical drawings and pushed for the highest standards of production. Every detail of the range was designed by us right down to the union flag motif on the winding crown, the engraved Shoreditch triangle on the back and the stitch details on the straps. We managed all the prototyping and signed of production samples in collaboration with the client.
Shoreditch is not just another brand marque. It was designed in the district, under exacting standards and with a unique character to appeal to travellers world-wide.
Working with a marketing agency and Just Beauty we were asked to create a range of organic, natural, pure and ethically sourced beauty products.
Each product contains one key ingredient proven to treat specific skin problems. It was important to convey the brand was made from 100% natural and premium ingredients - a viable alternative to many mainstream brands.
Inspired by the gift of nature, our identity combines the love of natural ingredients distilled to their finest essence. For us simplicity and purity were key in creating a memorable shorthand for the brand to stand out on-shelf and on-line.
Teaming up with my brother Richard, who works out of LA with a background in the music and entertainment business, we created a brand for a new food concept.
With many family trips to Provence food has been a centrepiece of both our lives and, as sons of artists, mealtimes have always been a colourful array of local flavours and ingredients.
The mission for Entube was to help people experiment with creating delicious, healthy food and bring the beauty of colour to the table. With print and fine arts in mind, the traditional oil paint tube became an inspiration for the brand.
The Entube design reflects the craft and care of a product made from all natural ingredients. Designed to fit in Wholefoods and independent delis as well as online sales. It is an evolving design process to get the best results on shelf and on-line. A collaboration in design.
The project included brand identity, packaging design, illustration, copywriting, gifting and point of sale.
It all started on a market stall in Camden selling pancakes. The sauces were so popular that customers often asked were they could buy them, which led our client to seek our help in creating a brand.
Nojo, meaning farm in Japanese is an all natural, vegan and gluten free range of blended Japanese inspired sauces.
Primarily an identity and packaging brief we have a lot of fun collaborating with our client to create a wealth of ideas.
The end pack design being minimal required real attention to detail when going to print. We worked closely with the printers to ensure the best possible finish. After all design, like good food is an art form.
The global travel retail has boomed over the last 20 years, as travellers seek self-expression through pre-flight and onboard shopping channels.
With a legacy in global travel retail dating back to the 1990s our client continues to look for new innovations to bring to market. The key to their success is being journey-savvy. Products must be eye-catching, tap into current trends and above all be designed for quick purchase. Pick up and go, is what they do best.
Zero in on Z-Zoom, a new reading glasses collection that uses a collection of exciting frame designs to celebrate individual style and puts proper reading back into focus.
Z-Zoom, is committed to creating confidence, style and clear vision. Knowledge of the latest international eyewear trends has led to these alluring, lightweight frames that are also fashion accessories in their own right.
We were tasked with taking on board their values and creating the brand from scratch. Everything from brand positioning and naming, through to point of sale. An example of a full brand-world with a range of supporting design assets. A bold and eye-catching design with a strong and meaningful shorthand.
Founded in 1928, Colibri grew from humble origins in an East London workshop into a globally successful brand. But by the 1990s the brand’s fortunes had taken a turn. The present owners acquired the business in 2009 with the aim of recreating the brand as a holistic lifestyle business fit for the future.
Lassalle Studio was tasked with developing a new identity, range architecture, product and marketing strategy for the revamped brand, for which we brought together a cross-disciplinary team. We were moving Colibri from being an outdated lighter business to a full range accessory brand.
Our client wanted us to take care of the entire branding spectrum – managing design, creating the product itself and marketing to distributors and end customers.
We were keen to respect the brands heritage and liaised closely with the founder's family to unearth hidden secrets of the brand. Snippets of which helped us as we developed the brand story, guidelines and design philosophy – all centred on the Art Deco heritage of Colibri and its quirky Viennese founder Julius Lowenthal.
We refreshed the logo, modernising the type and simplifying the bird icon. We created copy, commissioned photography, drew up product specifications and coordinated with manufacturers in Italy, Spain and the Far East. We wrote copy, design brochures and websites. A huge undertaking across three product ranges. Done at speed and with an entrepreneurial spirit.
Not only did we created new marketing materials, we even organised and managed a whirlwind of trade shows, retail visits and distributor meetings, listening to our customers' needs and issues in the run up to our launch and adapted our marketing accordingly.
The result has been a vastly improved relationship with buyers and an ongoing partnership based on supporting their needs at retail. Sales increased by 30% in the first 2 months alone. Colibri is once again a thriving brand.
Working with 3rd generation diamond dealers from Antwerp we were briefed to create an elegant, new jewellery brand. The family has workshops in India and Spain and were keen to grow into new online markets across Western Europe.
We collaborated with internationally renowned calligrapher Peter Horridge to create a memorable identity. Threading a necklace through the O of the wordmark to create a striking monogramed M that becomes a repeat pattern across packaging.
We worked with the client and Amazon to create the brand pages, and on-line marketing collateral which has seen it succeed across France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK.
Our client is an international watch specialist. Selling and servicing rare timepieces. Inspired by motor racing and cars in general, he was keen to supply his clients with a unique courtesy watch, whilst waiting for yours to be repaired.
Together we worked on the concept. We both had a vision of creating something that reflected contemporary, cutting edge engineering. A unique replacement that you’d be proud to show off and talk about, that was credible and exclusive.
We worked on the creation of the idea, product design and manufacturer liaison through to brand identity, marketing material and photography.

This was an important post for me to write. Thanks to Scattered Thoughts and Rogue Words for the opportunity.
I’ve written a lot of blog posts to promote this book. I was happy to see Scattered Thoughts and Rogue Words offered a series of interview questions and that I wouldn’t have to think up an entire subject on my own. The interview starts with the statement “You can answer any or all of the questions.”
Quick answer: it depends. Empathy aside, a writer really has to draw on their own experiences, and if not specific experiences, then similar emotional events. Everyone has love, loss, frustration, and inspiration to draw from. A writer doesn’t need to deal with exactly…
I don’t remember exactly what year I decided to submit to Dreamspinner Press. I think it was 2009, maybe 2010. They were a newer company at the time, but I remember being impressed with the books they put out, with their editing and cover art. I wanted to work with them. I figured I’d start small, see if I was a good fit for them and vice versa. I saw they had a call out called Advent Calendar—a holiday-themed story a day in December. I thought I could try for that… and I did.
The call mentioned an openness to holiday traditions outside Christianity, and I have always tried to be different. I submitted Neskaya, a novella loosely based on Scandinavian pagan practices and beliefs. It had abortion-performing cannibalistic witches, human sacrifice, a decidedly morally ambiguous elf-like society, a twisted bargain, and odds my lovers couldn’t beat. And they didn’t. There was no way to avert the mounting tragedy and stay true to the characters and the story. So I didn’t. I ended up with something that Mary Calmes, one of the first DSP authors I met, described as “pain.” (She also said she liked it, though.)
Needless to say, that novella was not included in the Advent Calendar. But Dreasmpinner Press still wanted to publish it. Looking back, I can see how much that little book changed the course of my life. Things would be very different for me if they hadn’t decided to take a chance on me.
Since then, I’ve published… eight? Nine? I think it’s nine novels with Dreamspinner Press and their imprints, DSP Publications and Harmony Ink. It might actually be eleven. I’m hardly a celebrity and I’m not a millionaire, but I’m very proud of what I’ve put out, how much I’ve learned and grown as an artist, and the wonderful people I’ve met along the way.
It’s never been easy for me to write light, fluffy, and feel-good. But this year when the Advent Calendar call went out for Warmest Wishes, I had an idea. I’d try to write something with a happy ending. Yes, it might be weird Western/steampunky-urban fantasy/AU historical. It might even have a silver-haired Cantonese mage, a slatternly, less-than-truthful protagonist, a magical climate crisis, some observations on addiction, and a subtle theme about how we are screwing ourselves by pilfering and exploiting natural resources, but I promise it’s happy.
I started this journey as an author with an attempt at a holiday story, and now I’m continuing with a successful attempt.
But if you want to suffer read something now, take a crack at my first publication with Dreamspinner Press, here.
Happy Samhain, Halloween, or whatever name you give to the changing of the seasons. Today is the last day of our Foxtober celebration, and we’re sending it off properly. Two wonderful authors have donated their time and talent for your enjoyment in a story and a poem based on this prompt:
Once upon a time, fox shifters had magic. They were known as kitsune, powerful spirit masters with nine tails.
No longer. Bijou was a fox shifter. He had one tail, and no magic. Hell, after all the bullying at school, he had very little spirit left.
Only his best friend Remmy, who was a cat shifter, understood why he smelled scents his human classmates, neighbors, and now coworkers could not. Remmy also understood why he avoided the men who smelled like gunpowder and death. Hunters. Bijou hated them.
The stench preceded them everywhere, so Bijou felt safe in the woods. He would have plenty of time to escape before a hunter came near.
He met Remmy in the usual clearing. A redwood downed by a lightning strike lay beside its hollowed-out stump. The fallen tree left a hole in the canopy, allowing sunlight to bathe the native grasses and flowering shrubs. The sky was an autumnal shade of dark blue overhead, the shade of Remmy’s cat eyes in his calico face.
“Had to work the morning shift.” Since graduating high school, Bijou worked at the gas station on the outskirts of their rural California town, north of San Francisco.
Remmy had a point. Bijou didn’t want to waste any more time on fruitless conversations about his stupid job. He stripped out of his clothes and willed himself to change. It was easier now, easier without the fear of the first time, when his bones shrinking and popping felt like death. Now, all he had to do was focus on the pine needles and leaves beneath his human-shaped feet, and his paws transformed, taking the rest of his body with them.
“I thought I saw something up here,” Bijou heard someone say below them. His fox ears gave him better hearing than his human ears. The voice was maybe a mile away, and the person didn’t smell like a hunter. Still, Bijou remained cautious. He raced Remmy to the hollow stump of the fallen tree, where they could scamper through the gaping lightning scar and listen to the humans below without being seen.
“Not hunters,” Remmy said, confirming Bijou’s assessment. “All men, though. And one of them smells divine.”
His nostrils flared. He sniffed Remmy, and then sniffed the air. “Another cat shifter. Must be your lucky day.”
“Not just a cat,” Remmy purred, rubbing himself along Bijou’s side. “A leopard. Now I get to see if leopards really have spots everywhere.”
“Scientific purposes.” Remmy had always been better at school than Bijou, but neither of them had the money it took to go to college. At least Remmy had a family to go home to after his long days working road construction, so he could save his money for a bio-chemistry major. Bijou didn’t know what that entailed. He’d always avoided the strong stench of the chemistry lab in school.
The scent of cat on the prowl was strong, but two other strange scents permeated the woods, mingled with the smells of soap and leather. One seemed awfully familiar, almost like a fox, but Bijou couldn’t place it. The other, he feared. Wolverine.
“There’s a mean badger shifter with them,” Bijou said, using the nickname he’d given the creature with sharp teeth, claws, and attitude before he knew its true name. Bijou had gotten too close to a wolverine’s den on a winter run, deep into the woods. Wolverines were rare in northern California, and Bijou was thankful he didn’t run into them on a regular basis.
Remmy sat in one of the zags of the stump’s scar, grooming his paws. He looked down at Bijou in the center of the stump with his tongue lolling out of his mouth, paused: Remmy’s way of rolling his eyes in cat form.
Remmy stretched up the scar, extending his claws above him and raking them down the tree. “You should get cleaned up. Our new friends are almost here.”
“They’re shifters,” Remmy said, like they’d never met a shifter they didn’t like. Well, so far, that was true. Remmy was the only other shifter Bijou knew, and they were best friends.
Bijou groomed his ears and whiskers, and brushed the pine needles from his tail. Cursory grooming would have to do.
“Hello, friends!” one of the shifters called. He had an interesting accent, one Bijou couldn’t place. “I know you’re here somewhere. We are just passing through, and need a good run in your forest before we get on another plane.”
Remmy jumped out of the tree stump and landed with a hollow thunk on the fallen tree below. Remmy’s jumps were usually silent, so this was to grab attention. Bijou scrambled up to the scar so he could see, and intervene, if necessary.
Remmy leapt down and pranced to a man in a white shirt, staring up into the redwood canopy. The man was shorter than his friends and smelled like a cat to Bijou. The man had an attractive face, accentuated by light green eyes.
Bijou watched with interest as the three stripped out of their clothes. The wolverine was the most sensibly dressed for Northern California, with long sleeves for an autumn evening in the desert. The one with the walking stick, with the familiar scent, had a tattoo of a fan on his back, the base of which looked like a tramp stamp, but the blades of the fan stretched up to his shoulders. The nine blades resembled fluffy tails. Fox tails.
The wolverine shifter changed first, dropping to all fours. The white V in his hair framed his pointed, bear-like face. The claws, though. Bijou couldn’t get over the long, sharp claws now protruding from the wolverine’s paws. He also respected the powerful jaws beneath the adorable little bear face.
Remmy’s leopard kept his green eyes when he shifted. His black coat still showed the beautiful leopard spots Remmy wanted to count. For Science.
Last, the man with the fan tattoo shifted, dropping to all fours as the ink took on a life of its own. The silvery, white gleam of tails separated and danced above the back of a silver-colored creature the likes of which Bijou had never seen. As Bijou studied the creature, he realized he was rudely staring at his backside. Worse, the creature caught him staring. In two bounds, the creature with nine silver tails was on top of the fallen tree, and then inside the hollowed-out trunk, face to face with Bijou.
“Hi.” He was the one with the strange accent, the one who’d spoken of running through the forest before getting on a plane. Bijou knew he shouldn’t respond to the urge to reach out and touch noses with the beautiful silver fox with nine tails, but he couldn’t resist.
“Hi,” he said. The other fox’s nose was cold and wet. Bijou didn’t know what to do when he twisted his snout and left a scent imprint on Bijou’s jaw.
“You have forgotten,” Ken said under his breath. Louder, he said, “I need exercise and water, and some fun before we fly back to Japan. Do you live in these woods?”
Bijou nodded. Too many times of late, the hollowed-out trunk had been his home. He wanted to ask questions, to get to know Ken better, but he was too dumbstruck by the world traveler. Even so, Ken reminded him of home, a home he’d never had.
Instead, Bijou ran. Ken followed. Their fox feet carried them out of the hollow trunk, over the downed tree, and off through the woods toward the stream.
At one point, Bijou smelled a squirrel. Normally, he would chase his prey, but today he was more focused on the joy of running with another fox. Ken followed his every move, even the practiced jumps from tree trunk to tree trunk and over fallen trees and tangled roots.
They arrived at the mountain stream, panting from exertion. Ken drank first, lapping at the fast-moving water as it rushed past the bank. Bijou dared to jump onto a slippery rock in the middle of the stream, where a pool of cool water stayed still long enough for him to enjoy his drink. There was barely enough room for two foxes on the rock, but Ken joined Bijou, his tails giving him uncanny balance. Ken took another drink, watching Bijou as his tongue lapped the water.
A home. A new, exciting friend. A possibility to be something more. As tempting as it was, Bijou liked his woods, and he would miss Remmy.
Ken laughed. “I have a pass for a therapy animal. You can be my therapy fox. Most humans will think you’re a dog, anyway.”
Bijou frowned. He hated when people assumed he was a dog. And he’d be seen by many people on a journey to Japan. Too many people.
“It’s okay,” Ken said. “You don’t have to decide now. We come back to San Francisco several times a year, and these woods, though dry, were too beautiful to ignore. We will meet again, little one.”
“Kenshin means truth,” Ken continued. “Kitsune value words as oaths. My parents chose my name with care. My older brother is a liar and a trickster. You have probably heard the stories. Kitsune is synonymous with trickster in Japan.”
“I will not bother you with my troubles. They are unimportant,” Ken said. “We should return to our clothes.”
They ran, slower this time. Bijou had a lot on his mind, and Ken seemed saddened by Bijou’s indecision. Ken’s tails dipped as they stepped into the sunlight. He seemed to carry an increasingly heavier burden with each step toward his clothes.
“Finally,” Remmy said, his ears pricked up with excitement as he ran to rub himself along Bijou’s side. “I have great news! Theo is taking me to Japan.”
“What?” Bijou couldn’t hide his surprise. He’d wanted to discuss Japan with Remmy before making a decision, and now Remmy was leaving him. Remmy, his only friend in the entire world. “What about college?”
Remmy sighed. “Even if I could afford it, who says I’ll get in? At least this way, I’ll get to see the world.”
“I have time to say goodbye, Theo promised.” The leopard nodded from his spot in the sun, by the stump. “I’m just a burden to them, anyway. This will be better, you’ll see.” Remmy rubbed along Bijou’s side once more, before returning to Theo. “You’re coming with us, right?”
“College?” The wolverine said, still stuck on Bijou’s previous question. “They are too young,” he said. “Too young to be caught up in our war with the tricksters.”
“They are tricksters, not soldiers,” Theo the leopard said. “Once we teach our new friends some magic, they will be able to defend themselves.”
“War?” Bijou asked again, turning to Ken, who had shifted back into his human form and now stood, fully clothed, leaning on his walking stick. Ken shrugged and pointed to his human ear. He could no longer understand Bijou’s fox words.
Bijou hopped onto the fallen log and changed into human form. The need for conversation won out over his modesty. “What does he mean, war?”
“If you join us, you may be caught in the war with my brother,” Ken explained. “It will be dangerous, but it would be worth it if you could fully shift into a kitsune after meeting with the masters of the forest.”
Ken sighed. “I come here every year, looking for my promised mate. You are the first fox shifter I’ve ever seen in this part of the world. I hoped it would be you.”
Bijou didn’t know how to feel about that. Ken smelled familiar, like home, but not like Remmy’s claim that Theo smelled “divine.” He also didn’t know of anything worth war with supernatural beings in a foreign country.
“Why did you stop in these woods?” Bijou asked, suspicion making his spine tingle, even in human form.
“We smelled shifters in town, and followed you from the gas station,” the wolverine, now in human form, shared. Remmy and Theo shifted, too, still entwined with each other as they leaned against the hollow tree trunk.
Bijou nodded. Remmy would be at home in Japan, or anywhere, for that matter. Bijou had no home, not in rural California, where he’d lived all his life.
“Come with us,” Ken said, sitting down beside Bijou on the fallen log. “It’s a long flight, but the woods are lush and beautiful, and the masters of the forest will guide you home, to your true self.” Ken’s eyes never left Bijou’s as he caressed his back with firm, soothing strokes.

Chances were Masao wouldn’t be able to face the humans again. Their prayers would be answered. He had been sent by the gods after all. But Masao had no intention of resolving the villagers pleas in the way they expected him too. His disgust and loathing of the humans cowardly actions made it hard to look at them. They had caused enough pain and misery for several lifetimes, would be paying for their actions for generations. Their false pleas now fell upon Masao’s deaf ears.
It didn’t matter Inari sent him to save the villagers. They had brought their plight upon themselves. They had broken sacred trusts then came running back to the gods because it suited their needs. No, Masao couldn’t face the humans any more.
Not because he was scared of them and how they might take their anger out on him for not complying to their wishes. No. He was stronger, faster, had magic and Inari on his side—probably. Masao felt confident his god would understand once the whole story came out. No, Masao couldn’t face them because he saw the furs the villagers used. Had heard their glorified tales of their triumphant hunt of the okami in the mountains. Felt the fury grow as they sung and boosted about the heavy furs they’d skinned off the okami. Tasted and smelled the wolves’ blood when he checked their empty den—the place where the pack had been slaughtered.
Except for ‘the Terror.’ The abomination, the yōkai, the reason the villages prayed and bowed before Inari and Masao had been sent to the remote mountain village.
Their mistake. Their doom, really. They had been so sure, so confident they had gotten all the wicked okami.
But no, their over-confident boasting and offers to Inari turned into prayers and pleas rather quickly once the spring thaw set in and trade opened back up.
For the okami the humans had missed also happened to be the strongest male of the pack. Physically powerful. Angry. Strong spiritual powers. And the the young kit wasn’t just some kind of ordinary okami either.
No, the ignorant humans ambushed and killed a pack of okuri-okami. A foolish, arrogant action lead by the head villager’s son. A weak and fool hearty decision because they had turned on the very thing that had kept them prosperous for so long. The okuri—protectors of the good and hunters of those with an evil of heart who traveled through the mountains. Generations from the destroyed pack had watched over the village, keeping the humans safe from bandits and other men who would do evil.
“Abe-sama?” village head said quietly, and yes when Masao checked, still in seiza. “Have we displeased you?”
More than you could know. Masao refused to turn around. Not even the enticing smells of niku tofu or hiyayakko would persuade his thinking. The kit deserved to parse out vengeance he brought down upon the village.
Why hadn’t Inari sent one of the Mizunos? That little clan of kitsunes were far better at dealing with humans than Masao, especially since they chose to live among the ridiculous humans. Hadn’t their oldest son taken a human lover recently?
Masao sighed. His ears swiveled back and forth as he listened to the murmur of concern running through the crowd. Inari should abandon this village if they were going to speak with such hush-toned of disrespect. A low growl vibrated his chest. Masao flicked out his tails. All nine of them trembling with anger.
“Abe-sama—Kitsune—Messenger of the gods. Our savior.” The village head’s voice sounded lower than before. Masao flicked his ear back, and he turned his head briefly to catch a glimpse of the human bowing over, hands out in front of him. “Please save my people from this yōkai who hunts us.”
Masao weaved through the villagers, out of the temple. A stunned silence followed him. None of the villagers tried to stop him. No one reached for him and begged for his help. He never once looked down. Masao didn’t even want to remember their faces let alone see what they felt now.
Never had he been so angry. It had been decades since he cared enough to hold this kind of fury within himself. But the absolute lack of remorse, the almost pure giddiness, the villagers had about their slaughter resonated Masao’s very bones.
The blood spilled in the den would stain the mountains for centuries to come. What kind of bad spirits
The young okami would end up being hunted if he was not stopped, and Masao found he cared about whether the wounded yōkai survived. It had been so long since he cared for anything. Why did it matter? What was this need to find the young kit and save him?
Trekking up the mountain pass took up hours, leaving Masao to wonder why he was so obsessed with what had taken place in the village. It also gave him time to wonder why he was sent instead of one of the Mizunos. Why had Inari agreed the villager’s request to begin with? The humans had obviously crossed a line and did not need saving. But then again, Inari’s tasks were never so straightforward. Masao had to be missing something important.
When the smell of old blood hit Masao’s nose he wrinkled it, sneezing at the fowl odor. The bodies might have been taken and desiccated by the village, but the blood would remember. Pain lived between the rocks now.
Masao lifted his head and breathed in. Underneath the smells of trees, dirt mixed with dried blood, and wind, another weaker scent floated in the air.
The young kit might have been driven out of his den, but that did not mean he abandoned his ancestral home. Masao debated on how he should sniff out and great the young kit. While he most certainly didn’t smell human, looking like one could provoke an attack Masao didn’t want. Then again, meeting the okami with his beast might cause other issues.
But his human appearance would leave him vulnerable if the kit somehow managed the upper hand in an attack.
A large bolder stood in the small clearing in front of the den. Seemed like a good as place as any. He tossed his kinchaku on top before kicking off his geta. The tabi went next. Masao unwrapped his obi and folded it neatly before placing it on the rock. Then he untied his koshi-himo and Masao’s yukata fell open, exposing him to the cooling night air. Before long it would be too cold to stay exposed to the elements. Masao pooled the sash on top of the obi before disrobing. A nip in the mountain wind caused a shiver to run through Masao. He quickly folded his yukata and placed it with with the rest of his belongings. After one quick deep breath in Masao stripped off his nagajuban.
Masao threw the nagajuban in the direction of the boulder, not caring if it made it. He was too focused on becoming his beast.
Fur rippled across Masao’s arms as his claws and fangs punched through his fingertips and gums. Masao fell forward, catching himself on his paws. A shudder wracked his boys as bones reformed themselves into a fox shape. This part never got easier, especially with age. Joints and tendons protested the change in form.
But now Masao wasn’t cold. Sounds and scents were louder, more pronounced in his beast as well. His kitsune nearly bounced in anticipation for being let out after so long. Masao shook out his legs and tails, swung his muzzle back and forth a few times to get teh crick out of his neck, then decided a good stretch was in order.
Those muscles feel new. They weren’t. Masao just hadn’t used them in… a long time. When was the last time he let his beast take over?
The okami’s scent came from higher up the the rocks. A little north and east of Masao’s current position.
Masao backed up then ran forward a few steps. He leaped onto a small ledge close to the mouth of the den. Lots of smells were on the spot, from many different okami. They’d probably taken turns watching for enemies and signs of trouble. It gave a decent view of the village.
Not far from the small ledge was another one, then one after that. Masao jumped from one outcropping to the next, following them up the mountain. By the time he reached the top he’d seen the path from multiple angles, a stream, the village from a few different vantage points, and several smaller dens.
Agitation swarmed Masao like a bunch angry hornets. His tails flicked to and fro, waving about wildly.
Each leap brought a stronger scent of okami. It rattled Masao’s beast, they were the smaller, weaker predator compared to the wolves. But Masao was older, bigger, stronger than most kitsune. Maybe that was why Inari sent him and not one of the Mizunos?
At the end of the ledges, another rock den was hidden away in the mountainside. It overlooked the mountain pass and the village, everything really. It was also close to the roughest terrain of the pass.
Beside the acrid scent of pain, there were smells of death and decay. Masao nearly tripped over his paws thinking he’d gotten to the young kit too late when a loud growl echoed out from the den.
With a growl of his own, Masao entered the den. A howl, angry and furious, met with his intrusion. Thrown into the abnormal blackness, Masao pushed against it with his light using a twig he stepped on. He filled the cave with his light, bright and sharp like the sun.
Masao pressed his light up against it, hammering at the darkness swallowing up the okami. The howl from the corner grew, loud, frightening, a clear warning to stay away. But Masao wouldn’t leave the kit here. The villager’s fear was already simmering into anger, and those kind of resentments meant they’d be willing to take risks soon.
Each step brought Masao closer to the shadows, and with each of those steps the pressure increased, pushing him away. While the force was powered by the okami’s anger, it would only last so long against Masao’s light. He was older, stronger, and just as determined as the young kit, though only Inari seemed to be in on that secret.
The shadows splintered, reveling a bone-thin wolf in its place. Where once full, thick, glossy black fur should have been, dull patches covered the young male. Each of his breaths came out in a rasp, his chest rising and lowering with effort. He could barely hold up his head, and he had curled his body around something.
Masao breathed in. That something smelled like death. He pushed forward. The okami stood up, wobbling as he did, and revealed the bodies of two small kits. Neither of the wolves could’ve been more than a couple years old.
The okami howled in response, firmly planting his paws on either side of the kits. The stance was rigid and—protective? Yes, yes he was. The young okami was protecting the long dead kits.
“I am no nekomata, okami. Death is not coming for you.” Though he almost wished he was. Masao understood the pained cries from the okami. Over the decades and centuries Masao’s family had dwindled to only him. Lovers, parents, brothers, sisters, his children—all of them gone. Death, fading away, illness, all of them gone—leaving Masao alone in a world he no longer understood.
That’s why you sent me. Isn’t it, Inari? Though his god’s sense of humor certainly left something to be desired. The villagers had demanded retribution. The god gave Masao and the okami a new family.
Because I understand. I know what it’s like to be the only one left. He’d never seen a fox and a wolf make a family before, but the world was a strange place.
The kit lunged toward him, his jaws snapping. His teeth sunk into Masao’s foreleg. Not far, and there was a real lack of power behind it. Poor kit had almost starved himself to death over the winter.
Masao shook off his foundling and leaned down. The poor okami had no strength to fight him. He licked the kit’s muzzle, earning him a growl. It lacked conviction. He continued to groom the kit until the young male stopped wriggling.
“I can’t give you death, okami, but I can give you new light,” Masao growled out. He curled his larger body around the kit. They’d deal with everything in the morning. One step at a time. But for right now, they both needed some sleep. “Lay your head down. No one will come for you with me here. I am your pack now.”

Determining the value of an estate is a fundamental first step in estate management and a critical requirement for settling a decedent’s estate.¹
Select the date of calculation. Because values move up and down, you need to set a specific date for a valuation. For a living person, you are free to pick any date. If you’re assessing the value of a decedent’s estate, you may choose either the date of death, or the date six months after death (the “alternate valuation date”). If you use the alternate valuation date, any asset sold or distributed during the first six months following the death must be valued as of the date of sale or distribution.²
Determine the assets comprising the estate. This asset list should include everything an individual owns or has ownership interests in.
Gather all financial statements as of the date of calculation. If an account is owned individually, the entire value should be calculated in the estate. If owned jointly with a spouse with rights of survivorship, then 50 percent of the value should be included. Remember to;
Include life insurance when the policy owner is the deceased individual or the beneficiary is the decedent’s estate.³
Calculate deductions. Subtract any debts from the total value of assets. For the decedent this may also include any regular bills that may be due (e.g., utilities, medical expenses, etc.), charitable gifts, and state tax obligations.
Assessing the precise value of an estate can be complicated, especially when settling an estate. Please consult a professional with estate expertise regarding your individual situation.
The information in this material is not intended as tax or legal advice. It may not be used for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties. Please consult legal or tax professionals for specific information regarding your individual situation.
The article assumes the deceased has a valid will and has named an executor who is responsible for carrying out the directions of the will. If a person dies intestate, it means that a valid will has not been executed. Without a valid will, a person’s property will be distributed to the heirs as defined by the state law.
Several factors will affect the cost and availability of life insurance, including age, health, and the type and amount of insurance purchased. Life insurance policies have expenses, including mortality and other charges. If a policy is surrendered prematurely, the policyholder also may pay surrender charges and have income tax implications. You should consider determining whether you are insurable before implementing a strategy involving life insurance. Any guarantees associated with a policy are dependent on the ability of the issuing insurance company to continue making claim payments.

Cattlemen saw a lot of progress on rolling back regulations under the Trump administration, and work continues to rein in more restrictive requirements.
Colin Woodall, NCBA vice president of government affairs, says the industry has made progress on several important issues but still has work to do on others.
It was a busy year for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, working with the Trump administration and Congress to further the interest of cattle producers.
It’s been “a year that’s provided a lot of opportunity for us, a significant number of wins, but at the same time many challenges we’ve had to think through and will continue to think through,” Colin Woodall, NCBA senior vice president of government affairs, said during a year-end webinar.
Those wins include gaining access for U.S. beef into China, relief from some onerous regulations and progress on still other unresolved issues, he and other staff members said.
“One of the bright spots in our relationship with the Trump administration has been our improved relationship with Environmental Protection Agency. For the first time in many years and spanning several different administrations, we find ourselves with an opportunity to work with the (Environmental Protection Agency) rather than just always working against the EPA,” Woodall said.
Scott Yager, NCBA environmental counsel, said the cattle industry has a lot to be happy about with the administration’s position on environmental issues.
Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, “is all about getting industry stakeholders in the room and hearing their perspective on issues,” he said.
Nowhere has that been clearer than with the Waters of the United States rule, which went way beyond federal jurisdiction in claiming water and land features for regulation. The rule is now on the path to repeal, he said.
The next step will be a new WOTUS definition, and NCBA has been fully involved in the effort to develop replacement language, he said.
“Keep in mind there has to be a jurisdictional limit on where the Clean Water Act applies,” he said.
NCBA also scored a win in getting the Bureau of Land Management’s Planning 2.0 rule repealed using the Congressional Review Act.
The rule would have radically changed the way BLM does its land use planning, removing local input from the process, said Ethan Lane, executive director of the Public Lands Council and NCBA federal lands.
Efforts to prevent BLM from curtailing grazing in its land use planning amendments for greater sage grouse have also paid off, with both BLM and the Forest Service working on new planning processes, he said.
There’s also been progress on fighting the abuses of the Antiquities Act, with President Trump reducing national monuments by 2 million acres thus far. Those monuments reduce grazing and destroy local economies, and more designation reductions and restrictions are expected, he said.
NCBA and PLC will continue to focus on changing the way the Antiquities Act works to prevent future designations without local input, he said.
There is also good movement on comprehensive modernization of the Endangered Species Act. NCBA and PLC have been working with the Western Governors’ Association, which has developed bipartisan recommendations to reform ESA and there’s positive feedback on the recommendations from Congress, he said.
Other wins in 2017 include securing a 90-day waiver from the Department of Transportation on electronic log devices for livestock haulers, an issue NCBA will continue to pursue.
NCBA was also successful in delaying a court order requiring agricultural producers to report air emissions from manure and continues to work on a legislative fix. It is also working on legislation to protect agriculture operations from lawsuits under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

The Covered California board approved the price caps on specialty prescription drugs today. Monthly caps will range from $150 to $500 per prescription. Most Covered California consumers will have a cap of $250 a month.
Executive Director Peter Lee says Covered California is the first health exchange in the nation to adopt specialty drug caps.
"We believe these recommended policies strike the right balance between our insuring that Covered California consumers get the medications the need and keeping premiums affordable for all," he says.
Health care advocates at the meeting generally welcomed the caps. But some suggested the upper limit of $500 might be too high.
Board member Marty Morgenstern voted for the caps. But he says pharmaceutical companies are demanding too much for their drugs.
"There’s no basis for the charges that they have for those drugs or other drugs. They charge what the market will bear," he says. "They charge irrational prices on specialty drugs and on all drugs as a matter of fact."
A representative of the Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America says agencies like Medi-Cal and health plans in the state regularly negotiate the price of drugs.
Well it isn't Friday, if I'm not getting up fairly early and heading to my Sanibel-Captiva Rotary Club meeting. Believe it or not, I enjoy every meeting because we have some great speakers on a variety of topics that it makes you think about how dedicated and passionate many of our fellow Lee County residents are in serving our community. We hear about a wide spectrum of non-profit organizations and activities all worthy of respect and attention for the work of their remarkable professional staffs and for their amazing volunteers, who give their time and effort to causes that are so important to the quality of life for all beings living here in our community.
On April 6, our guest speaker was Kathy Rotterdale, a volunteer with the Animal Refuge Center in North Fort Myers. Rotterdale's love for animals drew her to ARC and she has since become an active board member.
ARC began as a hope for an alternative to euthanasia to deal with the problems of unwanted healthy animals and advocate the prevention of cruelty to animals. Incorporated in 1988, it is a not-for-profit animal welfare society, dedicated to caring for all homeless animals brought to its care at its 22 acre sanctuary. The sanctuary is home to more than 400 cats and 75 dogs. ARC receives dogs and cats from other animal shelters in the county that have not been adopted and cannot be held at the facilities any longer. ARC also receives surrendered animals whose families cannot take care of them any longer.
On April 6, the Sanibel-Captiva Rotary Club's guest speaker was Kathy Rotterdale, a volunteer with the Animal Refuge Center in North Fort Myers.
Animals that are placed with ARC go through a 10-day quarantine and evaluation period. Medical treatment, socialization and behavioral training, and basic obedience is available for all the canines providing an attractive attribute for those who wish to adopt a pet from the rescue center.
Donations, fundraisers and grants help pay the mortgage and maintain the property, pay a small staff including a medical staff, house and feed the animals, provide medical treatment, and train canines with the hopeful end result being that the rescue animals are adopted and find forever loving homes with qualified individuals. Rotterdale mentioned that Sanibel and Captiva residents and businesses lead the way in donations to ARC; one donor from the islands funded the recent construction of a welcome and adoption center.
The love and attention the animals receive at ARC is outstanding. Volunteers are essential to ARC's success. ARC has cared for and found homes for thousands of animals over the past 20-plus years.
Presently, there are 10 main buildings housing felines: The Gable Village, The Ekstrom Cottage, The Harley House, The Mary Williams Kitten Cottage, The Casa Marie, The Casa Luis, the Dixie D, Aeries Place, Maises Place and Beesley's Hide Away. In addition, there are five small cottages where cats are often placed for their introductory period.
The Krieger Canine Village, McAllister Park and ARC Park are composed of 39 air-conditioned dog lodges for anywhere from one to two dogs to reside. A doggy door allows them to go in and out of their lodge at will into their own play yard that has an awning for shade and a child's pool for wading. There is also a 2 acre fenced-in park for the dogs, where they can run and exercise, along with an indoor canine training center.
The dog and cat residents at ARC like it there, but they would like to find that special home that is meant for only them. "Life is as dear to a mute creature as it is to man. Just as one wants happiness and fears pain, just as one wants to live and not die, so do other creatures." - Dalai Lama
If you are thinking about getting a new pet, why not check out ARC's campus in North Fort Myers after all, it has somewhere around 300-plus cats and 75-plus dogs to choose from.
For information about the Sanibel-Captiva Rotary Club, visit sanibelrotary.org or www.facebook.com/sancaprotary. The club meets every Friday at 7 a.m. at the Dunes Golf and Tennis Club, at 949 Sand Castle Road, Sanibel; visitors are always welcome to attend.

GASLIGHT GROTESQUE: NIGHTMARE TALES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES has been reviewed by Mario Guslandi as a featured review on SF Site
"Following in the steps of the previous volume, Gaslight Grimoire, the new Sherlockian anthology edited by J.R. Campbell and Charles Prepolec explores again the unpredictable effects of the encounter of Holmes' rational mind with the supernatural. Although I enjoyed many stories from the first volume, I had my reservations about the book because of the inclusion, besides a few excellent tales, of some mediocre material.
I'm happy to say that the present anthology is definitely of superior quality and that the large majority of the thirteen stories assembled therein are accomplished examples of dark fantasy, apt to satisfy even the more demanding readers, either Sherlockian enthusiasts or horror fans or just fiction lovers seeking out entertaining and well written stories.

Rabbi David Baron of Temple of the Arts learned the hard way the lesson of discussing politics on the High Holy Days.
Years ago, before the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, Baron invited Larry Greenfield, a future California director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, and David Sadkin, senior counsel to Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman, to participate in a community discussion on Yom Kippur afternoon about why they supported their respective party’s candidate.
The speakers, he said, “were gentlemen, but their supporters were yelling epithets. It was totally contrarian to the spirit of Yom Kippur. The fangs were out. I said I would never do anything like this again.”
This year, as the Jewish community is consumed with events unfolding in the U.S. and beyond, rabbis are considering how to acknowledge those events during a sacred holiday period otherwise focused on personal introspection and renewal.
There is no rabbinical consensus on this topic — for the High Holy Days or any other time of the Jewish year — as evidenced by a debate over politics on the pulpit that unfolded in the Journal this summer after Sinai Temple Rabbi David Wolpe wrote an essay denouncing how “the litmus test for religious legitimacy has become political opinion.” A colleague, Rabbi Noah Farkas of Valley Beth Shalom, disputed Wolpe’s view, saying it is incumbent on clergy to provide guidance on the “urgent issues our communities, our nation, Israel and the world face today.”
These same choices face rabbis as the Jewish year 5778 approaches and the churn of disruptive events continues to occupy daily thoughts and conversations.
Stephen Wise Senior Rabbi Yoshi Zweiback told the Journal that while he does not want to preach politics from the bimah, he will strive to follow the advice from his temple’s founder, Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin, in delivering High Holy Days sermons that are timeless and timely.
One of several rabbis who said he will acknowledge the challenging times while refraining from expressing a political viewpoint, Zweiback said he intends to discuss how Judaism — specifically, engagement with the religion, its traditions and values — helps make a person better equipped to handle what’s happening in the world.
“I will touch on what Judaism and what the Jewish community teaches us about how we can disagree but still be in community with each other; how Judaism teaches us about compassion for the other at a time when we see Klansmen protesting in the streets and Dreamers wondering what their status will be in the next few months,” he said in a phone interview. “In that sense, it can be timely without being partisan.”
Taking an alternative approach, Rabbi Sarah Bassin of Temple Emanuel of Beverly Hills plans to address politics and call her synagogue to action. Her Rosh Hashanah sermon, “Un-Fracturing,” conveys how stunned she felt this year as anti-Semitism spiked; when an LGBT rally in Chicago kicked out three women for carrying gay pride flags with Stars of David on them; when death threats targeted Jewish journalists in unprecedented numbers; and when Nazis marched in Charlottesville chanting, “Jews will not replace us.”
Though it is in the DNA of the Jewish people to worry for the future, Bassin will preach that the way to counter darkness is with light.
“It’s not preaching politics, but it is very much about how do I engage in the public sphere right now,” she said. “I have had a couple of congregants across the political spectrum review it just to get their thoughts and input, both from the left and the right, and I’ve made a few tweaks. I want people across the spectrum to be able to hear it. It’s not my intention to offend or be off-putting, but to give people a positive message.”
Her sermon draws on a theme selected by Temple Emanuel synagogue clergy that will tie together all of their sermons. This year, the theme is from Pirkei Avot, or “Ethics of the Fathers,” teaching that “In a place where nobody is acting human, strive to be more human.”
“I kind of feel the synagogue is a place to get away from that,” he said, adding that he supports Bassin’s decision to address controversial issues.
Rabbi Jonathan Jaffe Bernhard of the Conservative synagogue Adat Ari El in Valley Village said his sermon will draw inspiration from an August New Yorker article headlined “Is America Headed for a New Kind of Civil War?” He plans to talk about the polarization in the country, which he described as a “low-level civil war, with occasional bursts of violence,” and “what I think religious people, and therefore Jews, can do to address that situation.”
The rabbi doesn’t want his politics to turn off people, but he feels the need to be true to his convictions.
“There is a responsibility on the part of clergy to be thoughtful about what they are speaking about while also taking stands and putting themselves out there and sharing a point of view and not just being totally pareve,” he said, referring to food that can be eaten with meat or dairy dishes in accordance with kosher laws.
Like Bassin, Rabbi Denise Eger of Congregation Kol Ami in West Hollywood said she will discuss what is going on in the world in a way she feels is apolitical.
“I will address a bit of what happened in Charlottesville on erev Rosh Hashanah because I think it is on everyone’s mind, but it is not the main focus. It is: What do we have to do Jewishly at this season and within ourselves to overcome the hatred and the bigotry and the racism that’s become so openly present,” she said. “That’s not a political message.”
Senior Rabbi John Rosove of Temple Israel of Hollywood plans to deliver a Kol Nidre sermon he described as “political, but in a very high-minded sense.” He said he plans to focus on how Western liberalism — not liberalism in the political sense — appeals to the impulses of the Jewish people.
“I try to give people faith and hope and renewal about what is important to us as Americans,” he said.
His colleague, Rabbi Jocee Hudson, will address issues of racial justice and intersectionality — the concept that people of different minority groups have a shared struggle. Speaking to concerns of activists of the millennial generation, she, like Bassin, plans to call on the community to become involved, “to engage in justice work, and to do it as members of an organized Jewish community, not just as individuals who happen to be Jewish.”
Wilshire Boulevard Temple Rabbi Steven Leder’s approach falls closely in line with Wolpe’s and Zweiback’s. His goal in delivering a sermon, he said, is to provide a timeless and timely message, but being timely doesn’t have to mean a discussion of current events. He believes his congregants want something more.
“My general approach to preaching, and in particular on the High Holy Days, is to create insights for people to transcend the news of the day that are both deeper and more transcendent, because the news of the day on any given day fits into a much broader picture,” he said.
On Rosh Hashanah, Leder said, he will examine the art of letting go, going beyond what he called “the kabuki of change” — earnestly compiling, but not acting upon, intentions to do better in the new year — to actually work at achieving personal and societal transformation. On Yom Kippur, drawing on what he has experienced in his 57 years of living and his 30 years serving Wilshire Boulevard Temple, Leder plans to talk about death — a central theme of the day.
He will offer 10 lessons he has learned over the past three decades, a time during which he has seen approximately 700 corpses. What could be morbid, he explained, will be a plea to live life to the fullest.
“The rabbi does not write your eulogy after you die,” he will say in the sermon. “You write it with the pen of your life.”
The sermon will touch on larger themes, he said, and won’t mention Charlottesville, hurricanes or DACA.
“You’re dealing with something that transcends the headlines,” Leder said. “Not that the headlines are absent, but they ought to be illustrations for something more important on the holidays.”
Rabbi Yonah Bookstein of the Orthodox, young adults-oriented synagogue Pico Shul, said he plans to leave politics out of the discussion when he delivers sermons on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
“I am working hard on increasing people’s sensitivity to others and inspiring people to deepen and maximize their Jewish experience,” he said. “That is my goal.”
Rabbi Elazar Muskin, senior rabbi of Young Israel of Century City and president of the Rabbinical Council of America, an Orthodox membership organization, has had a policy for more than 35 years of separating politics from the pulpit. This year, he said, he will discuss faith in God and the importance of family, topics he insisted are relevant and appropriate for the bimah.
“In my experiences, every rabbi who speaks about politics ends up in trouble because he will alienate his congregation and he isn’t doing what he is supposed to do,” he said. “A rabbi is supposed to teach you.”
Baron, of Temple of the Arts, said he will talk about the hurricanes in Texas and Florida and the fires in California, despite his weariness of politics during the Holy Days.
“I wasn’t going to talk about hurricanes and the impact on our lives, but the words [from the High Holy Day poem, ‘Unetanah Tokef’] never rang more true: ‘Who by fire and who by flood,’ ” he said. “The Western part of the country is burning up, and the East Coast is flooding out. Human frailty to violence in nature is something I think we talk about on the chaggim [holidays]. It’s one of the central prayers.”
“It’s a minefield, because I guess the level of discourse has so degenerated,” Baron said. “It’s something we get too much of all year long. The holiday needs to be an alternative to that. It needs to be an alternative universe to the one we inhabit.
“This is about our inner journey. The trial-and-error of politics is not worth getting into, unless it is something that is so core, so vital to the survival of our Judaism, of American Judaism in general.”

New research published today shows an 18 year life expectancy gap between the richer parts and the poorer parts of the city of Sheffield in the North of England.........
As Justin Webb on BBC Radio 4's Today program said this morning at 8-50 "thats extraordinary" ........ just as I was thinking the same thing..........
Professor Danny Dorling of Sheffield University who lead the research team claimed his figures showed increasing polarization in the city neighborhoods ......... in the 1960's the life expectancy for those living in the whole of Yorkshire was pretty well the same.......
Now you are 30% more likely to die before the age of 60 if you live in a poor area of the city than if you live in rural Yorkshire or one of the smarter areas of the city of Sheffield. The richer neighborhoods have showed the highest increase in life expectancy since the 60's while the poorer areas of population have shown much smaller increase in life expectancy ........... Depressing stuff.
Last time I was in Sheffield I shot this above image......... of joyriders........ youngsters who steal and drive cars recklessly for thrills ........ often burning them after the crazy ride is over........
More depressing research from back when I shot this...... 10 years back .......... This particular poor area of Sheffield was said at the time to be statistically the worst place in Europe to park your car.

BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, August 31, 2007 – The 6th tropical depression of the season formed Friday evening close to the southern Windward Islands where tropical storm warnings were issued for some which are under threat.
Grenada and the southern Grenadines seem as the immediate targets of what could be Tropical Storm Felix on Saturday.
The centre is forecast to pass about 12 miles south of the Grenadine islands of Petite St Vincent, Union Island, Mayreau, and Palm Island – the site of a multi-million dollar upscale residential resort by the family of former prime minister of St Vincent, Sir James Mitchell.
A tropical storm warning was in effect for St Vincent and the Grenadines, Tobago, and Grenada for the low latitude cyclone while watches were posted for some territories further south. These were: Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao and sections of Venezuela – from Cumana to Perdernales on the north coast and the island of Margarita just north of Venezuela.
The National Hurricane Centre said that low wind shear and warm Caribbean Sea water provide the right ingredients for slow intensification however large scale computer models are not very excited about this system. These models do not envisage that the depression would actual become a tropical storm and would die a natural death sooner rather than later.
Nevertheless, based on various intensity models, the centre is forecasting that this depression will become Tropical Storm Felix on Saturday and a category one hurricane by mid-next week.
Unlike 2004 when Hurricane Ivan passed south of Grenada, this system is forecast to pass just north and possibly over or close to the southern Grenadine islands.
The strongest winds are in the northeast quadrant of cyclones in the northern hemisphere and this means that the southern Grenadine islands will bear the brunt of this storm.

According to the Australian Accountants Directory they are, “a practitioner of accountancy or accounting, which is the measurement, disclosure or provision of assurance about fiscal data that can help supervisors, investors, tax authorities and other individuals make selections about allocating assets”(“About Accountants”).

Greetings on a chilly Tuesday evening in Virginia! We're excited because the Woodlawn Needlework Show starts tomorrow and runs through the month of March.
We have a few trunk shows going on in the shop right now, and more to come. Here's a little taste: Samplers Revisited. We love this Adam & Eve Sampler (sorry for the angle--it's hung high above our heads so everyone can admire it), called Elizabeth Jackson 1824.
We also have some framed pieces by Trinity Designs, a Leesburg, VA designer of needlework. We like the sentiment of "Fret Not."
Spring is just around the corner, but while we wait, we think this would be a nice springy project to stitch. It is by Wiehenburg, and it is called "Spring Quaker." It can be purchased as just a chart or you can get the Dinky Dyes thread pack along with it. (Ahem, says Glenna--look at the rabbits!)
We sell lots of needlepoint too--painted canvases and counted canvas work. Here's an adorable project that is stitched as an ornament and includes a matching glass ornament as well.
Do you have a little princess in need of a new spring knitted wardrobe? We've got the books and the yarn to knit it! This is "Little Stripes and Brights," from Sirdar.
Or knit one of the fabulously popular Debbie Bliss patterns with this exquisitely soft yarn in delicious pastel colors that remind us of Easter eggs:
Need a basket to carry your knitting book, several balls of yarn and some needles, a stitch counter and a sandwich? Lantern moon crafts a beautiful lined woven bucket for carrying all your bits and pieces. Heck, I'm thinking of ditching my leather purse and carrying one of these instead!
Last, but certainly not least, we frame too. We're needleworkers too, so we are going to treat your needlework the way it should be treated--as something to be carefully conserved and showcased to pass on to the next generation. Talk to us about cost--you don't have to spend a bundle to get great service and a beautiful frame.
If you see something that interests you, please give us a call at 703-360-4600, and we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have about price, availability, stitch count, dimensions, recommended fabrics and floss and substitutions if you'd like. And if you would like to order something you see here--or something you've seen elsewhere--we'll be happy to mail it out to you, even if you live outside the U.S.!

Happy Noodle Boy is a comic created by Nny, and read mainly by the "goth", "punk", or any otherwise dark and/or metal themed lifestyle with dark or twisted sense of humor. Every issue has (at least) one single-page insert of the Happy Noodle Boy comic itself, detailing the often completely nonsensical adventures (mostly senseless babbling, screaming obscenities, and being killed). Happy Noodle Boy spends much of his time standing on a wooden soapbox and yelling nonsense at hapless pedestrians, often provoking his own death.
He appears in the backgrounds of many of the strips of the main storyline (the mall, the movie theatre, etc.), usually in crowd scenes, and pictures of him appear frequently in Squee's room. He also appeared in I Feel Sick #1 in a crowded dance floor. Johnny seems to be in the habit of leaving his drawings lying around.
It is believed that Happy Noodle Boy's name is a reference to Johnny's extraordinarily thin figure. In one particular comic, Johnny says that when he was young, other kids taunted him for this, calling him "Noodle Boy."
At one point it is mentioned that, while all Johnny can draw currently is Happy Noodle Boy, he used to be an artist of particular talent.
According to Jhonen Vasquez, he created Happy Noodle Boy while attending Mount Pleasant. According to Vasquez, "So many years ago, [my little romantical friend in high school] was the unwitting reason Happy Noodle Boy was created. [She] always asked me for comics. But I couldn't draw as fast as she requested. Thus, I tried to create the worst abomination of a comic that I could, so as to make her not want comics anymore. That abomination, my friends, was Happy Noodle Boy".
The face of Happy Noodle Boy appears on the covers of JTHM in place of the Slave Labour Graphics logo.

Senapus Charlesbois Furniture, 2017-12-12 18:24:06. Mattresses for Overweight People. For those who prefer foam mattresses and are overweight consider the latex mattress or the visco elastic mattress. Because these mattresses have no springs there are no painful pressure points exacerbated by the extra weight. In addition overweight people tend to wear out spring mattresses faster than foam mattresses. When buying a foam mattress select a high-density style, as it will last quite a bit longer. Another good option for overweight people is an air mattress. Once again there are no pressure points causing pain. The firmness is easily adjusted by adding or releasing air. If an overweight person must purchase a spring mattress try to get an inner coil mattress. Their construction is perfectly suited to heavier individuals. A futon mattress is very similar to a regular bed mattress. When shopping for one, consider how firm you want the mattress to be. Below is a guide to the different degrees of firmness in a mattress and the types of brands that make them.

Known for their durability, they also have anti-allergy and anti-microbial characteristics. These mattresses bounce back to their original shape as soon as you get off the bed. Pressure is evenly distributed too. A viscose elastic or memory foam bed is made of polyurethane foam. It does not respond as quickly as a latex foam mattress but is excellent at relieving pressure points on the body. This foam mattress has several different densities making some harder than others. Polyurethane foam beds are petroleum based. They too come in different densities and are one of the more popular foam beds.

Choose unbleached organic cotton with organic fill and organic dyes and steer clear of harsh chemically treated fabrics.

Anastasie Vertefeuille Furniture, 2017-12-11 19:44:41. Firm mattresses. Firm mattresses fall in 3 categories: firm, extra-firm, ultra-firm. The firm mattresses include the Orbit, Neptune Cotton Only and the Single Foam futon mattresses. Usually, these firm mattresses have very little foam, and are cotton only, giving it the firm feeling. The ones with foam use a denser foam that makes the mattress less soft. These mattresses are great for people who like to sleep on something firm and who need the additional support. The extra-firm mattresses include the Simmons Monarch 2 and the Liberty Futon Mattress. Some of these mattresses are created with very dense layers of foam from top to bottom. Finally, the ultra-firm mattresses are for those that love to sleep on the ground. These mattresses are usually not recommended for a futon frame, but more for a platform bed. These are for people who want that firm feeling of a traditional Japanese futon mattress. The high density of the foam makes these mattresses very heavy and harder to move around.
Eulalie Meaux Furniture, 2017-12-11 19:44:38. The twin mattress size can be a bit deceiving. At 39 inches wide and 75 inches long, it is the smallest standard mattress size available. You would have to go to a crib mattress size to find anything smaller. But for the twin mattress size, there are still a number of uses for it. Follow along for much more on this dynamic mattress size! Twin Mattress Size: Uses and Information It could be a tight fit for most adults. At 39" x 75", it is too short for those taller than 55", according to The Better Sleep Council - though adults in tight living quarters can make the jump to a twin XL (39" x 80").
Arianne Desrosiers Furniture, 2017-12-11 19:44:40. The mattress exterior is called ticking. Visually it is really not too important to select a "pretty" mattress as it will be covered most of the time. Instead you want to make sure the ticking is sturdy and well made and not prone to ripping. The higher quality ticking is made of material that is knitted or woven using cotton or viscose yarn. Cheaper mattresses are made of polypropylene or polyester. The cheapest mattresses are made of stitchbond or bonded cloth. Manufacturers now make external mattress covers with special features such as anti-allergy, anti-bacterial and anti-static. They may be resistant to staining, water and fire. Amazingly enough, there are even mattresses that give off different scents conducive to a good nights sleep. Spring Mattresses. There are three basic types of spring mattresses. A continuous spring mattress is made from a single piece of wire woven into many springs. The springs are linked in a vertical pattern. The wire is soft and the coils are small. This generates more reaction from the mattress. An open coil mattress is the most common form of mattress. The springs are arranged horizontally and connected at their tops and on the bottom by a twisting wire. The rods that run around the edge of the coils add strength. A pocket spring mattress has coils that are placed in fabric coverings. Instead of working as a unit, these springs function separately. As a result movement between partners on the same bed can not be felt by the other.

Brigliador Fortin Furniture, 2017-12-14 07:47:46. Adjustable Bases. Adjustable beds are becoming more and more popular but they are still very expensive. They make it easy to sleep or read as the bed can be raised or lowered as needed. They are also very helpful for people with medical conditions. GERD (acid reflux) patients find there is less pain sleeping in a raised position. In some situations the end of the bed raises and this can help patients who suffer from leg cramps. Most of these beds come as single beds. There are also double sized beds with the two sides independently adjustable. Some extreme adjustable beds can have up to 5 areas that can be altered. From the head to the feet and every point in between, these are considered the elite of adjustable beds. Because the mattresses are made especially to suit each bed it is best to purchase the two together.
Arianne Desrosiers Furniture, 2017-12-13 23:16:47. Medium mattresses. The next category of futon mattresses are characterized as medium in softness. These range from those on the softer side to those on the firmer side. The medium soft mattresses have extra foam like the soft mattresses, but has a bit more polyester to make it slightly firmer than a soft mattress. Good examples of these include the Saturn Futon Mattress, the Haley 90, and the Aries Futon Mattress. The next level up is what are characterized as medium. These include the Phoenix, the Mercury and the Pulsar mattress. Usually, these have layers of foam, but the top layer is a polyester layer making it a bit more firm. This means the mattress wont sink down a lot when you sit on it, but will still be bouncy when lying down. There is more support from these, but the mattresses are not firm. Finally, in the medium category, you have the medium firm mattress. These include the Simmons Monarch, the Galaxy Interspring, and the Cotton Coil mattresses. A lot of times, these mattresses will have an inner spring, similar to a regular bed mattress allowing the mattress to be more firm. The coils are usually surrounded by foam making these mattresses comfortable, but still firm. When the mattress does not have springs, the inner core is a lot thicker, making the mattress less plush and more firm. These medium firm mattresses are usually recommended by doctors since they are firm enough to give you more back support, but still soft enough for your body to merge into.

Brigliador Fortin Furniture, 2017-12-14 07:47:46. The Organic Crib Mattress. Nowadays most mattress manufacturers claim to have mattress options, and for the most part, they all do. However, they mostly use slightly different outer layer and filling materials. Since there are many safe and healthy options available today, understand that you are not looking for just one option when shopping for an organic mattress. Some items you ought to look for in an organic mattress include: The use of 100% organic cotton and wool - both in the filling and the outer layer of the crib. There are not any herbicides or pesticides used on organically grown cotton crops. The fire retardants that are used in organic mattresses are organic. As we mentioned before, the chemicals that are used in traditional mattresses, to protect against fire can have serious health effects. In-crib fire barriers are required per governmental regulations. Organic fire retardants such as baking soda, hydrated silica, cellulose fiber and wool, which is a natural fire retardant, are some of the products you should look for. These are all natural alternatives that may meet the fire protection requirement of crib mattresses.
Sibyla Dandonneau Furniture, 2017-12-14 07:47:48. Bedsteads. Bedsteads are what most of us consider a typical bed frame. The mattress support is usually made of wood slats that can be very flexible or tough and rigid. Wire mesh is another material used to make the support. The more rigid and cheap slats are further apart but the gap should not exceed 10cm. In addition, the wider the space between the slats, the more likely your mattress will be to wear out.
Anastasie Vertefeuille Furniture, 2017-12-14 07:47:48. For those living in extremely humid climates, a natural mattress offers a higher level of comfort because the wool contently absorbs moisture. This reduces the chance of waking up on damp bed linens. Some organic mattresses are made with latex foam, similar to memory foam. These are the perfect choice for light sleepers who tend to wake up easily when their sleep partner moves. More and more organic mattress companies are manufacturing customizable mattresses. This allows consumers to specify such things as mattress firmness and the type of latex used to create their individual sleep system. Organic Crib Mattress - Benefits

Eulalie Meaux Furniture, 2017-12-14 07:47:46. Hard Vs Soft Mattress. Mattresses come in a wide range of solidity. From the ultra soft to the extremely hard, it is more a matter of preference than necessity. However, there are some basic truths that hold for the majority of us. Very soft cloud-like mattresses can wreak havoc on bad backs. This is because there is very little support in a soft mattress. While hard mattresses might be better for a bad back, very hard mattresses can cause just as much trouble. It all boils down to what works best for each individual.

Ah, sleep it is a wonderful and yet strange thing. But in my case it is elusive. My insomnia had kicked into overdrive this week and no amount of dreams about the changing rooms for the England squad will entice my subconscious into letting me pass out.
Of course all my good intentions of using any time I have awake to do household chores to lull me into unconsciousness has failed and instead I lie there and think of Dominic Monaghan stranded on a desert island with only my good self for company....
Tonight I plan on finally watching Brokeback Mountain (I know, I know BAD GAY for not seeing it before) but I actually doubt I can garner up the energy to press play on the DVD player. What I need is a good man to wear me out. Even Rohypnol would be welcome at this stage!
Aside from the lack of sleep, this week has been rather nice. X-men 3 was entertaining and exciting in a summer blockbuster kind of way. I felt the 100 minute running time hindered rather than helped the film as they had crammed so much into it that I was left wanting more. Also, was it me or did Vinne Jones' costume rather resemble a large penis? You know, the veiny, bulky body topped off with the rather phallic helmet?
As I wake up this morning in a rum soaked haze I remember something very strange and wonderful from last nights Eurovision.
When called upon for his scores the male judge from The Netherlands flirted with the Male TV presenter and asked if he wanted his number now or later. The Show's presenter replied "Later will do, but I bet it is 69 69 69"
Eurovision, as ever was Marvelous. My good friend Aleasha held a wigtastic evening complete with more home made food and cake than anyone could possibly ask for. I was disappointed that Germany's fabulous country and western number didn't rank higher than it did....
Or the utterly camp Sibel from Turkey with her Kylie cast-off 'Superstar' complete with pretty British male dancers as back up....
As you can see from the pictures below, Aleasha has a wig fetish that even the delectable Lee would have trouble competing with and of course they were worn all evening. Sadly, I never managed to get any photos of myself in one, but one may appear at some time or other from a friends camera in the meantime meet some friends of mine...
I have had more rum punch than is seemly. In fact you can tell I had had too much when I began desperately sucking at the watermelon in the punch bowl in the hope that it had absorbed more alcohol. Not my most dignified hour, but I did take a cab ride home with someone who has the Prime-Ministers telephone number in their mobile and managed to refrain from 'borrowing' it to leave him dirty voicemails......
Tomorrow is set aside for a nice relaxed Sunday lunch with my ex-housemate the Princess. I do hope wigs are involved again.
Oh blogosphere beware. Whilst home, I got my Birthday present early and it is my very first DIGITAL CAMERA!
No hot boy on the street/tube/bed is safe now and expect plenty of narcissistic shots of myself wearing various funny wigs/hats/cocktails.
One worrying trend to come out of my trip home seems to be a new penchant for wearing shirts? Is this the bloody age thing creeping up on me again or is it just because short sleeved shirts are cool in summer? hmmm
Well dear, dear people. I survived my trip to Middlesbrough and am back with my dignity and my virginity intact. My goddaughter is going to grow up to be a heartbreaker indeed and coupled with her mischievous but lovable nature, I can see why they chose me to be her, ahem, spiritual advisor.
Now, things move back into their normal routine. I shall be seeing x-men 3:Hugh Jackman's Pants next week followed, on Saturday, by the Gay Event of the year. Yes, the Eurovision Song Contest is upon us again. Although, frankly I can't see what the rest of Europe gets out of it as they don't have Terry Wogan's wonderfully sarcastic commentary to listen too. Come on people it cant all be about the frocks and dance routines you know, no matter what the gay handbook says. There has to be at least some bitching involved...
Well seeing as I have to leave you dear, dear people I thought I would leave you with a few things to entertain yourself with while I am away. SO I scoured the internet (Don't worry, I had my marigolds on) and found these two wonderful games to keep you occupied.
Firstly we have Asphyxiate David Blaine , where you get to make the twat in the bubble do nasty things to his smug self.
And secondly, for all you pop culture vultures and celebrity aficionados out there we have a game where you have to guess the celebrity from the trash in their bins IN Celebrite Poubelle Magnifique
Think of me whilst I am in the cultural wasteland that is the North East of England. I don't think they have internet connection in Middlesbrough, but if I manage to get online I may try and post a cry for help.... Adieu
AH, the summer sun. A time for boys to go shirtless and drip ice-cream down their naked, muscled torso’s and for gays and girls to find a nice bench to sit and watch them from. Sadly, I have not had time today as I had to play the good citizen and go and vote this morning for the local elections. I shuidder to think that I had to set foot in a “Community centre” to do so. I had visions of tobaccos stained old men playing dominos and wheezing and troubled teens vandelizing the building and snorting coke off of the formica counters.
Luckily it was nothing like back home in Middlesbrough and the people were all very friendly and nice. There was a little bookstall on the way in selling second-hand paperbacks for 20p each. I had an attack of middle-class guilt though and paid £2 for one instead. See, I think I earn extra karma points today.
I have to dash across the river at lunchtime today to purchase a new shirt and some shoes for the christening. 2 things I absolutely loathe shopping for, I may have to have a G&T to perk me up after before I head back to work.
I was trying to be all arty with my friend Jason in the Cemetary behind my house. I rather like this picture, I think it perfectly captures my innocence. AHEM...
Well what another terminally dull bank holiday weekend. Dr Dick is away again so no entertainment on that front, all my housemates have mysteriously vanished and the incessant rain is preventing me from going out unless my hair turns into a Jewfro again.
In a vain attempt to pamper myself to make me feel better I had a nice relaxing bubble bath. Relaxing in the sense that there were so many bubbles I could hide the unsightly form of my naked body under them and relax by banishing all thought of the gym or exercise out of my mind.
This weekend I have to perfect my disguise for an undercover mission I have been asked to undertake.

I think that we all know how important good health is. The question is, what is actually healthy and unhealthy? I know that some people spend hundreds and sometimes even thousands of dollars on medications that their usually well-meaning doctors have advised them to take, all in the name of ‘good health’. However, that is not even close to striving for good health. On the contrary, it can often reap horrible side effects!
I firmly believe that the keys to good health include an organic whole foods diet consisting of plant based vegan (dairy free), soy free, gluten free, unprocessed foods. When I prepare these foods homemade, my body always thanks me! One of my favorite, natural products to use is Veden. Veden is the only plant based, soy free protein that I recommend. I love mixing it in with my smoothies once or twice every day for a delicious, natural alternative to all of the heavily processed junk foods. It comes in a powder form and is packed full of all of my daily vitamins and minerals, fiber, omega 3, protein, probiotics, and enzymes! Get it today
October 10th, 2015 at 1:12 pm I totally agree with you here. Organic food, veggies and fruits is the best for the lunch. And plenty of water and a walk in the morning will keep you away from doctor.
October 10th, 2015 at 2:16 pm It’s very important to take care of your health and body. If you do not give proper attention, you can be overweight in few weeks. And then it’ll be very difficult to reduce that fat in years. I’ve already experienced such thing.
October 14th, 2015 at 8:21 pm Good for you! I wish you the best in your life and your health, especially. You are so right, too.
November 15th, 2015 at 12:09 pm We all need to take organic whole food which must be dairy free, soy free, gluten free and unprocessed. It will make our body perfect and also satisfy all our physical needs at the same time. I never heard of Veden, I think I should give it a try as it’s made from plant based and soy free protein.

Unusual sites have always been an evocative trigger for my artistic practice. I am challenged both by the physical peculiarities of a space as well as it’s history of use. When I work this way I attempt to address both.
LUXE is designed to interact with the flowing neo-baroque architecture that moves from the inside to the outside of the building. During my site visit, I noticed a structure to the right as one walks into the main lobby of the gallery: under the stairs. It was reminiscent of a streamline airplane wing with its hard, shiny metal surface. On closer inspection, I realized that this form continued through the window providing an exterior presence. It is this part of the architecture that I have upholstered with a Victorian-inspired damask fabric.
The red covering softens and feminizes the structure contrasting the historical with the contemporary. The choice to make a piece, outside of the formal exhibition space, attempts to address the gallery itself: offering alternative possibilities for siting work and perhaps even suggesting the building as a collaborator.

High Ranking Mexican Cartel Operative Says “Fast and Furious” Was About Supplying Guns to Cartels in Exchange for Intel
Well if this turns out to be true it’s going to make an already bad situation for the Justice Department even worse.
According to statements being made by Jesus Vicente Zambada-Niebla, who is a high ranking member of the Sinaloa Cartel, and is currently in US custody, the US provided the Sinaloa Cartel with numerous guns in exchange for intelligence on other cartels. According to Zambada-Niebla, the US also allowed certain cartels to freely import drug shipments in exchange for intel on other cartels as well.

When Elon Musk described artificial intelligence as "summoning the demon" in the fall of 2014, the tech press responded with derision, scolding, and anxiety. Musk, according to the takes, didn't fully understand the technology and foolishly chose to invoke a metaphor - a metaphor that was not merely inaccurate but also dangerous, encouraging continued misunderstanding, fear, and hatred of technology by the common folk.
But our lives with computers are and have always been rife with so-called dangerous supernatural influence - software wizards walking us through installations, devices that are expected to "automagically" know our needs before we articulate them, and, yes, with demons. Or more specifically, with daemons. A term used to describe what amount to background processes performed by operating systems (later backronymed to Disk And Execution MONitor) emerged from MIT's Project MAC in 1963, as an explicit reference to Maxwell's demon of the 1870s. Daemons are fairly mundane pieces of operating systems, rarely seen by most users but crucial to making sure lots of things work and keep working.
Fixating on this word choice will, no doubt, draw the ire of Unix sysadmins for whom daemons are not metaphors but entirely real, but let's just run with it. While the choice of daemon over demon is to some extent a poetic accident of history, but it's one that offers a reminder of the constant struggle for the meaning of our metaphors, which are perhaps neither dangerous nor foolish but simply powerful, and never without context.
The concept of daemons in ancient Greek culture began as, essentially, mostly benign spirits - creatures beyond this world who could be called upon for various supernatural purposes but that weren't in and of themselves particularly good or evil. The Western conception of demons that Musk cited emerged in part from early Christianity's efforts to distinguish itself from its pagan critics. Even if a daemon was essentially benign or even helpful, it existed outside of the domain of a one true God, and therefore the domain of sin and damnation.
The past year has seen some remarkable invoking and inventing of demons, and while this is supposed to be a short text about magic and machines it is hard to speak today about contemporary demonologies without facing Darren Wilson's demon summoning. His grand jury testimony was a narrative not of a 6'4" armed police officer facing an unarmed teenager but of a child facing an unspeakable monster: "He looked up at me and had the most intense aggressive face. The only way I can describe it, it looks like a demon, that's how angry he looked." (State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson, Grand Jury Volume V, September 16, 2014, p. 225) Wilson's invocation and the support he received from cops throughout the country demonstrated the lengths that law enforcement in America will go to convince itself that it is a victim in a society it dominates.
A funny thing humans do when they have some form of power (be it the power of a police badge and a gun, a multi-billion dollar fortune, or, say, a massive military-industrial defense apparatus) is they'll convince themselves that they have none, especially in the face of that which is beyond their containment or comprehension. We're really good at this, at summoning demons where there are mostly humans, at insisting we have no control over our circumstances, over our killing machines, over contemporary hells often of our own making.
So many of the tools we love, use every day, and hope to gear towards emancipatory ends began as instruments for making killing more efficient and control more effective. These devices will continue to exist, and we will have to continue to live with them, and we will have to decide how to work with them. Living honestly among daemons means never being sure if they're on the side of angels or demons--because they are neither, really. To live with the uncertainties and ambiguities of machines and systems demands a different kind of magical theology, one that lets us live with our daemons.

Over the years, as in-vehicle safety tech becomes more advanced and innovative, the IIHS has raised their standards, making it harder for automobiles to achieve the coveted Top Safety Pick+ rating.
In order to obtain it, vehicles have to score top marks in every crash test category while having available crash avoidance technology and good quality headlights. For the 2018 model year, the Hyundai Sonata managed to pass the IIHS tests with flying colors and attain the Top Safety Pick+ title.
The IIHS has five different crashworthiness tests: small front overlap, moderate front overlap, side impact, roof strength, and head restraints. The 2018 Hyundai Sonata earned a top rating of “good” on every test.
The Sonata also was also equipped with the optional automatic emergency braking system and high-quality headlights. This is the second time the Hyundai Sonata has managed to grab the Top Safety Pick+ rating, following the 2016 model year.
The 2018 Hyundai Sonata’s Top Safety Pick+ safety rating makes it a great choice for a family sedan. If you’re interested, stop by Tipton Hyundai for an up close and personal look at the Hyundai Sonata and its new, top-of-the-line safety technology.

The cavity mode mediates spin-exchange interactions in which one atom emits a photon into the cavity that is then absorbed by another atom, driving anti-correlated spin flips. Image Credit, Rey Group, Thompson Group, and Steven Burrows / JILA
A collaboration between the Thompson Lab and Rey’s theory group is exploiting phenomena related to Quantum Information Science and Technology (QIST), such as entanglement, to break through previous barriers of quantum precision defined by the Standard Quantum Limit. These advances may transform typical physics laboratories into probes for the most fundamental questions of our universe.
The chaos within a black hole scrambles information. Gravity tugs on time in tiny, discrete steps. A phantom-like presence pervades our universe, yet evades detection. These intangible phenomena may seem like mere conjectures of science fiction, but in reality, experimental comprehension is not far, in neither time nor space.
Astronomical advances in quantum simulators and quantum sensors will likely be made within the decade, and the leading experiments for black holes, gravitons, and dark matter will be not in space, but in basements – sitting on tables, in a black room lit only by lasers.
These experiments, generally called quantum precision measurements, are leading the forefront of our fundamental understanding of the universe. These experiments use QIST (Quantum Information Science and Technology) phenomena to study and harness the quantum behavior of atoms, ions, and molecules, yet can fit within a food truck. Their power lies in their precision, or more colloquially, their sensitivity. Current quantum precision experiments, such as JILA’s atomic clock, have sensitivities of nearly 10-19[1], and with only a little more[2], this clock will be capable of detecting gravitational waves caused by colliding black holes, or measuring gravity’s influence on time. There’s only one problem: we already hit the limit of quantum precision.
The limit of quantum precision is defined by the Standard Quantum Limit, or SQL for short. Inherent to quantum measurements, SQL defines the inevitable quantum noise that arises from wave function collapse. This noise is not unlike the noise in a coin toss experiment, where more throws better estimate equal outcomes of heads and tails.
Atoms can become entangled by undergoing a coherent interaction called spin exchange. “The physics [behind spin exchange] is very easy,” explained Rey, as she described two atoms exchanging a photon to swap energy quantified by spin. When the atoms swap spins, they become entangled, meaning measuring the spin of one atom gives immediate information about the spin of the second atom. If two coins could be entangled, for example, then one coin landing heads would force the second coin to land tails.
The physics of spin exchange may be easy to understand, but the physical feat is anything but easy for the atoms. Two atoms may be many centimeters apart when they exchange spins. For these tiny atoms, that is the spatial equivalent of two humans discussing a coin toss while one is in Europe, and the other on the far side of the sun.
To spur long-distance relationships between two atoms, researchers in the Thompson lab placed tens of thousands of Strontium atoms between two mirrors. The scene then plays out like an apathetic game of catch: Bored of standing around, a random atom tosses a photon into the void. The mirrors then bounce that photon back and forth, back and forth, beating on, borne back ceaselessly into the – boom! A second atom steps up and catches the photon. And just like that, the two atoms, tosser and catcher, swap spins.
The group confirmed spin exchange interactions were indeed occurring by witnessing one-axis twisting. According to Rey, if a circle represents standard quantum noise, then one-axis twisting is “the circle sheering into an ellipse.” By redistributing the quantum noise along one dimension, it is reduced along the other. This one-axis twisting is a first step towards spin squeezing, added Thompson, which is a type of entanglement.
And the group was further pleased when they saw an “energy gap” emerge. An energy gap is like a penalty: atoms that misalign must pay for their rebellion with an energy fee. Thompson said the energy gap is generated by an effective magnetic field that can be sourced to the strong atom alignment. In other words, the aligning atoms encourage all others to align. “They create a kind of peer pressure,” said Thompson, “it’s hard to go against the crowd.”
Because the energy gap encourages atoms to maintain their spins, both Rey and Thompson believe the gap could protect entangled states from becoming disentangled. But the group has yet to observe this protection, as they need to first generate entangled states.
This will happen soon, promised Rey. “We have measured this gap. We have shown that this gap exists. And therefore, for the future, when we can generate actual entanglement, it is going to be useful because it is going to be able to protect our entangled states for longer times.”

Since 1999, Janie has created site-specific mosaic artworks for public and private settings in the UK and in Australia. Whilst the majority of Janie’s mosaics have been with tiles and handmade ceramic details, mosaics have been made in other appropriate materials such as slate and brickwork.
The handmade tile pieces create a totally unique feature to the tile mosaics. Clay is cut out or moulded with 3D relief work, then painted with ceramic underglazes. The work is then glazed and fired in the kiln. The completed details are then assembled into a mosaic with surrounding tiles. For wall mounted artworks, an eclectic mix of media can be used for the surrounding tiles such as glass and ceramic tiles and baubles.
‘After loading up the clay, travelling hours initially by car to the remote community where my mosaic project was held, the artwork on the clay tiles was ready to complete in Darwin. The Wet Season had kicked in by then, so flying was the only option. I had to ask the pilot of our small 4 seater plane to make the softest landing so that none of the hand painted tiles didn’t break………and he did!’
Janie produces bespoke mosaics for private individuals, public artworks and commercial organisations, schools and communities.
Janie enjoys the process of the artwork evolving, from the initial consultation and design stage, through to the production of ceramic details.
In school and community commissions, Janie believes it is important to reveal the process of producing high quality completed artworks. The process of creating the work and the end result are both important.

At the first of the year I started a "Pinned and Tried from Pinterest" project, it kind of fell by the wayside when summer arrived, I just wasn't trying many new recipes. I tried this one yesterday that I had pinned a while ago and really liked it - Kay's Spaghetti Sauce - the original recipe came right here from from All Recipes, I don't think you can go wrong with any recipe on that site especially any recipe that has a lot of 5 star reviews.
These are the leftovers from last night, I'm going to divide it up and freeze it. We had it on whole wheat spaghetti but it would be great for any type of pasta. Doesn't it look quite nice in Pyrex Friendship?
I pretty much followed the recipe - I used ground chicken instead of ground beef, used parsley instead of oregano and added fresh mushrooms. I let it simmer for a couple of hours - make your own sauce, it's way better than anything out of a jar or can!
I like your idea of letting others know how your Pinterest recipes turn out. I've had some real flops!
I totally agree-- homemade sauce beats a jar hands down! Hey, finished 2 Smash pages since yesterday. Fun!
Posting your Pinterest successes is a great idea! I have a great luck with recipes from there. And putting it in Pyrex completes it!
Brian is out of town tonight for work and whenever he isn't home, the kids and I have a tradition of having spaghetti & meatballs (he HATES spaghetti). It's too late for me to try this now but I am definitely going to pin it for next time.
That looks super yummy. Any spaghetti sauce with mushrooms that has been simmering for a while has to he delicious! I'm not gonna lie though, unless my grandma makes it for us, we usually eat jar sauce... one day I'll try this! :-)
I will make this soon! I'm trying very hard to be "an adult" and actually make meals at home instead of going to Subway or Noodles Co. etc. I'm going to be relying on your pinterest recipes often!
Abbas yolcu (lit. an Abbas traveler) -- idiomatic meaning is 'You can't detain someone who has to go' or 'She's at death's door.'
The story…Abbas Hoca (also known as Abbas Molla) was a famous 12th century folk poet, though none of his works survive him. This Süle tribesman loved to travel and it's said that he composed his works as he wandered from place to place -- through Azerbaijan, the Caucasus, Iran, India, Arabia, and Egypt. He was, apparently, a witty and pleasant conversationalist who was quick to make friends everywhere he went. But although many tried to persuade him to settle in their lands, he always refused, saying, "Impossible, I can't stay. Abbas is a traveler, he doesn't stay in one place." That easily explains the first meaning of the idiom -- and it's just a short logical jump to see how it also became associated with 'imminent death'.
The story… The 'çaylak' (a hawk-like bird), about 60 centimeters in length as an adult, is indigenous to Turkey. Because it's a bird with a heavy body, its young take a long time learning how to fly -- and do a lot of falling and crashing. It is this awkwardness of the çaylak young that is the source of the idiom.
Agaca çIksa pabucu yerde kalmaz (lit. 'If he goes up in a tree, his shoes don't remain on the ground') -- the idiomatic meaning is 'He's crafty, not easily fooled.'
The story… One day, Nasreddin Hoca went out walking in his pair of brand new shoes. A gang of youthful pranksters saw him and set out to trick him and steal the new shoes. As they approached him on the footpath, they pretended to enter into a deep discussion among themselves -- about the Hoca's ability in the 'art' of tree climbing…But the Hoca was suspicious of their behavior and sensed that they meant to trick him. So when the leader of the gang asked the Hoca slyly whether or not the old fellow was still capable of climbing a nearby tree, the Hoca replied, "Of course, I am." And, with that, he jumped up on it and began climbing -- but not before tucking his new shoes safely in his breast coat. The gang members all shouted out at once, "Wait Hoca, leave the shoes down here on the ground. What use will they be in the tree?" By now the Hoca understood the gang's intention very well, and with a glint in his eye, replied, "Oh, who knows…Perhaps from the tree, I'll have to journey to the next village by yonder road."
And so, the idiom has become associated with people who are intelligent and alert in the face of tricky dealings.
The story… Turkey's idioms come from her culture, of course -- and that includes her religious culture. In Islam, it's believed that a doomsday cometh. On that day the stars will fall from the sky and burn up, the sun and the moon will break away, mountains will 'walk', the earth will tremble, and water will cease to flow. Thus, according to the idiom, the certainty of the 'Law of Gravity', for example, will endure -- right up to that final judgement day when all earthly things cease to matter, and when even water ceases to flow.
AltIndan çapanoglu çIkmak (lit. for Çapanoglu to pop up) -- the idiomatic meaning is for an 'activity' or 'job' to meet with an undesired or unexpected difficulty, problem, or danger.
The story… For a time, Çapanoglu Ahmet Pasha and his two sons, Mustafa and Süleyman, ruled like feudal lords over wide territories encompassing the city/towns of Amasya, Yozgat, Ankara, Nigde, and KaysarI (until 1808 when Sultan Mahmut II had all three executed).
But although the Çapanoglu's were tough rulers during their reign, they also listened carefully to the problems of their people, and, where possible, they tried to ease the lot of the underdog.
According to one account, at the time of Çapanoglu Süleyman Bey, in Yozgat, there lived a pretty widow woman…And, a married man with a large family kept after her for sexual favours. The woman, who grew tired of the aggravating man, applied to Çapanoglu Süleyman Bey for help. At the Bey's command, she went one night to the married man's house and confronted him.
When she declared, "I am a woman of honor, don't bother me anymore," the man attacked her, and Çapanoglu (who had witnessed the entire event from a nearby hiding place) had the man hanged the same night -- in the Yozgat town center!
It seems that said old donkey was seen nibbling from hunger on the bell-rope in front of a grand mansion. When citizens reported to Çapanoglu that the donkey was weak and in poor condition, he initiated a search for the donkey's owner. And when the owner was found, justice was swift and harsh.
For failing to care for the donkey, Çapanoglu gave the owner 100 lashes of the long whip -- at a public flogging! On top of that, the man was ordered to feed the donkey five bushels of barley a day, to give it a daily washing and grooming, and to report in person once a week with the donkey for inspection by Çapanoglu.
The old donkey (because of all this special treatment) gained quite a bit of weight in very short order, apparently. And when citizens questioned the owner about the reason behind the old donkey's vigorous new appearance, the owner (remembering well the sting of the long whip) replied, "Semirir elbet; arkasInda Çapanoglu var." (Well, of course he's gained weight; Çapanoglu is behind it.)
And, over the years, the idiom has gradually evolved from 'arkasInda Çapanoglu var' to 'altIndan çapanoglu çIkmak' -- as a sort of warning to those who think no one is watching…
AyagInIn altIna karpuz kabugu koymak (Lit. To put a watermelon skin under his foot). Idiomatic Meaning: to oust someone from their position...
The Rest of the Idiom Story...It seems there was a woman-chasing müezzin at the mosque. And, ever time he ascended to the top of the minaret to make the call to prayer, he'd ogle the women in the neighboring houses below.
Finally, one of the women got fed up and told her husband about it. Her husband became furious and started off to give the muezzin a vicious whipping. But he was intercepted by his son who said, "Wait father, leave this matter to me. You're too angry to think straight. You'll just get in a fight, and that could land you in trouble. I've got a better idea." And his father agreed.
So, the young man went to the market and bought a watermelon, and sliced it up nicely for his friends and family. After the fruit had been eaten, he carefully cut up the skin in neat little squares. And he took them to the mosque and waited.
When the time for evening prayer approached, the muezzin began to make his way up the minaret stairway to issue the prayer call. The young man followed him secretly and strategically placed the watermelon-skin squares on every step of the minaret staircase -- from top to bottom. And then the young-man disappeared into the twilight.
When the muezzin completed the 'call to prayer' he took a few moments to ogle the woman below, and then began his descent. On the very first step he slipped -- and began a mighty head-over-heels fall that didn't end until he had reached the bottom of the stone stair-case, in a heap of broken bones and bloody bruises. And when he finally got out of the hospital, he took up work as a vegetable seller -- and he never ascended a minaret staircase anywhere again.
The story... Our source for this idiom attributes it to some boastful hunters. One day at the coffee shop where the hunters usually met to exaggerate their activities, one of their number began boasting about the superiority of his gun.
"It's extremely sensitive,: he said, "It never shifts left or right when I fire. Its sight is true, and no matter what I aim at -- be it a partridge or a rabbit -- it always delivers the bullet perfectly to the target without killing it, only enough to disable."
A non-hunting regular of the coffee house overheard the boast and tossed off this remark to his friends (just loud enough for the whole room to hear), " I have a fire poker in my house that's probably made from the same iron as his gun (aynI tüfegin demirinden). Because every time I throw it at my wife, I hit her in the heel -- a precise disabling blow."
During his 30 years in the photography business, Jimmy Steinfeldt has worked with everyone from Miles Davis to the Ramones. Born in Minneapolis, Jimmy first focused and clicked at age 14. Cars (not the band), were among his first photographic subjects.
Jimmy moved to California to study at San Diego State University where he graduated with a Bachelor's in Business Management. After college he shot his way through many long road-trips and rock concerts armed with his first real camera. A one-hundred dollar Minolta!
Jimmy is a self-taught photographer who has only to squint through the lens for inspiration. Jimmy cites photographer Richard Avedon and cinematographer Karl Freund among his strongest influences. Jimmy's unique photographic style conveys the personality of his artist-musician subjects while conveying the story of their music.
As a live action photographer, Jimmy was first published in 1985 in SPIN magazine. In that same year Rolling Stone published one of his photographs of Madonna, which he credits as a major boost to his career. In 1986 his dreams as a music fan and photographer came true when Rolling Stone published his photo of Bob Dylan. CD covers followed from this exposure: Miles Davis, Willie Nelson, John Denver, Dee Dee Ramone and many others.
Jimmy's Elusive Studios, in the canyons of Hollywood, is his base of operations and has become a haven for music, film and television artists. In 1998 and again in 2007, industry players recognized his work and named him Photographer of the Year at the Los Angeles Music Awards. Winner of the Best Music Video for 2014 at the New Media Film Festival Los Angeles.
Jimmy's advice to aspiring photographers? "Try something new on every shoot - experiment with lighting, film, filters and gels. As for your camera, never leave home without it!"

When you publish your article, ads, website,or your manuscript in Japanese, you may usually place an order for translation to some agency or someone you already might know.
Yoshihiro Kaneda (it’s me) is a writer of Kodansha Ltd which is the largest publisher in Japan and it requires a writer to have highest skills in Japanese. He published two books from Kodansha Ltd and also published nine books as an author and an editor. And Yoshihiro Kaneda is a translator for Vice Japan. He lived in Brooklyn, New York and knows English and English culture inside and out. His book “Net Voice In The City” has interviews of Kevin Kelly, R.U. Sirius, Allen Cohen, Justin Hall, and Michael Gosney, and so on. Also his editorial book has manuscripts of Mark Frauenfelder and John Lebkowsky.
Moreover, he edited one book which was written by Hikaru Natsumi and is on Japanese literature history after Hikaru’s death.
I am an English-to-Japanese translator for publishing and for your private affairs. My recent career is a translator for Vice Japan.I can also translate Japanese to English and I do it professionally. I propose a cheap cost for your publishing or your private matters. One English word costs 20 cents for publishing publicly and for 15 cents for you privately. Isn’t it cheap? That’s it. If you want a more professional article in Japanese I may consider a different cost.

Then to the top of the fence, the better to sit and watch the local kids practice, amazed that girls could participate. She even started returning stray balls.
I didn't know much about this trilogy of young adult books until The Hunger Games was recommended by my book group, and to be honest the idea of reading about young people fighting to the death on live television was enough to put me off reading it at all - but I'm so glad I took advantage of Amazon's recent Kindle sale and purchased the first of the Trilogy....
Set sometime in the future, in the dystopian society of Panem, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sister's place when she is selected to represent her district in the annual Hunger Games. Katniss is pitted against other youngsters who must use their wit and cunning in order to survive.
The premise of the book should be off putting - young people selected to fight to the death on live television isn't something I would normally choose to read, however, this book captures your imagination from the opening page and carries you along in a tidal stream of events.
Whilst reading the book I was reminded forcibly of Reality TV shows like X-factor and American Idol, and whilst we don't encourage young people to fight to the death on live television, we do as a society "enjoy" and actively encourage the cut-throat world of competitive combat live on our TV screens.
I was delighted to be given this book as my fourth read in the Transworld Book Group Reading Challenge 2011.
The story opens in July 1910 with passengers boarding the SS Montrose in Antwerp bound for Canada. Amongst the passengers are a Mr John Robinson and his seventeen year old son Edmund, who together with a disparate group of fellow travellers are to be confined on board ship for the duration of the journey. This fictional account of the true story of the notorious Doctor Crippen gets off to a rather slow start, but then develops into a suspenseful and credible murder /mystery story. The depiction of the hypocrisy of the upper classes in the early part of the twentieth century is cleverly written, and the added snippets of Crippin’s early life serves to emphasise the complexity of his character, and highlights his emotional instability. There are several other background characters that add weight to the story, and allow a fascinating glimpse into the convolutions of a society where social class was paramount.
Overall, I thought Crippen was a really good read; it is very cleverly constructed as the slow pace accentuates the gradual exposure of Doctor Crippen, and eventually reveals the sordid details of this crime which gripped the imagination of the nation.
For me, the added enjoyment comes from John Boyne’s exceptionally good writing; he has a distinct talent for storytelling, and his ability to make the story come alive is typical of his style and flair.
This is my fourth and final book in this years' reading group challenge. I have thoroughly enjoyed the reading experience, and whilst one book was rather disappointing, it in no way detracts from the quality of books published by Transworld .
I am extremely grateful to have been given the opportunity to review the work of some excellent contemporary novelists, and look forward to future challenges.
One of my favourite times of year is now with us - the smell of Autumn is in the air, and there is a real sense of looking back over summer, and forward into winter. There's something quite comforting about the change of the seasons ....and the sentiment is eloquently express by this passage from John Keats poem -
Also known as the September equinox, the event signifies the first day of autumn in the UK. The autumn equinox is also used to determine the date of the traditional harvest festival which is held on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the autumn equinox.
I've had a period of a few days where I have really struggled with my reading - and have started and put down my latest Transworld review book Crippen by John Boyne a couple of times - so in order to get myself back into review mode I have decided to read one of my favourite authors - Elizabeth Chadwick.
I first discovered her books in the 1990's when she started to publish medieval historical adventures - her characterisation is excellent, and her sense of history really makes the story come alive.
I have three books of hers as yet unread, which I sort of squirrel away for those moments when only a good book by a favourite author will fit the bill...
I'm reading The Leopard Unleashed - which is the third book in the Ravenstow Trilogy and which was first published in 1992. It was re-edited and re-released in 2010, and whilst the trilogy can be read as stand alone novels, the books really are more compelling if read in sequence.
I reviewed Elizabeth Chadwick's latest book Lady of the English for newbooks magazine in April 2011.
Lady of the English is set in the 1100's, and follows the lives of two very different women, Matilda and Adeliza.
Matilda, the only daughter of Henry I, was used as a political pawn for all of her life. As a young child she was married to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V, until his death in 1125 resulted in her father using her again to make a political marriage, this time with the Count of Anjou. Following the untimely death of her brother William, Matilda was regarded by some of the English barons as the rightful heir to the English crown. However, after the death of her father, the succession was insecure, and Matilda’s life became one long battle to regain, and maintain what was rightfully hers from Stephen, the usurper King. Adeliza of Louvain was the second queen of Henry I, and Matilda's stepmother. Little is known of her historically other than she did not produce the male heir Henry I needed for a safe succession.
This is a meticulously researched historical novel with great insight into both female lead characters. Elizabeth Chadwick has cleverly juxtaposed the lives of these two fascinating women, and brought the medieval world to life in such a believable way, that you feel the tension and experience the struggle, not just for supremacy, but for survival. To be a woman in a medieval world was to be subjected to the whim of men – and only the strongest women made a difference.
Elizabeth Chadwick is a master of medieval storytelling, her sense of history is superb, her characters leap off the page, and enter your life in such a way that the story lives on in your imagination long after the last page.
.If you haven't tried her books before, and love good historical fiction then do give yourself a treat and pick up a copy of one of her books - there's loads to choose from, and each one will take you back in time .....so much so the housework simply won't get done and the chocolate hob nobs will simply disappear....
The Restoration is such a wonderful time to write about - I'm surprised that so many authors seem to bypass it - and either go back to the Tudor period, or forward to Regency England. I was completed hooked on this time in English history when I read the novels of Jean Plaidy as a teenager - the love story of Nell Gwynne and King Charles II can be found in the Charles 11 Trilogy . Their content is a bit dated now, and yet, the books capture the historical period very well.
The Darling Strumpet: A Novel of Nell Gwynn, Who Captured the Heart of England and King Charles II by Gillian Bagwell
Nell Gwynne is a ragged ten year old when she watches King Charles II make his triumphant return to London in the Spring of 1660. London is rejoicing following the end of Cromwell's rule, and the city is soon to become the debauched centre of Europe. Into this world of prostitution and corruption young Nelly makes her way, first as an orange seller in the flourishing theatres, and then as one of the first female actresses.
Nell is a lively and very popular attraction, and as such is the focus of incessant male attention, but it is her relationship with King Charles that will alter the course of her life forever.
The book is a beautifully written and lively romp through Restoration England. Gillian Bagwell has captured the very essence of the period with a charm and wit that keeps you turning the pages.
The Darling Strumpet is saucy, and sexually explicit throughout, but overall the humour and the sheer joie de vivre shines through, and emphasises the utter glory of being alive and young in one of the most glittering of Royal courts.
I'm delighted to discover that Gillian will have a new book The September Queen out in the US in November 2011, and then published later in the UK in 2012.......and there are already plans for a third book about Bess of Hardwick.
I' ve been recently reminded of one of my favourite childhood books, which led me to think about other books that influenced my younger years..
So here they are in no particular order, but all made a lasting impression, and no doubt fostered my love of reading...
Written in 1937 - it won the Carnegie medal for the best children's book - features the Ruggles family who are poor, and very ordinary, and yet are filled with zest for life...and had amazing adventures.
The Rudomin family is arrested by the Russians and exiled to Siberia. This tells the story of survival against all odds.
Smith is a pickpocket ragamuffin cruising the streets of London, who gets tangled up in a murder investigation when he becomes the chief suspect.
The Owl Service is a stack of grimy old plates stuck in the attic. Uncovering the mystery of The Owl Service, Alison, Roger and Gwyn get caught up in long buried secrets.
A boy's own tale of smuggling, contraband and illicit danger set in 1757 - it was the inspiration for many games of "smuggling" when I was a child and on holiday amongst the cliffs and caves of North Wales.
What's really reassuring is that all these books are still very readable today.....and have stood the test of time.
I was delighted to be given the opportunity of reading this book for the Transworld Book Group Reading challenge.
Whilst studying in London, Anil and Lina meet and fall in love. Yet they come from very different backgrounds; Anil is a non-practising Sikh from a wealth Kenyan family, and Lina is a devout Muslim from a middle class family in Birmingham. Lina’s parents want her to marry a Muslim man of their choosing and as a result Anil and Lina are destined to keep their love secret, as predictably fate conspires against them. Theoretically good, the novel encompasses a whole range of conflict, not just the frustrations encountered by the star crossed lovers, but also the effect that post 9/11 had on the world’s larger arena.
The book’s stunning cover and the promise of a 21st century Romeo and Juliet sold the story to me. I so wanted to love this book, but struggled with it from the beginning, and whilst acknowledging the writer’s talent I have to say that I didn’t enjoy the book as much as I expected. I found the narrative cumbersome and quite confusing in places, and by the end of the story didn’t engage with either Anil or Lina enough to care what happened to them.
I was delighted to be given a copy of this book to review for newbooksmag. I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but this one really did appeal to me , and I wasn't disappointed once I opened the book ...
jaffa's rating 4paws - he'd love to learn French, and has been practising purring in a French accent !
A small box filled with the keepsakes of a past life is the premise for this beautifully narrated book which is based on the author’s own interpretation of a discovered box of treasured mementos. This quirky story has been weaved around a lost world of love letters, photographs and keepsakes, and collectively offers a whole new story perspective.
When American academic Trevor Stratton is given the box of relics by his colleague, Josianne Noireau, we are introduced to the life of Louise Brunet, a young Frenchwoman who lost her first love during WW1, and who now lives a vicarious life in post war Paris. The story is dotted throughout with illustrations, and small snippets of intimate information, which together form a story filled with romanticism, and visual appeal.
I loved the way the book was presented, from the French chapter headings, to the availability of QR codes for my Smartphone, all help to make this a deliciously different story, which at times feels like you are reading a very personal memoir.
My feeling is that this book will appeal to readers who enjoy interactive narratives, and who are searching for something “ just a little bit different".
I was delighted to be given an early reading copy of A Means of Escape to review for bookdagger real readers.
On a cold November morning a woman’s body is discovered on Glastonbury Tor. Detective Inspector Rob Brown and his colleague Detective Sergeant Kate Linton head the murder investigation. When a second woman is abducted in Glastonbury, there are real fears that the killer may have struck again, the only problem is that the mystical community around Glastonbury creates more questions than answers.
This is an accomplished debut novel, with good character analysis, and a well driven and gutsy plot. There is enough information about the investigative process without it being too cumbersome, and some genuinely funny moments which help to lighten the mood. I especially warmed to both lead characters – the details of Linton and Brown’s separate personal lives adds a nice dimension to what could develop into a strong partnership. The added frisson of a “will they, won’t they” atmosphere to their relationship, makes the book all the more enjoyable to read.
It is refreshing to have another British female crime writer on the scene, and I am pleased to discover that this is the first book in a proposed series featuring Kate Linton. I am sure that the series will gain in strength and popularity, and I look forward to spending more time in the company of this gutsy and intelligent detective sergeant.
Take a damaged war hero with a vulnerable ex-wife, add to an impossibly romantic Scottish tower, mix together and out comes this beautiful and tender love story, written by an author who has a real flair for storytelling, and who quite simply makes a story come alive.
There’s always an air of trepidation when a favourite author brings out a new book, and a fear that it won’t live up to expectations. Not the case with Untying the Knot, in fact I think that Linda has surpassed herself with this one. Beautifully written from the opening page, the emotional depth of the characters, and the amount of love and care that has gone into the narrative, make it a joy to read.
When Agatha Raisin sells her London based PR business and moves to the sleepy English village of Carsely, she expects to have a quiet and uneventful life. However, when she enters a local baking competition with an illegal quiche , she unleashes a catalogue of events which will have disastrous consequences for some of the villagers.
I rather enjoyed this whimsical murder/ mystery - there's some lovely eccentricities that just leap off the page. Unexpectedly, I find myself hooked enough to want to read more, and have already ordered the next two books in the series.
When Sloane arrives at his London home on his release from prison, he finds a letter from an ex lover asking him to visit her because she is ill, and needs to tell him something. This information takes Sloane to America in search of something which will involve him in danger and heartbreak.
I always enjoy John Harvey's stand alone novels just as much as his detective series . This one has more emotional depth, and is rather more gritty. The action mostly takes place in the US which he describes very well.
Reading a Nora Roberts book is like settling down in your favourite armchair with a packet of chocolate biscuits !

Heartland Contractors of MN, Inc. offers full design and building services for projects of all sizes and prices points.
Likewise, if you opt for a plan like our StarTex Power example, but in some months only hit 990 kWh of energy use, the $35 discount for cresting $1,000 kWh won't apply — and your bill is going to show it. Picking the right plan for you requires two things: an intimate knowledge of your home’s typical energy use, and a critical eye on any plan’s fine print.
Determining the validity of these allegations ultimately rests on the shoulders of the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT), which has acknowledged “concern” over the reports. However – as a retail electric provider committed to responsible, transparent operations – we at Think Energy believe it’s important for Texas energy consumers to understand the issues at hand before entering into their next supply agreement.
4. Know your current contract terms. Before you shop, know what you already have. (Surprisingly, most people don’t.) What’s your kwh rate? Check your electric bill. It may be higher than what’s available elsewhere. (In Texas, last week it ranged from 4.9 cents to as high as 13.5 cents.) Also call your provider and ask for the date your contract expires. Find out whether your rate is fixed or variable. Start planning a possible switch a month before a contract expires.
Final switch tips. When you make your final selection, don’t call your current electricity provider to cancel. Sign up with the new company only. Try to sign up at least five to seven days before your plan expires so the overlap between the two billing cycles is negligible. Some people switch too late and pay higher prices during the transition. If you have a smart meter, the state rule is you must be switched within 48 hours. But five to seven days is safer.
Because of this exemption, it's possible to move throughout the state and live under different rules pertaining to your right to choose energy supply. If you're moving to a deregulated area and are just now experiencing your right to choose an electricity provider, it can be a confusing process. But we can teach you how to switch power companies for a smooth transition. Enter your ZIP code above to determine whether you live in a deregulated area.
Due to the increased usage of natural gas immediately after deregulation, new-era energy tools such as wind power and smart-grid technology were greatly aided. Texas' first "renewable portfolio standard" — or requirement that the state's utilities get a certain amount of their power from renewable energy like wind — was signed into law in 1999, as part of the same legislation that deregulated the electric market.
5Green energy plans are supported 100% by Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) that are purchased and retired in an amount sufficient to match your annual consumption. RECs are a tradeable, non-tangible energy commodity in the United States that represents proof that 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable energy resource like biomass, hydro, solar or wind. Please see your Terms of Service for more information.
The local electric company is the utility – that’s the company who owns the infrastructure, including the poles and power lines that deliver electricity to your home. They are who you call if your power goes out or there's an emergency. But in almost every city in Texas, you must choose another company to supply that energy, called a Retail Electric Provider (REP). These REPs, like Spark Energy, allow you to choose electricity plans that offer competitive prices and plans to meet your needs.
The 797-horsepower 2019 Challenger SRT Hellcat Redeye, which Fiat Chrysler unveiled this week at its Chelsea Proving Grounds, is successor to Dodge’s Demon has slightly less horsepower, but is still potent.
“I have always been a wine enthusiast. That doesn’t make me an expert. Let’s say, I’m someone who knows how to appreciate the good things in life. The wine scene is fascinating because it allows you to meet some marvellous people, like the day I met Steve Ledson who owns vines in Sonoma. It just so happens that Steve also heads up a children’s charity, the Harmony Foundation for Children. One morning he contacted me and asked me if my new album – called ‘Be Here Soon’ – could become the name of one of his wines. The aim was for the proceeds to go to a good cause.
I had known Steve since ‘Tucker’ was filmed because it was shot on his property. As you know, Francis Ford Coppola directed it. During filming, Francis and Steve would host tastings for us. I started to get a taste for it and vowed to create my own wine one day in Santa Barbara [Ed. Jeff has since then sold his company]. Quite honestly, the result was not great. At best, the wine tasted like grape juice, at worst, it was like vinegar! It’s at times like these that you realise you don’t become a wine grower overnight!”

Opener John Campbell believes working hard on his batting in recent times was the primary reason behind his century yesterday for the Jamaica Scorpions against Trinidad and Tobago Red Force in their sixth round of the CWI-Digicel Four-day Championship at Sabina Park.
The stylish left-hander, in recording his third hundred at the first-class level, belted 155 after resuming the second day of the encounter on 14, as Jamaica, after starting the day on 16 for none, closed on a comfortable 318 for four in their first innings.
Trinidad and Tobago, who won the toss on the opening day, scored a creditable 243 in their first time at bat.
"It's a lot of hard work that I have been putting in," said Campbell, whose previous best knock was 135.
"Since returning to the team after the West Indies 'A' team series against Sri Lanka, I have been getting starts, but been converting. Thankfully, however, this game, and this innings, I have,'' he added.
Resuming with his overnight partner, Trevon Griffith, who eventually made four, Campbell was a picture of poise and panache as he reeled off a number of classy cuts and drives.
He also shared in two valuable partnerships. The first was 157 runs with Brandon King, who in matching Campbell at periods with fours and sixes, went on make 63, while the second consisted of 89 runs with captain, Paul Palmer, who is not out 68.
The in-form Fabian Allen, who is coming back-to-back unbeaten centuries, is the other not-out batsman. He is on seven.
"It is my biggest century and I like this one the most," highlighted the 24-year-old Campbell. "It is also my first first-class century at home, and for that I am really happy.
"It was just me being myself, being positive and picking the right balls. I also choose my bowlers to attack and picked areas in the field to score, and didn't try to go over the men on the boundary, and I think I did well for the most part.''
Meanwhile, looking at the state of the game, Campbell said the Scorpions had the upper hand, and come the third day, he hopes they will be able to drive home their advantage.
"We are in a pretty good position. We have a sizeable lead now of 70-odd with six wickets remaining, with two batsmen who have been in form for us this season at the wicket.
"It's also good to have gotten two batting bonus points in the innings so far, as batting bonus points could play a role for us towards the back end of the season.
"If we could therefore get another two batting bonus points by reaching 400 or 450 runs in our first innings, that would be good for us. Also, any lead of over 100 would be good,'' he added.

With a Mediterranean influence, the Illyria lamp is rich in detail. The central "bead" is laminated in 8 sections of curly maple, separated by walnut inlay. Bigleaf maple burl and walnut medallions are set on each section before turning. The neck and base are similarly sectioned in walnut. The neck section is rough turned to profile, then hand faceted to create a sweeping octagonal shape and to mirror the octagonal plinth. The plinth ring is laid up with the wood's end grain to the outside to add variety in the wood figure.
The conical shade is recommended with this lamp. Panels can either be light (alkyd) or amber (shellac) mica. Also available are birdseye veneer panels. Wood veneers are infused with clear penetrating epoxy and laminated to sheer fiberglass cloth to stabilize and inhibit cracking.
Lamps and shades are fine sanded, oiled to bring out the figure, and finished in catalysed lacquer for a durable finish.

...on the shore of Matanzas Bay, St. Augustine, Florida... sits Castillo de San Marcos... the oldest masonry fort in the United States. Designed by Ignacio Daza, the fort was constructed by Spain between the years 1672 and 1695. The fort was briefly named Fort St. Mark, during the English occupation of Florida from 1763 to 1783, until it was returned to Spain, which held on to it until Florida was ceded to the United States in 1821. The fort was then occupied by the United States Army and named Fort Marion. In 1924, the fort was deactivated and declared a National Monument, its name reverting back to the original "Castillo de San Marcos"... and turned over to the United States National Park Service in 1933.

Eventually, Nadim mustered the courage to ask the coach of the girls’ team if she could play, a decision that unwittingly put her on a path to becoming one of the best strikers in the world.
Long before Nadim starred for Sky Blue FC in the National Women’s Soccer League and brought Denmark to the cusp of qualifying for this summer’s Women’s World Cup, she kicked her first soccer ball in the unlikeliest of locations: the walled garden of her childhood home in Kabul, Afghanistan.
Her father, Rabani, was a progressive man. The Taliban had seized control over the country in the fall of 1996, declaring Afghanistan an Islamic state and immediately banning women from employment; education; venturing outside the house without male supervision; laughing loudly; wearing anything white or shoes that made noise; being seen in public uncovered by a burqa; and, of course, playing sports.

Aging is inevitable but with a proper skin care regimen you can delay the signs of aging and keep your skin looking healthy and beautiful. One of the first signs of aging is the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Dark spots, enlarged pores and loss of skin elasticity are some of the other signs of aging. Loss of skin elasticity is one of the major reasons that a person looks older than his/her age. When the skin loses elasticity, the skin tends to sag and this is more noticeable along your jaw line and under your eyes. The best way to prevent this is by not only keeping your skin hydrated but by doing regular facial exercises. Limiting sun exposure and wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen also helps in preventing skin from sagging.
If you are already suffering from sagging skin then there are lots of products available in the market that you can use. But before trying out these expensive beauty products, you can try some home remedies for skin tightening by using ingredients that are available in your pantry or refrigerator. Here are some skin tightening home remedies that you can try.
Sandalwood Mask: Apply a mask on your face by making a paste of sandalwood powder with pure organic rose water. Wash the mask off with cold water when it gets dry. This mask will help to tighten the pores of the skin and also tone up your face.
Egg White Mask: If you are going to a party and want a quick skin tightening home remedy, then here is a good option. Crack an egg and separate the egg white into a bowl. Add a few drops of lemon juice and whisk the egg white until it is light and frothy. Use a brush to apply this mixture on your skin and then let it dry completely. Wash off with lukewarm water and you will immediately see that your skin looks taut and glowing. Enlarged pores are also tightened temporarily by this method.
Milk and Honey Mask: Take two tablespoons of milk and add a few drops of vitamin E oil and organic honey. Apply this mixture on your skin and wash off after 10 minutes. This will not only tighten your skin but also help to get rid of tanning.
Cucumber Mask: Grate a medium-sized cucumber and extract its juice. Add two tablespoons of rosehip oil into the cucumber juice and apply this mixture with the help of a cotton ball. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes and then wash off with cold water.
Banana Face Pack: Mash a ripe banana and apply this all over your face and neck area. Leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes and then wash off with cold water. Mashed banana is a very good anti wrinkle treatment as well as one of the most effective ways to tighten skin at home.
Aloe Vera Massage: Massaging your face with fresh aloe vera juice also helps to tighten the skin and provide hydration.
Sugarcane and Turmeric Mask: Another good skin tightening home remedy is to make a mixture of sugarcane juice with a tablespoon of fresh turmeric juice. Apply this mixture on your skin everyday to get the best results.
Tomato Juice Toner: Cut a tomato into half and rub the cut portion into your skin in gentle circular motion. Wash off your face with cold water. With regular use you will find that your skin looks brighter and the pores are also greatly reduced.
Orange and Grape Mask: Mash 4 – 5 grapes and mix its pulp with freshly squeezed orange juice. Apply this mixture on your skin and leave it on for 15 to 20 minutes and rinse with cold water.
Avocado Face Pack: Scoop out the pulp of an avocado and add two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil into it. Refrigerate the mixture for half an hour and then apply this on your face in an even layer. Wash the mask off after 20 minutes and rinse with cold water. The avocado not only tightens skin but also hydrates and moisturizes your skin leaving it smooth.
Yogurt and Lime Face Pack: Make a skin tightening face mask by mixing 2 tablespoons of thick yogurt with the juice of a freshly squeezed lime. Apply this mask on your face and allow it to dry completely before rinsing with cold water.
Papaya and Blueberry Pack: Another great face mask can be made by mashing a piece of overripe papaya with a few blueberries. Papaya will help in exfoliating the skin and blueberries contain antioxidants that helps in fighting free radicals that damage the skin.
Before you try out any skin tightening products or consider laser skin tightening, it is best to try out some of the natural ways to tighten skin. In addition to these treatments, you should also drink adequate amounts of water to keep your body and skin hydrated. If you suffer from stress, go for yoga and meditation and also reduce the intake of coffee and tea. Have a healthy diet with a proper exercise and beauty regimen and you can keep skin aging at bay and have wrinkle free, smooth and supple skin.
In 1970s, a helpless atmosphere was flowing in Asagaya of Tokyo, Japan. Abe (acted by Kenji Mizuhashi) lived with Miyoko (acted by Mary Machida) and got attention by his art comic work “Miyoko asagaya kibun” (English title: MIYOKO).
But Abe was gradually coming to a dead end in his creative way because he lost the border between his private life and the world of his work. Then, he became a schizoid and repeated to stay in the mental hospital.
The editor (acted by Shiro Sano) who worked for a legendary art comic magazine “Monthly Comic Garo” could not give up Abe’s talent and visited Abe’s place.
[Cinema Today Film News] “Miyoko Asagaya Kibun” (English title: MIYOKO) which is a nominee for VPRO Tiger Awards of the 39th International Film Festival Rotterdam was screened officially on the spot. Even though it screened early in the day, 10:30 am in the morning, most of seats were filled with audience.
The film brought the Best New Actress award to Mary Machida, a leading actress, in the 31th Yokohama Film Festival, is decided to reshow in Sangenjaya Central Theater in Tokyo from March 6th, and is spreading good valuation slowly. In the spot, Rotterdam, the film is now widely talked of as a possible Grad Prize due to the good complicated story of the short fiction comic work whose model is a cult comic artist, Shinichi Abe’s wife and his real life.

The comic artist, Shinichi Abe, is the model who has published his works centering on the comic magazine named “Garo” since ’70s. The film is reflecting a binding relationship between a main character, Abe himself, and his wife based on Abe’s works which draw the relation with the wife without reserve. The film including humor and eroticism attracted Korean audience. In the screening process, the film gathered high valuations with words “the film is outstanding with the expression of mixture of falsehood and truth and Miyoko’s portrait which supports the artist, her husband Abe, with selfless devotion.

Durgadas speak about Ramdev bringing back Traditional Yoga of the Vedas, as opposed to the western pasteurised Yoga systems.
There are some changes in modern India. Baba Ramdev has given Yoga a new resurrection and along with this, PM Narendra Modi has started transforming the nation and also is sympathetic to sciences such as Yoga and Ayurveda.
While Baba Ramdev has been criticised for much in India, his views and teachings on Yoga and Ayurveda have brought back to India, the same kind of resurgence that we saw back in the 12th Century AD, with Hatha-Yogis such as Gorakshanatha and others who started this tradition, based on the ancient aspect of Dhanurveda or Vedic martial arts (lit. "The science of the bow". )
Sri ‪‎Gorakshanatha inspired Bappa Rawal and his ‪‎Gurkhas (named after Gorakshanatha) to go west and defend India against attacks of Arab and other Muslim invaders.
To accomplish this, the forceful or ‪‎Hatha-‪Yoga was taken up, as it was by Parashurama thousands of years beforehand in southern India, to train warriors with flexible muscles and systems as ‪brahmacharya (celibacy) and shat-kriyas (cleansing actions) to retain their vitality and cleanse their bodies to avoid any wavering from dharma while fighting and being impervious to distractions of sex or women or other allures, which made them single-focused powerful "super-warriors". The militant Gurkhas later migrated into Nepal. ‪Krishnamacharya, the Guru of ‪Iyengar himself learnt from a Gurkha in the Himalayas in the system of Hatha-Yoga that has been populated across the globe as the "Mysore" and other schools. It is people like the Rajputs and Gurkhas today, like the southern Kalari masters, who are the people traditionally created and cultivated through Hatha-Yoga.
It was hence also used, since time immemorial, to cure various diseases. Along with this was also developed the science if Rasa-shastra or Alchemy, the science of Mercury (rasa or parada). This dates back to the Rig Veda and the various Soma preparations that were both mineral or alchemical and also confections (avalehas, rasayanas). Both Sushruta and Charaka Samhitas by 1500BCE also mention use of heavy metals and mineral preparations. These were often used along with Yoga therapies for more difficult and so-called incurable diseases and disorders.
I don't believe there is really an asadhya (incurable) disease. In ‪Yoga, the higher side of ‪Ayurvedic healing, we can choose to prolong the body and heal anything or choose to allow the body to die. Much depends on our state in karmic evolution and our personal situations. Many Yogis rejuvenated their bodies and is stated some, like Chauranginatha even grew limbs, let alone healing of organs and such. Others as Chyavana reversed the aging process through ‪rasayana (rejuvenation). All is possible. Sadly however, this higher or para-yoga is hardly unknown today, giving way to the commercialism of Yoga! The Ashwins here however, are also the pranic and other keys to this, through their symbolism embodied in the Rig Veda (note my book Ashwini Rahasya).
What Baba Ramdev however has brought back to India and the world is this sacred synthesis of Yoga and Ayurveda as sister-sciences as an integral science. His knowledge of aspects such as prana is also important. Deep within the recesses of the spiritual sushumna-nadi in the spine also lies the pranic-nerve, of which, when disrupted, can cause diseases. The body requires oxygenation of the blood and also organs, of which our current tamasic lifestyle smothers. We have bad prana or air in our facilities - we use electrical forms of heating and cooling, what to speak about such dramatic drops in temperature do to out health directly (such as stepping out of an A/C room in India into 30 degree heat!). Remember that climatic and seasonal changes affect health in such manners also - yet we deliberately change these in our lifestyles and cause diseases - what to speak of the false quality of air (polluted inside and out). The ancient world also had more trees and forests to propagate better atmospheres and performances of Agni-Hotras and larger-scale ones (known as Ashwamedhas - which are not horse-sacrifices!).
The personal Ashwamedha was actually an offering of pranayama into the inner-fire to purify it (prana-shuddhi). Ashwa is also a Vedic synonym for prana, medha meaning both wisdom and also implying an offering. Horses also personified indriyas or senses, as in Kathopanishad. Here, their offering was represented by various animals and limbs symbolically, that was later taken more literally (see my article No Meat-Eating in the Vedas on this note). Most Vedic mantras, in fact, can be used and turned into pranayama-mantras and when intoned correctly, can also purify out nadis or subtle nerves and meridians in the body, the subtle channels behind disease.
Some have doubted Ramdev's claims that Yogic techniques can cure renal failure, AIDS, cancer and other severe diseases. Such criticisms usually also include a bias towards allopathy and it's false application of dietary and specific regimes. For disorders as Sciatica and Arthritis for example, which surgery is an option, but not a definite cure, analgesic drugs are it's best "cure". Digestive disorders such as Crohn's and Coeliac, it has little hope for, as also advanced Diabetes, whereas Ayurveda and Yoga first look at dietary factors and ahara - what we are taking into the body in forms of toxic foods.
As an example, the classical texts tell us that damage near marmas or vital-points, even surgery or heat - says Sushruta, can cause damage to the organs they relate to. The feet are connected to the nerves in the eyes. I have found a number of people suffering from Glaucoma and Cataracts, upon questioning, have had acupuncture at some time on their feet for other ailments. Acupuncture has short-term positive effects (like allopathy), but long-term deranging effects. Ayurveda looks at the long-term. There are also traditional or classical medicine practitioners in China, outside the common TCM system, who argue that Mao and others doctored such systems (while it was used in some communities, as also in India).
The issue is that modern medicine derived a great degree of its background from the ancient Greek and Ayurvedic systems, the latter of which came into the West possibly as early as the Greeks, who had contact with India long before the Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great, and also translations of later texts via the Arabs, which included the transmission of Indian knowledge such as integers, zero and the numerical system, as well as advancements in astronomy and other areas of mathematics.
Yet, the West, at least since Constantine and the invention of Christianity, has only had a partial-system, which further became reduced. Important techniques such as Yoga were rejected, as also the rational approach of Ayurveda towards fields such as psychiatry (of which Ayurveda also includes spiritual aspects, with both spiritual and rational treatments, but symptoms differ). While the Church adopted the purely spiritual approach and a Catholic remedy for this (exorcism), the rationalists in Europe rejected all spirituality and ties with the Church, it's arch-enemy and went purely rational. Both sides however were extremes, while Ayurveda took the middle-ground, encompassing both sides, but in a more sophisticated and elaborate manner, which exists to this day.
As a result, the approach of disease in Ayurveda is more complex. Ayurveda pioneered many advancements in modern medicine, such as the diagnosis of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, surgical clips for the bowels by using ants, anesthesia, vaccination against smallpox, plastic surgery of which the British first noted in the Mysore wars by southern Ayurvedic physicians and was later taken up by Joseph Constantine Carpue who introduced it into Britain, cataract surgery and surgical removal of kidney stones, among others. If we also carefully examine the Ayurvedic classics, we note the preliminary and post-operative procedures were much more complex and involved more patient care and rest than we allow today with out quick-fix culture, aimed at freeing up hospital beds, rather than patient recuperation. There is also little in the way of rejuvenation or rasayana, the science of the celestial Soma.
Even Yoga itself, the West has turned into a chiropractic-model and a culture or lifestyle for the elite, rather than one aimed at transcending the ego! In most cases, Yoga teachers take up Yoga, as with Pilates and other trends as Zumba, to adapt to the materialistic chardonnay-socialist culture of cheese and wine, over austerity, service to humanity and deep dedication. Concepts such as bhakti or devotion and surrender to a deity, let alone pujas or offerings and reverence of the deities and Rishis of tradition are reduced down to to a few pictures or pretty-statues of Shiva-Nataraja or Ganesha in a room. Asana or posture is quickly taken up, dismissing the deeper value of preliminary limbs such as yamas and niyamas that actually took traditional Yogis decades - sometimes lifetimes, to master (which is why many tried to prolong the body to live 1,000 years or reduced their karmas and assumed multiple births in continuation). The idea of the Ten Sikh Gurus of Sikhism and the Dashavatara or ten incarnations of Vishnu in Hinduism also reflect this, representing mastery over the 5 yamas and 5 niyamas of Patanjali. Yoga today also has no dharana - no concentration, as there is no pratyahara - no withdrawing from (toxic) influences.
As I explain to students, while many talk about ahimsa, how can one really go to the next yama, let alone jump to asana, before first understanding it's complexity, which includes daihika (bodily), vachina (spoken) and manasika (mental) ahimsa or non-violence, not just to others, but to one's own body? Unless we adopt the pratyahara of abstaining from foods, substances and actions or lifestyle regimes that are not agreeable to our Ayurvedic Prakriti or constitution, our Manasika Prakriti or mental constitution and our Vikriti, our disorders - how can we state we know about and have actually perfected the first tenant of Yoga - ahimsa? Are we not doing harm to the body?
Take an example. The number of people I see that I speak about incompatible food-combinations causing ama or toxins and others such as avoiding cooking honey (which is toxic when cooked to the body), that are amazed and violate these rules, is astounding. Simply reducing these, alcohol and red meats in our diets is a start - even if we don't eat for our dosha per se (which this is recommended!). Most Yoga teachers and circles with a wine culture are actually daihika-himsikas - those who cause injury to the body and thus violating ahimsa!
Ahimsa is also not about non-injury alone. It means we should not attack or injure another party and try and avoid it at all costs. However, if we are attacked, we must take up arms to defend ourselves, such as examples as Arjuna, Sri Krishna, Sri Rama, Hanuman and even the Brahmin Parashurama show. The Rishis also defended themselves, as we see with the wars of Vasishtha vs Vishwamitra! If we perform non-action and do not fight or stand up for dharma - the foundations upon which ahimsa rests, society's ahimsa wanes and is uprooted, such has occurred in South Americans who have lost their traditions to Catholicism and the Middle-East and Central-Asia, which have lost theirs to the aggression of Islam. India however, revolted - starting with the actual science of Yogis themselves with militant-Yogis as Gorakshanatha, Rajputs and the Gurkhas. This science began with Parashurama himself and the asanas or postures formed, as they did with Gandharvaveda or music and dancing, part of the vyayamas or exercise-regimes for warriors, for agility etc. in battle. While used to cure diseases, it was tailored.
I began practising Yoga at a tender age of about 8 or 9 years old, when I began taking up martial arts. I did not wait until my thirties and decide that I wanted to become a Yoga teacher - what is really an asana teacher! I still have no ambitions for such. This is also the point here - we have forgotten the true foundations of Yoga-dharma itself and westernised Yoga, molded it into the fabric of allopathy and turned it into a culture of bodily-preservation for vanity, rather than the Yogic view to extend our lives in order to work out our karmas. There is also still, even in western Yoga circles, a reluctance for this self-responsibility of oriental faiths and still a culture of blame on the outside world for our weaknesses and failures, for our own actions we cannot come to terms with. Such is also due to what I class as the "Christocentric samskaras", the cultural residual substratum of almost 2,000 years of Christian-dominated thinking. It is much like a turmeric stain - one can wash and wash, but in vain, as some residue still remains of the yellowish hue!
This is where Baba Ramdev comes in. His Yoga is the original Indian-Yoga system that isn't a synthesis of East and West, it is a powerful and energetic thunderbolt of tradition that is at odds with the ego of western views of Yoga and how Yoga 'should be'. While we have the western experts from Max Muller to Michael Witzel who believe no Indian knows their own Hindu history better than they do as they look at it from afar - so also we have our bored housewives in the West with their Country-Club cultures who believe Yoga is however they see fit (reminiscent of Pentecostals and Southern Baptist preachers!). By contrast, Ramdev's Yoga is one of practice and personal effort, the result of which, if adhered to, is highly rewarding, both spiritually and physically!
And that is the difference between East and West - personal effort vs effort of others. The West, including the Arabs gained their riches by plundering the wealth of other nations and then turning cultures against each-other, deeming them as heathens, while stepping back and not admitting any foul-play on their part. This ranges from the slavery of Blacks in the Americas to the Aryan-Dravidian divide and Aryan-Invasion Theory of India and racial theories. It is venomous in the Western mind to accept one's own actions have resulted in anything but instruments in some fantastical "divine plan"!.
Criticisms of traditional Yoga will remain, especially with traditional and outspoken teachers as Ramdev and others. This is as, once again, the personal effort of the orient clashes with the silver-platter culture of the west. We can see this in hardworking Indian and east-Asian migrants in Western countries who do better in business than local residents, due to their work-ethics, compared to the laziness of the west, by comparison, especially British colonies! Much was the same logic that underlined the Nazi fascism and hatred of Jews in Europe. It was more jealousy rather than hatred - more based on a Christocentric sense of entitlement rather than gains due to personal works or efforts and actions (karmas), on both a physical and spiritual level.
The Arab and Turkic plunder of temples in India was also similar. Islamic invaders could not imagine how such wealth and opulence, such magnificent buildings and riches were in a nation of "heathens" or pagans, compared to their own God-beloved culture of Allah! As a result, it must be that Allah requires the plunder and destruction of such people and their evil riches, taken forcefully instead for his chosen people across Central Asia and the Middle-East! Thus, this underlying logic, while removed from religion, is still present today in the western minds, Middle-Eastern and European! It is a samskara hard to scrub-out and is masked by a pseudo-acceptance of Yoga, Ayurveda and such, as well as a culture of reinventing such in the West, as a sign of cultural dominance over the Indian, as was also historical!
This is also why such egos, especially those clones of such Victorian attitudes in India - where they perhaps are best preserved today more than anywhere else, clash with the likes of Baba Ramdev! We must also remember that Baba Ramdev forms a part of the Arya-Samaj Movement in India, started by the Vedic reformer, Maharishi Dayananda Sarasvati. A powerful opponent of Islam and Christianity, he was a first to include a detailed criticism of these faiths in his work Satyarth Prakash (The Light of Truth) and also expound the Vedas along symbolic lines as opposed to those of the 14th-Century Sayanacharya and western scholars as Muller who followed his lead. He was also the first to proclaim Swaraj or Self-rule for India and Hindi as the national language - long before Gandhi. Many Arya-Samajis lost their lives in independence struggles, long before Gandhi ever came on the scene. Scholars such as Sri Aurobindo were also profoundly influenced by Dayananda and his Vedic wisdom, including his claim of ancient technology in the Vedas:
"‘ There is then nothing fantastical in Swami Dayananda’s idea that the Veda contains the truths of science. I will even add my own conviction that the Veda contains other truths of science which the modern world does not at all possess, and, in that case, Swami Dayananda has rather under-stated than over-stated the depth and rage of the Vedic Wisdom. Immediately after the character of the Veda is fixed in the sense Swami Dayananda gave to it, the merely ritual, mythological, polytheistic interpretation of Sayanacharya collapses, and the merely meteorological and materialistic European interpretation collapses. We have, instead, a real scripture, one of the World’s sacred books, and the divine word of a lofty and noble religion’."
"In the matter of Vedic interpretation I am convinced that whatever may be the final complete interpretation, Dayananda will be honoured as the first discoverer of the right clues. Amidst the chaos and obscurity of old ignorance and age-long misunderstanding his was the eye of direct vision that pierced to the truth and fastened on that which was essential. He has found the keys of the doors that time had closed and rent asunder the seals of the imprisoned fountains."
There were also many Western scholars who appreciated ancient Indian thought and philosophy, who also included J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nikola Tesla, Carl Jung and even Friedrich Nietzsche! Today, Physicists such as Fritjof Capra and Fred Alan Wolf have also looked to ancient Indian philosophies for answers to modern scientific questions of the wisdom of the ancient Yogis!
With such strong personalities behind Ramdev however, it is hence unlikely he will be silent, if we has a point to make. And why should he? The ideals of the modern world that Yogis are soft-spoken, jovial and silent on political issues certainly do not match the great teachers of Yoga's tradition such as Parashurama, Rishi Yajnavalkya, Bhishmacharya and Sri Krishna, who were very outspoken personalities and also political figures in their own right!
While the civilised aspect of debate existed in ancient India with philosophers as in ancient Greece, we expect that modern Yogis do not debate, and we accept, without question, their words and criticise others in the media. Such is the asuric form of debate, bereft of the Vedic tenets, which include pratyaksha (direct perception), anumana (inference), upamana (comparison) and shabda (spoken word / scriptural evidences or aitihya - historical accounts), not simply who can shout the loudest or hurl the most insults or defamatory columns in the Hindustan Times!
We also forget that Ramdev is a man who lives a Yogic lifestyle and has helped hundreds of thousands of people across the globe with his Yoga camps. His hospitals in India and Yoga mission has also been a blessing and has also helped Indians realise what Yoga actually is, to take it up, and also the glory of Ayurveda, beyond a mere few village herbs! He has released many classical preparations and has rejuvenated Ayurveda in Northern India, especially in urban areas which are becoming increasingly westernised and destroying their native roots. Others such as Dr. Partap Chauan of Jiva Ayurveda have done great efforts to bring Ayurvedic remedies to the masses in India through the TV media, as Ramdev has also done.
For me, Baba Ramdev is not simply a great Yogi and Guru, but also epitomises what it is to be a Yogi. I have seen this in the spirit of Sri Aurobindo and also Maharishi Dayananda and Swami Vivekananda. It is not a silent personality, but what Dr. David Frawley (Pandit Vamadeva Shastri) calls an "Intellectual Kshatriya" or warrior.
This is about Hindus standing up for what they believe in and defending the dharma, not simply bowing or caving into peer-pressures of the modern world and its perverted and materialistic changes. In medieval India, it was also the Brahmins who preserved diligently, the ancient Vedic teachings, against all odds. It was the likes of Manidhara and Sayanacharya that dared to write commentaries on the Rig Veda, thousands of years after the Brahmanas and Yaskacharya. It is this Yogic spirit that has immortalised Hanuman, Parashurama, Sri Krishna, Shivaji, Maharani of Jhansi and the Sikh Gurus and martyrs. It is not about sipping wine and telling your students about ahimsa and the greatness of Gandhi (which appears to have been taken from Ben Kingsley's role in the movie than reality!).
A Yogi is not a conformist - he is a rebel. he exists outside of society, as the sannyasi - one who has renounced all ties. Sannyasa also means a comatosed-state in Ayurveda, which refers to one's loss of consciousness from the ordinary, which is also represented by both the mission and vision of the Yogi.
Baba Ramdev, like the ancient Vedic Rishis as Bharadvaja, Vishwamitra and Vasishtha is a political figure, a spiritual guide, a Yogi, an Ayurvedic practitioner and upholder of the sacred Vedic traditions, by definition of the authors of the tradition itself, not of the fantasy of the modern mind! As such, we can ask for no better defender of the Yogic faith and for Hinduism itself, which denies nobody - as the Cochin Jews and the largest number of Zoroastrians (Parsis) who exist now in greater numbers in Mumbai, not their original homeland of Iran! It is this spirit of defense, instigated by Gorakshanatha and the Hatha-Yogis that saved these people and provided preservation and refuge for both India and others, that embodies the real spirit of Yoga by tradition.
And if Baba Ramdev is guilty of that, of which he is, then let him remain a rebel and trouble-maker, for he is possibly our closest living example of Yoga's personification or avatar today!

Took a short and quick weekend turnaround trip to Kuala Lumpur in the mid of August. It has been about one year since the last visit.
To begin the trip with a slight flight delay on a evening flight out isn’t much of a good thing. The flight despite being 30 minutes delay from the scheduled 9:15pm departure was retimed to 9:145pm. Hence, arriving at KL at 10:45pm. Took an hour to clear immigration and manage to get some light food as there were shops still operating and Glad there was the option of KLIA Ekspress to KL Sentral. It would have been wise to stay at the hotels near KL Sentral – such as Hilton KL; if take evening flights out. However, being a first time evening travel out, that was something I had miscalculated. So I took a Grab ride to the Holiday Inn express KLCC.
Kl has always been a place for food and shopping. However, it doesn’t stop at shopping for me. It’s worth checking out how shopping malls are doing – especially Pavilion and lot 10.
Visited Jogoya (Starhill Gallery) for their buffet lunch (RM122 per pax), and had seafood dinner at Kai Seng Seafood Restaurant.
So at the end of the trip, was a smoother ride back with the convenience of in-town check in at KL Sentral for Malaysia Airlines. If you are taking Malindo Air or Cathay Pacific, this option is available too.

Calculate interest only mortgage payments by inserting the appropriate loan values in the calculator fields below. The monthly savings on interest only loans may be significant compared to traditional fixed rate mortgages so you owe it to yourself to learn more about the benefits & risks of interest only home loan programs.
What is an Interest Only Loan? An Interest-Only loan is a home loan program where you have an option to make "interest-only" payments for a defined period of the loan. The term "interest-only" does not mean not mean a consumer will never have to repay the principal amount of the loan. Usually there is a term in which you will pay only interest. After that term, you would then have to pay both interest and principle. Interest only loans generally use a variable interest rate.
I try to write a short essay or two every day. I have been doing this for at least a decade. Sometimes I work on my poetry. This takes WAY longer. For anyone who attempts this art form, who is not blessed with The Gift, my heart goes out. You wake up in the middle of the night with ONE word that insists on inserting itself into your poem, and that changes the entire energy of the verse. Oh well. Maybe that's why you will notice I am wrtiing essays late at night, because once the Muse wakes you up in the middle of a succulent dream, insisting that you must add that one word, she departs leaving you wide awake and essaying.
All this got me wondering...Maybe I should try to write day essays. No better time than the present. Today it's pouring here in Asheville. Great day to take some time off. So, follwoing my own sage advice, I wrote today's essay for Active Rain...e a r l y.
OK! I don't care, I will post my great essay on how come real estate professionals need to know about GREEN STUFF. I don't care about the Points! I care about getting the word out to my colleagues. BUT wait a minute. If I value what I have to say, and I think YOU who read what I have to say might value it, shouldn't I refrain from posting this amazing peice until Monday? when it can get the credit it deserves? Isn't this a test of how I value myself?
What if I applied this lesson to my real state practice? Shouldn't I NOT work with people who do NOT value me and what I have to say? A Relevant Topic this week here on the Featured Side. http://activerain.com/blogsview/17188/-Murphy-s-Law What kind of Muse hangs around during the day, anyway?
Here's what I want to know...Can I still get a STAR? if anyone happens to read this, can you still give me a star?
I think I shall return to my nighttime ramblings. I'll save the non-pointed days for rants...and HUMOR.

Hidden in the center of Sioux Falls is Kenwood Manor Apartments, one of the city's cleanest, quietest, and best kept secrets. The park-like setting is enhanced by the calm and quiet atmosphere.
Kenwood Manor Apartments are located in the west central part of the city with direct access to 18th Street, just six blocks west of Sanford Hospital. The complex is set far back from the 18th Street thoroughfare with no through traffic, making this an isolated island of quietness.
Kenwood has great access to everything in the city. Sanford Hospital is just six blocks away, and the V. A. Hospital is four blocks. Avera McKennan Hospital is just ten minutes away, just off of 18th Street. We are also close to Augustana University and the University Of Sioux Falls. Sherman Park, the bike trails, W. H. Lyons Fairgrounds, and the new Sanford Events Center are all in the neighborhood.
Built in 1950, these buildings are constructed of concrete and steel throughout. Every wall, floor, and ceiling is constructed specifically with noise reduction in mind. Sound transmission from apartment to apartment is virtually nonexistent.
Kenwood has been around for over 65 years, so consequently, the grounds are full of mature trees and well-established vegetation. Kenwood Manor gives you the feeling that you are living in one of Sioux Falls’ older parks.
Facebook marketing is incredibly popular today and for a good reason. With over 1.39 billion users, all signs point to right now as the time to be on Facebook with your business, as there is good chance your audience is on there. Pay attention to these five tips from the pros if you want to take Facebook marketing by storm and you want to increase your profits like never before.
To gain more traction on Facebook, you need plenty of new fans. Use a referral code and give your loyal customers a discount whenever they tell a friend.
Everyone loves free and it’s amazing how people will come out of the woodwork the moment they hear the word. If you want to attract more Facebook fans and loyal customers, give your audience something they can use and don’t charge for it. An e-book, e-report or video tutorial series filled with tips, tricks and advice work best. Once you’ve hooked them with your free offer, that’s when you can offer your up-sell item to really ramp up your profits.
Remember to use your keywords in your posts, on your profile, in your Facebook ads, in the articles you share and on everything else. While Facebook posts don’t show up in Google, Facebook does have its own search engine. Facebook will also ‘recommend’ your page to like-minded individuals. Use your keywords and use them often when Facebook marketing for better results.
Your Facebook business page should make your fans feel as though they’re part of the club. Make your page interactive and get your fans involved. Have a video contest where your fans can upload their own content and you can pick the best one. This is a great way to get everyone involved and they’ll be more likely to stick around even after the contest is over. Facebook marketing is about being social. Form your own unique community with your fans and your competition won’t stand a chance against you.
For best results while Facebook marketing, tie everything together; your website, your Facebook business page, your Twitter feed and any other online presence your business may have. Facebook is an excellent tool for marketing, but the platform really pops when you can create the ultimate Facebook experience. If you can create a completely new online atmosphere for your customers, visitors and fans, you will keep them on your page longer and they’ll be more likely to convert.
These five Facebook marketing tips can be used by anyone to ramp up exposure and profits using the social network. Visit [How To Use Facebook Ads For Business & Add Sales].

Villains, you gotta love 'em. After all, the most heroic stories are those that involve beating the vilest of villains, and having a great antagonist is often what makes the story worth telling in the first place. Villainous takes a completely different twist to be original, instead of being the hero, you get to play the role of the villain. And thus beings your quest to raid towns, attack castles and ultimately, raise as much infamy across the land as possible.
A true evil mastermind should always remember that the end goal is the most important thing of all. It is not how wicked, or cruel, or mischievous you are, it is about getting your goals done. And for the most evil wizard in the world, you have a very simple goal to finish: successfully raid towns over and over again. To do so, you must successfully send your goblin raiders into the heart of the human's settlements and have these little buggers do your dirty work for you. But in between your goblins and the human's treasure-filled coffers, you need to deal with a ton of defensive tower structures that are armed to the teeth with a variety of weapons designed to send your troops back in a body bag.
The game looks a lot like a tower defense game, and in many ways, even the concept is the same. But what differs is the side you are on. Instead of building towers and upgrading your defenses, you are the one sending in goblins, golems and other creatures -waves if you will, that are all aimed at only one thing: raiding human towns. Goblin raiders are not exactly the best units to send against a well defended town -after all, all they can do is pillage, plunder and philfer. To help keep them alive, you need to send in specialists and probably toss in a few supportive evil spells of your own.
And thus comes the strategic portion of the game. Villainous requires its players to think carefully when it comes to sending in troops. You cannot just send in a regiment of 12 goblin raiders and expect them to hold out well against a rain of arrows and cannon fire. You will need to bring healing casters, golems that emit a protective aura, turtles that distract enemy fire, and many more abilities that will ensure that your raiders make it to town in tip top shape (or basically, alive).
There are three main phases in the game: upgrading, deployment and attacking. For the upgrade phase, players must delegate and portion their infamy points for buying upgrades. Upgrades will do a variety of things ranging from unlocking new spells to improving troop stats to increasing your army size and more. Naturally, it is best to focus upgrades on skills and features that you actually use in combat. The game will provide plenty of chances for farming infamy in the later stages, but it is still best to be careful with the use of your resources.
The deployment phase is actually a lot trickier than one would think. Here, you will be able to decide what troops you would be sending in. Each troop type has its own specialty and purpose and ultimately, your main goal is for all the support troops to be able to keep your goblins alive. Making sure that your formation is working successfully towards this goal is a combination of luck, skill and preparation. The most difficult thing to consider here is the fact that once you decide on a final deployment scheme, you can no longer alter the arrangement and positioning of your army. The key here is to focus on a setup that will not just withstand a few waves, but one that has plenty of staying power. Try to foresee which units are likely to die first (usually the turtles) and plan ahead for how the arrangement of troops will work once the first ones fall. Also, another thing to consider here is the area of effect for your units with aura bonuses. Healing and defensive auras are crucial for helping keep your army alive and kicking for many waves, so be sure that they cover the right units when you send them out.
Try to prevent your gold plated jewelry from being in contact with detergents, perfumes and lotions and be careful with excessive friction. To keep your pieces full of brightness you can occasionally rub them using a dry cloth. In case you notice the gold is damaged, do not worry, you can always gold plated them again. Don’t forget my jewels are handmade and they might present slight differences compared to the original design in the picture.

Almost everyone who ventured west past 40th Street during our time at Penn surely remembers the phrase, “See You in Church!” uttered by Joe Murphy, aka Murph, of Murphy’s Tavern fame as you exited the bar late on Saturday night (or early Sunday morning). Situated at the northeast corner of 44th and Spruce, Murphy’s Tavern was a favorite local and campus bar. We asked classmates to share their memories.
He was always happy to see us….gave a great deal on pitchers and what was that red drink we got there? I don’t remember what it was called.
Julie: Yes! The Skylab! The bar was gross, but Murph was always happy to have us (even those of us with bad fake IDs).
What can I say about Murph and Murphy’s Tavern? It was the quintessential bar, and one my friends and I preferred over any other establishment around campus. It had everything we wanted from a bar, and nothing we disliked. Memories are hazy at this point, but I distinctly remember that there was always great music. It wasn’t small, but it wasn’t so big that you felt like you couldn’t see and interact with everyone there on any given night. It had the perfect balance of intimacy and yet wasn’t too claustrophobic. It had zero pretension, but wasn’t a dump — it had the perfect vibe, and I would have been thrilled to find a bar exactly like Murph’s at any point in my 20s to hang out in. Murph’s had an iconic and unique drink, the Skylab, that was the perfect drink for college students because it was not too expensive, it was full of alcohol, it tasted great, it had a great name, and was indigenous to Murph’s and only Murph’s.
Over everything, though, Murph’s had Murph, who was the quintessential Irish bar owner. Friendly, gregarious, always welcoming of his regulars, but happy to have newcomers. Anyone coming into his bar immediately felt at home. Murph had a great schtick, mostly because it wasn’t schtick for him, it was completely and totally authentic.
Josh sent this photo saying, “I’m disowning my friends for not including me in this picture. I was with them at Murph’s that morning, so I’m not sure how I missed being in this photo, but I will never fully forgive them.”
Murph’s “See You In Church” that he said to everyone as they left his bar may have led to Jef’s eventual marriage to his wife, Deb Brown. As I recall, Deb was a columnist for the DP, and named her column “See You In Church”. Jef and I didn’t know Deb at that point, but we thought her picture was cute (as much as one could see of a one square inch black and white photo in the DP), and that she had to be super-cool to name her column after Murph’s tag line. Jef eventually pursued Deb, and the rest is history. I don’t know if Jef and Deb consider Murph responsible in any way for their relationship, but I wouldn’t be surprised to know that there are many couples who are still together who met in some small or big way because of Murph’s. What held true for Jef and me looking at Deb’s column still holds true today — anyone who “got” Murph’s was our kind of person, and that’s all anyone can ask for from their favorite college bar.
What happened to Murphy’s Tavern? After multiple Liquor Control Board violations, Murphy’s was forced to close after a judge refused to renew their liquor license in January, 1997 (as detailed in this DP article). Now the location is the site of Local 44, a “neighborhood beer joint.”

Jewish Issues Watchdog: Media solidarity with murderous Palestinian knife-wielders, mixed with callousness towards innocent Israelis' lives
Media solidarity with murderous Palestinian knife-wielders, mixed with callousness towards innocent Israelis' lives
October was a bloody month in Israel, with over 50 terror attacks, mostly involving stabbings, but also using firearms and vehicles.
Many of the Palestinian perpetrators died in the attacks, some were teens, motivated by religious incitement and lies concerning the site known as al-Aqsa to Muslims and Temple Mount to Jews.
“What we have witnessed these past weeks has looked like solidarity with murderous Palestinian knife-wielders, mixed with callousness towards innocent Israelis' lives.”
Here in London, the past few weeks have felt like a veil was lifted over political-correctness and a veneer of journalistic practice with regards to Israel. This was no Gaza operation, not a drone war, nor an exchange of unequal firepower. The facts were clear and simple: Israelis, from children to the elderly, were being murdered in broad daylight in towns across the country.
Yet the media does not seem to get it right even under these circumstances. Headlines still run as "Israeli police shoot Palestinian", then change to "Palestinian shot in knife attack", and again to "Woman who planned knife attack shot dead" (she didn't just plan it, she actually carried it out). An Israeli whose car is stoned with rocks steps out and "pays with his life for attacking Palestinian trucks", while a terrorist "becomes seventh Palestinian killed by security forces after Jerusalem stabbing".
All of the above headlines are real, and all were subsequently corrected; some of them undergoing three or four different versions, reflecting the clear fact that editors understood that they did not make sense, simply did not reflect reality on the ground. Yet these corrections ensued, week after week, as if media outlets were unwilling to accept reality and forgo their automatic mode of reporting on the region, in which Palestinians must play the role of victims, and Israelis the aggressors.
Anti-Israel groups also seemed confused by the situation, and so they did the only thing they know how to do − call for a protest outside the Israeli Embassy. Under the vague banner of "Protest for Palestine", last week we saw the familiar scenes of Hamas and Hezbollah flags, and of people telling an Israeli journalist that "all Zionists should be killed". Thankfully, his equipment wasn't trashed this time, as it was in last month's "peaceful protest".
Countless headlines were corrected this month, nearly one for every deadly terror attack in Israel. Meanwhile, Palestinian incitement was dismissed by some as "an Israeli line", a "distraction".
Radical clerics brandishing knives and holding up explosive belts, Hamas spokesmen acting as cheerleaders for terror attacks, and Palestinian radio playing songs of praise to the "martyrs", were of little interest to a media focused only on Israeli actions.
The willingness to disregard reality, to display this level of animosity toward Israel at a time when its civilians were facing a wave of rampant terror, sends a clear message: "Your lives are of no interest to us".
Unfortunately, reality doesn't conform to the attitude of the media, as we've seen in Syria, where civilians continue to die regardless of scant media coverage, or Gaza, whose population continues to suffer under Hamas even today.
When we read headlines focusing on Israel's in-the-moment response to murderous Palestinian terrorism, rather than on the terrorist stabbings and shootings themselves, I wonder precisely what such people expect from Israelis? When a television presenter asks Jerusalem's mayor if carrying a gun to protect oneself from a stabbing wasn't "excessive"? Do they wish for Israelis to passively accept the terrorist's knife in their chest, and not defend themselves lest this provokes another negative headline or protest abroad?
Solidarity and sympathy with Palestinians aside, what we have witnessed these past weeks has looked like solidarity with murderous Palestinian knife-wielders, mixed with callousness towards innocent Israelis' lives.
The work of Javier Riera is based in geometric shaped light projections, striked directly onto vegetation and landscape. He uses photography as a means for registration and spreading of the happening, without digital manipulation whatsoever. Thus, it’s centered in an experience of real intervention onto “the space and time of the landscape”, something that approximates him to the LandArt proposals.
The relation between geometry and nature in this work adquires a meditative character, appealing for a coexistence between the public and the suggestive power of the modification of the landscape of which it is being witness, that aspires to expand its perception by reaching out towards qualities and dimensions that are hidden from the spaces in which it occurs. Riera understands geometry as a natural language previous to matter, able to establish with it a sort of subtle and revealing resonance.
In the last few years his work has broadened its records with site specific projects and temporal interventions in open spaces such as the one carried out at the gardens of Turia in Valencia, where eleven of his light projections remained installed during two months. Other interventions have been performed in MUSAC or Photoespaña.
Born in Avilés, Asturias, Javier Riera studied Fine Arts in Salamanca. Between his most important exhibitions stands out the one that took place in the Museum Reina Sofía in 2008.

Ireland had an outstanding autumn which started with a historic victory over the All Blacks in Chicago, and although they were beaten by New Zealand two weeks after that, the result is a significant one.
They also managed a win over Australia and thrashed Canada in their other two internationals over the course of November.
The pack was outstanding, tireless defence with pace and aggression was the foundations for the win in Chicago. The set piece is also a very strong part of the Irish game.
Ireland do look well ahead of many of their opponents with England looking like the only other realistic title contender after strong years for both sides.
In the forwards CJ Stander just keeps improving, his defence is powerful and his attacking runs are extremely important, puncturing holes round the fringes, making the hard yards for his club or country.
Robbie Henshaw is well and truly in control of the Lions midfield as we head towards the Six Nations. The centre is a proper centre, strong on the ball and a distributor able to open up space for his dangerous wide men.
Ireland only have two home games but they have the massive advantage of playing England in Dublin, that is a hugely beneficial result for Ireland. The trips to Cardiff, Edinburgh and Rome should not pose too much of a challenge.
Ireland will feel they can win this tournament and Joe Schmidt will be targeting a Grand Slam, the game against England will likely be a tournament showdown to decide the champion what a wonderful way that would be for Ireland to cap a truly outstanding year. South Africa, defeated, New Zealand defeated, Australia, defeated, England, maybe.

There are a number of star names in the Bristol camp, a man with Gavin Henson’s CV is always going to be a talented player pair that with the new duo of Jordan Crane and Tusi Pisi and the squad has quality.
Bristol have a creative backline led by Samoan fly-half Pisi and the creative midfield should give space to the pace and flair of the quicker players out wide such as former Leicester and Wasps winger Varndell.
The pack is match for most Premiership sides without having any big names and lacking internationals. They should not encounter much in the way of trouble.
The playmaker has it all as an inside centre, he kicks, passes and tackles well, his pace is not quite what it used to be as he enters his mid-thirties but his playmaking ability make him a valuable player.
Henson also brings international experience and a big game knowledge to a team lacking much of that, he is among a splattering of internationals brought in by Andy Robinson to help Bristol acclimatise to the high level Premiership and Challenge Cup games they will face.
A ferocious tackler who’s size makes the tackle area a really difficult area to establish any dominance against the Bristol skipper. This coupled with effective breakdown work sees the Bristol captain dominate the immediate tackle situation.
Lam is also no stranger to attack and is more than happy to pop up on the inside shoulder of a fly-half to terrorise opposition tens.
Varndell is an absolutely unbelievable finisher, up there with the likes of Cueto and Hanley he can score from anywhere due to his pace. He adds some ‘X Factor’ to the Bristol backline.
The 30 year old will be Robinson’s main attacking outlet this season, and it is a joy to ahve the talented winger back in the Premiership.
Tusi Pisi is a good signing providing them with talent at fly-half. Arscott also has a lot of top level experience making him a clever capture along with number eight Crane. Everyone knows what Tonga’huia is capable of.
Genge is a hot prospect and will be missed especially as he is now gaining recognition from Eddie Jones. Mama is a good player and could have been hugely influential for Bristol. What a way for Dwayne Peel to end his career and a glittering one at that.
15 Luke Arscott 14 Tom Varndell 13 Will Hurrell 12 Gavin Henson 11 David Lemi 10 Tusi Pisi 9 Will Cliff
They have some seriously impressive backs such as Christian Wade whose speed is just incredible, the young centre Elliott Daly is also a massively talented player. Dan Robson has become an exceptional scrum-half and even overtaken Joe Simpson in the Wasps pecking order.
Wasps eagerness to play expansive rugby is admirable and the way they use their playmaker to open space is remarkable. The wide spaces are there to attack and Wasps do this perfectly using the power of Halai and the pace of Wade.
The balanced midfield last term was perfect however the recruitment of Kyle Eastmond and Kurtley Beale suggests a move away from a 12 in the mould of the now retired Ben Jacobs or international Siale Piutau.
Hughes is a key man for Wasps at the line-out and open play. The number eight can make metres for the Wasps using his frightening turn of pace. His ability to change a game make him invaluable.
His incredible form has seen him called up to the England squad after qualifying on residency in July although Eddie Jones sees the giant Wasp as more of a flanker than a number eight.
The Springbok star joins Wasps on a short term deal and as currently one of the best counter attacking fullbacks on the planet along with Israel Dagg, Israel Folau and Stuart Hogg. He has electric feet and blistering pace.
le Roux also has quality in the air with a great ability at diffusing a situation using his powerful legs to control the skies.
The winger is absolute pace and his speed has seen him on the peripheries of England on more than one occasion. He can beat defenders one on one no problem and his appetite for scoring tries is insatiable.
Defending remains a concern but make no mistake Wade is still brilliantly exciting as ever and he remains a constant threat.
Two signings from the southern hemisphere stand out in the shape of le Roux and Beale adding real star quality. Danny Cipriani is also an impressive coup for the club. In the pack England hooker Taylor and Ireland prop Moore should bring some stability to the scrum and Symons is brilliant in the air. Furthermore captures of de Luca and Eastmond add depth to an already frightening backline.
The departures of George Smith and Piutau will hurt as they were by far their best players last season. Davies will also be a loss and it is sad to see Masi, Jacobs and Downey into retirement. The losses of fly-half duo Jackson and Lozowski could hurt Wasps.

All six European giants travel south this June to take on some form of opposition whilst England, Wales and Ireland all have three match test series, Scotland and France have two matches against their hosts and Italy have three assorted matches.
Italy have three tests this summer to see where they really are after a scathing Six Nations campaign in which they were thrashed by Ireland, Wales and England whilst also losing to Scotland convincingly and coming ever so close to France.
They face a very tough test against Argentina firstly before playing the USA and Canada. The Argentina game should be the hardest match for Italy, a fantastic World Cup campaign and with their Super Rugby franchise, los Jaguares playing well Argentina are in good health.
Italy seem to have found a new general at fly-half with Carlo Canna, a talented fly-half, he has some real pace and is not afraid to take on defenders using his pace and skills to punish defenders.
The man in midfield is able to direct play as well as he showed against France, his brain is switched on and making up his little partnership with Gori is exciting Italian fans.
Gori had an indifferent Six Nations and you could argue that Palazzani is the man to take Italy forward, his distribution was certainly slicker than Gori’s and he offers a turn of pace that Gori is simply incapable of.
One other back that was stand out is Michele Campagnaro, the Exeter centre was powerful using his upper body strength to swat away defenders that were left trailing in his wake.
Campagnaro is key player for Italy on this tour if he stays fit Italy have a prominent ball carrier in the backs, the backline can be built around him and add something to the traditionally strong pack.
What has not been said about Sergio Parisse, the leader, a man that is Italian rugby, he can at times try too hard to be the hero as was evident against France with his wayward drop goal.
Elsewhere in the forwards, lock Biagi looks an exciting prospect, the giant lock was athletic in the line out and has a high work rate around the park.
My Italy 23: 1 Andrea Lovotii (Zebre) 2 Davide Giazzon (Treviso) 3 Lorenzo Cittadini (Wasps) 4 George Biagi (Zebre) 5 Joshua Furno (Newcastle) 6 Francesco Minto (Treviso) 7 Simone Favaro (Glasgow) 8 Sergio Parisse (Captain, Stade Français)
In recent years it’s been too much about this powerful yet rarely effective forwards game. If France are to become a world force again they need to get back the flowing rugby, the backs scything open defences with ease. They certainly have the personnel.
Maxime Médard, what a player, dazzling feet, electric pace and an eye for the half gap. The fullback is a really high quality player and one man that can change the game given half a gap.
Another mesmerising talent is Wesley Fofana, once the greatest inside centre in the world, now confined to the odd start for his country after this change in strategy which has coincided with a downturn in form for France.
The centre has the most unbelievable step and grace that can turn players inside out or stand them up in spectacular fashion. He has to be playing for France come the tour to Argentina.
Those are just two men who will have to be at their best if France are to get anything in their tour to Argentina.
Argentina will feel they have this series won, two tests against a poor French side should be a win for the Pumas.
That powerful pack and a backline with the likes of Cordero and Imhoff in it is a pretty scary prospect for France and their new coach Guy Noves as they visit South America.
The best player over the course of the Six Nations was most definitely fly-half François Trinh-Duc, every time he came on he changed the game, he is a sensational talent. he kicks well out of hand and the attacking game he brings is unmatched by any other option the French have.
In the forwards there is just one player that has been a top player for them, that was Toulon hooker, Guilhem Guirado. The skipper epitomised the determination of a France side wanting to be the side they used to be.
He led by example over the course of the championship, an undoubted talent at hooker, he excelled as captain and will be key if France are to win this tour.
My France XV: 1 Eddy Ben Arous (Racing) 2 Guilhem Guirado (Captain, Toulon) 3 Rabah Slimani (Stade) 4 Sebastien Vahaamahina (Clermont) 5 Yoann Maestri (Toulouse) 6 Damien Chouly (Clermont) 7 Bernard Le Roux (Racing) 8 Louis Picamoles (Toulouse)
The Sunwolves have also recently claimed their first scalp over the new Argentine franchise, Japan have a growing rugby pedigree, Dom Day the latest European star to join the Japanese top tier, a league saturated in money.
They are growing and with players like Tanaka and Goromaru in the backs and Leitch and Mafi in the forwards they have real pedigree and will provide Scotland with a real test in June.
Scotland seem to have discovered a set of strike runners to add to Glasgow star Hogg they now have Seymour and Visser two extremely talented wingers. They also have some great ball players in the middle of the park.
Bennett is becoming a real asset, his pace make him a seriously valuable player to have at 13 and with a selection of players to have inside him, the midfield is becoming really strong and depth is developing.
Laidlaw is a wonderful leader and has given Scotland some direction in terms of leadership, his goal kicking is up there amongst the world’s best. He also doubles up as one of his country’s best playmakers.
In the forwards the double act of Jonny and Richie Gray is something that really cannot be overestimated, the locks are sensational coming round the corner and are quite brilliant at the lineout and they provide some real drive at the scrum.
Richie has for years been an important part of Scotland’s engine room but it seems as though Jonny is going to be even better, he is being tipped by some as the next Scotland captain.
Scotland will have a real test on their hands against Japan, the improving ‘Brave Blossoms’ will want to continue to build on their win over South Africa. Scotland did beat Japan at the World Cup but a test in the far east is a much tougher ask than beating them on a one off in England.
A defining series for both sides, Scotland could show some real intent to become one of the leading sides in the northern hemisphere and Japan could show they will be a ‘Tier One’ nation. June will tell us the full story.
My Scotland XV: 1 Alisdair Dickinson 2 Ross Ford 3 WP Nel (all Edinburgh) 4 Richie Gray (Castres) 5 Jonny Gray 6 Josh Strauss (both Glasgow) 7 John Hardie (Edinburgh) 8 David Denton (Bath)
CJ Stander was a revelation over the Six Nations, a powerful carrier able to power over at least on defender, his offloading game can also open space for the quicker men such as Bowe or Zebo.
The Munster flanker will come in for some competition in the back row which looks very strong for Ireland at the moment, especially at blindside.
Another revelation was Ultan Dillane at lock, the 22 year old has been huge for Connacht in their awesome season. Dillane is looking like the real deal and with the likes of McCarthy and Toner stepping up due to the loss of Ireland legend O’Connell, Dillane is the up and coming star of Irish rugby.
A playmaker may take some searching, Sexton is getting on a bit but his all round game is still superior to the majority of options available. Sexton’s kicking game and attacking ability is quite something.
Teenager Ringrose is making quite a splash down in Dublin at the moment, his turn of pace and good hands make him a contender to join the touring party in South Africa. Starting is unlikely looking at the options Ireland have available but exposure to the elite squad can only aid his development.
The aerial ability of Rob Kearney is still unrivalled and his ability to break the line make him a good asset if the Irish back row can force teams to kick long. He really is the definition of a strike runner, against a heavy South Africa team with a kick chase game he could be hugely influential.
South Africa will be a high pressure environment, they place a huge onus on the kick chase and with wingers like Habana you can understand why. The breakdown will be really tough, Louw, Alberts, Burger are all powerful and strong at the breakdown, Ireland will have to try and combat the green Springbok machine.
Another challenge for Ireland will be the altitude, Johannesburg’s Ellis Park is the stadium furthest above sea level in the world at 1,753 metres. The game in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth should not be as much of a problem.
The effects of the altitude can be a real challenge, Johannesburg will see Ireland facing nausea, anaerobic breathing which will increase the build up of lactic acid and other adverse effects on the body as well as a very tough South African team.
Ireland will believe they can win in South Africa and last year they were in a good place and most certainly the strongest of the northern hemisphere but after the Six Nations they have had it is not looking promising.
My Ireland XV: 1 Jack McGrath (Leinster) 2 Rory Best (Captain, Ulster) 3 Tadhg Furlong (Leinster) 4 Iain Henderson (Ulster) 5 Ultan Dillane (Connacht) 6 Peter O’Mahony (Munster) 7 Sean O’Brien (Leinster) 8 CJ Stander (Munster)
If Wales can rattle the All Blacks in the first test and they crumble the series win is on for Wales. New Zealand have some really exciting talent coming through though and with players like Israel Dagg also looking red hot this task is not an easy one.
Definitely the most settled squad of the squads touring and with veterans such as Sam Warburton, Jamie Roberts and Luke Charteris. The experience could give them a real edge in the first test should the All Blacks be undercooked.
Wales’ George North has been out of form for Northampton for the vast majority of the season but he did look at his best in the red of Wales during the Six Nations. Wales will look to get the ball to him as quickly as possible especially if he is up against a lightweight winger for example Habana.
Dan Biggar has emerged as the best fly-half in the northern hemisphere following a very strong Six Nations and consistent performances for his franchise, the Ospreys. Biggar’s attacking game either from kicking or him taking the ball to the line make him a real threat.
Roberts has been outstanding his powerful running lines make him a deadly threat, he proved that against Scotland. His size allow him to punish defenders is he is allowed to get up to speed. If he is marked closely and hit hard he will come down.
In the forwards there is the awesome Faletau, the Dragons eight is an absolute machine he moves fast and is powerful. The back row is certainly key to Wales and he will be relishing a battle with the unbelievable Kieran Read.
Samson Lee looks to be the answer to all Wales’ prayers at scrum time since the loss of Adam Jones. Lee is becoming a world class prop and although he is not the quickest around the park his set piece work make him dangerous.
Fekitoa and Ngatai look to be making up for the loss of Nonu and Conrad Smith who have left to go and make their money in France.
The All Blacks are a team to be wary of, they are a tough side to beat even though the stars of Nonu, Carter and McCaw are gone. The depth is scary and with players like Ardie Savea, Beauden Barrett and Ngatai waiting in the wings they are not short on talent to come in for the stars.
My Wales XV: 1 Rob Evans (Scarlets) 2 Scott Baldwin (Ospreys) 3 Samson Lee (Scarlets) 4 Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys) 5 Luke Charteris (Racing) 6 Dan Lydiate (Ospreys) 7 Sam Warburton (Captain, Cardiff) 8 Taulupe Faletau (Dragons)
Australia are back to being one of the world’s best and despite the majority of their franchises struggling they will be tough to beat for any side and although they won the Grand Slam let us not forget they are still learning to work with Eddie Jones as head coach.
England have riches aplenty in the backs, Alex Goode is in scintillating form, his attacking game is something to behold, one of the few Saracens players to have that flair and with that gives his strike runners like Ashton space to score the tries. A varied kicking game is also very welcome in a back three which will likely be all out pace.
One of Bath’s positives this season has been the rising stock of Anthony Watson although he is better deployed at fullback than wing with Goode in such good form it looks as though the youngster will be playing at wing for the duration of the tour. His electric pace and lightning footwork is something that is frightening for the rest of the league.
In the pack it looks as though England have nailed their second row pairing with George Kruis and Maro Itoje looking like the real deal, both are strong in the air and powerful in the scrum, their work rate is just incredible and they will be key in Australia.
Another Saracen, Billy Vunipola is a hugely influential player for England, his impressive outings for England during the Six Nations will mean the Australians will know what he can do. The number eight raw power and defensive capability will see him ripping into the heart of Australia to open space out wide that with the runners England have they can exploit.
Hartley, the contentious captain, he led England by example kept himself squeaky clean thought the campaign and handled the media duty very well. His performances spoke for themselves, his work around the park was evident and the set piece was almost flawless.
Australia do have their own threats one of which being Israel Folau, an athletic powerhouse and with the likes of Kuridrani and Mitchell around him Australia are not short on fast players.
In the forwards players such as Hooper and Pocock have under performed in Super Rugby, they will likely improve in time for the tour but the way they have been playing will not fill Cheika with hope.
They have a scrum to be feared now after years of struggling to get to grips with the complex art of scrummaging they now have a front row that are both powerful and capable when it comes to scrums.
My England XV: 1 Joe Marler (Harlequins) 2 Dylan Hartley (Captain, Northampton) 3 Dan Cole (Leicester) 4 Maro Itoje 5 George Kruis (both Saracens) 6 Chris Robshaw 7 Jack Clifford (both Harlequins) 8 Billy Vunipola (Saracens)
England face three tests down under in the summer against the team that knocked them out of the World Cup and if they are to win what will be a testing series a few things will need to be ironed out from the Six Nations performance.
The 19 year old is currently plying his trade across the Severn having left Gloucester to play in Wales for three years. He has quickly established himself as one of the back row superstars of the league.
The young flanker is quick, powerful and athletic and could offer some balance to the England back row joining Robshaw and Billy Vunipola.
Underhill is your typical scavenger back row not unlike David Pocock from Australia, a figure England missed desperately in the World Cup as Australia and Wales beat them at every breakdown.
Verdict: As good as in the squad as Eddie Jones looks to use the exceptional circumstances clause. Cap Potential: 40-50+
The league convert is electric for the West Country club, his turn of pace and electrifying step make him undeniably difficult to defend against.
The centre can beat people one on one but can also act as a second playmaker, having returned from injury recently he looks back to his exciting best for Bath.
Eastmond offers something a little different to Tuilagi or Slade the other two contenders for the 12 shirt that is if Daly is to remain at 13.
He was never given enough of a chance under the old regime it would be nice to see Eastmond cut loose.
Verdict: Depends on who else Eddie Jones takes and if he thinks Eastmond can offer something different. Cap Potential: 15-20
The Fijian number eight qualifies in June through residency which frankly is a ridiculous rule but one that England should make the most of.
The number eight is not just strong but for a big man can shift, he has pace to burn as well as an abrasive edge so can he beat defenders any which way he chooses.
His height also makes him a hugely valuable asset in the lineout, he is sure to provide some competition for the outstanding Billy Vunipola.
The Leicester lock has been brilliant for Leicester this season replacing Parling as he now plys his trade on the south coast with Exeter.
Barrow is making a real name for himself at Welford Road and is surely the type of abrasive forward Eddie Jones is looking for.
Verdict: Unlikely to feature which is a shame but I expect him to make the squad at some point. Cap Potential: 15-20
Another Tiger really impressing this term, his athletic ability is enough to match that of Jamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie.
His form is undeniable the only problem is hooker is such a competitive spot at the moment with Hartley, George, Cowan-Dickie and Taylor also vying for a spot on that plane.
Verdict: The options are just too strong for Thacker to play this summer but by next year he will be a real contender should this form continue. Cap Potential: 30-40+

So England have won the Grand Slam, an excellent achievement for Eddie Jones’ side winning the championship at the first time of asking. So which players impressed during the course of the tournament.
Really powerful in the scrummage, made life hard for all opposition tightheads he faced. He is one of the reasons the Welsh scrum was so good, Gethin Jenkins is not missed.
The English captain has led excellently, awesome in the tight making England’s set piece impenetrable. Always happy to take on the ball himself, a real leader.
The adopted South African has become a hero for Scotland, a scrummaging powerhouse and a rock in defence.
A star has most certainly been born. Athletic, quick, strong the Saracens second row will be an England star for years to come.
The young Scot is on of the reasons for the rejuvenated Scotland side that have impressed over the course of the Six Nations.
The Munster flanker’s carrying has been one of the best things about Ireland’s ultimately disappointing campaign.
He has proved himself after the World Cup where the back row came in for criticism but it looks as though Jones is forging a back row capable of competing with the best in the world.
Undoubtedly the best eight, possibly the best player in the championship. Powerful and abrasive for England. So hard to stop.
Kicked well for his team and led from the front. Laidlaw had his critics but he has been a key cog in the Scotland team.
The fly-half has been absolutely sublime this championship, his attack has been wonderful and he has become one of the leaders in the Welsh team. Bigger is also now among the best fly-halves in the world.
Called slow on many occasions by his critics but has been one of England’s strong wingers over the course of the championship.
The Harlequins centre has been hugely influential for his side over the course of the championship. His power has played a huge part in Wales’ fairly successful last four years.
The centre is up there on the defenders beaten chart and metres made charts. His upper body strength is something to marvel at.
The best attacking fullback in the northern hemisphere, his pace is unbelievable and he has one hand firmly on the Lions 15 jersey.

The Six Nations is looming and this year it looks to be a close run affair as Wales and Ireland will look to build on relatively successful campaigns, Scotland try to carry on their World Cup form, England and France rebuild and Italy attempt to recover from a disappointing autumn.
Ireland are the favourites having won the last two championships under Joe Schmidt, a canny operator and he knows which players get the men in green to tick. To add to the old guard are a crop of youngsters coming through such as Ringrose who could add something to an already strong side.
Wales seem to have built a team that can beat anybody at the moment and with many of their home grown players back playing for a top side has given them optimism even. Warren’s Law could affect them down the line but they still look like they will be mounting a title challenge.
Scotland were one refereeing decision away from a World Cup semi-final, it seems Vern Cotter’s style is beginning to rub off on Scotland as they continue to build. This Six Nations could be a defining tournament for the men north of the border.
England are an unknown quantity under Eddie Jones, he has said he wants to base England’s game around their traditional strengths like the scrum, his selection though seems some very exciting talents in the squad.
France also have a new coach in former Toulouse boss Novés, he has reshaped the team and hopefully can bring back some je ne sais quoi. Saint-André’s pragmatic nature stifled what was once the best team in the world to watch.
Italy will look to this championship as a chance to redeem themselves, the World Cup ran to the script for Italy and saw them crash out after the group once again. They need to find something special if they are to get anywhere near the title this year.
England have faced some pretty tough criticism recently after their World Cup. This lead to the appointment of Eddie Jones.
The squad has been named and has a blend of experience and youth, on paper it looks competitive. If England can get their pack moving forward and pick an exciting backline with distributors and finishers this England team could be brutally efficient.
I expect England to pick up wins in Rome and Edinburgh, they should be routine for this England side. I think playing at Twickenham could give them the edge against wales and Ireland but the trip to Paris looks a game too far for this developing English side.
This Six Nations is a stepping stone for bigger things for the likes of Itoje, Daly, Beaumont, Clifford and Paul Hill. It looks as though they will be key in England’s future joining the likes of Ford, Farrell, Joseph, Launchbury and Vunipola all still young but players that could have 40 to 50 caps come 2019.
France like England have been criticised for not just results but what has been dubbed a boring and drab style in attack and bring weak in defence.
Novés’ first squad suggests a very extreme change in tactics and a more of a swing towards that attacking play we have loved to watch in the past. With the reintroduction of Médard in the backline and Gaël Fickou coming in there is some flair there.
I think France can pick up wins over Italy and Ireland despite the strength in Ireland’s squad I think Paris will be tough to win in. I think they will also defeat England at home. Tough away trips to Edinburgh and Cardiff could be their undoing.
Flair in the backs and power in the forwards could be a glorious combination. This fresh approach could be either brilliant or horrendous. I for one hope that it brings a new era of running rugby with the likes of Médard and Fofana providing excitement.
Ireland won the championship last year and put in some impressive displays at the World Cup including a memorable win over France. This year they look to retain the title.
With Ireland’s squad due to be announced next week at some stage it is a fairly settled image we expect to see despite some high profile retirements and injuries for Ireland to come to terms with.
Ireland should win all three of their home games against Wales, Italy and Scotland. Hoever away trips to Paris and London could be tough games especially as both England and France will be smarting after a tough World Cup.
Among the players Ringrose is an exciting prospect and big things are expected of the centre. Henshaw is in the form of is life at the moment and the pack will see who can fill the void left by O’Connell.
Italy had a disappointing World Cup and still are struggling to give that extra 20% that could take them from also rans to join the top table of international rugby where Argentina now dine and Japan are approaching.
Italy have announced their squad and it really is a mixture of the Italian stalwarts and a few new names as Brunel will try to make Italy competitive it’s a strong enough side.
Italy have two home games against England and Scotland, I don’t think they will win either of those England should have enough to win convincingly and Scotland too. I think repeat heroics in Paris or Cardiff are also unlikely whilst Ireland is a tough trip for any team let alone Italy.
Italy have picked an astonishing 18 players in a 38 man training squad that convened in November in Treviso assuming the squad will be cut with the France and England based players also to be added.
Scotland’s World Cup heroics may be the turning point and rugby in Scotland could be headed for a period of success, this Six Nations they’ll be hoping to kick on.
Scotland are yet to announce their squad but are due to towards the middle of next week. I expect Cotter will retain the vast majority of his World Cup squad who performed so well. There may be a couple of additions after seeing how well Edinburgh are playing this season.
Scotland should be able to beat Italy in what has for a long time become the wooden spoon decider. I also think that at Murrayfield they should be too much for the French. Trips to Cardiff and Dublin are tough and England should be able to beat them.
Scotland’s second row is the frightening Gray brothers who the pack is being built on add to that some pace in the backs they will be formidable opposition.
Wales will be enthused after a strong World Cup that meant they would only crash out thanks to a sumptuous offload from Duane Vermeulen.
The core of the squad is settled and is due to be announced soon although the exact date is not set in stone. The squad will be much unchanged from the team last year.
Wales face tough trips to Dublin and London which I can’t see them winning however they should be able to see off the challenges of France, Italy and Scotland at home. Although Scotland and France could go either way.
Wales have the old guard such as Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones in their ranks they know how to perform on the big stage there is very little room for manoeuvre in the current squad.

Today Eddie Jones named his squad for the Six Nations and his first squad since he took over following the departure of Lancaster.
Eddie Jones was only permitted to make a small amount of changes to the squad that crashed out of the World Cup after three lacklustre, boring, stodgy performances that left England fans questioning who picks the team?
Eddie Jones’ changes include seven uncapped names Paul Hill, Sam Hill, Ollie Devoto, Maro Itoje, Elliot Daly, Josh Beaumont and Jack Clifford. All young vibrant players but you could certainly question the inclusion of Devoto and Sam Hill, both these players however it is important to note are covering for Tuilagi and Slade both of whom would have been included had they been available or fully fit (in Tuilagi’s case).
I question why Jones includes a centre that doesn’t even start for his club. Devoto is often left to ponder the wonders of the universe sat on the bench whilst Jonathan Joseph (included in the squad) and Kyle Eastmond start for Bath Rugby. Surely Kyle Eastmond is a better fit, he has at times this season shown the form of last season, his blistering pace and agile feet make him almost impossible to deal with.
Sam Hill, a strong ball carrier possibly so the loss of Tuilagi won’t be felt too hard by England. His kicking game is also something to admire but with the kicking ability of Ford, Farrell, Daly and Goode already in the squad it begs the question what does Sam Hill have to offer? One player I think does merit a go in the England squad is Australian born Ben Jacobs from Wasps.
The Wasps centre now qualifies on residency and the centre has been playing well, his crash ball running lines and defensive capabilities have complimented Daly well in the midfield for Wasps this year, he would surely add more to the squad than Sam Hill.
The reintroduction of Chris Ashton is a great move, the Saracens wing is scoring for fun in north London and he is certainly a player that is wonderful to watch. Ashton will be hugely influential in this England team and let’s hope he can rediscover that scoring touch in the white of England.
Another winger back in the squad after some time out is Harlequins flyer Yarde. He is fast and powerful, but look at the other options available, Rokoduguni is in fine form for Bath, Lewington is flying for London Irish and Matt Banahan looks like the man he was a few years ago.
Yarde is no better than those three wingers neither is Nowell, Jack Nowell is slow, he doesn’t possess the pace to be an international winger. His talent stretches to being a high level club player but no more than that. He offers nothing to the squad that suggest flair or finishing ability.
The inclusion of Chris Robshaw is possibly the selection that causes the most confusion in my head. I don’t understand how following not only a poor display as an openside, but a shambolic display as a captain can Chris Robshaw remain in the side.
To me he represents all that was wrong with the previous England regime. His inclusion undermines this supposed overhaul we are experiencing.
My final talking point involving the squad is around the much discussed inclusion or exclusion of Danny Cipriani. Eddie Jones opted to leave the Sale playmaker out of the squad, good move or poor decision?
Eddie Jones only selected two fly-halves and looking at the make-up of his squad it is hard to see who he could have dropped to include Cipriani. And to drop either the mercurial George Ford or fiery Owen Farrell would have been a travesty.
Hopefully in the summer on the tour to Australia Eddie Jones will have room for the fly-half but for now he’s best developing his game further and continuing to press the golden boys (Ford and Farrell) of English rugby.
A squad that England can be proud of and hopefully one that can do the nation justice in the upcoming Six Nations.
1 Mako Vunipola (Saracens) 2 Dylan Hartley (Northampton) 3 Paul Hill (Northampton) 4 Joe Launchbury (Wasps) 5 Courtney Lawes (Northampton) 6 Maro Itoje (Saracens) 7 Matt Kvesic (Gloucester) 8 Billy Vunipola (Saracens)
The fact that Ian Ritchie who’s tenure at the Rugby Football Union has been marred by controversy and ultimately failure has only allowed eleven changes is in itself moronic. How can Eddie Jones make his mark on a team full of deadweight that have overseen England’s worst ever World Cup.
As well as the enforced change of Burgess, Henry Slade, Kieran Brookes, Jonny May will all have been changed due to injury. This leaves Eddie Jones with just seven real changes within the squad that can be used to improve.
If we look at replacement options surely Wasps centre Daly has to be included to replace the Rabbitohs star. Daly has proved this season that he has grown in maturity, his running lines are inventive and a breath of fresh air.
He has some real pace probably due to the time he spent at fullback, his pace and running lines have shown some of the best defences in Europe crack such as Toulon and Leinster. Daly’s ability to smash the ball over from 60 plus metres is also a hugely handy attribute in international rugby.
Another man that has to be considered after being practically ignored for there last four years is Kyle Eastmond, granted the centre is not having the best of seasons with Bath who are struggling to regain the form of last season which surely will click at some point.
Eastmond’s dazzling footwork is a joy to behold watching him dance his way through defenders was one of the high points of last season. His electric feet and turn of pace make him a nightmare to defend against.
To replace the injured Jonny May there is only one contender in my mind that man is Saracens flyer Chris Ashton. How many tries does this man have to score to be in the England squad?
He is on fire and scoring for fun in north London with the players inside him offering a few kicks ahead and his knack of popping up in the right place at the right time make him an invaluable finisher, just what England and Eddie Jones may be looking for. He will score tries and plenty of them.
The loss of Brookes who looks to be the next big thing in the England scrum is a shame, there are few players who can scrummage like the Saints tighthead. The only option in my mind is Wasps prop Jake Cooper-Wooley who has done a sterling job up in Coventry.
Due to the lack of real talent at tighthead and the way Dan Cole was ripped to pieces by Saracens pack mean Cooper-Wooley may well be thrown into the deep end in the absence of Brookes.
OUT: Kieran Brookes (Northampton Saints), Sam Burgess (South Sydney Rabbitohs), Jonny May (Gloucester Rugby), Henry Slade (Exeter Chiefs)
My favourite English opened right now has to be Kvesic and with other contenders in the mix like Clifford, Fraser and O’Connor, Haskell also has to go. Kvesic is an unbelievable openside, a ‘traditional’ seven.
He has been brilliant for Gloucester which is why they find themselves in a pretty strong position so far this season. Kvesic has struggled to really break into the England squad despite being around the team for long enough. His turnover rate is astonishing and he’s not shy of a big hit either.
Jack Clifford would be my replacement for Haskell. A lot has been spoken about Jack Clifford being England’s next openside and his skills. For me Clifford is a future England captain and his ball carrying and tenacity at the breakdown see him usurp Haskell.
Nick Easter, what a player. An example to players everywhere to never give up after being told by Lancaster in 2011 he would never again play for England four years later he is playing for his country in a World Cup.
A lovely story but he has to go, and there is only one man to replace him, Maro Itoje. The Saracens man who is just as at home in the engine room is my player of the season so far. His athleticism and leadership skills are making Saracens tick this season. Another contender for future England captain.
Only four changes left and so much left to change with three changes alone going on the back row you can imagine how much more I have left to change.
Rob Webber has to call time on his England career, he isn’t up to the standard at the moment. His replacement fairly straight forward Dylan Hartley also my captain.
The playing side for Hartley is exemplary he is excellent in the loose an abrasive in the set piece a really good player. The behaviour does however border on thuggery at times and although this may seem contradictory this is why he would be my captain.
The hard edge that made Johnson, Dallaglio, Vickery and Back feared not just by the opposition but by the young players in their team for example a certain Jonny Wilkinson is something Hartley has in abundance.
One player that has to go purely due to the fact I feel he has offered little to the squad since his debut back in 2012 is South African born Brad Barritt.
He has not been good enough, hugely influential for his club and solid for England but not spectacular. Rather than induct another centre into the squad I would have a fly-half come in purely because I think Danny Cipriani. It is still a mystery to me how the Sale out half didn’t get selected for the World Cup following a great display in the warm-ups.
His form for Sale has been wonderful and he is the reason his team can compete at such a high level this season for Ford and Farrell to be selected and he be left in the north west would be a travesty.
The one cap wonder Semesa Rokoduguni has to be in the squad, he must be having déja vu after once again a scintillating start to this season. His ability to either bash or dash his way to the try line make him a real asset to whatever team he is playing in be it Bath or England.
He would replace Jack Nowell, yes Nowell has been great for Exeter but the fact is he’s not quick enough to be an international winger. Exeter fans would disagree but look at the other three wingers I have picked Rokoduguni, Ashton and Watson would Nowell really trouble any of them in a foot race.
Scrum-half is a really tough place at the moment for England with four or five contenders for just three places. My choice would be to drop Wigglesworth for Joe Simpson.
Wasps although inconsistent have looked sharp in the backs and the catalyst for that is the lightning quick Simpson. His service isn’t bad either and that earns him a place alongside Youngs and Care.
OUT: Brad Barritt (Saracens), Jack Nowell (Exeter Chiefs), Rob Webber (Bath Rugby), Richard Wigglesworth (Saracens)
Props: Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers), Jake Cooper Wooley (Wasps), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Mako Vunipola (Saracens), Davey Wilson (Bath Rugby)
This weekend two more backs hit the scene competing for places, Ben Spencer of Saracens reminded of the class he possesses but rarely gets to show due to the depth at his club.
The scrum-half was blinding. His kick over the top to send Ashton over was masterful you could even argue perfect.
Vision like that is something you cannot teach. A quick look up after a clever break was all Spencer needed to send his winger away.
He added to this with a try of his own. This was created by his fleeting feet and made him stand out.
In the later Twickenham game there was one teenager who stood out. London Irish centre Johnny Williams was outstanding and scored a brace in a game which showed very little positive for the Exiles.
Williams has an excellent record recently with four tries in just three games bagging two tries in the Challenge Cup with one each against Grenoble and Agen.
The speedy centre’s tries were not that straight forward either, they were quite sensational. The strong fending and bravery of Williams makes him a very exciting prospect.
The fact that every weekend a new name is popping up as a potential England candidate is only promising for the game in this country.
Spencer and Williams are sure to be around for years and if they can continue their current form there is nothing to stop them being England stars.

“Audubon himself would be delighted to read John Moir’s exciting and authoritative account of the difficult, politically fraught but ultimately rewarding effort to save the largest of all the living birds, a great shadow in the sky above the Western range. I certainly was.”
—Richard Rhodes, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, author of John James Audubon: The Making of an American
“Moir deftly chronicles the efforts of the dedicated biologists at the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service who work to save the California condor from extinction. [He] keeps the reader in suspense from the poignant moment when the last wild condor was captured to the triumphant morning in 1992 when the first birds raised in captivity were released.”
“The story grips our attention as a good novel does and will be enjoyed by birders, environmentalists and curious laymen alike.”
“RETURN OF THE CONDOR is an eminently human story. The subject matter—complex and controversial, ultimately heartwarming—demands a skilled and sympathetic writer, and Moir’s chronicle is thoroughly successful in this regard.”
“John Moir’s dramatic account of bringing the condor back from the brink of extinction is a reminder of the fragility of life on our planet and of the capacity of one species, humans, to protect or extinguish all others.”
“Moir, whose prize-winning story for Birding magazine grew into this book, tells of the salvation of the condor.”
“This fine book by John Moir makes abundantly clear why preserving magnificent beings like our once-more wild condors is one of 21st century society’s more important obligations.”

Languages and linguistic diversity, as well as communications and interpretation, has long been one of ICV's main areas of work. This is also the path through which goes the integration process of migrants, at a time where integration is one of the key topics on the agenda in a globalizing world. In its common basic principles, the European Union defines integration as "a long-term and two-way reciprocal compromise between all migrants and residents of the host society". With roughly 4 million new permanent immigrants in the OECD in 2005, ground work is thus urgent and continuous.
This is the context in which ICVolunteers decided to contribute, with an initiative entirely focused on linguistic services for new migrants. ICV's national offices in Spain, France, Switzerland and more recently South Africa are working with the local contexts to develop "Speak to me, speak here". It starts off with a local inventory of institutions and associations providing linguistic support and primary care to immigrants and to foreign refugees hampered by the fact that they neither understand nor speak the local language of the country in which they reside.
After this preliminary study phase, ICVolunteers plans to offer targeted and adapted support to associations which already work in the field of immigration. Through volunteer effort, ICVolunteers can in particular provide language services such as the translation of legal documents, simultaneous interpretation during the migrants' daily administrative undertakings and assistance throughout the person's regularization process.
Convinced by the capacity building approach which aims to provide opportunities, ICVolunteers aims to train already well-integrated immigrants. In turn, they will serve as bridges and effective cultural links between newcomers and the host society.
The project "Speak to me, speak here" also aims to enhance the image of these populations, by giving a new image of migrants: human citizens who are fully integrated in the host country and able to provide their time, like any other volunteer around the world.
Spain has been transformed from a land of emigration to one of immigration at the end of the nineties. In fact, it could presently be considered as one of the main immigration countries within the European Union.
Every year, during the summer months, thousands of people are leaving various African countries. They risk their lives in hopes of reaching the Canary Islands. In 2006, they were over 15,000.
Barcelona, capital of Catalonia and headquarters for ICVoluntari(o)s-Barcelona welcomed a large number of migrants these past years (starting with 74,019 in 2001 and reaching 260,000 in 2006, according to the Catalan Department of Statistics). Unfortunately, this caused a number of cultural clashes, primarily due to the predominantly assimilationist approach. Indeed, the immigrants are expected to abandon their linguistic, cultural and social specificities, to adopt the values and practices of the welcoming society and to blend in with the host country's population, reserving "other" languages and religions to the private sphere.
Benefiting from the close collaboration with Linguamón --the House of Languages--, and the collaboration with the Catalan Federation of Social Volunteering (in particular, its Immigration Department), the Immigration Office of the Catalan Government and the Technical Cabinet of Immigration, ICVoluntari(o)s-Barcelona thus became acquainted with the entities handling the initial welcoming to the municipality (44% of which do not offer any language services). ICVoluntari(o)s-Barcelona assessed both the needs and requirements, then moving on to a more operational phase of the project: it currently is training volunteers interpreters and mediators, offering targeted support to migrants and working on the creation of a tool kit, in order to make this project duplicable elsewhere. Primarily geared towards the Faubourg and Ciutat Vella neighborhoods, the project is now focusing on immigrants, most of whom are women, for the most part originating from Morocco, Pakistan, Romania, Equador and Chili.
With nearly 40% foreigners, Geneva is not only the Swiss Canton with the highest percentage of foreigners, but also the most cosmopolitan one: of 194 possible nationalities, 184 are represented (source: Cantonal Statistics Office). As a result, French is not the main language for 25% of the population living in the Canton. Learning this language therefore remains a key factor for a successful integration. The large majority of migrants who do not speak French or have benefited from little schooling are taking basic French or literacy classes. However, some of them, not working or on unemployment, cannot find any place where they can practice the newly acquired skills. Housewives, elderly people, recently arrived immigrants, the unemployed or those who have not benefited from sufficient language training and are thus left to themselves.
The feelings of exclusion and isolation -- whether real or perceived -- can be reduced with increased communication abilities and possibilities. ICV's Swiss office is currently carrying out an inventory of existing interpretation and accompanying services for migrants in Geneva. Based on this inventory, ICVolunteers will propose additional services, in order to offer linguistic support to migrants, provided by mediators and voluntary interpreters. The aim is to enhance confidence, resolve conflicts and favor positive and fruitful exchange.
Because of its tradition and due to its geographical location, but also in order to deal with the development of its industries, the Rhône-Alpes department and Pays de Gex -- home of the French antenna of ICVolunteers -- have always been a welcoming land for foreigners (Italians, North Africans and Turks). With over 471,585 immigrants in 1999 -- that is 8.4% of its population -- it is the French region with the 6th highest immigration rate after Ile-de-France, the three southeast Mediterranean departments and Alsace.
Inspired by the Spanish model, ICV-France's project is designed to better welcome people in France, using integrated immigrants and volunteers as facilitators and interpreters throughout the daily administrative processes they have to deal with and to help newcomers grasp the importance of mastering the host-country's language in order to understand its social system and to quickly reach a good level of integration.
The support work is designed to assist with administrative processes, access to social services, healthcare and schooling, job seeking, writing resumes, preparing for interviews, putting together the paperwork to create one's own business, and looking for housing.
ICVolunteers promotes volunteerism and its recognition, by enhancing civic commitment and involvement, and by providing leadership and links between organizations, individuals and communities. With this perspective, ICVolunteers develops projects and leads initiatives.

Looking at a few of Miyo’s nude webcam screen grab pics is one thing but having her live and all to yourself is a completely different and better experience. It’s fantasy versus reality…which do you prefer? She can be your personal sexy 18 year-old dress-up doll. If you’ve been following this blog you may be wondering whether or not these nude Japanese girls on cam only speak or respond to Japanese. I’ve had a few people ask me that and the answer is that most of these girls speak or understand English as well as Japanese. Some even can speak and understand German, French, Italian, Chinese, Spanish, Korean and others. Every hot cam girl lists their languages in their profile. One great thing though is that if a sexy girl doesn’t speak your language, you’re not out of luck. There is a very unique translate feature on this site that allows you and her to cross language barriers and enjoy playing together live. For example there are basic things like “how are you?” “you’re beautiful” and of course more erotic phrases and words such as “show me your panties” or “may I activate your remote control sex toys?” Awesome, right? That being said, the vast majority of these ladies do speak and understand English. 😉
“Hokkaido” 【北海道】prefecture is the prefecture in Japan which lies on the top north of the archipelago.
In Winter there is, depending on the quality of the annual snowfall a huge incentive for people to travel there from all across Japan to go skiing or do winter sports activities. There is also a “Snow Festival” which people can visit and enjoy their time with.
As Hokkaido is located in close proximity to the ocean you can have a taste of a lot of different seafood and shellfish there, which also includes fresh caught ones. Vegetables, meat and more are splendid in resource, because there are a lot of farms along the plains of Hokkaido cultivating them.
Also theres a mountain which is called “Hakodate” that is a very famous touring spot and looks beautiful at night.

Because, let’s face it, we THINK we know what twin flames are and all that. But, when it’s all said and done, we really don’t. Some are still stuck spinning their wheels thinking their twin-flame soul mate is the ONLY one for them and that, even though they are estranged now, that is the person they will be with one day. And, until that day, they will drown in a sea of sorrow. This is the kind of mentality we need to nip in the bud, for it serves NO ONE. Trust me. I waited five years for my twin-flame to come back around, and even though we did reunite “one more time,” it did not last and was nothing but a huge disappointment. What I learned from it: I deserve MUCH better. And so do you. And this is why I challenged my Akashic team to set the record straight and get the truth about all these human-ego ideas we read about twin-flame soul mates when everything comes crashing down – even after we loved without conditions and took every exhausting “test” and “challenge” our twin flames threw at us, accepted every “mirrored reflection” they showed us and integrated it into our own unconditional self love and it still wasn’t good enough.
Most twin-flame gurus will tell you that you’re estranged from your twin flame because you “still have work to do,” or that you “need to work on yourself more; love yourself more.” Even after you’ve done all the therapy and loved yourself raw and you’re still finding yourself alone, you’re still thinking, because THE GURUS said so, that you can’t make it to 5D without a harmonious reunion with your twin-flame soul mate. You believe without this unconditional love for yourself and each other, you simply cannot ascend. Some may even try to tell you that the one you believe to be your twin-flame was actually a “false twin” or a “catalyst,” leaving you even more confused than ever before. That’s the last thing you need when you feel like you can’t breathe… can’t function… can’t even LIVE anymore.
So I decided it’s time for us to really dig for the truth about this twin-flame business. (See what I did there?) Using some of the “information” found around the internet that never resonated with me about twin-flame soul mates as well as some questions from my clients, I created the following list and asked for my Akashic team to please reveal the truth for all of us.
Twin-flame soul mates are two souls that have split from one light being, much like identical twin humans have split into two beings from one egg.
This is often done by beings who incarnate into a physical embodiment on a physical planet, such as Earth. The main reason is to have two aspects of the one soul – either both incarnated or only one incarnated while the other stays in spirit – to assist in the evolution of the soul.
Let’s focus on those who incarnate together for a moment. What is their purpose together? Why do they incarnate together?
Ultimately, twin-flame soul mates incarnate together to push each other onto the path of unconditional self love and to harmoniously reunite in unconditional love for each other. As far as mission or purpose to serve together once harmoniously reunited, it all depends on the contracts they make together before incarnation. They may also be in contract with other soul mates to help teach lessons to them. For example: the twin-flame soul mates incarnate on Earth as an interracial couple to help teach their respective families tolerance and love for other races. It can be as simple and complicated as that. At the same time, they may be in contract with one another to teach each other the same lesson and so many more that come along with cultural differences and learned prejudices. In short, the missions are usually to help teach unconditional love and bring peace to Earth.
Do twin-flame soul mates always incarnate with the intention of being romantic partners or sexual partners, and if so, why?
Mostly, yes. But some may choose to change it up and create some very challenging situations by being born to the same bloodline. Twin-flame soul mates mostly incarnate with the intention of being romantic sexual partners because there is a bond and a trust there like no other. The sharing of Kundalini energy is also very powerful, especially between twin-flame soul mates because of the sacred, spiritual bond that exists between them.
Why, then, if there is this sacred trust, is it so hard for twin-flame soul mates to stay together? Why is there always a runner and a chaser?
There’s not always a runner and a chaser. It seems that way, but that is not always the case. What creates the difficulty is the human ego entertaining the lower, fear-based energies. Each life experience is different. The difficulties and hardships faced in every life are what form and shape the ego-learned fears. It is possible to have two runners, just as it is possible to have two highly spiritual beings who are committed and willing to stay together through thick and thin. To have a constant game of chase in every life would be madness, and that is not every twin-flame story. We know that this is a common philosophy regarding twin-flame soul mates, and we would like to state that this is not the absolute truth; this is an ego-based philosophy based on a sampling or case-study of human experiences in your current now. It is not completely accurate.
Since we are on the subject of twin-flame myths, there is one floating out there that twin flames always incarnate as the same gender. What is the truth regarding this belief?
Not true. Although a specific gender may be preferred, all souls have incarnated as both genders numerous times.
So that brings us to a few more twin-flame myths. Some believe that the one soul splits into a masculine energy and a feminine energy. What is the truth regarding this belief, and, do the twin souls share one higher self, or do they each have their own?
When we talk of souls, what we are talking about is conscious energy known as light beings. They are genderless when not incarnated in physical bodies, and they have an equal balance of masculine and feminine energy. That is not to say that they don’t favor or project more of one energy than the other, however, which is the same for human beings. Each twin soul has its own higher self identity.
What about twin-flame soul mates who incarnate as the same gender together? Is their intention also to be romantic or sexual partners?
Yes, most of the time. These are usually more experienced and evolved souls who have learned that love transcends gender, and it is their mission to teach the younger souls incarnated on Earth this lesson – that love is love – regardless of gender, race, religion or culture. These souls are the strongest and bravest, and they usually incarnate with their twin-flame soul mate knowing they will need to rely on each other in such courageous efforts.
What about those twin-flame soul mates who cannot succeed in their union with each other? What happens to their “mission” they agreed to serve together?
They cannot complete their mission if they cannot overcome their issues to unite and serve together. Contracts can be rewritten, however, by the higher selves.
There is another myth out there that twin-flame soul mates must reunite in order for the souls to ascend into the 5D vibration. What is the truth regarding this belief?
It is not true. First of all, most souls are already of 5D vibration. Twin-flame soul mates incarnate together to assist one another in their individual soul evolution as human beings. The secret to achieving the 5D Christ Consciousness vibration while incarnated as a human being is self mastery and self love. Once the ego is tamed and the need to compare, judge and criticize (self or others) no longer exists, then it is time to move into unconditional love and complete and total acceptance of the self. Self love must be achieved by both individuals before unconditional love for each other can thrive. Unconditional love does not necessarily mean that the two marry or live together or even remain a couple; it means that they are able to love and accept one another as they are, and they are able to let go of old ego attachments to allow one another to be free and happy. For most twins, this does mean that they stay together as a couple. For others, it means that they lovingly let each other go and truly wish them well for the remainder of their journey without feeling longing or need for one another.
In the Twin Flame “guru” world here on Earth, some terms are being thrown around that only add confusion. The first is: catalyst. The second is: false twin flame. Sometimes the terms are being presented as interchangeable; other times they are presented as two different things. What can you tell us about catalysts and false twin flames?
There is no such thing as a “false” twin flame. There are some soul mates who will serve as “near” twin flames, to prepare individuals for their real twin-flame. The near twin will challenge those hang ups that may arise with your twin flame and help you hurdle some of the smaller issues to clear the way. The difference here is that you will feel this near twin is your soul mate until you discover your twin-flame soul mate and discover how much deeper you can go into love. A catalyst could be anyone, really, but usually is a member of your soul group who comes along to shake up your soul mate relationship so that you can move onto your twin-flame, but this really only occurs in extreme cases. Catalysts are not always necessary. Most go directly from the near-twin soul mate experience to the twin-flame soul mate. Some may confuse the actual twin-flame as a catalyst if the first reunion attempt is fast and furious and a failure (which is common if the near twin did not fully accomplish its mission). Catalysts are a one-time thing. There is always a sense of rockiness with a catalyst, so when the relationship is over, it’s over. There’s no going back, and both parties strongly feel this way. With a twin-flame separation, a constant longing is always felt by both parties and it cannot be shaken, despite the hurt they may have caused one another in their first reunion attempt.
There is still another myth out there that we have more than one twin-flame soul mate. What can you tell us about this belief?
It is true that higher selves create many aspects of themselves in physical bodies, so, in theory, there are individuals walking Earth (and other planets) who share the same higher self. Although it is rare, there are special cases in which an incarnate being wishes to discontinue its life, but the higher self wants to continue, so contracts are rearranged and that individual encounters another aspect of its twin-flame counterpart in the same life. We want to reiterate that this is extremely rare, but it is possible. For the most part, higher selves have already decided in advance which aspects will be paired together.
Sometimes it is contracted; most of the time, however, it is not intentional, but, rather a result of a lack of self love which can be manifested in many different ways, including addictions, (substance or alcohol, prescription drugs, tobacco, sex, pornography, pedophilia, food… the list goes on and on) low self-esteem, self-mutilation, self-deprecation/sabotage, mental illness, physical dis-ease and illness, anxiety, depression and more.
Some suggest that there are negative beings on Earth who want to prevent twin-flame soul mates from reuniting. What is the truth in this regard?
It is true. They are the ones who create obstacles we just mentioned to keep the human ego in lower vibration.
What happens when a twin-flame couple fails and separates and one is able to raise vibration into self love while the other is unable to rise and stays in lower vibration? Does this mean that the one who achieves unconditional self-love never gets the opportunity to reunite with his/her twin-flame for that incarnation?
In this case it is possible for those other aspects of the higher selves of the twin-flames to reshuffle and begin attracting to those who are of similar vibration. So those aspects who achieve unconditional self love begin pairing up, while those who choose to stay in lower vibration either find another aspect who matches their vibration, or they remain alone or settle for someone else who is not a twin-flame who is of equal vibration.
What if there is no match for the higher vibrating aspect to reunite with? What happens to that aspect?
This is where walk-in situations will occur. These contracts are usually in place before incarnation with soul group mates who are willing to “trade higher selves” if their own twin-flame union fails or if they have incarnated without their twin-flame (which is usually the case). The other option is for a twin-soul attract once unconditional self-love is achieved because this 5D vibration is the same as harmoniously reuniting with a twin-flame soul mate. Or the higher vibrating aspect will most likely be perfectly happy flying solo since there is really no need for a partner once unconditional self love is achieved.
This is the whole-soul twin of your higher self. One who is of higher vibration who has also achieved unconditional self love. You will find you have more in common with your twin soul than you do with your twin-flame and that your differences don’t matter at all; unconditional love is free-flowing and drama is at an all-time low.
So what is better, a harmoniously reunited pair of twin-flame souls or a reunited pair of twin souls?
If the twin-flame souls have each achieved unconditional self-love (which is the only way for them to be harmoniously reunited) then there really is no difference. It is about vibration. Soul mates will only attract to one another when they share a similar vibration; they repel when they are discordant in vibration. If one half of a twin-flame pair achieves the 5D vibration alone, that half automatically becomes a whole – with or without a partner who is an aspect of the other half. All are one, you see. So whether the 5D vibration is achieved with or without the other half, it is still a successful union into a whole for the half who achieved unconditional self love. It’s the vibration that counts. Not the union.
What happens to the lower vibrating twin, then, if the higher vibrating twin moves into union with a higher vibrating aspect or twin-soul?
The lower vibrating twin may move into union with another aspect who is a match in vibration or the higher-self may opt out and a walk-in situation may occur for that individual.
Twin flames serve as mirrors to one another, to show where there is an imbalance (between masculine and feminine energy) or to reflect those issues of self-esteem that need work for unconditional self-love to be achieved. The union is also usually a lesson in what unconditional love really is – as opposed to conditional or emotional attachments. Twin flame unions – whether successful or not – help awaken and guide each half toward the path to unconditional self love. Unconditional self love is what is necessary in order for the collective to rise and ultimately bring and maintain peace on Earth. When humans achieve unconditional self love, they no longer feel a need to judge, criticize, compare or compete. Instead they prefer to express compassion and compliment and help one another. And this is what Earth needs in order to heal and thrive.
So there you have it, friends. Straight from the Akashic Records. For those of you ambitious enough to change your ways and raise your vibration, there’s not “just one” possibility in the twin-flame arena. There are higher vibrating options if you feel you need a partner to help “get you there.” For those of you flying solo, isn’t it nice to know that you can achieve the 5D vibration on your own by mastering human ego and achieving unconditional self love? And isn’t it nice to know there are those accomplished whole-soul, twin-soul counterparts awaiting you when you reach the summit if you go it alone? So why waste another day pining for someone stuck in low gear? Start loving yourself and raise your vibration so you can attract a healthier, happier life partner (who just happens to have the same higher self as that original twin-flame). Or why not just fly solo? You already have everything you need inside you, and once you achieve unconditional self love, you complete yourself and the 5D vibration. Who better to love you without conditions than YOU? Trust. Fly!

One of the pleasant surprises coming out of last week's Catholic Bible Taxonomy was getting to spend time with some less familiar translations. This week, let's take a closer look at the Christian Community Bible: Catholic Pastoral Edition.
This is the English translation adapted from Father Hurault's Biblia Latinoamericana in 1986. Although it's been in print consistently since then, and older editions are widely available used and online, it's very hard to locate new in the US. (Thanks to Lenny for locating new copies on sale through St. Paul's Press.) Because I wanted to review the latest (59th!) Revised Edition published in 2013, I contacted Claretian Publications in Macau, who makes this Bible available to English-speaking Christians in China, India, and the Philippines (where the Imprimatur was issued).
The volume itself is quite attractive and very comfortable to read. Using it for a week in Morning Prayer, I can say it's probably my most comfortable Bible to hold and read. It has a surprisingly large typeface for a Bible that's not large print, and a compelling "global" design.
Consistent with Fr. Hurault's desire for a Bible that can be read easily by "ordinary poor people," the distinctive pen and ink drawings for each book of the Bible interpret key themes of the book through the experience of the working poor in the developing world. Here are some of my favorites.
Though I don't have an older copy to compare it to, I rather like the translation of the 2013 Revised Edition. It's definitely a translation, and not a paraphrase. If the New Jerusalem Bible and the Good News Translation (Catholic Edition) had children, this would be their firstborn. Liked the NJB, it uses the Divine Name to render the tetragrammaton. Like the GNT, it is conversational without being dumbed down. To be glib: this is the NJB for pastors instead of scholars, or the GNT for grownups. You can sample the text online, and here are some passages for flavor.
Gen 1:1 In the beginning, when God began to create the heavens and the earth, the earth had no form and was void; darkness was over the deep and the spirit of God hovered over the waters.
Is 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The Virgin is with child and bears a son and calls his name Immanuel.
Jer 20:7 Yahweh, you have seduced me and I let myself be seduced. You have taken me by force and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; they all make fun of me.
Eph 1:3-14 (One sentence in the Greek!) Blessed be God, the Father of Christ Jesus our Lord, who, in Christ, has blessed us from heaven, with every spiritual blessing. God chose us, in Christ, before the creation of the world, to be holy, and without sin in his presence. From eternity he destined us, in love, to be his adopted sons and daughters, through Christ Jesus, thus fulfilling his free and generous will. This goal suited him: that his loving-kindness, which he granted us in his beloved might finally received all glory and praise. For, in Christ, we obtain freedom, sealed by his blood, and have the forgiveness of sins. In this, appears the greatness of his grace, which he lavished on us. In all wisdom and understanding, God has made known to us his mysterious design, in accordance with his loving-kindness, in Christ. In him, and under him, God wanted to unite, when the fullness of time had come, everything in heaven and on earth. By a decree of him, who disposes all things, according to his own plan and decision, we, the Jews, have been chosen and called, and we were awaiting the Messiah, for the praise of his glory. You, on hearing the word of truth, the gospel that saves you, have believed in him. And, as promised, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit, the first pledge of what we shall receive, on the way to our deliverance, as a people of God, for the praise of his glory.
Earlier versions use a much criticized two-size typeface to pop essential passages off the page for visual emphasis. That's still here in the 2013 Revised Edition, but it's not as distracting as I feared, so maybe they've dialed it back a bit. Traditionalists and original language purists will not like the extensive use of horizontal inclusive language. One strange choice I think everyone will find jarring is the highly unusual decision to print the Old Testament not in Catholic or Protestant order, but rather in the order of the Torah!
Essentially this gives us a Catholic Bible built out of the New Testament with an English-language Tanakh in front of it. The guiding editorial principal of this translation is a pastoral focus on Catholic community organizing, so I can't imagine what real-world scenario made this a necessary choice. Perhaps a polemic strategy to counter some Protestant sect in the field?
For my money, the real star of this edition is the commentary. It's quite different, at least to North American ears. Where most Catholic Bibles hew either to historical-critical academic notes or dogmatic-catechetical notes, the Christian Community Bible: Catholic Pastoral Edition reads more like the preaching notes of a missionary trying to make clear the sense of Scripture that will help group leaders build and organize communities around the gospel for dignity and survival. That's because they are: essentially the commentary is Fr. Hurault's homiletic notes from his missionary work in 1960s / 1970s Argentina.
To that end, it finishes with a few handy charts of the Liturgical year for easy reference guiding Bible study or planning Liturgy.
I could imagine a revitalized interest in this text given that it shares a common culture with the Holy Father. I could easily see teen and college ministers leading groups with this Bible in one hand and the Didache NABRE in the other.
What do you think? Especially if anyone has older editions, I'd love to hear how it compares and how you've encountered Scripture through it.

very nice post on this interesting bible. The version officially in use for liturgy in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay (and the only spanish bible on the Vatican site), 'El Libro del Pueblo de Dios', from the late 70s and early 80s, made a similar decision with the order of the books: the OT follows the order of the Tanakh, while the deutoerocanonical books are placed between the OT and the NT. It was probably some sort of fashion in South America at the time.
Also, I'd like to point out that Fr. Hurault pastoral work took place in southern Chile, not in Argentina. He might have visited Argentina, but he did his pastoral work, and his Biblia Latinoamericana translation, in Chile.
As having practical experience with the CCB, earlier versions, Chris are in fact, gender-exclusive. The inclusive language had made its way through several revisions of the CCB.
Maybe you found the preliminary articles on the CCB refreshing to the Catholic readers. In my edition, the liturgical readings list is located before Genesis.
But for one thing I applaud the CCB, is that its notes are compatible enough for pastoral uses of the Bible. In some printings of the CCB, particularly the Indian NCB, though for some it became controversial, inculturation of the pastoral notes, for instance to the Indian secular and cultural context would made the Indian CCB, more accessible to its readers.
It is an irony indeed in the Catholic arena that Study Bibles and Commentaries are those filled with spiritual and pastoral notes, while casual editions of the Bible are those filled with historical-critical notes.
For a casual reader, the spiritual and pastoral notes will be of much greater value, while enthusiasts and specialists will appreciate the historical-critical notes. Let us pray that this optimal scenario be the situation in the future.
For one thing, casual Catholics are often discouraged from reading the Scriptures because the notes are often "Greek" to them and do not understand fully their significance to the main text, leading to an impression that the Scriptures are reserved for those studying and has higher knowledge of the Scriptures.
"Israel is God's spoiled child. In former days, God brought them out of Egypt, and ever since then, has been calling then and trying to draw them to himself, but they continue their depraved ways which bring punishment upon them.
I am God and not human (v. 9). Our setbacks which seem to be God's punishment are, in fact, what Good considers the most suitable ways to teach us (see Hev 12:7, 2 Mac 6:16, Wis 11:23)."
That's just amazing. In two or three sentences sentences it struck directly at why this reading matters today. Even the Pastoral notes in the Didache Bible came out "Greek" by comparison.
Just got home from the Manila International Book Fair, where I saw, for the first time, the elusive "New Catholic Version" of the NT.
Yup, it has an imprimatur from Bishop Bastes, who once headed the biblical apostolate commission of the CBCP.
1. It's one of the widely available, yet very underrated, Catholic Bibles here in the Philippines. I overheard some youngsters, probably college students, who visited the Claretians booth at the book fair. And when they saw the CCB, they remarked that it brought back memories of high school when it was the bible they were supposed to buy, and hopefully use, for religion classes at school. Yet, you can rarely hear it proclaimed at church, read and studied at prayer meetings, or even quoted in books (except for those published by Claretians and Orbis).
Unless someone gets lucky enough to prepare (and maybe even secure Vatican permission) a lectionary and a divine office based on the CCB.
2. Both the CCB and its Tagalog counterpart "Biblia ng Sambayanang Pilipino", have a "concise edition", which is made up of major stories and verses from some of the biblical books. Most of these are the ones frequently used in the liturgy: the parables and miracle stories of Jesus, the often quoted psalms, the Canticles of the Servant of YHWH in Isaiah, etc. it's meant to give first time readers a first hand encounter with the bible.
3. Unlike other Catholic Bibles (e.g. NABRE, JB, NRSV...) the CCB is available both in print (and in all sizes), as well as online. The only other Catholic Bible doing this is the GNT and the Tagalog MBB.
From years of quietly reading this blog I know that I have been in the minority as both a fan and regular user of The Christian Community Bible: Catholic Pastoral Edition. I have been using it in various editions since about 1999. Just got the latest (2013) edition last year. I find its notes so helpful for praying & pondering, and often for homily crafting. As far as availability for the USA try this link. VERY easy to obtain:https://www.comcenter.com/product/LIGE-BIB101/CCB-2013-Revised-Edition-hardcover/
Thanks for weighing in though. I'm really glad to hear of someone actually using this text in active ministry.
Christopher...Oh too bad! I ordered and received one to give as a gift not too long ago. Hopefully back in stock soon.
A Tanakh-order OT reminds me of the old French TOB (traduction oecuménique, if my memory serves me well), where I always assumed that quaint choice was supposed to be a neutral solution giving privilege to neither of the traditional Western Christian systems. I applaud the attempt at being ecumenically sensitive, but the result for me was that it took me ages to find anything in the OT.
I have mentioned this recently on another post, that the CCB is availible on kindle. It has the commentary notes included!
And in case I embedded the link too obscurely, you can read the full text of the English, Spanish, or Philippine versions online here:
The main reason why the CCB and the Tagalog counterpart Biblia ng Sambayanang Pilipino didn't get any ecclesiastical attention is that our bishops want to execute the virtues of Vatican II, especially the Conciliar document "Dei Verbum" which recommends Bibles from an ecumenical background.
That's why the CBCP tapped the Philippine Bible Society, which is obviously a Protestant-majority organization to collaborate and produce the Tagalog MBB. This was in line with the transition to the vernacular Mass.
Since you saw the NCV in the international book fair, chances are that it will be published here in the Philippines.
FYI there are more reviews of the CCB 2013 edition found on this blog. Type in search Catholic Community Bible and you will find reviews dated back to Feb and May 2013.
Are the notes still anti-Catholic though? Many of the ones in my edition are kind of offensive. If I dig it out I will post a few...
Are the notes still anti-Catholic though? Many of the ones in my current edition are kind of offensive. If I can dig it out to post a few I will...
As a record of evidence of the CCB´s text evolution I could provide photos of all the CCB versions I have on my shelf (about nine or so, displayed at bibles.wikidot.com, plus one new acquisition). But I need to know if there's still interest in that topic. I'd share text images of each an OT and an NT page if wanted. But I presently have no idea if I need to register first to CB and how to send in the scans. Please reply to birnbaum (at) bibelarchiv.com. I think that is the best way to show how the CCB text and commentary development advanced since the early publication dates. In addition I could add images of pages of the Indian New Community Bible which is in fact a revision of one of the earlier CCBs. Feel free to reply. Tks sb
I can't see how a printed Bible with an imprimatur from a Bishops' conference could be "anti-Catholic." In my experience, if some aspects of our faith don't challenge and even offend us occasionally we're not really paying much attention to it.
I'm currently reading -cover to cover- the excellent translation 'Biblia del Peregrino' (Pilgrim's Bible), by spanish Fr. Alfonso Schökel. It doesn't have an explicit Imprimatur, but it states "con las debidas licencias de la Conferencia Episcopal Española", which translates as 'with all needed authorizations by the Spanish Conference of Bishops'. Well, the note to Luke 11:37-53 says: "In this chapter -more so than in others- it resounds the controversy between Judaism and emerging Christianity: the text probably postdates the official excommunion of the christians, 'nazarenes', by the authorities of Yamnia".
If the council of Yamnia did take place, it did after the destruction of the Temple, that is after 70 AD. So, what this note is telling me in plain spanish is: 'these words you are reading are not real words of Jesus. Rather, they are an elaboration by a christian community that took some of Jesus' ideas, and adapted them to be useful to their own controversy with the Jewish authorities, in post-Temple Judea. In doing so, the members of this 'community' didn't shy from using the Holy name of Jesus as a vehicle to give prestige to their own ideas'.
In short, the members of this 'community' made their own ideas pass for the Words of Jesus. They were, in plain english, counterfeiters. And this might very well have been the case. But if it was, then Christianity has to go, because we would have no way of knowing what is from Jesus, and what has been made up by 'communities' of counterfeiters.
This note to the Bible might be scientifically true (and I personally don't think it is). But I do think it is anti-Christian, in the sense that Christianity can't survive a note like this. (Of course, if the note were scientifically sound, our duty to intellectual honesty would compel us to choose the note, and drop Christianity).
Plus, I think notes like this are a deception to those who in good faith buy a Bible with the approval of Catholic bishops. The appropriate title to a Bible with this notes should be: 'Critical study exposing the Bible for the forgery it is'.
I also understand that the ancient world had very different notions of text and authorship than we do. Specifically, they had a literary tradition of "pseudepigraphy," writing in the name of a respected teacher to expand upon or convey the essence of his teaching.
I'm not saying whether any specific words of Christ in the NT are or aren't pseudepigraphal. I AM saying that one ordinary way in first century Roman culture to spread someone's teaching was to write an original work based in their school of thought, even in the first person, and present it as a work of the teacher himself.
In fact, if you weren't important enough to inspire pseudepigraphical texts, you weren't important enough to remember.
1) Most first and second generation Christian converts would have assumed ANY oral tradition the apostles passed on contained pseudepigraphical material... even when they were passing on Christ's own words.
2) ALL NT texts were completed at least 20 - 30 years after the Resurrection and Ascension. Do you think those first Christians had the Gospels to turn to as "authoritative" scripture before that?
3) That's why Catholic tradition places Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition on an even footing, as equal components preserving the full Deposit of Faith. What the Apostles passed on orally ABOUT Christ and his teachings is essential to understanding any words Christ actually SAID.
4) It was the Apostles' oral teaching in the name and tradition of Jesus, inspired by his word, that shaped and guided the Gospel texts that we DO have. The gospel writers themselves tell us that.
Luke 1:1-3 makes it clear there are lots of people writing in the tradition and name of Jesus two generations after his death. Luke states his job is to review all of that material with an ear to what the Apostles had said in order to help put it in order for the third generation of believers.
"Since many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the events that have been fulfilled among us, just as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning and ministers of the word have handed them down to us, I too have decided, after investigating everything accurately anew, to write it down in an orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may realize the certainty of the teachings you have received."
In other words, he's reviewing pseudepigraphal material, comparing it to the teachings passed down by the apostles through their followers, and then capturing the stuff that matches what they taught.
"It is this disciple who testifies to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true. There are also many other things that Jesus did, but if these were to be described individually, I do not think the whole world would contain the books that would be written." (Jn 21:25)
He and his congregation heard PLENTY of other stories about Jesus. He's not saying to discount them. He's saying "compare them to mine, because I was there."
So I hear what you're saying, but I don't find it a threat to faith. I find it an explanation of how God enable the words of Jesus to survive, using the tradition of the ancient world.
I agree With Christopher's reply, this was what I was taught at The Catholic Bible Institute sponsored by our archdiocese. I was a Catholic only for one year when I attended this course for two years. It did not hurt my faith in the least, in fact it encouraged me to continue learning about my new faith!
Your entry is most interesting and informative. This is getting technical real fast, and I will soon be out of my depth. So, before that happens, I’d like to clarify my point.
In the case of the verse whose note I transcribed, we’d be facing a double case of pseudoepigraphy: the first layer would be the ‘community’ presenting its work as that of Luke. The second layer would be the suppossed author, ‘Luke’, reporting his own ideas as Jesus’.
Now, I went to the Wikipedia (I know it is not the most scholarly of sources, but it is the one I have at hand). There, on the article on Pseudoepigrapha, they list (according to some scholars), seven levels of autorship and authenticity:
Scholars have identified seven levels of authenticity which they have organized in a hierarchy ranging from literal authorship, meaning written in the author's own hand, to outright forgery:
3. Delegated authorship. A church leader describes the basic content of an intended letter to a disciple or to an amanuensis.
4. Posthumous authorship. A church leader dies, and his disciples finish a letter that he had intended to write, sending it posthumously in his name.
5. Apprentice authorship. A church leader dies, and disciples who had been authorized to speak for him while he was alive continue to do so by writing letters in his name years or decades after his death.
6. Honorable pseudepigraphy. A church leader dies, and admirers seek to honor him by writing letters in his name as a tribute to his influence and in a sincere belief that they are responsible bearers of his tradition.
7. Forgery. A church leader obtains sufficient prominence that, either before or after his death, people seek to exploit his legacy by forging letters in his name, presenting him as a supporter of their own ideas.[7]:p.224
Applying this to the case I pointed out, the first layer of pseudoepigraphy, could be something like numbers 4, 5, o 6. That is, disciples of Luke finishing his work, or puting his ideas in writing.
On the other hand, the second layer is different. The spirit of the note to Luke 11:37-53 clearly is: ‘this text is so hostile to the pharisees, so bereft of mercy, so unlike Jesus, that it can’t possibly be from Jesus. It has to be a late insertion from the time after the Council of Jamnia, when the nazarenes had already been excommunicated by the Jewish authorities’. The spirit of the note itself, points to a forgery. Not to any form of pseudoepigraphy. Pseudoeqigraphy implies respecting the ideas of the Teacher one invoques. And here, the author of the note tries to get the pharisees of the hook by showing that the teaching can’t be from Jesus, because it is not in the spirit of Jesus. That is his whole point.
That it is why I still think that note is an anti-Christian note in a Catholic Bible with official approval by a Catholic Bishop’s Conference.
On the wider subject of pseudoepigraphy in the Gospels, that is, of communities using the name of apostles or disciples to sign their works, and of those same communities writing ideas of Christ they received through oral tradition, I’d like to add:
1) Oral societies, societies where writing was rare or expensive, as in Judea in the time of Jesus, worked in ways that are very difficult to grasp to societies like ours, which are based on the written word. In those societies, people were mentally trained to memorize faithfully big chunks of information. The phenomenon has been studied in depth. It has been found that in places like the Ucraine, or North Africa, at the end of the XIX century, there were people who could repeat amazing amounts of historical data, or legends, without introducing errors. The linguistic and anthropological basis for this phenomena, was described by french Fr. Marcel Jousse, SJ.
So, in an oral society, oral transmission was assumed to be faithful. It was not hearsay. It was not something one tampered with. It was serious business, like the jewish scribes copying the Tanakh. There were errors in the transmission, but they were extremely rare.
Plus, if the transmission was originally oral, and not written, it would make sense that it was in aramaic or in hebrew, and not in the international koiné greek. Research by Claude Tresmontant (who translated Matthew to the hebrew) and by Fr. Carmignac, seems to support this hipotesis.
Having said all this, in that sort of oral culture, first and second generation christians would not have expected to receive pseudoepigraphical material as the norm.
2) So, to answer your question: ‘do I think those first Christians had the Gospels to turn to as authoritative scripture before it was commited to paper?’, my answer is: Yes, I do. They had it as oral record, which in an oral culture was as good or better than a record on paper.
3) Agreed on Sacred Tradition. Those were the teachings of Jesus, transmitted faithfully in oral form through generations.
4) Agreed. Revelation ends with the death of the last apostle. While they were alive they teached, they introduced new rules (like the end of circumcision), all of it in the name of Jesus. They never pretended those were secret teachings of Jesus. Those were their own teachings, inspired by the Holy Spirit. No pseudoepigraphy here.
5) Luke 1:1-3 says nothing of generations. It is an intriguing hipotesis. But it is not in the text itsef. He is not explicit about his material or sources. He just doesn’t count himself among the eyewitnesses. Probably his source was Paul. But he is not pretending to be Paul. No pseudoepigraphy here, either.
6) Jn 21:24-25 doesn’t, per se, point to pseudoepigraphy. If the author is John, then he was an eyewitness, and he chose to commit to writting only part of what he saw and heard. If the author is not John the Evangelist, then it would be pseudoepigraphy, but we can’t know it from the text.
To summarize: I don’t see it as so evident that the Gospels are pseudoepigrapha. No one is signing them as Jesus. They could be if the real authors where not Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and instead were their disciples, finishing their works, or commiting them to writing. If in the ancient world that was an usual and respected practice, it would not amount to lying, and then there would be no danger to our faith.
But, as if the note I transcribed implies, the real authors of the Gospels did not transmit faithfully the ideas of Jesus, but rather had their own agenda (like fighting the pharisee rabbis), and used the name of Jesus just as a weapon in their disputes, to better disseminate their own ideas, then we are lost. And Christianity is dead. Because we have no real way of knowing what was true and from Jesus, and what was something introduced as part of an agenda relevant to people in first century Judea. I mean, the only direct witness to the Resurrection that we have are the Gospels. If they were written at the end of the first century, by communities with their own agendas, those communities could perfectly well have made up the story of the Resurrection.
"I also understand that the ancient world had very different notions of text and authorship than we do. Specifically, they had a literary tradition of "pseudepigraphy," writing in the name of a respected teacher to expand upon or convey the essence of his teaching."
No, I'm sorry but this is bogus. There is absolutely no evidence that in the ancient world it was considered acceptable for someone to attach another person's name onto a document. This has always been regarded as fraudulent.
Even if you go back to ancient Greece and Rome, scholars were concerned about "fakes". Platonist philosophers were concerned about weeding out inauthentic dialogues by Plato, Aristotelians were interested in identifying and weeding out fake writings by Aristotle. People interested in drama were concerned wth finding fake plays by Euripides or Sophocles, and eliminating them from collections of the works of these authors, and everyone was concerned about finding out which of the many documents bearing the name of "Homer" were authentic and which ones were forgeries.
We actually have in our possession documents written as early as the 3rd century BC where scholars debate whether or not a particular poem bearing the name of "Homer" was actually by Homer. Scholars compiled lists, some of which are in our possession, listing the authentic works by certain authors, and identifying the forgeries, and warning people to avoid the forgeries.
And in the Early Church, the debates over the canon were centred on the question of authenticity. The books that were accepted into the New Testament canon were accepted because they were believed to be AUTHENTIC, and the books that were rejected were rejected because they were believed to be forgeries.
And when you had debates in the early Church over whether to accept a book like Revelation or 2 Peter or Jude, the debate centred entirely on the question of authenticity. The people who rejected Revelation or 2 Peter rejected them because they believed that they were fake. The ones who accepted them did so because they believed them to be authentic.
At no point in these debates did anyone ever say "well, 2 Peter probably wasn't written by the apostle Peter, it was probably written after Peter's death by a disciple writing in Peter's name, but there is nothing wrong with that", no one EVER said that.
There has NEVER in any culture or society been a tradition where it was considered acceptable to write something and then attach a famous name to it to give it authority. There has never been a society where there this was regarded as anything but dishonest and immoral.
The claim that this was ever regarded as being morally acceptable is something that someone just made up one day in order to eat his cake and have it too, so that they could claim that the New Testament was not written by any of its purported authors while still claiming to be "good Christians" who believed in the Bible.
Linguistics note: when I wrote 'hipotesis', I meant 'hypothesis' (I used the spanish spelling. Sorry).
I don't want to make more of this than it warrants. The question was simply whether commentary in the Spanish Biblia del Peregrino was anti-Catholic. I don't know, because it's not the English Bible I was reviewing here and it's not clear that it has an imprimatur. If it doesn't, anything is possible. If it does, then I was explaining what a Catholic scholar had in mind when writing it.
I think if you examine my first paragraph, Javier, I am not saying the Gospels are pseudepigraphy. I am saying the audience was familiar with pseudepigraphy, and Luke's reason for writing the gospel is to help them tell the wheat from the chaff.
As for the claims about Luke, while it doesn't speak directly to pseudepigraphy, the Ignatius Study Bible commentary does emphasize the multi-generational aspect of Luke's task:
"1:2 delivered to us: Luke is probably a second-generation Christian. His work is heavily indebted to the testimony of eyewitnesses and ministers of the gospel in the early Church. Three points follow from this: (1) Luke is a careful historian who has sifted relevant sources to obtain accurate information; (2) he transmits, not private opinions, but apostolic traditions; and (3) he writes to strengthen the faith of fellow Christians."
Looking at those "relevant sources" with the phenomenon of literary pseudepigraphy in mind suggests my hypothesis. And yes, that's what it is: a hypothesis. I'm just suggesting how the commentary note in question could be written by someone looking to support Catholic tradition.
Biblical Catholic, we just disagree. In my studies, pseudepigraphy was a real phenomena. Yes, concern over forgery was there, and Christ left us the apostles and their oral Sacred Tradition to tell the difference. Sorting real Jesus traditions from game was the whole point of Apostolic witness then and the teaching authority of the Church now:
"Remember your leaders who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teaching." (Hebrews 13:7-9a NABRE) http://bible.com/463/heb.13.7-9.NABRE
You are right there that the Church was tasked to identify which are pseudigrapha, the early Church definitely has more context to the background of the early writings and for sure, the Apostolic Oral Tradition helped the Church to distinguish which are of merit to be Scripture and which are not.
A good work to be in this discussion is the Letter to the Hebrews. The Tradition recognizes Paul as the author of the letter. However, modern scholarship now shows that it was apparently not Paul who wrote the letter due to:
(a) difference in style among other Pauline letters with an matching opening salutation (I, Paul, slave of God,...) and closing words (Greet each other with a holy kiss...).
(b) higher register of Greek, not only among other Pauline letters but also among other New Testament books.
That being said, just because it was scholarly conjectured that the letter was not authentic Pauline, so with respect-to Paul, the Letter to the Hebrews will fall under "pseudigrapha" since it was concluded that Paul did not wrote the letter.
Just because it was a Pauline "pseudigraphic" work, some scholars believed that it is an attributive work from someone who has been a student or someone very close to Paul, it doesn't follow that we will reject the Letter to the Hebrews as Scripture. Well, to recall, Luther attempted to remove this to the NT Canon, along with what he referred to as NT Deuterocanonical works.
But however, being guided by the Apostolic Tradition, despite the scholarly findings, the Church continues to hold Letter to the Hebrews as Scripture. However, to recognize the scholarly evidences, the Church meanwhile did not refer anymore to Paul as the writer.
I find the whole subject -dates, authorship, oral tradition, original language, etc.- fascinating. It may be due, at least in part, to the fact that in my language -in my spanish speaking culture- it is a non-subject.
Would love to do more posts like that. Life right now doesn't afford me the time to do it, however if there are some more people who would be interested in guest posting, I'd be open to that.
That perhaps I think, because of our culturally Catholic background. Since Catholicism is already part of our cultures, something that we inherited from the Spaniards way way back, we tend not to question articles of our Faith since it is culturally embedded into us.
But the ill-side of this nature is that Catholics from our nations are easily driven by other teachings, being not solidly grounded to Catholic teachings.
And the most ironic part of this, since Americans are culturally Protestant, if I am right to assume that, most American Catholics are more knowledgeable to the Faith since converts made their way through discernment in the Faith granted through the grace of the Holy Spirit. Cradle Catholics, on the other hand, are culturally empowered to stand up with the Faith.
If for anything, these topics of the Catholic faith, will make sense to cradle Catholics since this will edify our innate knowledge of the Catholic faith aside from what we have known from our cultures.
I think you are right, Gerald. In our catholic cultures Catholicism used to be the culture itself. One didn't need to examine the Faith, its foundations. It was just there. Now the culture is turning atheist really fast, and people, catholics, don't have a clue of what is going on ("things used to be that way back then, but now that has changed"). Why have things changed?, why did they have to change?, what is the source of Good and Evil?, what is the tape measure that atheist society uses to decide what is Right, and what is Wrong?. Is that tape measure consistent with the philosophical underpinnings of an atheist and materialist culture?. Why do we believe Jesus was the Son of God?, can we prove it from the Bible beyond reasonable doubt?, do we have a clear understanding of what a Trascendent God implies?, do we understand there is no Right and Wrong beyond and previous to a Trascendent God?.
Nobody is asking these questions. At least not here, in my nominally catholic, spanish speaking society.
just a word to the wise. I used the link to order the CCB from St. Pauls. Bible just arrived today and it was the 34th edition and not the 59th. In fact, the version I received was older than the version I currently had and wanted to replace.
(a) the difference in style among other Pauline letters with a matching opening salutation (I, Paul, slave of God,...) and closing words (Greet each other with a holy kiss...).
(b) higher register of Greek, not only among other Pauline letters but also among other New Testament books."
The book of Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul, in fact, it is anonymous and has no name attached. And it, not just modern scholars who thought it wasn't by Paul, the Fathers of the Church didn't think so either. It was Origen in the third century who first said that no one knows who wrote Hebrews except for God. It wasn't until the fourth century that it became common to attribute Hebrews to Paul.
However, the one thing no one has ever denied is that whether or not Hebrews was written by Paul, it is absolutely 100% Pauline in theology. So whether it was written by Paul or not, it clearly represents his style of thinking and reflects his theology, and so was clearly written by someone in Paul's circle, whether Paul himself, or Apollos or Barnanbus or whomever.
So to be canonical it had to have been written by an apostle, or someone who was closely associated with an apostle, had to be in use universally in the Church, and not just locally, and it had to teach orthodox doctrine.
So, Hebrews because it was clearly written either by Paul or by someone in Paul's inner circle, because it was used everywhere and because it taught orthodox doctrine,
And what do we call Apostolocity that is written by someone who was "closely associated with an apostle" but traditionally attributed to the apostle himself?
I guess we'd call it pseudepigraphy if, and only if, it could be shown that its real author originally intended it to be attributed to someone else (i.e. the Apostle). But, if it was written by someone different from the Apostle -who never claimed this to be the Apostle's work-, and then it was erroneously attributed to the Apostle, it would not qualify as pseudepigraphy.
Yes, it's sad how the Philippines is recognized as the first Catholic country in Asia (formerly, it was the ONLY Catholic country in Asia) - but how because it is also a cultural practice, many of us take it for granted and do not study it religiously (pun intended). I have been there myself and it is only this year - after my theology classes in a Catholic university, my goodness! - that I began to be much more serious in studying all aspects of my faith.
Because of that, Protestantism is growing quite rapidly here - Evangelical and non-denominational churches are sprouting up left and right. And more and more of the so-called educated Filipinos are leaving the Mother Church for these churches - and how can I blame them, that is where they genuinely find Christ, precisely because growing up Catholic, there are a fair number of those who blindly follow the faith.
That is also exactly why, indeed, the Catholic Church in the USA flourishes in Catholic literature, because being a culturally Protestant country, they who become Catholics there have more of an impetus to study the faith seriously. It's like foreigners studying a certain language and being more highfalutin or deep in it than native speakers who take it for granted - kind of like us Chinese-Filipinos here.
Christopher can I ask how you contacted Macau to acquire your copy of the ccb? I have been trying to get a copy and have been stymied.
I encountered this translation accidentally in a shop in Ft. Worth,Texas of all places. I purchased it and read it off and on. I liked the freshness of the translation. This was in the early 90's so I am sure it was a somewhat different translation than the revised edition that is out now. I have the 56th edition!! I am guessing it is not too different from 57-59.
One interesting story: I was in Rome in 2001 and went into the Official Vatican Bookstore - publishing house - it is in the collonade to the left as you face St. Peter's. There they have the Liturgy Of the Hours in every language imaginable, every Papal Encyclical, Documents of Vatican II, Bibles in every language, and a WHOLE lot more. When I came to the section of Bibles in English, this CCB Bible was practically the ONLY one they sold! Every shape and size imaginable. Incredible.
Regarding the above review, I enjoyed reading it. I did want to point out an error by the author: he mentions the order of the Old Testament being in the order of the "Torah". I think he meant to say "Tanakh" because, as many of us know, the Torah is just the first 5 books of the Bible, not the entire Bible for the Jews. Tanakh is the correct term for what we Christians refer to as the "Old Testament". Thank you. Great Blog!

My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road, though I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always, though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone.

Teamwork, athleticism, agility and fun were the highlights of this year's student Sports Day. Due to weather related issues we rescheduled the event, which is usually in the Fall, to this Spring. We sure are glad that we did because the weather was wonderful with a shining sun and not a cloud in the sky.
The events for our Pre-Nursery and Nursery levels took place on Thursday April 27th and for our K1 and K2 on Friday April 28th. Both days students gathered in the morning with their classes and paraded in front of their parents, marching like little olympians. When all classes were presented the parents joined their children to practice the morning exercise. It was great fun watching parents dance with their kids and learn more about the things they do in their daily kindergarten routine. Next the students sat down on the sidelines as the parents competed in a wild game of Tug-A-War. Newton has many strong parents and the competition was fierce. After the victors were rewarded the classes marched off to begin the student's games. Around the campus we arranged 4 different games for the sports competition. Carefully designed by the teachers and staff the games tested students' coordination, speed, accuracy, balance and cooperation. Some of the games the parents were able to get involved and play too and in some they were able to watch and cheer from the sidelines. After all the classes completed all the games we held a small award ceremony where each student was awarded a gold medal for their efforts and participation.
It was a day full of smiles, laughs and fun competition. Newton is lucky to have so many strong kids who continue to grow and achieve new things. Sports day is a great way to show off athletic talents and and see all the progress the students are making. Each year this event is a memorable experience for students and parents, and this year was no exception. We are grateful for all the parents who were able to participate and look forward to more cooperation and fun in future Newton events!

“Heather you are authentic and have far more understanding of the complexity of what makes a healthy happy person..
my roommate died Sept 13th. lucy called 911 at 7am. i was told her heart stopped when they transferred her to the gurney. they worked on her for an hour. couldn’t bring her back.
we had these rituals that are gone. the night before we had a perfectly normal conversation. no indication she was having health issues other than she had “heart burn”. could be a cardiac sign for a woman (women generally don’t have the tv classic, left arm pain, truck sitting on your chest like men do. that is why women die of heart attacks at a greater rate, the signs are misinterpreted).
i was the first they called because i was the first person they could find. please put an emergency contact in your wallet. mine says lucy. i need to change that.
family came. we celebrated her. they cleaned out her room. i listened to them find things that she had kept and reminisce about her, and them, and their lives.
i find myself saying “silly lucy” when i think of something i want to share. the night before was SO normal, that it still seems like she could walk back in. we just remodeled our kitchen!
i went in and held her hand at the hospital. she was wearing cute underwear. (i saw them when i lifted the sheet to hold her hand. women will understand why this is important)
she was the perfect roommate. we had already started planning our house warming part. we were going to make goth tapas! (and when i say we, i mean lucy. i would make dessert).
my friends are bringing me food because they are afraid i will starve to death. just like when patrick and i split. i really love being taken care of like this. it feels good. it feels like a big family. a place where i have people supporting me. maybe that place has existed before, but i really feel it now.
i may understand that death is not personal. but my patients are sick. lucy was perfectly normal the night before. sudden death is the worst. it makes no sense. when i die, i want a 6-month cancer. doesn’t drag it out, but people get to process it before i am gone.
i have had 3 dreams (in like the last 4 days) of patrick “betraying” me. while i did not want to get divorced, patrick never betrayed me. all the dreams have him being with other women. and it hurts SO BADLY. the dream is emotionally painful. i want them to stop.
they are about people i thought were my friends. i found out a coworker applied for the team lead position but hasn’t told me. why would she do that? i told her i was applying. this is a rift i don’t think i I can forgive. i don’t hate her. but i don’t respect her anymore.
they are about my boss. we certainly do NOT betray our patients. despite everything, our patients get a level of care of have never seen in healthcare (before or after i entered the field myself.) but i think mgmt betrays us. they say all sorts of things. but nothing changes. no one who works on the floor is held accountable. messages are sent with no sense the meaning or rules will be enforced.
so what do i do about this? i don’t have another appointment set with my therapist. we both thought i had found some footing. she commented “you say ‘whatever’ a lot more” (i think implied in that she saw i felt it too). i am not even sure this is a “big” issue. it is obviously very meaningful, but is it some deep seated, life long misery? i don’t think so. at least not one i haven’t come to understand and learned to live with. i have a number of friends that say you can’t trust anyone. i don’t want to live in that world. i also don’t want to take care of any patients except the dying. how do i find this new balance? or is it just a bunch of stuff at once and will mellow out?
my refi is complete. my financial position is far more solid. i don’t HAVE to work a lot of extra hours. don’t really want to either. i want to pass the CHPN (certified hospice and palliative care nurse). i get $1/hr more for that. that’s another ~$150/month. but you have to sign up 2-months before you take it yet pay $400 it costs to take the test at that time. i’ll need some extra hours for that.
PopCats in 2 weeks. new kitchen the week after. lots happening. now if my brain would just stop being such as asshole.
so, this weekend i had some closure that has stopped a loop in my brain. i visited with the “boy who broke my heart” to see how i felt about him. was it getting better? am i getting over the heartache? (also a thing about lust that has to do with a medication i started taking, but that is WAY too complicate to explain). Anyhow…
while it was hard to hear about other women he is trying to forge relationships with, it made things clearer. while hearing, he didn’t like me quite enough to date was a virtual slap in the face (though certainly NOT what he was trying to do, i am just using a metaphor for how it feels, my feelings) it helped clear the path forward.
while i wish you felt about me the way i feel about you, thank you “boy who broke my heart” for being honest and clear. i wish and hope and offer my virtual energy so that you might find the right girl and she treats you as fabulously as you should be.

so, basically, i started it in june, but have been stewing for almost a month. not in a bad way. in a “hm, but then there is this” way. whatever…
i am refinancing my condo. after 4 years i have some great equity. it is going to relieve some stress in my life. i won’t have to work as much, if i don’t want to. i find i like having days off. i like being surprised by who is still there, gone or back when i come back after 3 days or so. i did apply for a promotion. they have listed a Team Leader for HACH. i think i am the best candidate. i don’t think i am perfect. i do think i will need the support of my boss. i worry about that support. but i KNOW i can make HACH a better place to work (not sure it can even BE a better place to die, but we’ll make that better too!)
i also like having days off because i fit into ALL my clothing again. so i have all sorts of outfits i want to wear out!
susan (from work) and i went to a haunted hotel/dancehall in Coupeland, TX last weekend. i do not believe in ghosts, but susan does. and i love weird things. we had a WONDERFUL time! i was talking with the pharm tech at CVS today and he likes creepy places too. he seemed to want to say more, but didn’t. so i said, “perhaps susan and i will need a male protector?!” he thought we might. hm.
i made the mistake of going to david’s FB page to see what he has been doing. there was a photo who took of someone in NOLA (that day). that made me SO sad. i even posted on FB about feeling stressed about things. i even mentioned “the boy who broke my heart”. he seems to read most of my stuff (considering the things he “likes”) so he may have seen me reference him. to be clear, not loving me back was fine – that is my own heart’s problem – it was the forgetting me the night of the goth ball that ended it for me.
but, with the medication, i don’t want to have sex (i have thought about this so much i feel like i must have already blogged about it?). which is super bizarre for me. though, emotionally and/or mentally, i don’t really care. i realized tonight that for the first time in my life i want to cuddle instead of have sex. it made me laugh because when patrick and i got married, he wanted to cuddle and i wanted to roll-over and go to sleep! fact is though, i do want a emotional/romantic partner. i just don’t want to have sex. i could probably enjoy having sex, i would just never finish. that causes issues. i don’t need issues like that.
kyle has started a new med for his depression that has made an AMAZING difference. he is a totally different person. he thinks about people other than himself. he has openly helped and supported me a bunch of times lately. he even joined the gym and we go together. he is my platonic husband. we act like a married couple. i really like just being around him. but i don’t want to have sex with him. i simply don’t feel like having sex. part of me wants to ask if he wants to cuddle, but i don’t want to give him the wrong impression or hurt his feelings when i don’t want to do anything more than cuddle.
i work. i sleep. i drink soylent. i read. i go to the gym with kyle. i sew. PopCats is at the end of august. i go see shows. it is a good life. i feel a little weird. everything feels ok. i am doing new weird things with newer friends. while i still love to dress up and look as perfect as possible, i am tired of men responding to me sexually, as a first interaction. my therapist told me i had to take “sex-positive” out of my personal ad on OKC, because men don’t get it. am i doomed? because my clothing fits me perfectly and shows off all the best parts of me, does that mean that is how men are always going to respond to me? life feels balanced and that feels weird. i worry i am missing something. am i missing something? or is this a peaceful feeling i simply haven’t ever achieved before?
this may not sound like a lot of thinking, but it has been. where am i? where is this all going? seems good though i fear a false sense of security. i’ll keep you posted.
i’ve had a few friends send me very nice messages lately. one who empathized with my loneliness, and while realizing being told you are awesome doesn’t make it go away, still told me i was valued. another friend was stressed at a conference but when the presenter reminded her of me, she said she was suddenly comfortable. aren’t those cool?
had a great bookclub. the strange case of the alchemist’s daughter. we always start bookclub with with Ross asking, “So, <bookclub host> why did you pick this book?” funny thing was, i couldn’t remember why i read the book. i picked it for bookclub because i enjoyed it so much. which counts, i suppose. not everyone had time to read it, because it was only like 3 weeks from our last meeting because of my work schedule. those that did really enjoyed it. i was asked if i related with any other the characters. “do any of the fatherly relationships remind me of my dad?” then i told them my ultimate dad story. some already knew, some were shocked. there was a lot of silence (i am referring to the accidental dick pic incident). and i made my standard comment, hearing things has got to help people understand why i am the way i am.
my boss gave notice. i like holly. i think she is a GREAT nurse. i don’t think she is an effective manager for that environment. i pushed back hard because we needed a leader to help improve our work and work environment. for whatever reason, she wasn’t able to do that. she went back on promises on too many occasions. all of HA mgmt has. a few people have already asked if i will apply for the job. i’d love to be a full-time “charge” nurse. deal with staffing, help with admit/discharge, work on processes, etc. but i am not a good direct people manager (and probably can’t afford the pay cut). i want to help in the best way for me to help. i’ll talk to leanne on friday, i suppose.
planning my new ikea kitchen is challenging. the app lost my updates. i think i just need to wait for the summer sale and go in to get help directly.
so, at my last sit down with my therapist she asked how i was. i said lonely. i am sad because i feel lonely. she replied “we’ve got to do something about this. Loneliness kills.” and i replied, “yes, i read that research article too.”
the problem is several things that build on themselves. i have a lot of monthly payments i have to make. which means i have to work a lot. which means i don’t get a lot of sleep. which means i don’t feel very good. which means i am not enthusiastic about dating. (and i still miss the boy).
it isn’t just dating though. i don’t have any close friends, really. i spend time with and talk with my friend Mathew pretty regularly (he is a regular reader) but he is married. my friend Stacy and i have started to do more things together. (note to self: do NOT forget the winter coat for HMart on saturday). i like some of my coworkers quite a bit. but they are married (or divorcing) with kids. with the recent struggles i have had, i have wanted to call someone. talk about what is happening. but i have no one to call. at least one i feel close to. whom i know values me as i value them. that is why this can’t be a boytoy or a playmate. i am not even sure it could be someone i was sleeping with. yeah, yeah, i have the body of a woman much younger than i am. blah, blah, blah. doesn’t keep me warm at night.
the sad are super strong tonight. my refi fell apart for some reason. last week they said all my stuff is fine, this week it isn’t. it would have REALLY taken a lot of pressure off me to refi. now that worry plus the singleness are still heavy.
i have been going out more. went to a book signing with my FAVORITE author, Christopher Moore. he signed “blessings!” in my copy of Lamb.
work work work. which will have to continue, until i can dig out of this financial position. life. but i’d rather be dating.
suppose to start my cat dress tomorrow with rosie. just want to hide in bed. not enough sleep will happen. i think i may send a note saying i have to start later. must go to bank, then i can sleep a little more. want to get pattern and fabric cut tomorrow. more than that is probably asking for too much frustration.
i was exchanging emails with my psychiatrist about changes in my meds. in my last email i said what i wanted to try. no reply so far.
going to read some romantic female and lead detective story before bed. i think i might start crying again (no this minute, just in general).
i think, as we get older, this is the thing we start to run out of. the thing that makes us panic. it isn’t exactly money we are worried about, it is having enough of it when we need it. time again. being single? time. time is running out not to be single. i had a nice weekend. worked half day on friday, went to The Dinner Party event for 20- and 30-somethings that have lost someone close to them. then i went to a girls night, that was weird. next day to Hmart, had coffee, hung around. went to the store with lucy. i went to the going away party of one of our older, and beloved neighbors. sunday i did laundry, had more coffee, picked up drugs (from the pharmacy). then went to elysium to see my friend Luna who had moved to CO. for her job. it meant i had 4 hours, max, sleep before work today, but it was totally worth it. reminded ben he needs to find me a boyfriend. but then back to work today. crazy day. so busy. didn’t leave until 9pm.
weird time thought tonight though. i got a new facial soap product and though i do think my skin looks brighter, i am getting pimples (not really hard, painful ones like i did as a teen, just bumps). so i thought to myself: i’ll use the aveeno in the shower (old product) and then new one before bed. but that assumes i have time. i didn’t eat dinner until 10pm tonight. if i had to go to work tomorrow, i wouldn’t have taken the time to wash my face because i would be trying to do the minimum things necessary to get to bed as fast as possible. not enough time. perhaps, if i were a more perfect nurse, i’d have had my charting done at 7:15pm. but i get up and help people a lot and spent 3 hours on something i shouldn’t have had to spend 3 hours on today. which reminds me i am running out of time.
he says he is working on it. some great songs on the dance floor make it almost possible to not be quite so sad. not feel quite so lonely. i think i need to try harder to get myself to 80s night. Ça Plane Pour Moi made my night. nothing like a little inappropriate french punk to make you feel good. kids today, their music doesn’t have the nihilism 80s New Wave did. ah, the cold war, it was so simple.
still REALLY miss the boy. still think of him every day. still wish he would message me that he’s made a terrible mistake and i am the awesome he is looking for. how long does it take to stop feeling heart hurt?
yeah, i am sad. and lonely. i suppose this is me getting over the boy. i offered some encouragement after one of his posts (told FB i didn’t want to see them, but whatever…) at the end i reminded him he was awesome and replied “So are you. Some day we’ll find people who fully appreciate it”. ouch. yeah, you HAD someone who fully appreciated it. me. yeah, that hurt. a lot. i composed a reply after a number of days:
“My therapist is trying to teach me to give feedback when I feel hurt. This hurt: “Some day we’ll find people who fully appreciate it.” You had someone who fully appreciated it. Me. Totally understandable that you didn’t feel the same way. Seriously, that is how life goes. Sometimes you connect, sometimes you don’t. I don’t fault you at all (really, really) for not feeling about me the way I feel about you. But to hear you say, “we’ll find people” just hurt very much. I am people. I had wanted to support you when I thought you were sad about trying to reconnect with people. But then I felt sad.
In my fantasies you change your mind and fall madly in love with me. Fantasies being what they are, I think I should go back to the social boundary you talked about earlier. I am not going to pretend you don’t exist, but I am going to try really hard to be more careful with my reflex to automatically try and help people when I think they are sad.”
his reply was somewhat vague. tone is hard online. but man, am i sad now. i went to see OMD on Friday night with, basically, all my friends. i was the single one. it was like flashback high school only i don’t have anyone to share it with. everyone i was there with has a partner. it just made me feel SO sad. i have two tickets to see NIN in Vegas in June. it is the middle of the week. i am definitely going. i fear i am going alone.
yeah, well, i have been trying to find dates online. someone interesting conversations. but none have gone anywhere. work is slow so i can’t distract myself there either (though, today, i did have a family member come up to me in a grocery store and hug me three times). refinancing my condo, taking some cash out to pay some debt. that will make things easier, less stressful. but i did buy a $200 duvet cover with skulls arranged in the shape of hearts.
Despite the new-fangled recipes with all sorts of exotic foods and fancy complex technology, sometimes you want to see on your home table is a simple summary of the classic meat dishes – roast pork. I backed down a bit in this recipe, cooking pork from classical because she wanted to see her with a side dish of potatoes that, I think, in other cases, it is extremely convenient. Alternatively, you can use in a dish or mushrooms.
Today the second house will be a dish of pork, which is at the minimum set of products, the result is nutritious, spicy taste and appetizing aroma. Pork ribs are perfect for everyday menus and for how hot main meal. Special requirements to the choice of pork ribs, but prunes it is desirable to use a thick, seedless. Prunes in the recipe will give the finished pork ribs.
A dish like meat stew with vegetables, pleasant in all respects. It’s delicious, affordable and easy to prepare, given the fact that we use the help of a slow cooker. Active work time with meat and vegetables will spend about 15 minutes, meanwhile multivarka itself stew main course for two hours, I will spend time cakes with raisins for lunch and sponge cake with banana filling for an evening dessert.

Usually any article of food causes salivation rampant and inevitable trip to the fridge in search of “something”. I’m sure that today you into the kitchen not going. Today the talk is about the strangest dishes in the world. For those countries where they were invented, it can be quite normal food, even a delicacy. You’ve probably heard about the dishes of their monkey brains, fried Scorpions, a bear’s paw, rotten fish and similar “delicacies”. We wouldn’t come to cook this dish in his kitchen, but, drat, eat, and praising…. What can you offer hospitable hosts from the “special dishes”?
No, not the lollies in the shape of sea horses, like our “males”. It’s a Chinese delicacy – fried seahorses on a wooden skewer. The range can offer even grasshoppers or Scorpions – delicacies for any taste!
This Japanese delicacy. And this is not wasps encroach on sweet sticky cookie dough. This is a specially prepared dessert, for which OS is pre-boiled in boiling water, dried and added to the dough. A pack of those biscuits is not expensive – less than a hundred rubles. I wonder how the chef copes with the wasps before they get into hot water? Continue reading →
Modern cooking can be considered art, and each dish has its price. For the preparation of the most expensive meals in the world require the best products and chef of the highest level. Expensive meals are in fact the same that we can buy at the regular price every day. The difference lies only in the fact that in the composition there will be some unusual ingredients. It can be made of gold, meat, unusual fish, and some unique, rare plant or animal components. So what products can enter into the most expensive dishes?
If the recipe is saffron . you can be sure that it is expensive. Hundreds of thousands of stamens marigold assembled by hand to get a pound of this spice. At the same time, you can afford to add saffron to the usual pastries, meat, fish or vegetables. For four servings of the finished dish will only need about half a gram. In almost all countries of the world have a recipe that uses this expensive spice. In Russia, the saffron is added to cakes, in India most of the dishes contain this spice. Spanish paella without saffron, and Italian risotto. For best aroma and flavour of spices should be of high quality. Continue reading →

If you suffer from leaking bladder accidents when you cough or laugh or sneeze, or if you have the urge of going to the bathroom all the time, you are not alone. Millions of people across all ages, both genders and all races are affected by this common problem that is termed urinary incontinence (UI), a loss of bladder control. The good news is that the underlying medical condition causing urinary incontinence is almost always treatable and today it is possible to get affordable treatment overseas through medical tourism.
Though urinary incontinence can be classified into several types, its three main types are: stress, urge and overflow.
Stress incontinence occurs during certain activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise, and is most commonly caused by weak pelvic floor muscles.
Urge incontinence or overactive incontinence involves a sudden urge to urinate followed by instant bladder contraction and involuntary loss of urine, and occurs regardless of the amount of urine that is in the bladder.
Overflow incontinence is the constant dribbling of urine usually associated with urinating frequently and in small amounts, and may be caused by weak bladder muscles or a blocked urethra.
Depending on the cause, type and severity of urinary incontinence as well as your lifestyle, treatment approaches available to you may include weight loss, exercises, medications, bladder retraining (timed voiding), biofeedback, electrical stimulation, and if all else fails, then surgery.
Medical tourism is the act of traveling from one city to another within your country (domestic medical tourism) or to another country by crossing international borders (overseas medical tourism) to obtain medical care that is either not available or not affordable at your local provider. The popularity of medical tourism is largely due to the availability of high quality care at a highly discounted price.
Healthcare providers participating in medical tourism boast of modern facilities with state-of-the-art equipments and technologies, and surgeons who are trained or educated in the US or Europe – all this at a cost that’s 60% to 90% cheaper compared to typical US hospital rates.
Several procedures are offered abroad for the surgical treatment of all types of incontinence – stress, urge, overflow, mixed, etc.
For curing stress incontinence in women, sling procedures such as Tension-free transvaginal (TVT) sling, Transobturator tape (TOT) sling and Mini-sling procedure are available overseas. Another type of procedure for stress incontinence treatment offered abroad is bladder neck suspension procedure which includes Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz procedure (MMK procedure) or a variant of it called Burch procedure.
To treat severe urge incontinence, procedures offered overseas include augmentation cystoplasty or a newer procedure called sacral nerve stimulation.
For the treatment of urinary incontinence in men, some of the procedures available abroad include artificial urinary sphincter, male sling, and urinary diversion.
Some of the most popular countries that patients from the United States travel to for urinary incontinence procedures are Mexico, India, Singapore and Thailand.
Apart from the considerably lower cost of surgery, Mexico is preferred for another obvious reason – its close proximity to the United States. This means shorter travel times and more convenience for the medical tourist.
Singapore‘s high quality of care along with the large concentration of internationally accredited hospitals in the country play a major role in its demand in the medical tourism market for incontinence surgery. Furthermore, English being the official language of the country makes communication with your international provider easy.
But, if you want the best value for your money then India is the answer. The medical tourism hotspot offers prices on procedures that are unbeatable. For instance, a TVT or a TOT procedure, inclusive of the hospital charges and the doctor’s fees, costs approximately USD2,500*.
Also note that urinary incontinence surgery abroad typically involves a 2-3 day stay at the hospital followed by a 3-6 day of recuperation or rehab at a nearby hotel before returning home.
So, if an incontinence surgery is what your local doctor has recommended and treatment abroad is what you wish to seek, then get your local doctor’s report along with any and all reports of diagnostic tests and then call upon a reputed medical tourism company such as Healthbase for a consultation with an overseas incontinence specialist of your choice.
*Note: The price mentioned is for rough planning purposes only. The actual price charged may vary based on your specific medical condition, the provider chosen, currency fluctuations or for any other reason. Transportation, hotel accommodation and food are not included in the price.

Human development is shaped by the physical and human environment at all stages of life, so life course research is vital for improving health and wellbeing outcomes. What is the future of life course research in New Zealand? How can we all contribute and be involved? Where is this research heading?
These questions will be addressed at a major symposium He Ora te Whakapiri: Unleashing the potential of New Zealand’s life course research this week in Wellington. The conference will be opened by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor, at Te Papa on 18 October.
Hosted by the three health and wellbeing National Science Challenges, A Better Start, Healthier Lives and Ageing Well, this symposium brings together leading thinkers about life course research from New Zealand and overseas, and serves to create new synergies to apply innovative research to help New Zealanders live healthy and successful lives.
“Life course research takes researchers out of their comfort zones. It brings together people from disciplines that rarely meet. The goal is to generate new questions and new ways of asking questions about key stages in our lives from birth to our later years,” says A Better Start Director Professor Wayne Cutfield.
The conference aims to achieve a discussion on improving the health and wellbeing of people from birth to old age and support better lives and brighter futures for the country, and how a life course approach can help us to better understand the impact of events and experiences during important periods of our lives.
“Taking a life course approach is about more than just producing academic outputs. Life course findings are used to inform policy and practice in Aotearoa,” says another of the organisers Dr Reremoana (Moana) Theodore, from Ageing Well and a co-Director of the National Centre for Lifecourse Research.
Life course research helps us understand the impact of events on our health throughout our life journey. That knowledge should be able to help inform policy and practice so that individuals, whānau and communities can steer a course to more healthy lives.
Healthier Lives Director Professor Jim Mann notes that the symposium will reveal that research also needs to focus on adults and intergenerational effects.
Professor Mann will chair a session of future directions of life course that will include research from Professor Rod Jackson of the University of Auckland that has also potentially identified reversible factors in adult life.
“Life course research to date has identified many determinants of health outcomes. I hope that discussions at the symposium will clarify which of these warrant translation into interventions which can be tested and translated into actions most likely to improve the health of all New Zealanders.”
Keynote speakers include Professor Janeen Baxter, Director of the Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course, University of Queensland, whose research focus is on the impact of intergenerational transfer of inequality, and Professor Richie Poulton, Director of the National Centre for Life course Research, University of Otago, who leads the Dunedin Study, New Zealand’s longest running longitudinal health and development study.

Six months from diagnoses he passed. I can go back as far as 2005 for symptoms. some of the things that happened in his lifetime, he worked on a tracker at the age of 12, he did canal work for a few years, he worked in a metal printing shop for 25 years, he was a Forman for a crane company for 10 years, and he was a truck driver for over 15 years, this was his favorite job.
He smoked until the age of 55. These are some of the things in hi s life time, he would have been 71 in January. He lost his sense of smell about 20 years ago and his sense of taste not long after.
I'm telling you these things about him, so you can see if your loved one can relate to any of these. I know we are always looking for something to click with this disease.
I am holding up, good moments and really bad moments. But I have to say it is a total relief to see him at peace, it's like the stress was just taken off , like you would take off a piece of clothing. We were married for 52 1/2 years. So yes I am feeling the alone thing. Love and hugs to all of you that are still caring for you love one.
Feeling so sad to hear about your news but glad Charles is at peace. At least now he is free of this dreadful disease. Your memories from throughout your long and happy marriage will sustain you and when you feel the peace and love of everyone who cares about you hopefully that will help in the days to come then surround yourself with everyones kind wishes and find time to grieve and think of the lovely man who was your life partner and whom you shared so much with. Sending you my condolences and thoughts. Pauline xx
Alma you are both free from this terrible PSP you are Free although this illness will never leave your memory and neither will Charles.
His ending was at home he was kept comfortable. Once his oxygen was gone 4 minutes was all it took. He was so very ready. I am so glad he chose not to have any life saving devices. He was in enough pain. The week before he started grabbing his head and saying it hurt. Also the last 3 weeks dementia set in 90%. All in all his last day was peaceful.
Your job now, is to look after yourself! You have proved you are a good Carer, put your skills to work, by caring for Alma! There is only one way to grieve and that's YOUR way and at your speed.
What a lovely photo of someone who sounds as if he was a lively, interesting man. Apart from also being a lovely man, my C doesn't have anything in common with Charles. It's a mystery where PSP starts. To me anyway. Hopefully the experts will find out more.
I'm so sorry your darling man has left you but as you say, he is now free. I hope you will now be able to recharge your batteries and start doing things for yourself.
Hugs to you Alma and so nice of you to give so much information , it's always good to compare . I know how sweet it is to feel sublime relief when a loved one passes out of agony, my sister died age 34 many years ago after suffering horrendous pain for 3 years, it was a relief beyond words when she left us. Don't feel guilty , you cared and loved and he can suffer no more x
What a handsome cowboy, rustling traffic across the country side! Thank you for sharing his work history with this site. Coincidentally, I have asked carers such as yourself to help create a study, more of a survey, that could help enlighten us.
As for now, please know that my heart goes out to you and your family. Believe it or not, you have become a stronger person because of PSP. Though it has won the battle, it has not won the war.
Alma so sorry to hear this sad news, but he really is in a better place, sending you a big hug. Yvonne xxxxx
Dear Alma - I so liked the title of your post. Yes, that horrible PSP has finally been kicked out where it was never welcome to start with. 52+ years of marriage, wow. Yes, it must feel very lonely now, but you lost the real Charles a while ago. I hope you have loving family and friends round you and I am sending you a warm hug to hopefully brighten your day. I look at the things you mentioned about Charles, his work, the smoking... and it's almost totally different from my dad's life (PSP sufferer). Abirke mentioned to start our own study, to just start writing down essentials before we forget, to see if anything 'clicks'. There must be something common... I'll go find that post now .
So sorry for your loss Alma. It's terribly sad though I can't help feeling a joy for Charles to finally be free of this wretched illness. God bless you xx
So sorry to hear of your sad loss but I can detect a great sense of relief that he is no longer having to suffer this awful disease. Take care and look after yourself. Kate xx
So sorry to hear of Charles` passing. I don`t feel I can add any more to the wise words already posted, but we are all thinking of you.
Alma, my sincere condolences to you and your family. My wife was also misdiagnosed with Parkinson's, but it was only one year later when one of the doctors happen to see her in their neurology group and determined it was PSP. Wondering why it took so long to determine Charles' correct diagnosis. Did he see a neurologist on a regular basis?
My wife never lived on a farm, never drank well water, never around much pesticides, and never smoked a day in her life. She was a hair stylist for about 6 years, but prior to that, she was a wonderful housewife, raising 2 awesome children. Often thought her PSP could have been caused by all those hair chemicals that she was around, but I've never heard of an influx of hair stylists getting this disease. But she did have several aunts and uncles who had Patkinson's on her mom's side of the family. But as hidden as PSP is, some of them could of had PSP too.
I enlisted hospice for my bride this week and it was a tough decision, but I'm sure it was the right one. She behaves now like she is comatose, but occasionally will make some sounds and will sometimes squeeze my hand or blink her eyes when I ask her to. I'm praying that she is not in any physical pain. Was Charles' pain from his difficulty breathing? Had he aspirated? Kim's lungs are currently clear, but my fear is she can easily catch something from others. With all the hospice folk coming as well as family during the holidays, I worry she will acquire something rather easily. I'm closely observing everyone she comes into contact, and if they appear sick, I will show them the door (politely of course).
Again, so sorry for your loss. Do reflect on the good times with Charles and do take good care of yourself. I'm sure that would be what he would have wanted.
He was seeing a neurologist on a regular schedule, every 2 months. But he had no clue about PSP. He just kept upping his medication. I finally wrote his first neurologist and set up an appointment and told him I thought it was PSP and not Parkinson's . He took less than a few minutes to determine it was PSP. This was 2 1/2 years later. If I had not had to change doctors, we most likely would have know sooner, the MRI didn't catch it the first time.j
Charles had never aspirated, and they never found fluid in his lungs. With Charles I also worried about something coming in and making it worse, so I had 4 containers of Clorox wipes near entrance and wiped everything down several times a day.mi also had visitors wear gloves and masks if they thought they may have been exposed to anything.
I did forget to mention that there were many times that my husband had been hit in the head. Car accident, loading trucks, motorcycle accident, and clearing out trees, also he was a self taught mechanic.
It sounds like your wife is in the same area of health, that my Charles was at one time. Take notes on changes you see each day. If she starts rubbing or holding her head, that is a sign of pain. This was the only time Charles showed pain. It was 5 weeks from the time he was completely bedridden.
You do what you think is best, at all times. Because unless they are there 24/7 they have no clue as to what is best. I am very heartbroken that I lost Charles, but to be honest I lost him the first week he was bedridden. So I had already started my grieving process.💔
I am sorry for your loss and understand the pain you are now going through as I lost my husband a month ago. The relief of him being free of the disease and knowing I did all I could helps to get through each day. The pain can become unbearable at times. No one can knows what this loss is like until they go through it. I keep busy with friends and family but there is still the times you are alone and the loss comes flowing in. Let yourself grieve at these times no matter how painful it is. Take one step at a time. My prayers are with you.
I am truly sorry for your loss, but as you, I feel the same, PSP took all that they were. So we just need to hold on to what was before it came along.
Condolences. Take each day at a time until the pain lessens and you can remember with a smile and not a tear. God bless you.
Such a lovely photo. I'm so sorry you lost your husband to this terrible disease but now it no longer has a hold over him. May you find strength for the days that lie ahead and comfort knowing he is at peace. Lots if live, Nanny xx

There are three ways to search for authority data as shown in Figure 1, i.e. 1-1. Search by Keyword, 1-2. Search by Classification Numbers and 1-3. Search by Authority ID.
Search objects include Authorized Headings and References as well as kata-kana form and romanized form of them.
If you search for personal names and cannot find any results, be sure to insert a space between the family name and given name.
Search results are affected by spaces between words. Expressions in the search index have spaces between words. If your search does not find any items of interest by using kata-kana form or romanized form, be sure to separate each word with a space.
Characters shown below are normalized and are considered identical in searches. Thus, a user may input either form and get the same search results.
Upper case “ツ”, “ヤ”, “ユ”, “ヨ”, “ア”, “イ”, “ウ”, “エ”, “オ”, “ワ” and lower case “ッ”, “ャ”, “ュ”, “ョ”, “ァ”, “ィ”, “ゥ”, “ェ”, “ォ”, “ヮ” are recognized as the same letter (same for hiragana).
All half-width and full-width punctuations or symbols other than the above are handled as spaces. An AND search is conducted for character strings before and after a space.
If you want to search for the heading “AT&Tベル研究所”, you can also get the same results by searching for “AT△Tベル研究所”, where the △ indicates a space. Searching for “ATTベル研究所” does not find any items of interest.
Due to system restrictions, a keyword that contains only a single kanji in combination with other characters will often fail to find meaningful hits from the authority data.
The Classification Number Search allows users to search for authority data for Geographic Name, Uniform Title, and Topical Term by representative classification numbers from the Nippon Decimal Classification (NDC) 9th Revised Edition, NDC 10th Revised Edition or the National Diet Library Classification (NDLC), which are assigned to the authority data. Users can choose either from a dropdown list ((a) in Figure 2) to search. In addition to searching for exact matches, users can do a prefix search by adding either a half-width asterisk (*) or full-width asterisk (＊) at the end of the search string.
Example: Searching for ME352 will find headings with a representative classification of ME352, such as “阿賀川”, etc.
Example: Searching for ME* will find headings with a representative classification that starts with ME, such as “雨” (representative classification of ME129) or “阿賀川” (representative classification of ME352).
Users may select “All”, “Name”, or “Topical Name” radio button in the search window ((b) in Figure 2.). Users can search Geographic Name and Uniform Title by selecting the “Name” button, and can search Topical Term by selecting the “Topical Name” button.
Results of Keyword Search and Classification Number Search are displayed in a list, as shown in Figure 4 below. The screen comprises the following parts: (a) Search conditions, (b) Search refinement (Type of Authority), (c) Page feed, (d) Records per page and (e) Search results. The description of each part is as follows.
If a user refines the search results by Type of Authority, the Type of Authority and any keywords are displayed under “Your searched:”.
(b) Search refinement(Type of Authority) Users can refine search results by Type of Authority, such as Personal name, Family Name, Corporate Body Name, Geographic Name, Uniform Title, Topical Term, and Subdivision. Select the “All” to clear all filters.
(c) Page feed Numbers refer to page numbers. Click a number to go to the page. Click “<<Prev” or “Next>>” link to go to the previous or next page.
(e) Search results The Authorized Heading exactly matched with the query is shown at the top of the search results. Other search results are sorted in order of transcription of the heading.
Search results are shown in the following format. In the “See also” Reference, only Personal name and Corporate Body Name will be displayed.
This shows detailed individual authority data from search results. This screen is divided into 4 parts as shown in Figure 5: (a) Detailed Information of the authority data, (b) Graphical Display, (c) Search Box, and (d) Search bibliographic data via NDL Search. The description of each part is as follows.
Data items shown in the Detailed Information tab are shown below. Each item is explained in the following table.
3 Heading Authorized Heading of the Authority data. Transcription by katakana is shown as ruby characters (format will vary per web browser). Subdivisions are connected with main-heading by two hyphens.
6 Variant(s) (synonym) Linked to “See” reference for Topical Term or Subdivision. Transcription by is shown as ruby characters (format will vary per web browser).
11 Each Heading (rdfs: See Also) When a subdivision which is also used as a main heading (e.g.“年鑑”) is included in the subject heading with subdivisions(e.g. “eマーケティング--年鑑”)、the subject heading with subdivisions will be divided into main heading and subdivision and links of each Authority data will be shown. (Note that if the divided Authority data is Geographic Name or the Uniform Title or Geographic Name with Subdivisions (e.g.“万葉集--植物”, “イギリス--人口--歴史”), they are not founded.
16 Date of Establishment The date of establishment of the corporate body recorded in Corporate Body Name Authority data.
17 Date of Termination The date of termination of the corporate body recorded in Corporate Body Name Authority data.
18 Period of Duration An active period of the corporate body, which was reorganized after disestablished.
21 Classification Number Representative Classification assigned to Geographic Name, Uniform Title, or Topical Terms. By clicking the classification number of the “NDC10”, “NDC9” or “NDLC” (each classification scheme is shown in parentheses after the classification number), users can access the List Screen of Authority data with the same representative classification number.
(skos:closeMatch) Links to the Library of Congress Control Number (LCCN) or the record ID number of the Basic Subject Headings (BSH).

11 short days ago, we welcomed our newest member to the family. Finley Dianna was born on August 3, at 8:26 am. She came into this world screaming, with a head full of dark brown hair. She was our smallest baby, weighing just 6 pounds and 7 ounces.
Her birthday was a calm, peaceful day. We drove to the hospital at 6 in the morning, equally terrified and excited. Since our first two babies were born via c-section, she was scheduled to arrive the same way at 39 weeks, and 1 day. If you recall my previous pregnancies, you'll know that this was weeks earlier than my other babies, and when the time came I couldn't believe that it was happening so soon.
We parked and nervously made our way to the labour and delivery ward. We were sent to a room to change, and before we knew it we were ushered into a pre-op room. Soon, it was time to head into the OR. I went in alone, and waited until Ryan was allowed to be by my side. Scheduled c-sections are a very surreal experience. The rest was a blur of tugging and waiting, and then... a tiny, but loud cry. Our sweet baby. Our third perfect daughter. Finley... our grand finale.
We had a few hours to soak up our brand new baby before we welcomed some of her family to meet her. First, and most importantly... her big sisters. My entire pregnancy, Aaralee had been excited about meeting her sister, while Briley seemed oblivious to the huge life change ahead. I was shocked that from the moment they met, it was Briley who was obsessed. She constantly asks to hold her and can't get enough of her tiny toes. Aaralee is a bit more reluctant, and prefers her baby dolls.
We spent a couple of days in the hospital before finally being set free to go home! We buckled Finley into her carseat, in awe of how tiny she looked.
And then, we were home. Home to start our lives as a family of 5. I remember the early days with Aaralee. They were filled with anxiety, overthinking and sleep deprivation. This third time around felt like a dream. Having a 3 and 4 year old makes a newborn feel like a breeze. She is so content, so tiny, and she doesn't climb the furniture or talk back yet.
We are all so in love, and she rarely gets set down because I can't resist the urge to constantly snuggle her and sniff her sweet newborn head. When I do stop holding her, it's typically to pick up my camera so that I can capture these fleeting newborn moments.
Welcome to our family, my sweet girl. We didn't realize that you were the missing piece of our puzzle until you arrived, and now I can't imagine a world without you.
Summer time is hands down my favourite time of year. In our family, July and August are typically jam packed with fun adventures. We try to spend the least amount of time at home, opting to be outside. We camp, we swim, we stay up late, and we go on at least one long road trip each year. By the time that September rolls around, we are suntanned, happy, and ready for the crisp autumn air.
This year has been a bit different. With a baby due in August and a huge backyard to landscape, this summer has involved a whole lot of time at home. Aside from a short mountain trip for my birthday, we haven't left the city. Ryan has spent every dry day (and some rainy days) outside, slaving away at the seemingly endless job that is our backyard. He goes straight out after work and comes in when it's time to sleep. The kids have had more screen time and fast food than I care to admit and my patience levels have reached a record low.
It's hard not to feel like we are missing out, and impossible to not feel guilty about our lack of fun. Both of my girls came long past their due dates and neither without medical intervention, so I feel like odds are this one won't make an early appearance. But I know that every pregnancy is different, so I do the responsible thing, and stick close to home, no matter how much I long to flee the city.
I keep seeing a post on Facebook about how we only get 18 summers with our kids, and how we need to make them count. Meanwhile, I'm turning on another movie and making peanut butter and jam sandwiches for lunch for the fourth day in a row. We spend most of our time in our air conditioned house for the sake of my swollen feet and lack of energy. Am I letting my kids down? Will they be sad when summer ends and we didn't do anything spectacular? Will they remember how grumpy and lazy Mommy was? Am I ruining their childhood?
I hope that when they think back upon this summer, they'll remember cuddling on the couch with their little hands firmly pressed upon my belly, feeling their baby sister move. I hope they'll remember afternoons spent in the pool, and Mommy making giant splashes trying to climb into her inflatable donut.
I know for a fact that they'll remember eating far more ice cream than they'd normally be allowed, because Mommy's cravings have been out of control. I hope they'll remember playing hopscotch and blowing bubbles on the driveway, because we don't yet have a yard for them to play in. Most of all, I hope that they remember this summer as the summer that they met their baby sister. All of these long, boring days spent cooped up indoors are going to be so very worth it in just a matter of weeks. Aaralee talks about the baby every hour of the day, and Briley asks me every morning if she is still in my tummy. They are going to be such good sisters. This baby is going to be loved so much.
July has been pretty uneventful, but August will be here before we know it, and so will our brand new family member. Our summer adventure is only just beginning.
On Friday, my sweet Briley turned 3 years old! It seems like just yesterday I was holding her for the very first time, rubbing her bald head and staring in awe at the immense size of her cheeks. Today, she is a crazy blonde ball of energy. I can't imagine a world without the constant joy that she adds to it. She makes us laugh, gives the very best hugs (she calls them unicorn hugs, because unicorns are superior to bears), and is as stubborn as they come.
I love birthday party planning, but at 32 weeks pregnant I couldn't possibly pull off quite as elaborate of an event as previous years. It would be a quieter party, with less decor and food and time invested. That's what I told myself, but then my inner DIY addict took over. Before I knew it, I was in over my head with projects and baking.
Every morning Briley climbs into our bed, bright and early. She snuggles for approximately 23 seconds before sitting up and declaring "I want breff-ist". This girl lives for breakfast, it is without a doubt her favourite time of day. It was decided, she would have a pancakes and pyjamas themed brunch party. The pyjamas part might have been more for me, because these days I'll take any excuse to avoid getting dressed.
We stocked up on cereal, made a huge batch of pancakes, several packs of bacon, and we were ready! It was time for a brunch party!
The cake was a labour of love. It was my first time ever using fondant, so I fully anticipated that I might have to send Ryan to buy a grocery store cake last minute. Much to my surprise, it worked out! Briley absolutely loved her giant stack of pancakes!
One thing that really struck me this party was just how fast my girls and their friends are growing up. Our guest list has remained pretty consistent over the years, so it is so fun to see the progression as the kids get older. This year, most of the kids went upstairs to play or did their own thing instead of constantly sticking to their parents. It was so much fun watching them all play together and truly enjoy the birthday party chaos.
Briley had such a great day and was so spoiled with so many amazing gifts. She is so lucky to have so many amazing friends and family members that love her so much. Thank you for making her special day so perfect!
This quote often circulates on social media and seems to resonate with parents. The days ARE long. I am a stay at home mom. I spend almost every waking hour catering to my children's needs. Most days, I love it, and other days I struggle to maintain my sanity. Regardless of the outcome, when Briley climbs into my bed at 6:30 am, I know that I'm always in for another long day.
And then suddenly, a photo pops up from a year ago, or even a few months ago, and I wonder where the time has gone. How do these long days accumulate and turn into months and years so quickly?
Our long days together are everything. They are their childhood, the memories that they'll carry into adulthood.
I've always wanted to spend an entire day with my camera, capturing the simple moments that make up our days. The breakfasts, the routine, the chaos. Our life, in this chapter, and a day in it.
Today, I finally carried out this plan. I missed some moments, like dinner, bath time, temper tantrums, and car rides. I'm also not in any of the photos, which isn't an accurate representation of our days. The photos aren't perfect and beautiful.
Oh hi, I'm Krysta. I live in Alberta, Canada, and until recently I was living my dream of being a cabin crew member for an airline and essentially getting paid to travel. I began this journey working for an international airline based in Dubai. Love lead me home, where I jumped at the opportunity to work for an airline based in my very own country. I married my best friend in 2012, and life changed drastically on September 10, 2013 when our beautiful daughter Aaralee was born. My stories of dining in Paris and exploring Hong Kong have transitioned to updates on my baby, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I lived my dream, and now I'm living an entirely new one. Our second daughter Briley was born in June 15, and these days my world revolves around my 2 little girls.
I'm still aviation obsessed and a travel addict. I still love to take photos of beautiful places and try delicious new foods. I'm still up for any adventure, so long as I can bring my kids or find a babysitter!
I really like friends. If you want to email me just to say hi, or talk, or whatever, email me at larson.krysta@gmail.com. If you are looking for an internet girlfriend or webcam buddy, don't waste your time. Have a super day, thanks for visiting!

Canadian Football League: Commissioner Randy Ambrosie is Leading the Charge of Many Good Things to Come
Videoconferencing telecommunication technologies have come a long way since those first rudimentary commercial experimentations in Germany during the late 1930s. The next major step in video telephony was unveiled in the United States during the early 1970s as part of AT&T’s development of the Picturephone. Today, it is Montreal-based CBCI Telecom that is widely regarded as a preeminent world leader in the most comprehensive videoconferencing solutions, enabling simultaneous visual and audio collaboration between two or more locations.
As high capacity broadband Internet and more powerful computer processors began to emerge in the mid to late 1990s, the progression of videoconferencing solutions surged, most notably in the business, education, medicine and multimedia sectors.
The Canadian Business Journal recently spoke with CBCI Telecom President and CEO Denis Dumouchel about the many innovative advancements, which have transpired within the industry. Of note, Dumouchel provided a first-hand demonstration of just how impressive his company’s system performs by speaking with us via videoconferencing from his head office in Montreal, while we were positioned in front of a large monitor in the boardroom of another of the company’s locations north of Toronto; speaking face to face, yet hundreds of kilometres apart. The video quality that is displayed on the monitors is outstanding, typically delivering at speeds between 1.5 kbps and 1.7 kbps and virtually no packet loss with an excellent synchronization between the audio and video.
CBCI Telecom has origins dating back to 1988 when most modern technological communications were still quite cost prohibitive including such things as fax machines, cellphones and wireless modems. By 1991, CBCI had become more heavily involved in the cellphone business and it was in 1993 when CBCI added the word Telecom to the company’s official name, aiming to branch out their enterprise opportunities as technology continued to evolve at a whirlwind pace.
“It was around 1992 when we saw videoconferencing as potential new technology that would revolutionize the way people communicate with one another,” Dumouchel recalls. “We decided to create and to manufacture our own videoconferencing with a codec, which is the brain behind the camera. By 1995 we were the fifth-largest videoconferencing manufacturer worldwide with 11 offices in the U.S. and five offices in Canada.”
In 1997, CBCI Telecom was acquired by TANDBERG, a Norwegian company that had designs on aggressively pursuing the U.S. market.
Following the acquisition by TANDBERG, CBCI Telecom bought back the telecom division in 1998 and became private once again, concentrating solely on videoconferencing. Eleven years later TANDBERG was acquired by Cisco and CBCI Telecom was recognized as the best videoconferencing reseller for Cisco, an accomplishment they managed to achieve each and every year while working alongside TANDBERG.
“We’re the only undefeated best reseller partner of the year since 1999, and that’s just on the video front,” Dumouchel proudly says.
CBCI Telecom has 66 employees working out of four offices: head office in Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa and Richmond Hill, ON. About 15 people are in the sales department and seven in administration with another seven to 10 stationed on the help desk. The remaining 30 or so are part of the engineering team, handling project management, design, documentation, and consulting, some of whom specialize in videoconferencing, while others work on collaboration and audio-visual.
“We service customers across the country and throughout the world. We have an excellent relationship with a number of other resellers that we’ve done business with for 15 years. If there happens to be a very complex setup, we will send our own guys. We always aim to provide the very best products and services for our customers,” Dumouchel says.
Throughout the years CBCI Telecom has developed numerous niche markets and a widespread portfolio of clients, with healthcare being a predominant sector. As just one example, a doctor in a remote area is immediately able to evaluate a patient’s health by video and audio. Other notable applications for the videoconferencing units are within the justice system, including courthouses and prisons.
Not only does the new technology control the video and audio feeds, but it has the best security features built in as well, ensuring that there is no unauthorized access. It is the type of technology that is able to enhance work efforts in both the public and private sectors.
“The cloud is where a lot of business is moving,” Dumouchel adds. “About seven years ago we created our first cloud-based videoconferencing platform. Now we have three clouds, including one which is dedicated for the (Quebec) provincial government.”
Whether it’s using iPhone or iPad or laptop, video is firmly entrenched to be a fundamental aspect of the future. More and more people are disposing of their home telephone landlines because they almost exclusively now use cellphones. Similarly, people appreciate video to a greater degree because there is an ability to look at people’s faces and immediately gauge their true reactions. As Dumouchel points out, the younger generation is not afraid of the camera or using mobile communications so it’s only going to continue to flourish beyond where it stands now.
Methods of data packet transfer are now also made much easier through IP transfer. In the past, the only option was ISDN, which was a good solution in its day, but far inferior to today’s technology. Remote locations are able to use satellite, if necessary.
“All our devices can do either IP or ISDN. When you have satellite, for us it becomes an IP. The fact that it’s a satellite doesn’t really make any difference, it’s more about the latency,” Dumouchel explains. “A satellite becomes more of a challenge the same way if you’re calling, for example, you have more of a delay because of the distance. There’s just a slight delay in the speed when using satellite.”
Network encryption and the method of transfer via IP have both dramatically improved as newer technologies have emerged and the pricing has also been drastically reduced in terms of bandwidth usage. At the same time the codec manufacturers have done an excellent job of creating new frameworks to reduce the requirement of bandwidth. Both the codec and the networks have improved so dramatically that any fears of technical problems have now virtually dissipated. The advent of high-definition and flat-screen monitors has also greatly enhanced the business of videoconferencing with incredibly crisp, clear video and audio.
“Nowadays we’re getting a very nice quality of video on the TV so we’re trying to replicate the feeling of that – having HD at home into the office,” Dumouchel says.
Many large law firms in Canada are also working with CBCI Telecom. For the legal profession, it is critical to be able to share information and expertise on an audio-visual network that is trustworthy and dependable. Healthcare has been – and will continue to be – a natural fit for videoconferencing with still numerous untapped potential applications according to Dumouchel. “For us, the next step is to work with the pharmacies. The desire for us is to have them connect with doctors in the hospitals. You could walk in to your pharmacy and it would allow the pharmacist and the doctor to directly interact about the patient’s needs. It would be a much more efficient way of treating people.”
The majority of the research and product development undertaken by CBCI Telecom to this point has been aimed predominantly towards the commercial market, both private and public. The federal government and the Quebec provincial government are just two examples of major clients using CBCI Telecom. However, Dumouchel envisions expanding horizons. “I think the next step for us would be to look more on the residential front where it would allow people to use video from their homes.”
The success of CBCI Telecom is readily evident both through its impressive list of corporate clients and also the dedication of its highly-skilled employees. Dumouchel is exceptionally proud of his team and the efforts they put forth on a daily basis to ensure the company remains at the very top of this high-tech industry.
“We have the most talented resources and we know that you have to treat your employees the way you treat your customers,” he says. “I believe in treating people the way I want to be treated – with respect. That is at the very core of our values.”
Since taking the helm as president and CEO in September, 2011, Dumouchel has been instrumental in the continuous ongoing success of CBCI Telecom, solidifying the company’s position as Canada’s leader in visual communications.
“My job is to ensure each regional office is used 100% efficiently,” he says. “The number one concern is to always take care of the customer.”
Strategic partners in the U.S. and around the world utilize the resources and expertise of CBCI, meaning the company doesn’t need to literally maintain a global presence. As long as those partners are using the brainpower of CBCI, Dumouchel is more than satisfied. He is also cognizant of not growing the business too quickly and aggressively because it risks dilution of the products and services. It’s also challenging and crucially important to find people with the right skills so it is absolutely critical to follow through on comprehensive due diligence when adding new employees.
As top-tier communicators, Dumouchel and his team recently decided it was time to unveil a new corporate website, noting many of the new adaptation of philosophies and technologies at CBCI Telecom that are now at the forefront of the company’s current and future endeavours. In addition to showcasing products and services, a website is an international marketing gateway to a company’s personality, characteristics and accomplishments. As a vital marketing tool, Dumouchel made a point of a new website being a top priority.
“We were so focused on the work we are doing in the field for our clients we had an older website and it was time to update it,” he says. “Our philosophy has changed from what it was 20 years ago and we wanted to reflect that change on our new site. The old philosophy was more along the lines of pushing intelligence; now it’s a pull. The idea is to put information on your website to make people come to you.”
Outside of CBCI Telecom there is currently a herculean battle brewing between two major worldwide manufacturers who are seeking ultimate control: Microsoft and Cisco. Dumouchel believes that within the next few years one will likely emerge as the sole leader in unified communications solutions. CBCI Telecom, with its specialized technology, is well positioned to move seamlessly forward, regardless of which one of those two titans ultimately ends up on top. The company’s position as a VAR – Value Added Reseller – allows CBCI Telecom to look at every solution offered by the manufacturers, and the company is not tied to a single manufacturer.
“We can deliver our visual solutions any place, independently from our clients’ locations and networks, and virtually anywhere — whether it’s at our clients’ location or in a home office. We are well positioned to provide our customers with the very best videoconferencing solutions,” Dumouchel says.
It is fragrant and powerful germicidal. The oil of thyme is antispasmodic, carminative and antiseptic. It is used in gargles, mouth washes and in combination for whooping cough and bronchitis. It also possesses antifungal and anthelminthic properties.
When people buy condominiums in a prepared area, they are intended to pay a monthly or yearly cost to the home owners' organization administration.

Individuals should recognize insurance coverage and make sure that their structures are totally shielded from whatever nature could decide to throw their way. They have to leave it to the organizations to make certain every little thing is corrected.
Generally, a condominium proprietor's insurance coverage could have the complying with insurance coverage:
• Offering added living expenses to fire and also any other catastrophe targets according to the insurance coverage

A home remodel is a very costly venture. Homeowners are always looking for ways to add value to their home. Renovating is a great way to update an area of your home and add value to your biggest investment, your house. But not all home upgrades and renovations are worth spending your hard-earned money on. Here is some simple advice to make your home renovation worth the money and effort you put into it.
Repairs are the renovations that will yield the most value for your home. Fix the areas of your home that are in need of attention from a contractor or handyman. In an article by Realtor.com, you will be more likely to get the best value from handling repairs than any other renovation. Good repairs to consider are: fixing a leaking roof, replacing broken kitchen tile, stopping leaky faucet, and having an electrician rewire a faulty outlet. Even these small repairs can increase the value of your home.
Are you thinking of selling or are you planning on staying in your home a while? Getting a good return on your home improvement project might not pay. To find out if a home renovation increases your home value before you sell, contact a local realtor for advice. A local realtor will be able to evaluate your home with an eye for what sells. He or she can tell which renovation project will get your the best ROI. If you not planning on moving then the best renovation project is one you want to do the most.
Additions are the most costly of all home renovations. A good remodel is a much better bang for your buck. But if you need more space and love your home, an addition is the only way to solve that problem. Consider you local market when adding on. If the neighborhood is full of 3 bedroom homes then adding an addition with 2 bedrooms to make your home have 5 probably won't get a good return on that investment. You would be better off selling your home and buying a bigger home in the neighborhood with similar home sizes.
Going green is all the buzz right now, but it also just makes good financial sense. You can save money in the long run with energy efficient appliances, windows, doors and more. You can also get tax breaks on these energy efficient products too. Energy prices are only going to increase, do your best to keep your costs at a minimum.
According to an article from HGTV.com, kitchens and baths are the most expensive rooms to renovate. They are also the most frequently used, however, so the remodel will definitely be well appreciated. When renovating the kitchen or bathrooms you typically get a 100% ROI. Ask your local realtor before you make a big investment if you plan on selling once the renovation is done. Regardless of whether you sell or remain within your home, the upgrades you make in the kitchen and bathroom will be well worth the money and effort you put into them.
Home remodels and renovations can definitely pay off if you plan carefully. Ask a local realtor about what improvements in your home will help it sell. Repairs, along with upgrades in the bathroom and kitchen, far outweigh other renovations and add-on projects you would undertake. By planning ahead and understanding how your renovation project will affect your bottom line, as well as home value, you are protecting your investments and hard-earned money in the process.

JazzyBIT is a trio consisting of Teodor Pop (piano, keys), Mihai Moldoveanu (bass) and Szabó Csongor-Zsolt (drums). Active since 2012, JazzyBIT offers an energetic combination of jazz and rock, scattered here and there with blues, latin and funk. The group describes its style as being “loud jazz”. It sounds like Hiromi would play with Snarky Puppy, but in a trio. All About Jazz compares JazzyBIT with the Esbjörn Svensson Trio: “JazzyBIT channeled the successful Esbjörn Svensson Trio combo by bringing a bit of rock attitude to catchy tunes adorned with a melodic lilt. What also caught the ear was their combination of funky rhythms, tight musicianship and witty arrangements.”. The band released the debut album “Touch the Sky” in 2014, followed by the album “Horizon” in 2016.
After winning the 2013 Newcomer Award by the Muzza Foundation Bucharest, JazzyBIT got to be finalists in the European Jazz Award competition of the Tuscia in Jazz festival in 2014. Moreover, they won the Timișoara Jazz Award for the Group of the Year in 2016, and in 2017 all members of the group received the Banat Jazz Award for the Musicians of the Year, the latter two awarded on behalf of the Jazz Banat Cultural Foundation.
The band has a flourishing live activity, counting almost 200 concerts in its first 6 years of existence. Until now, JazzyBIT has played in 9 countries, on 2 continents, participating in some of the world’s biggest jazz festivals (Jarasum International Jazz Festival in South Korea, Vilnius Mama Jazz Festival in Lithuania or Belgrade Jazz Festival in Serbia). In addition, they have played in some of the most famous jazz clubs in Europe (Reduta Jazz Club in Prague, Sunset Sunside in Paris, or Budapest Jazz Club). Besides the jazz circuit, the band also played at some multi-genre festivals, such as the Sziget Festival in Hungary, the Exit Festival in Serbia or the Untold Festival in Romania, but also in some well-known clubs from the European circuit, like the A38 in Budapest or the Control in Bucharest.
Alongside the contemporary folklore group Subcarpați, JazzyBIT launches the Subcarpați x JazzyBIT / SUBJazz project, a merge of the music of the two groups, in 2017.
Teodor Pop fell in love with the piano at the early age of 4 and studied classical music until 14, when he joined the jazz classes of the Francisc Hubic Popular Art School from Oradea. In 2001, he was awarded a Certificate in Jazz, with a perfect final exam. One year later, he moved to Timișoara, where he continues to play jazz and blues in several projects. In 2004, he won the Best Pianist Award at the Iuliu Merca memorial competition in Cluj Napoca. Teodor is a Nord Keyboards artist.
Mihai Moldoveanu started playing bass in high school and is self-taught. With a background in rock music and having learned jazz by doing, Mihai is interested in many styles of music and art. Besides JazzyBIT, Mihai also plays with Amalia Gaiță and Sunset in the 12th House, while being the initiator of the improvised music event Paperjam. Mihai has a very diverse musical background, approaching almost every genre, from electronic music to black metal. For more information about Mihai, please visit mihaimoldoveanu.ro

Which AC machine are you using for heating and cooling? It should be an energy saver with SEER ratings of 13 or greater. Whether you are using a split air-conditioner or a packaged AC, it must be environment friendly otherwise you are going to pay dearly for using a low quality HVAC system.
When buying a new AC, what should you look for? The first thing to look for is the price of the machine. The product should be pocket friendly and also maintenance free. Being maintenance free doesn’t mean that it won’t require cleaning or change of parts. It means that the machine can work perfectly without requiring frequent maintenance.
When should you get a new air-conditioner? The average life cycle of an HVAC machine is 15 years but you shouldn’t wait for your AC to complete its life cycle. One should buy a new machine as soon as one’s present machine starts malfunctioning. If an HVAC machine requires frequent maintenance and change of parts then one should take it as an indication that the machine has started malfunctioning.
Should one keep using AC round the year? People need heating and cooling according to the weather conditions. Global warming has increased the length of summer and made winter short and uncomfortable. Today one can’t think of living without an HVAC machine. But fall and spring is the time when AC is not required. Ideally one should use AC only when necessary.
What is the ideal time for servicing air-conditioners? Fall and spring are the most favorable time for AC service. You don’t require Air Conditioning during these two months.
AC machine requires proper servicing at the hands of an experienced technician. If you are not taking care of your air conditioner then it may stop working abruptly for want of service and you many have to spend huge sum to get your AC repaired in short period.
To get proper heating and cooling, you need to maintain your AC. It is not a difficult task if you are following the user’s guidelines provided with the AC machine. If the machine is taking longer than usual time in reaching the temperature, you need then it is an indication that the machine requires servicing. If you are paying a heavy electricity bill then it is an indication that your heating and cooling system has become redundant and you need a new HVAC machine.
We are a trustworthy company who is not out to get the consumer who needs their air conditioning and or heating or both serviced or replaced. If a system can be repaired, we repair it, we do not pressure our customer into a new system.
The theme for this year’s International Women’s Day is #BeBoldForChange and it’s a chance for women to take action, tackling issues women face all over the world. Diabetes research has shown that, on average, women with Type 1 diabetes can have it harder than men, owing to a higher risk of death from complications such as heart disease.[1]
At Abbott we firmly believe that diabetes shouldn’t hold you back. In fact, we know from the diabetes blogging community that managing the condition is a chance to make friends and join an active online community of support. Our message for International Women’s Day is simple: don’t let the potential complications of diabetes hold you back from what you want to achieve in life.
For example, blogger Melanie Stephenson, has been living with Type 1 diabetes for 14 years. After being diagnosed with diabetes, she decided to take control of her life and take up athletics. She is now an international level athlete, and although she has had her ups and downs, Melanie has always pushed forward and achieved her goals.[2]
Lindsay, who had only ever run a 5K before, decided to challenge herself and sign up the Birmingham half marathon. Despite her struggles with diabetes, she finally got into a routine and with the help of the FreeStyle Libre system and pump therapy, she could take control of her diabetes and completed her first half marathon in the incredible time of 2hrs 15.[3]
Another inspiring story is Jane, who is an avid skier. Having diabetes can be tricky and combining it with an activity such as skiing can make it even tougher, but this has never put her off. Jane has been on 12 skiing holidays to date and doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon.[4]
It’s the attitude towards diabetes that makes a difference, and equally important is how it is managed. The FreeStyle Libre system helps empower people to manage their diabetes through data insight[5]. All you have to do is apply a FreeStyle Libre sensor to the back of your upper arm, scan the sensor with the FreeStyle Libre Reader and then get the reading; we call this Flash Glucose Monitoring.
These inspiring stories prove that you can push through any hurdles that may come your way. We would love to hear your stories about managing diabetes, especially what you’ve achieved since your diagnosis. To let us know, become a fan of our Facebook page and leave a comment.

In the past, in the city of St. Petersburg, the Egyptian Bridge rose with surprising glory. High porticoes, majestic columns, hieroglyphics, and a host of beautiful, ostentatious decorations gave the Egyptian bridge a splendid bearing.
Unfortunately, in 1905 the bridge sank, carrying all the ornamentation down and leaving it in oblivion, lying forever in the depths of the Fontanka River, an arm of the Neva River.
According to the legend, the Egyptian Bridge felt down because of the vibration produced by an Infantry regiment marching on it. It is unlikely that this urban myth is true, however, what is certain is that after its reconstruction the bridge lost its former beauty.
Of all the ornaments that the bridge had, only a few sad sphinxes have been restored, which have become the solitary guardians of this place. These sphinxes were not Egyptian, they were the result of the work of Pavel Sokolov, and they do not even maintain the Egyptian style but they were sculpted like Greek sphinxes.
Despite this, the Egyptian Bridge is still an important point of all the city tours, if you visit St. Petersburg, do not ignore it in any case.

KNUSTSpace: Composting millet glume for soil fertility improvement and millet/cowpea productivity in semi-arid zone of Niger
Title: Composting millet glume for soil fertility improvement and millet/cowpea productivity in semi-arid zone of Niger
Abstract: xi Figure 4.16 Added benefits from MGB-compost and N and P fertilizers application 123 xii ABSTRACT Declining soil fertility is among the most limiting factors for improving crop production in the Sahel. In Niger, organic resources are unavailable due to other competitive uses. However, millet glume (residues left after threshing of millet) is readily available in most villages of Niger and represents a potential source of reusable organic material. Nevertheless, the low decomposition rate of millet glume constraint its direct-use as an organic amendment. This study therefore focused on valorising millet glume for improving soil fertility and millet/cowpea productivity in semi-arid zone of Niger. The study consisted of five parts: (i) exploration of the indigenous knowledge related to farmer management of millet glume, (ii) decomposition and nutrient release pattern of millet glume-based compost (MGB-compost), (iii) changes in soil chemical and microbial biomass C, N, P induced by combined use of MGB-compost and mineral fertilizer, (iv) influence of combined application of MGB-compost and mineral fertilizer on millet/cowpea yields and (v) economic benefit of MGB-compost and mineral fertilizer application under millet/cowpea based cropping systems in Niger. To explore the indigenous knowledge relating to farmers‟ management of millet glume, structured questionnaires were administrated in Dan Saga village, District of Aguié. Litterbags and leaching tube incubation experiments were used under field and laboratory conditions, respectively to monitor the decomposition and nutrient release pattern of the MGB-compost. A two-year field experiment was also conducted during the 2013 and 2014 cropping seasons to evaluate the potential of combined application of MGB-compost and mineral fertilizer on soil chemical and microbiological properties, millet/cowpea yields and economic benefit. The xiii treatments used consisted of a factorial combination of three (3) rates of MGB-compost (C0, C150 and C300 g hill-1) and three (3) rates of mineral fertilizer (0 % RR, 50 % RR and 100 % RR kg ha-1; RR = recommended rate) and replicated four times. Composting millet glume in a 2:1 ratio (2 parts of millet glume: 1 part of goat manure) improved markedly millet glume N content by 43 % and P content by 138 %. Half - life of 4.65 weeks was recorded for MGB-compost relative to 12.38 weeks for millet glume. MGB-compost released 87 % and 90 % of its total N and P contents, respectively by the end of 10 weeks of decomposition. Soil microbial biomass P was on average 2.4 times higher on MGB-compost amended plots relative to sole N and P fertilizers treated plots. The increased microbial biomass P resulted in 223 % increase in available P on MGB-compost amended plots. Application of sole MGB-compost increased millet and cowpea grain yields by 187 kg ha-1 (21 %) and 163 kg ha-1 (20 %), respectively over the sole application of N and P fertilizers. However, the combined application of MGB-compost and N and P fertilizers increased millet and cowpea grain yields by 462 kg ha-1 (51 %) and 616 kg ha-1 (76 %), respectively over the sole application of N and P fertilizers. Combined use of MGB-compost with N and P fertilizers did not increase the Value Cost Ratio (VCR) for millet. However, the VCR for cowpea was 4.4 for MGB-compost treated plot. The study concluded that millet glume could serve as an alternative organic material for soil fertility management and for increased millet/cowpea production. It is therefore recommended that combined application of MGB-compost and N and P fertilizers could be used to reduce 50 percent mineral fertilizer investment currently made by smallholder farmers in Niger.
Description: A Thesis presented to the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science, 2015
On November 1, 2017, the Court entered judgment in plaintiff's favor on his appeal from defendant's denial of his application for Social Security benefits. (See 11/1/17 J., ECF 18.) Defendant has filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (“Rule”) 59(e) to amend the judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the Court denies the motion.
A Rule 59 motion “performs a valuable function where the Court has patently misunderstood a party, or has made a decision outside the adversarial issues presented to the Court by the parties, or has made an error not of reasoning but of apprehension.” Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese Sales, Inc., 906 F.2d 1185, 1191 (7th Cir. 1990) (citing Above the Belt, Inc. v. Mel Bohannon Roofing, Inc., 99 F.R.D. 99, 1010 (E.D. Va. 1983)). “Such problems rarely arise[, ] and . . . motion[s] to reconsider should be equally rare.” Id.
Defendant contends that this is one of the rare occasions on which reconsideration is appropriate because the Court reweighed the evidence rather than giving the ALJ's decision the deference it is due. (Mot. Alter Amend J. at 2, ECF 19); see Craft v. Astrue, 539 F.3d 668, 673 (7th Cir. 2008) (“We deferentially review the ALJ's factual determinations and affirm the ALJ if the decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.”); White v. Sullivan, 965 F.2d 133, 136 (7th Cir. 1992) (quoting Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971)) (stating that “substantial evidence” is “‘such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.'”). The Court disagrees.
The ALJ rejected treating physician Fayyaz's opinion as “inconsistent” with: (1) “intact mental status exams and all treatment notes”; (2) plaintiff's “demonstrated ability to work for a significant period of time”; and (3) his lack of difficulty with “interpersonal relationships.” (R. 34.) First, as the Court previously explained, Dr. Fayyaz's treatment notes are consistent with his opinions. (See 11/1/17 Mem. Op. & Order, ECF 17 at 4.) Moreover, the treatment notes of other physicians that the ALJ cited were from physical, not mental, examinations and thus were not “intact mental status exams, ” as the ALJ asserted. (See, e.g., R. 429-41, 445-47.) Second, as the Court previously noted, the record shows that plaintiff worked for a significant period of time before the onset date of his disability, a fact that sheds no light on his ability to work after the onset date. (See 11/1/17 Mem. Op. & Order, ECF 17 at 4.) Finally, as the Court noted, the only interpersonal relationships the record reveals plaintiff to have are with his wife and son, and the ALJ cited no evidence for her assertion that plaintiff has no difficulties with those relationships. In short, the ALJ rejected Dr. Fayyaz's opinions by: (1) ignoring the bulk of his treatment notes; (2) cherry-picking observations of plaintiff's mental state made by doctors who were addressing plaintiff's physical, not psychological, complaints; (3) relying on plaintiff's pre-onset work history; and (4) making an unsupported assertion about the quality of his relationships with his immediate family.
The Court respectfully disagrees with defendant's assertion that the Court reweighed the evidence considered by the ALJ. We believe that our review was deferential, as is required. Our concern is that the ALJ ignored medical evidence that did not support her conclusion, failed to demonstrate a connection between plaintiff's pre-onset employment history and his post-onset symptomology, and asserted facts about his personal relationships that had no apparent support in the record, none of which is permissible. See Moon v. Colvin, 763 F.3d 718, 721 (7th Cir. 2014) (“[T]he ALJ must identify the relevant evidence and build a ‘logical bridge' between that evidence and the ultimate determination.”) (citing Moore v. Colvin, 743 F.3d 1118, 1121 (7th Cir. 2014)); Denton v.

Operations : Affected at IV Army (General GOURAUD), the N 155 settled on july 14th at La Noblette base (Marne), where it is enroled in the "Groupe des Escadrille de Chasse d'Armée", led by Capitaine COURRET DE VILLENEUVE, already composed of escadrilles N 48 and N 94.
The N 155 stays at La Noblette for a short time; it moves on august 6th to Melette base (Marne), where it stays until end of january 1918.
On Champagne front line, his fighters operate, for the benefit of the Army, missions of enemy air force destruction, bombing protections, in the limit of the (yet quite short) range of Nieuport airplane, and reconnaissances deep in the enemy lines.
The first escadrille pilot killed by enemy is the caporal VILMART, shot down in dog fight on november 1st, 1917.
On this same november month, the flight exchanges his Nieuport 24 bis against Nieuport 27, faster and more manoeuvrable.
At the end of january 1918, the flight 155 which name is now SPA 155 since his transformation in late december 1917 on Spad X and XIII, is incorporated to the Fighting Group 18 created at the same time by the Capitaine SABATIER, on Plessis-Belleville base. The others flights of this squadron are SPA 48, 94 and 153.
The escadrille SPA 155 is engaged in the battles that enable our armies to stop the great german thrusts on the Somme and the Avre (march 21th-april 7th), on the Aisne and the Marne (may 27th-june 4th), on the Matz (june 9th-12th), on the Marne and in Champagne (july 15th-18th).
In the meantime of this missions, the flights ensure lots of reconnaissance missions, or protection of, or bombing missions of the differents rear enemy front lines.
The SPA 155 grows, his pilots gain more and more victories, but the enemy also takes heavy toll of it. The enemy makes huge effort to increase the number and the quality of his air force units, so that the encounters are more and more deadly.
In april, Lieutenant BECHON, Maréchal des Logis PAUMIER and Brigadier JOUBERT are killed in action. In may it is Caporal KIRIFOFF and Brigadier LAPICOTIERE turns, and on may 20th Lieutenant CASTAIGNET is missing in patrol.
Starting on july 10th 1918, the flight SPA 155 is involved with the Fighting Group 18 (led by Capitaine LAURENT and boosted by Lieutenant GEORGE, and then by Lieutenant LABITTE) in the victorious counter-offensive known as the second Marne victory (Xth Army of General MANGIN), and then with the IIIth Army (General HUMBERT) to the battle of Santerre (april 8th-30th) which lead to the fall of the Saint-Gobain forest.
It is engaged from 12th to 30th of september on the IIth Army front line (General HIRSHAUER), to the battle of Saint-Mihiel which gives to American Army the salient of the same name, deeply penetrated into French territory as a redoubtable wedge.
On september, the flight loses 2 of his pilots, the Brigadier BOULARD and the Sergent GRIMAUD, killed in mission, and on the 3th of october the Brigadier TALLET, is missing in patrol.
Finally it is also involved, in the area range of the IVth Army (General GOURAUD), into offensive operations of the last weeks of the war which lead the vanguards of this army to the Meuse, where november 11th, 1918 armistice stops them...
Settled on april 1st 1919 on the plateau of Malzéville, in Lorraine, the flight is transfered at the beginning of july on the base of Bron, near Lyon.
Here, it is dissolved late july, his members being posted to the 1st Compagnie of the 2nd Groupe d'Aviation.

Welcome to the I Am Roses Challenge Blog hosted by the I Am Roses Design Team! We hope you join us here every month for challenges, contests, prizes, inspiration and FUN!
Happy Tuesday everyone! It's Rosie here today featuring this adorable girl called Jillian Creates. I have loved art and crafting for as long as I can remember. It was my favorite subject in school. I always tell my hubby it's my therapy. I just LOVE to create! When life gets overwhelming, I think it's always nice to have a hobby to turn to for comfort and fun. Coloring and creating takes me to a different world much like reading a book does for book lovers. If you ever need to relieve some stress, pick up some markers, colored pencils or even crayons and color something. You will be amazed at the calming effect. <3
I used some paper from a paper pad called Echo Park Fashionista. The sentiment was hand-written. These are the gorgeous I Am Roses flowers used on my card:

In July 2018 I was back on familiar ground in Minnesota. My home town is set in a classic Midwestern setting. Sprawling farm fields with rows of potatoes, corns, and beans. Wheat and barley fields with sprawling prairie oaks from remnants of prairies that were. As my passion for photography has grown I have found new ways to appreciate and observe its beauty. As with most of the places I go, I had an itch to go into the night and see the familiar landscape in a new light (or lack of it). The clear, moonless skies and warm nights brought me into the darkness like a moth attracted to the light.
My dad and I drove north under ink dark skies. With the Milky Way core rising at midnight, I wanted to make sure that we were in place by 11:30. We had scouted an old, abandoned farmstead the day before and sought it out along the country roads. The night was calm and a heavy dew lay on the grass. Crickets chirped and my camera clicked. A peaceful start to a peaceful evening.
Moving on from the farm we continued north to our land. We opened the orange metal gate at its entrance and drove through. In the familiar, 50 acre pasture an old Paper Birch and Burr Oak stood juxtaposed against the short grasses below. We worked together to light paint the trees and surrounding pasture. As I made the images the night hit its dew point and fog rolled over the pasture and fogged my lens. This inconvenience ultimately dampened my shooting and we packed up my gear and headed home.
The images below are the result of my journeys into the night over a few days. They are a new way of looking at and remembering the countryside I grew up in. They fuse together elements of my home with elements in the sky and for me lock in memories of those nights out.
Some days are destined to be better than others and due to the probability of the seasons it has a 25% chance of being a day in autumn. There is something magical to the season wrapped into the death, color, and distinct smells it manifests each year. Fall mornings immerse all of your senses: the bite on your nose of frost in the morning, musk of decaying leaves, the sound or crunching leaves, and brilliant colors of foliage make the season like none other.
The magic and of the day started as soon as my eyes opened. I stepped from my bedroom to watch a subtle and beautiful sunrise over Neka Mountain and Port Frederick. As I sipped my coffee and watched from the window the warm colors of low sunlight started from the peak of Neka Mountain and progressed to its base. I smiled and thought through the possibilities of the day. The plan for the day was simple : go fishing and bring a camera.
I enjoyed the sunrise over Port Frederick in Hoonah, Alaska while I sipped on a cup of coffee. You can see the autumn colors of the muskegs near the summit of the mountain
Eight miles out of town Spasski River held the promise of fish and bears. I strolled through a muskeg full of color. 4-leaved, 4-inch tall, Bunchberry Dogwoods had transformed into red fireworks with colors nearing a poinsettia and lingering frost framed the sharp edges of sedges and grass. I crossed out of the muskeg and descended the banks of the river passing giant sentinels of Hemlocks and Spruces. Once in the river the circular ripples in the surface of the water over my fishing hole gave hint to the presence of Cohos below. Peering in I counted fourty 40 or more fish and noted some of them had turned the dark red of the season.
After 15 minutes of fruitlessly flinging my pink fly into the school of Cohos a pair of bears showed up on the river bank. I watched as the sow and cub came closer and stepped into the open so they could see me. The cub trailed closely behind the mother and after a couple of my woops acknowledging I was there they passed into the tall grass of the river bank.
A sow and cub meanered up the bank of Spasski River. This encounter gave me insight into the cub’s behavior when I observed it later.
When brown fur came into view again I had the privilege of gaining some insight into bear behavior. The cub emerged alone in the tall grass and it was evident it was very nervous. It stood on its rear feet to sniff the air and then sprinted forward in the long grass while looking back over its shoulder as though being chased by shadows. The young bear stood three more times to look and smell for its mother, but she was not to be found. Mother bears have a reputation of being helicopter parents to protect their cubs from aggressive males trying to kill them. It was evident the cub appreciated the protection of the mother and was nervous to be out of her shadow. When I left the cub and sow had not been reunited, but I was sure the sow had not left the cub as isolated as it thought.
You can almost see the worry on the cub’s face. It was looking back and forth in the search for Mom.
With the bears on my brain I decided it was best to stop fishing. I needed to be alert and was not keen on carrying Cohos out knowing the bears may interested in them too. I turned my attention to the scene in front of me. Yellow Salmon Berries reflected off the surface of the river. My eye was led down the scene to the flat top of ear mountain presided over the river. It was a special place to be and I was there to enjoy it alone.
The colors of Salmon Berries were accented by the presiding presence of Ear Mountain above Spasski River
I framed up the tall spruces along the bank to bring your eye into this shot of autumn colors and mountain
Leaving the bears I encountered the next fiercest mammal of the forests of Chichagof Island : the American Marten. I found it in the compromising position of scavenging trash, and snuck closer whenever it dropped into the green garbage can in front of me. I was about 30 feet away when it spotted me and the necessity for me to move closer was negated by the curious creature. Before long it approached me to within 10 feet and was perhaps trying to decide if I was edible. I stood stock still and it curiously twisted its head back and forth to size me up and stared my camera each time it clicked. The Marten, not totally trusting the large bi-pedal in front of it, dashed into the grass several times as though testing to see if I would pursue. Each time it poked its head up from the grass by standing on its rear feet. Finally bored or perhaps hungry it left the grinning human for good.
After popping out the grass several times the marten approached closely from my right side and looked directly at the camera as it snapped and clicked.
Throughout the day I had stopped several times to stare at and admire the incredible reds and oranges of the muskegs. Red leaves of Wild Blueberry plants transformed the floor the muskeg into fire. The read were accented by the evergreen trees sprouting from the muskeg and by the crystal clear blue skies. However, in one place the red colors were especially vibrant, rivalling the reds of the Maple trees that I grew up with in the Midwest. The beauty of that place held me there for a long time as I photographed it and felt privileged to be there.
From the fiery muskeg I descended to the quenching silence of the Suntaheen River valley. Along the river I found autumn to be in full progress. Red Alders sheltered the slow flowing river with amber leaves. The fallen leaves of those trees covered the rocky river bank like the yellow brick road. Beams of sunlight backlit trickled through the canopy and individually lit some of the fallen leaves. Groves of Devils Club along the river’s bank were turning a vibrant yellow and sunlight poked through their decaying leaves.
A frost-kissed Oak Fern was stripped of its green cholorphyll, and sunslight streamed through its white skeleton.
In the river I was reminded by of the salmon that had choked its waters only a month before. Scattered ribs, spines, and salmon jaws lay where the carcass had been eaten by a bear or had simply died. The bones were devoid of flesh and provided evidence the fish’s energy had already been absorbed by its sourrounding environment. Its nitrogen and energy mingled with the decaying leaves of the trees above cycling to ultimately feed to tiny fish emerging from the eggs buried in the gravel. Some days are just better than others. On this beautiful day I felt blessed to watch nature, learn something new, enjoy the transition of seasons, and observe the cycle of seasons.
A Pink Salmon’s jaw and its jutting teeth perches along the river. The river bank was littered with dozens of these jawbones from months-old dead salmon.

I just finished reading the NYT article on Food Politics Creates Rift…I practice integrative medicine in Chicago and spend the majority of my time doing nutritional counseling as it
work as it added the missing piece in my practice. I now prescribe a 0% GMO diet to 100% of my patients and have been thrilled with the results. I don’t need research on GMO’s at this point. I have all the proof I need from 30 years of clinical practice. I am writing to give you my support. Keep up the good work. Educating the public with the truth is a high calling.
Thanks! I will have to check out your blog. Ironically, I was just in Laguna for an art event and to check out Crystal Cove. It’s so lovely there.
Great Blog! My family and I started eating organic foods for about 5 years now and we cut out the processed foods. Although, we just can’t escape it 100% when we are away from home, I made my home free from soy, gmo foods and all types of corn based products including corn itself. I only use olive oil and coconut oil to cook with. We are in Toronto, Canada.
Thank you! That’s great that you have made the switch to more real, organic, non GMO foods. Congrats!

As a retired RN, in healthcare for 50 years, in diverse specialties, including psych., I would like to pay you my top compliment; knowlegable & sensible.
I recently purchased some house brand “organic” honey from a national super-market chain (forgetting my cardinal rule to read the back of the label with skeptical eyes).
When I unpacked it at home, it read “product of Brazil” and I suspect it may have been “trans-shipped” from China (which in addition to avoiding customs duties, according to the NYTimes, has been discovered to include “additives” no one would want to ingest).
I tried to verify the area in Brazil which the company rep. claimed she had visited but could find no apiaries.
I hope everybody reads the ridiculous New York Times article on Kraft & their payment to a national group to endorse an award of a “nutrition seal for kids” to one of their “cheese products”.
There are so many wonderful local & artisan real cheeses in the world, life isn’t long enough to introduce my kids to all of them !

How should you balance useful content with solicitations for sales or offers? One of the greatest risks of an auto-responder program is having users become frustrated with hard-sales attempts and subsequently marking your email as spam, opting-out, or simply not opening future emails. All of the aforementioned activities can lower your quality score with email service providers and make it harder for your email sends to get into the inbox. Therefore, it's very important that your auto-responders actually contain useful information. While it's acceptable to include a sales offer along with useful information in each email, it is not advisable for you to make a sales-only email any more frequently than every fifth email in the series in order to protect your email sender reputation. https://www.naijatechguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Email-Marketing-for-Beginners.png
The outbound method involves a proactive attempt to reach out to your audience. This usually begins with purchasing lead lists. You then contact these leads by calling them directly (cold calling) or sending them physical mails (direct mail). For a wider reach, businesses look beyond lead lists and use billboards, print ads, television ads, and radio ads. The emphasis here is on budget, media connections, and how much marketing muscle you can flex.

I explained my problem to someone online and she suggested that I should contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that don’t believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I meant a spell caster called Dr Zuma zuk and I email him, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4pm.

Lead generation firms supply your company with the hot leads you need to acquire new clients, while freeing up your time to spend on other tasks, like product development or quality assurance. Conversely, you could double down on new leads, drumming up business in tandem with leads provided by generation firms. Business expansion is directly correlated to finding new clients and making them happy, and the free time gained to reallocate time on these pursuits is what makes lead generation so powerful.
Remember that it’s equally important that you make sure your online and offline processes are aligned. You can have the best content marketing, webinar, social media, email, you-name-it marketing strategy in the world, or host some great in person events, but if the leads you generate as a result of these efforts aren’t handled effectively, and if you’re not connecting offline with online, you’re quite likely spending money on tactics that aren’t delivering any ROI.
Promotional emails are one of the most economical ways for any business to connect with customers. Research shows a message is five times more likely to be seen through email than on social media like Facebook or Twitter. That’s why musicians use email marketing software to share their performance schedule with their fans, non-profits use it to get donations and photographers use it to promote their portrait services. It just works.
The digital age has also made it easier for companies to research and understand their perspective leads. By understanding the wants and needs of their target customers, companies can tailor information to better draw them in, as well as qualify any potential leads based on a variety of factors, such as engagement and demographic information. It is increasingly important for companies to not only generate new leads but also develop and nurture relationships with them.
With the new buyer it is important to note that your marketing efforts don’t end once a new lead comes into your system – what we call Top of the Funnel (TOFU) marketing. Many companies do a good job at generating leads, but the problem is that most new leads are not ready to buy yet. And if a sales rep does engage and the lead isn’t ready to talk with them, it reinforces the notion that marketing sourced leads are not great. As a result leads get lost, ignored, or snatched up by your competitors.
Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century. Prior to this growth, when emails were novelties to the majority of customers, email marketing was not as effective. In 1978, Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) sent out the first mass email[1] to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products, and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails. However, as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication, users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs. In order to effectively communicate a message through email, marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user, without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software.
Office Autopilot plans all start at above $200 a month. These are the top 10 autoresponder and email marketing tools on the market today. You have options all the way from free to several hundred dollars a month, from basic functionality to complex analytics and shopping cart integration. The one you pick depends entirely on where your business is and what it needs.
Webinars - A webinar is a live video session which your visitors can view and participate in. Webinars typically last between half and hour to an hour and provide information and educational material about a specific topic. Because webinars are interactive and require a big investment in time, they can be a great way to not only create a lead but also to educate and convert them.
Use personalization. Personalizing the content of your emails (depending on your segment from Chapter 3) will make it infinitely more relevant and valuable to them. Personalization is so much more than inserting your subscriber’s first name into the email. You need to tailor the actual content of the email to address their needs. For instance, an online retailer will find it much more valuable to read an email with the subject line, “How to build backlinks to your eCommerce store” than just a generic subject line, “How to build backlinks.”
With Pay-per-Click (PPC ) ads you pay for each click on your ad which is displayed on a search engine such as Google, Yahoo, or Bing, or on a website. For PPC on search engines, your ads show up as sponsored results on the top and side of the organic search terms. PPC ads are a terrific way to draw attention to your latest content or service offerings. They are also highly targeted so they can generate very high quality leads. Advertisers bid on keyword phrases relevant to their target markets and your ads will display when a keyword query matches your chosen keyword list.
Several vendors offer computer programs designed to assist businesses in lead generation. Ethics are an important consideration in the choice and implementation of such programs. The use of spyware, Trojans or other intrusive means of gathering information without the knowledge or consent of targeted individuals or entities is frowned upon. Mass unsolicited e-mail advertising (or spam) is also considered unethical by many, and it can result in electronic blacklisting. https://s3.amazonaws.com/giveffect-assets/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/02133844/email-marketing-campaign.jpg
Content: While the download of a coupon shows an individual has a direct interest in your product or service, content (like an educational ebook or webinar) does not. Therefore, to truly understand the nature of the person's interest in your business, you'll probably need to collect more information to determine whether the person is interested in your product or service and whether they're a good fit.
As far back as the days of Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press or Henry Ford’s implementation of the assembly line, businesses have had to adapt to the introduction of new technologies; what’s happening today with the rapid advancement and acceptance of technology is nothing new. (Check out this infographic from GroSocial for a quick history lesson.)
The problem is that information abundance equals attention scarcity. This is known as attention economics. Social scientist Herbert Simon was the first person to discuss this concept when he wrote “in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.”
ROI is probably the most important metric in lead generation. The calculation is fairly simple: it’s the profit or loss you make from investing in a lead, compared against your initial investment. Let’s say you spent $15 capturing each lead, and a lead is worth $20 to you. Your profit from a lead ($5) against your initial investment ($15) gives you an ROI of 33%.
I got an email today from a marketer…. subject line “Don’t Worry, I won’t email you again” Huh? I was never worried in the first place and is I found it insulting to my intellect to assume that in my daily busy life I would actually take the time to worry about a lame marketer trying to get under my skin. I’m not going to open it because it simply sounds pathetic and self serving. Maybe it’s me but I just don’t like time wasters and nonsensical drival. https://i3.campaignmonitor.com/assets/images/guides/internationalization/birchbox.jpg
The first autoresponders were created within mail transfer agents that found they could not deliver an e-mail to a given address. These create bounce messages such as "your e-mail could not be delivered because..." type responses. Today's autoresponders need to be careful to not generate e-mail backscatter, which can result in the autoresponses being considered E-mail spam.
In addition to satisfying legal requirements, email service providers (ESPs) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns. The service providers supply email templates and general best practices, as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically. Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers. They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened, and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages.
Gone are the days that a marketer only relied on outbound techniques like trade shows, cold calling, and advertisements to get leads. Today’s buyer is in control. According to Forrester, buyers seek out three pieces of content about a vendor for every one piece sent by a marketer, and for every one piece sent by sales. Because of buyer self-education, your job as a marketer is to be heard through the noise and come up with new ways for leads to find you. To be a marketer in today’s world, you need a solid grasp of inbound in order to truly amplify your lead generation impact.
Use it to send new subscribers a “welcome” sequence. This is the message that you send to people right after they subscribe to your email list. It could contain a link to your lead magnet for an easy download, a thank you for subscribing, and maybe a call-to-action to check out your most popular blog posts. Every email list needs a welcome series: don’t miss this chance to “woo” your new subscribers and turn them into loyal fans! https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/465640-email-marketing.jpg?thumb
Direct Mail. “Just like each of the above all on their own could be a standalone marketing campaign to feed your business enough leads forever, this could as well. You can generate these letters and target all kinds of lists, so you can get very specific and never ever run out of potential campaigns. I use melissadata.com for my lists, but there are many companies that can and will sell you lists. I then use a done-for-you service. They create, print, stamp and send to us to drop in the mail. It cannot get any easier than that. These letters we use are in hand written font and made to look like you wrote it out on a yellow pad of paper. They're mailed in invitation- type envelopes so they get opened and not tossed in the waste basket.”
It’s long been known that headlines attract more attention than body copy on a written page. Decades ago, the father of modern advertising, David Ogilvy, found that 8 out of 10 people will read a headline, while only 2 will read the body copy. Make sure the big, bold words at the top of your page give prospects a reason to read the rest of it by communicating the benefit of claiming your offer. If you can’t explain what’s in it for your audience immediately, they won’t continue on.
Email marketing is a simple and proven strategy to promote your business. It attracts new customers and helps maintain close relationships with loyal customers. There's a long list of email marketing services available today and most operate at relatively low prices, with packages to fit every business size and need. It's just a matter of determining which features and tools you need and how much you're willing to spend.
What should be the time frame between sends? At the beginning, you want to ensure that you do not take too long between sends. Your subscribers have just signed up and are enthusiastic about receiving your communication, so take advantage of that enthusiasm.While once daily is too frequent, you can begin by spacing your emails out with only a day in between. After that, extend the time between to three days. As you get to the tail end of your auto responder, meaning that you are getting to the least engaged customers who have not converted and may mark you as spam or opt-out of the email, begin to stretch things out by five days or even a week. Many email marketing service providers will allow you to also mark days of the week that you don't want your auto responder to send, so you may want to eliminate weekend email sends of auto responders. Email open rates are lower on weekends.
Write great subject lines. David Ogilvy once said that 80 cents of your dollar should be spent on writing headlines. With emails, the subject line is just as important. If it doesn’t catch your attention, you won’t open it. So, spend the majority of your time writing and polishing your subject line. A great email subject line entices curiosity about the content of the email. It’s also personal, and highly relevant to the recipient. To learn more about how to write amazing subject lines, we have an entire blog post on the topic: 30 Successful Bloggers Share Their Best Converting Email Subject Line.

One of the many black families settling in New York at the turn of the 20th century was the Waller family. In their quest to guarantee a better future for their children, they left their native Virginia for the big city.
They had eleven children between the years of 1890 to 1920, of whom only five survived. Thomas Wright Waller was born on May 21, 1904. He was a turbulent and restless boy. He loved music from a very early age on. His parents took him to church where he had the opportunity to listen to religious hymns and to the organ of which he remained particularly attached for the rest of his life. His father, Edward Martin Waller, was pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.
Around the age of six, he occasionally climbed up the stairs to his neighbour’s apartment so that he could play their piano. He was fascinated by the instrument and openly expressed his desire to become a pianist. Very shortly after, a piano appeared in the Waller apartment. Encouraged by his mother, Thomas took several lessons from a certain Miss Perry. He often played “by ear” because he found the music boring. He also practiced on the church organ and He soon joined the school orchestra where he claimed his first success; making his classmates laugh. His father, wanting him to become a Pastor like himself, took him to see the pianist Paderewski, in concert, but "Fats", as his friends called him because of his stoutness, preferred the ragtime of Tom Turpin and Scott Joplin or the "stride piano" being heard in jazz clubs.
Subsequently, Fats became acquainted with a Miss Maizie Mullins, the organist at Harlem's Lincoln Theater, and dreamt of replacing her. She trained him and by 1919, Fats became the regular organist there, accompanying silent films to the delight of the audience. Two years later, he also became organist of Harlem's premiere Lafayette Theater for $50 a week.
At seventeen, he married Edith Hatchett and had a son, Thomas Jr. In 1920, his beloved motherdied and soon after that, he left the family after an argument with his father. He was taken in by pianist Russel Brook's family. Brooks had a player piano and numerous rolls by Luckey Roberts and James P. Johnson. Fats was in a hurry to learn these hits by heart, so he would place his fingers on the keys while the piano played automatically. Fats divorced Edith in 1923 and was plagued by her persistent alimony claims for the rest of his life. In 1926 married Anita Rutherford. They had two sons Maurice and Ronald.
It was during this period that Fats slowly built his life's dream. He met the piano celebrities Willie Smith and James P. Johnson who both gave him solid training in the art of stride. He practiced piano more and more and hung around the clubs in Harlem at night. He never missed an opportunity to slide under the keyboard when the musicians took a break. His dynamic and humorous character propelled him into the musical meetings and rent-parties taking place in Harlem.
Fats probably made his first recording in 1922, thanks to the intervention of Clarence Williams who also encouraged him to compose. He first recorded Muscle Shoals Blues, followed by Birmingham Blues, which he spontaneously wrote while in the studio. He was very much at ease with recording, and his astonishing tune-writing qualities were revealed in the first session. Their first song published was Wild Cat Blues. IIn that year, he accompanied beginning blues singer Sarah Martin, and continued to make recordings.
In 1923, he collaborated with J. Lawrence Cook to create player-piano rolls for the QRS company (Quality Reigns Supreme) of Buffalo, NY. Piano rolls were quite popular at that time. The manufacturing process consisted of transcribing an imprint of each note onto a master roll. After corrections and additions, a technician would then perforate the imprints. The rolls were then mass produced.
In 1927, Fats Waller met the talented poet and lyricist Andy Razaf. They co-authored a number of successes together. The tiniest melody inspired words for a song. The tandem regularly submitted their compositions to music publishers. Relationships with the publishers were stormy. As a general rule, they would try to buy the rights to the song for next to nothing, or they would "forget" to pay the royalties. In reaction to these practices, Waller and Razaf would either leave the office in an outrage and rip up their creation, or accept the pathetic sum offered by the publisher and afterwards submit the same song to a second, and then a third publisher. Selling their compositions in this manner allowed them to have a decent income. Fats was frequently victim of his own happy-go-lucky attitude, and his total lack of organization in his business dealings. Occasionally, he sold his compositions for next to nothing ; compositions which were to become huge hits only shortly thereafter. This was the case for the songs, On the Sunny Side of the Street, I Can Give You Anything but Love, and If I Had You which, according to musicians and close relation were most likely his compositions.
After a first unsuccessful marriage and the birth of his first son, Thomas Junior, Fats remarried a woman by the name of Anita Rutherford. They had two sons, Maurice and Ronald. In 1926, he began recording for the Victor company. Abandoning rent-parties little by little, he began to compose music for Broadway musicals. Keep Shufflin’, followed by Load of Coal in 1928 were both hits and his fame spread far beyond Harlem. The Waller-Razaf duo also composed the music for Hot Chocolates in 1929, and wrote the most wonderful Wallerian standards, Honeysuckle Rose, Ain’t Misbehavin, and What did I do to be so black and blue. Unfortunately, Waller sold the entire catalogue of songs from "hot chocolates" to Mills Music for a mere $500. Fats bitterly regretted this later
Fats went to Paris in 1931 and played in several clubs. He then returned to New York and was discovered in 1934 by RCA Victor recording executives at a party given by Georges Gershwin. He began an intensive series of recording sessions with RCA Victor and began hosting a weekly radio show, performing in public and becoming an immensely successful and popular performer and recording artist.
Fats made his first recording on May 16, 1934 with a small group called "FATS WALLER and his Rhythm". He rarely performed without this group. They played together without respite for 9 years, recording more than 400 songs, playing for radio shows, and appearing in movies. Fats directed the orchestra with his eternal good humour. His presence and energy empowered each performance. He knew how to encourage each musician to give the best of himself, all of this, with either a single word, a joke or a chorus on the piano. All remained spontaneous with arrangements and rehearsals being reduced to a strict minimum, as usual.
Fats WALLER became a big star, drove around in a Lincoln, and wore tailor-made suits. Each of his performances triggered off applause and laughter because of his hilarious antics. You should have seen this big man dancing around, and then shaking his bottom at the audience before beginning his song once again with changed lyrics. He emptied the bottle of gin beside his piano every night. Fats was happy…well, almost. He still dreamed of playing in prestigious concert halls for the same public that rushed to hear George Gershwin, or any other classical concert. He suffered from not being recognized for his qualities as a pianist, and sometimes grew tired of his “jokester” image. He consoled himself by drowning himself in activities, washing them down with gin or Old Grand Dad, his favourite bourbon.
Fats returned to Europe in 1939, and then continued his tours and recordings. Still haunted by his image of being a concert pianist religiously listened to, he performed at Carnegie Hall in New York … in tails. It would not be his fondest memory
In 1943, Hollywood produced the film Stormy Weather in which he appeared along with Lena Horne and Bojangles Robinson. The last Broadway show he composed for was Early to Bed. Once again, it was a hit.A train returning to Los Angeles carried one exhausted Fats WALLER.
His last engagement at the Zanzibar Club had to be interrupted because of a bad case of influenza. On the night of December 15, 1943, the train was immobilized in the Kansas City train station because of a blizzard and icy winds. Fats sat shivering and unconscious in his compartment. He was declared dead in the wee hours of the morning by his manager, Ed Kirkeby, and a doctor who had been called in emergency.

Lynd Ward used to joke that he was destined to be an artist because his last name spelled “draw” backwards–a curious statement from a man whose contributions to the visual arts deliberately repudiated words. Now recognized as one of the founders of the American graphic novel, Ward used to be better known as a fixture of progressive cultural politics in Depression-era New York City. In this, the centenary of his birth, Ward’s fans are celebrating both his visual innovations and the passion for social justice that suffused his silent novels.
Ward inherited his political worldview from his father, the radical minister Harry F. Ward, who worked in Chicago’s settlement house movement at the turn of the century and helped found the ACLU in 1920. He also wrote and preached about the virtues of the U.S.S.R. as the embodiment of Christ’s teachings on Earth, long after the Soviet experiment’s vices had become apparent. Ward, though, was no red-diaper baby. The family home was littered with Methodist sermons, not social manifestoes, and it was ascetic Protestantism rather than Marxist discipline that forbade Ward to do anything but sketch during Sunday afternoons.
If Ward’s political outlook was Midwestern radicalism, European expressionism was his artistic vision. Like so many art students of his time, he dutifully set off for a year in Europe, fortunately spending 1927 not in the cafes of Paris, but in Leipzig, which swirled with a long tradition of German printmaking and the recent blossoming of Weimar cultural politics. Ward, who possessed only a few words of phrasebook German, may have been particularly attuned to the possibilities of visual communication in the work of radical printmakers such as Käthe Kollwitz and the Belgian artist Frans Masereel, who crafted the first wordless novels.
Returning to the United States, Ward published Gods’ Man (1929), the first woodcut novel in the United States. The book’s subject matter–an allegorical fable about an artist who sells his soul for worldly success–was timeless. But its artistic innovations were unprecedented; its visual structure and pacing owed as much to silent film and mass-circulation comic pages as they did to artistic predecessors like Kollwitz or Honoré Daumier. Wordless novels were political interventions, too, meant to take advantage of what Ward called the “great asset of the book’s thousandfold duplication of contact with people.” Ward wanted to get art out of stuffy museums and snooty galleries and into the hands of an international community of readers who shared the language of images.
Gods’ Man appeared in bookstores the week of the 1929 stock market crash. As the Depression settled in New York City, Ward’s vision grew increasingly more engaged; his work tackled unemployment, poverty and exploitation. In Madman’s Drum (1930), Wild Pilgrimage (1932) and Vertigo (1937), his political vision grew more forthright. Even while cushioned from financial crisis by his family, Ward labored to organize artists politically. He founded the Equinox Cooperative Press, an illustrators’ collaborative dedicated to noncommercial work, and the American Artists Union. In addition to convening artists’ congresses, Ward later helped shepherd the group into the CIO.
As the New York art world swirled with political controversy in the ’30s, Ward steered a middle course between the rigidity of Communism and the apathy of art for art’s sake. “t was impossible,” he recalled, “for anyone, artist or not, to remain ignorant of the fact that the world was in trouble.” A quintessential fellow traveler, he joined one organization after another, signing every social justice petition that came along, devoted more to the urgency of an issue than the orthodoxy of an ideology. But, he lamented, “every dose of medicine seemed only to aggravate the situation.” His moderation showed too in his work. Ward–ever the wood engraver–patiently carved out his vision while fellow artists like William Gropper pounded tables with fists, demanding that art serve the revolution. In an age of agitprop and socialist realism, he never turned his vision into a cartoon.
The Cold War, though, would cast a dismal shadow over the art world. The romance surrounding ’50s Abstract Expressionism still obscures how ruthlessly the politically engaged artists of the Depression era were silenced–an effort the art world participated in with the vigor of a Congressional committee. Many artists found it nearly impossible to earn commissions or secure gallery spaces. Senator Joseph McCarthy summoned some artists, among them Ward’s old ally William Gropper, to Washington.
As pages piled up in his FBI file, Ward turned away from explicitly political art. But a closer look suggests that Ward had not abandoned his commitment to social justice. In the popular children’s novel Johnny Tremain (1943), Ward, in collaboration with the book’s author Esther Forbes, told he story of the American Revolution as a populist narrative at the height of the Cold War. Readers may be tempted to read just a bit much into the redness of The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge, one of Ward’s most beloved works. For once, they might be right.
Recent years have restored Ward’s reputation, turning him into a patron saint of illustrators and graphic novelists. Ward’s admirers include Will Eisner, who has credited Ward for establishing a “historical precedent for modern graphic storytelling,” and Eric Drooker, whose 1992 work Flood!, helped usher graphic novels into the mainstream of American literature. But Lynd Ward’s work was never really lost: A young Allen Ginsberg pulled Gods’ Man from his family’s bookshelf, and in 1955 transformed the book’s images into his epic Howl. Even when Ward himself was silenced, his images continued to speak a thousand words.
Aside from the danger and costs — which currently make large-scale hydrate 70-441 exploitation impractical — is the issue of greenhouse gases. Methane is more than 20 times more potent than CO2, and undersea and tundra drilling are already releasing vast quantities of the greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, where it supplements the rise in methane caused by global warming. It is not known whether the Obama administration’s policies on new 70-442 drilling will include this unproven technology. Nor do we know how much oil has spewed from BP’s gulf well or from numerous past disasters. One surprising revelation is that oil gushing from the failed blowout preventer has apparently coalesced into giant underwater plumes that hold far more of the leaked oil than surface 70-443 slicks would predict. (BP CEO Tony Hayward denies that these plumes exist; Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of a House Energy and Commerce Committee environmental panel, dubbed BP “Blind to Plumes,” and asked 70-444 Hayward for evidence. )
Over the next few years the company bought out other magnet producers, including test king Idaho-based GA Powders whose product was developed by federal government researchers and UGIMAG’s Valparaiso plant. The testking 70-433 company invested in its U.S. facilities but also began building factories overseas. Magnequench’s operations initially were quite profitable, but the market slumped in 2000, and the company testking 642-971 announced it would close the Anderson plant. The company rebuffed employee efforts to buy the plant, and the union decided to negotiate a severance payment rather than risk a strike and lawsuit testking JN0-400 over violation of the agreement not to shut down. Early last year Magnequench told its Valparaiso workers that the testking 642-583 plant would close.

A HekaFramingSplitter is used to split streams of data that use Heka’s built- in Stream Framing, with a protocol buffers encoded message header supporting HMAC key authentication.
A default configuration of the HekaFramingSplitter is automatically registered as an available splitter plugin as “HekaFramingSplitter”, so it is only necessary to add an additional TOML section if you want to use an instance of the splitter with settings other than the default.
Optional TOML subsection. Section name consists of a signer name, underscore, and numeric version of the key.
Usually if a HekaFramingSplitter identifies an incorrectly signed message, that message will be silently dropped. In some cases, however, such as when loading a stream of protobuf encoded Heka messages from a file system file, it may be desirable to skip authentication altogether. Setting this to true will do so. Defaults to false.

McDonald’s Corp announced it would introduce a new lineup of low-cost foods in early January nationwide as restaurants strive to win U.S. customers who have come to expect deals on fast food. The new menu is called the $1-$2-$3 Dollar Menu, which consists of a wider variety of items covering the three different price points.
The world’s biggest hamburger chain is in a price war with competitors ranging from Yum Brands Inc.’s Taco Bell to Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc.
The new dollar menus, which is slated to launch on January 4, comprise any size soft drinks and cheeseburgers for $1, small McCafe drinks and bacon McDoubles for $2, and Happy Meals and triple cheeseburgers for $3, the company said.
They will be added to McDonald’s current value offers such as McPick 2 where customers can choose two items from a list for $5, including Big Macs, fish filets, and 10-piece chicken nuggets.
“You always have to have value as part of the equation,” Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald’s U.S.A., said in a statement.
In October, the company’s executives said almost all of its U.S. operators give their support to its current change plan which includes the new value menus.
The fast-food chain’s latest U.S. revival has been bolstered widely by its value offers, said Bob Goldin, partner and co-founder of food industry strategy firm Pentallect Inc.
“They are really killing it with dollar beverages and the McPick 2,” Goldin said, adding that value remains an important factor of traffic to fast-food restaurants, even as the economy grows and diners have more disposable wages.
Meanwhile, Taco Bell regularly interchanges the around 20 items on its $1 value meal. Subway, which became a hit to customers a few years ago with its $5 foot-long” special, is now providing different six-inch sandwiches for $2.99 each.
Moreover, Dunkin’ Donuts also is preparing more value offers after franchisees take a liking to the idea of using deals in their battle to win breakfast.
Goldin said the strategy is not without risks. He said that increasing food and labor costs congest franchisees who endure the burden of rising costs.
“They are really stuck in a value trap,” Goldin said. “There is going to be tremendous pressure to raise prices.”

Teachers and support staff in nearby school districts are agreeing to unpaid furlough days as California’s public schools struggle to make ends meet.
In the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District, teachers agreed to take off four unpaid furlough days to save about $6 million. About 96 percent of teachers in the Orange County district voted to approve the furloughs as part of their contract, which the school board OK’d last month, according to The Orange County Register.
The Orange Unified School District meanwhile approved five unpaid days off for classified school employees, or support staff, The Register also reported.

Gracie, profoundly developmentally delayed with spastic quadriplegia, cerebral palsy and a seizure disorder, was nineteen years old when Lifecare Innovations was first contacted to provide for a five year plan detailing her care and expenses. Gracie had outgrown her initial life care plan, completed by another third party source, given its general language and application.
Since the initial plan had been developed, many major life changes had occurred in Gracie’s life. Her parents had gotten legally separated and were also separated from one another by distance as they lived in separate homes, dividing up care and responsibilities for Gracie and doing so with less than desirable communications. Gracie’s condition had progressed with a seizure disorder and scoliosis being added to her diagnostic list requiring advanced treatment. The landscape of disability had changed.
The 21st century economy forced once available and much needed programming to limit or deny resources. Conversely, new developments in technology and treatment in the 21st century have provided greater advantages, along with greater costs. Finally, Gracie is approaching the end of her school aged programming in the public school sector which calls for further and more specific refining of both public and private resources.
Used in the probate court, the five year plan created by Lifecare Innovations benefitted parties in three key ways: 1) outlining, for Gracie’s parents who are legally separated, the most likely care needs and expenses of their daughter and doing so in manageable chunks of five years; 2) assisting the Guardian of Estate to make the most of trust monies by investing them in ways that maximize Gracie’s investments while also allowing for their ease of liquidity when needed; 3) informing the probate court of the status of the ward, her needs and recommended care and care expenditures in order that they be able to provide for legal oversight of the guardian and ward alike. One year later, the probate court continues to use the plan as a guide to map Gracie’s care and expectations of her Guardian of Person and Estate.
I just wanted to take this opportunity to express my admiration for you and the obviously sincere efforts you make on behalf of many people who are in need of assistance. I am going to keep your business card in a handy place for future reference!
I have found the services of LCI to be invaluable in dealing with the personal care issues of elderly clients. Not only is appropriate care professionally secured but the follow up monitoring is provided. Since a law office is not equipped to deal with such issues, their services are of enormous help not only to the Attorney, but more importantly, to the client.
It was a pleasure to meet and work with you. Your help in setting me up with Medicare and AARP was invaluable.
Thanks so much for all you did for my Aunt. I know she cared about all of you also, thanks for the help and support you gave to me.
I just wanted to take a moment to thank all of you for your kindness during the time you were looking after my mother. You have gone far beyond the basic requirements of you jobs, and it has been much appreciated!

In a bid to provide up-to-date, accurate and transparent information to all real estate investors as well as facilitate the state management of houses and real estate sector, the Government recently issued Decree No. 117/2015/ND-CP prescribing the development, management and use of a housing and real estate market information system.
The housing and real estate market information system will be built uniformly nationwide__Photo: Hoang Hai/VNA
Accordingly, the system will be built uniformly nationwide and include a database on housing projects and real estate market, information technology infrastructure, and a software system to serve the housing management and operation.
The information system’s operation must comply with the criteria and regulations on application of information technology in state agencies to ensure convenience for users.
The new regulation also refers to violations in the building, management and use of the system, including providing inaccurate, inadequate and untimely information on housing and real estate market; providing falsified information or leaking housing and real estate market information and data; and illegally appropriating or distorting such information and data; using housing and real estate market information in contravention of regulations, etc.
Violators will, depending on the nature, seriousness and consequences of their violations, be subject to disciplines, administrative handling or criminal punishment.
San Antonio approved fluoridation of its water in 2000, making it one of the last major Texas cities to do so.
Fluoridation of drinking water is one of those perennial issues for city governments, and since the practice usually involves approving a contract to a company for providing the additive, it is a municipal debate that can’t quite be put to rest.
Most recently, the controversy flared up in Dallas in January. A year was spent dithering. Newspaper columns were written. Activists appeared. Dentists rallied. In the end, the Dallas City Council wisely approved its $1 million contract, putting the issue there to bed for another three years. College Station opted in 2011 to stop adding fluoride to its water supply (the city does still have naturally occurring fluoride in its water, albeit at lower levels than recommended to prevent tooth decay.) Closer to home, San Marcos plans to revisit this issue after deciding in July to revisit the issue in eight months after allowing its city council to study fluoride’s safety.
As the Texas Oral Health Coalition points out in this Viewpoints submission, Texas was on the cutting edge when fluoride was first introduced in the 1940s. Today most U.S. cities add fluoride to their water, despite a fairly active anti-fluoride movement.
Texas has long been a proud engine of health and medical progress. Dr. Michael DeBakey was a Houston physician who pioneered heart bypass surgery. In 1968, Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper introduced the world to the importance of aerobic exercise, and he later opened a Dallas research center to promote wellness. Yet the Lone Star State’s medical and scientific reputation is under assault.
Like childhood vaccinations, water fluoridation is a health practice with strong scientific evidence behind it. Yet several Texas cities have felt pressure to end fluoridation from people who misunderstand or overlook this evidence.
Fluoride is a mineral that exists naturally in water supplies but at a concentration too low to help prevent tooth decay. Some of the earliest studies of adding fluoride to water were conducted in Texas. In 1945, Marshall, Texas, became one of the first three cities in the United States to fluoridate their public water supplies.
Today, many Texas communities fortify their water with additional fluoride. By doing so, they help reduce tooth decay using a strategy that has been praised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as one of 10 “great public health achievements of the 20th century.” Unfortunately, over the past few years, a small yet vocal group of activists in several Texas cities have attacked water fluoridation and urged officials to stop this health practice.
Some people mistakenly believe that using fluoride toothpaste or fluoride mouth rinses means that drinking fluoridated water is no longer necessary. Yet the CDC reports that even with other available sources of fluoride, water fluoridation reduces tooth decay by about 25 percent over a lifetime.
Both children and adults benefit. Fluoridation helps prevent the kind of dental problems that can undermine children’s ability to eat, sleep and learn. Studies show that students with recent dental pain are nearly three times more likely to miss school and are four times more likely to earn below-average grades. Having unhealthy or missing teeth can also disrupt adults’ lives and self-confidence, and place them at a disadvantage when seeking service-sector jobs.
Fluoridation also saves money by reducing the need for dental treatments. Families benefit because the average, per-person cost of a lifetime of fluoridation is less than the cost of filling a single cavity. Taxpayers benefit too, because it curbs state Medicaid costs. A Texas study showed that communities with fluoridated water, save the Medicaid program $24 per child, per year.
Last month, after roughly a year of hearing and reviewing the opponents’ arguments, the Dallas City Council voted by a decisive margin to continue fluoridation. However, opponents are attacking fluoridation in Austin and San Marcos.
Are critics credible? No. PolitiFact, an independent fact-checking service, has investigated three common arguments made by anti-fluoride activists, and each one was determined to be false or deceptive. Many websites with anti-fluoride messages have ads or a “store” trying to sell water filters, books or herbal supplements.
Texans have been leaders in health and medicine because we have respected science, instead of ignoring it. Fluoridation has saved our state money and helped ensure that more Texans have healthy teeth. Preserving this proven strategy is the best way to honor our state’s proud legacy.

It bothered her how he would often boast about his “big dick” around his friends and even around her friends. He even told her friend Jenny that Marta would never leave him because she loves his big dick too much.
Marta told me more than once that she wished she could somehow give Tony my penis and my humility. She enjoyed sex with him and was happy with how frequently they went at it.
They had sex at least once every day but Marta was having trouble reaching orgasm from intercourse with Tony. Rukam little chat video.

Jessie is a good looking boy, and one of the few boys in the area to be able to afford a truck, and it was new. He had a reputation for being kind of wild, along with his best friends from high school, Cody, and Donny, and would’ve probably been sent to jail several times for driving drunk and other offenses, if it wasn’t for Woody’s connections with the police and sheriff.
My parents knew about his reputation, and whenever I mentioned his name, they warned me to stay away from him. He was always flirting with me and asking me out, and I was able to resist him, at least for a while. Desi sex chat video live.

I've had multiple bad experiences with clickbank. Shortly after my affiliate account started to really pick up steam in 2016, I hit login issues and assumed their site was having problems. However the next time I was unable to login, I finally contacted customer support. They told me my account had been flagged for removal. Upon review, they found their automated system had failed and my account was a victim.
It will probably take a couple years to build a sustainable, passive income. That is the 1st car I have EVER purchased myself at age 29 (I was broke until then and leased from my parents). But the time committed to affiliate marketing and creating great tutorials and YouTube videos was worth it… I work for myself, there is virtually no limit on how much I can make, my schedule is flexible, and I collect enough passive income to live how I want.
Because of this drop in income, I have been forced to try out other methods and systems. recently I wrote a blog post promoting a clickbank product, then sent out a link to the blog post via email. Just cold - sent it out telling people to have a look at the post. I made over a hundred dollars from one email, in a single day. I have since been convinced that email really is the way forward. Imagine if I had spent the last year focused on collecting emails rather than getting adsense clicks!!!!
Another survey from VigLink offers a closer look at just how much income affiliate marketers are bringing in. According to the survey, 9% generated more than $50,000 in affiliate income in 2016. The majority, 65%, said they were making between 5% and 20% of their annual revenue from affiliate programs. The survey also showed a link between time frame and revenues. Among the publishers with the largest revenues, 60% had been utilizing affiliate-marketing strategies for five years or more.
If you’ve got a way with words and expertise in a niche, there are plenty of sites that will pay for articles and content you write. Think of the sites you read regularly. What can you contribute to them that would be interesting? Research your niche and then look for ways to pitch articles. Many sites will simply have a submission or contact link in the footer. To get started, check out my full guide to becoming a freelance writer on the side and then submit your articles to places like Listverse, TopTenz, A List Apart, International Living, FundsforWriters, and Textbroker.
To make money from affiliate marketing, you need to ascertain that the product has a high demand. No matter how much efforts you make, you might make little or no sales, it totally depends on the demand of the product. You need to know if it is what your audience really needs. If you manage to get a reasonable amount of traffic on your site, then you can run a small online survey to get input from visitors.

- The information available it is easy to find free? The second important point that needs to think. I think for example of recipes. Imagine an ebook containing 100 pizza recipes. Now look at the number of pizza recipes that you can have for free by searching on google for "pizza recipes." It is obvious that you will lose some customers on a product like this.
(Mailing) Lists are run like campaigns, spaced a few days apart. The income can be 'decent' provided the offering and the campaign was well thought of. However, I might add, it takes (months, if not years) to have such a list of so many people who opt-in, and the key point to note in lists is that they cater to a very specific vertical/niche. You can only market within that niche. Building such a huge list of subscribers takes a lot of money, so if the Question is can you make it - via lists, I would say, the jury is still out. I am 'convinced' it can be made, however, I have yet to see proof for the same. I don't know what the big deal is why people cannot share proof.
Once you have signed up, the first thing I suggest you should do is buy one credit pack although it’s not compulsory to make this work. What are credit packs? These are advertising credits that allow you to buy advertising space on their website plus it will allow you to earn from clicking on 10 ads a day. So the more credit packs you have the more you will earn daily from your clicking efforts.
Alibaba is a Chinese eCommerce store that matches Chinese suppliers with buyers all over the world. Prices are extremely cheap, providing the possibility of large profits. However, with the potential profits comes more risk. As you are dealing with suppliers in China, if the quality of the product that arrives isn’t up to standard there is little that you can do about it.
If you are a budding photographer and would like to be paid for your craft then you should consider setting up your own photography website. This is a great way to not only promote your services as a photographer, but also to sell your images. You can charge visitors a fee to download your images. Or, if you’d rather, turn your site into a paid membership site, with free downloads of all images for paying subscribers.
A month later, I logged in to see that Clickbank had been charging me a $1 dormant account fee "per pay period" - which, lucky for them, happens to be every single week. When I tried to contact customer support and pressed "2" for affiliate accounts (in the middle of the day, in the middle of the work week), I got "Affiliate Support is not currently available." AKA - "please spend 30 minutes gathering data to write us an email instead of five minutes talking to a live person."
First off, I’m a blogger so it seems wrong not to mention it, but more importantly, it’s a legitimate way to make money. It’s quite possibly the least straight-forward way on this list, but it’s very doable and it’s also quite possibly the funnest way on this list. I love blogging and I know hundreds of bloggers who feel the same. So let’s talk about making money blogging and what it really means.

- analysis of the existing University Management systems and special needs of the university information management.
- organization of the Conference dedicated to discussion and approval of the concept of university information management .
Hello everyone. Yesterday, where patients watched the movie Independence Day: Resurgence, they got a surprise visit from Joey and Travis Tope.
These kids are so incredible and I feel so incredibly luck to have been blessed to be in the same company as them today @travistope and I made some amazing friends at the children's hospital screening @independencedaymovie for the kids with @lollipoptheater.

Sixteen-year-old Joey King has been acting for a decade—so yes, at the age when you were just starting to get into American Girl Dolls, she was making her TV debut. With *nine* new movies in the works—including the upcoming Independence Day sequel—she’s only gaining steam.
Rookie of the Year: In Smartass [stay tuned for the official release date], my character skateboards. So I took lessons at a skate park in Simi Valley, California, called Skatelab, and I just really loved it.
How’s Tricks: I can do a front shove-it, which is where you rotate the board around underneath your feet. But I dream of grinding on a rail [skateboarding on a handrail].
Flying High: When I’m in the air, I’m either having a panic attack or I have total composure. There’s no in between.
Girl’s Girl: I have a beautiful, marbled skateboard by Girl Skateboards. It was so pretty at first, then I started destroying it, putting duct tape and stickers on it.
Free Fallin’: During a break on Independence Day, I skated around with an assistant director and Liam Hemsworth. I did a trick and didn’t land it, so I got up and kept going. The guys were like, “Joey, your knee!” I was bleeding, apparently.
Sk8er Boi: Usually when I go to my skate park, I’m the only girl there. It’s a very intimidating setting. And I’m just like, “I know you think I’m a girl and I can’t do it, but guess what? I can.”

Joey King and Liam Hemsworth are both starring in the upcoming Independence Day 2: Resurgence, and the actress just revealed an amazing (and also kind of horrifying) story from set.
She shared a throwback photo showing her serious knee gash, and the accompanying trip she took to the store to get band-aids. It involved stealing her co-star’s car to take that trip.
Joey explained, “I wasn’t supposed to board on set, but I did, got hurt and stole Liam’s car to get band-aids.”
Sounds like a serious adventure! Liam probably didn’t mind too much, especially after he found out what Joey was using his car for. A girl’s got to do what a girl’s got to do!

Independence Day: Resurgence has the potential to be one of the biggest blockbusters of 2016. Fans of the first film have been waiting 20 years for a sequel. And while Will Smith won’t be reprising his role, a slew of new casting additions will be making their mark on the franchise. One of those is 16-year-old actress, Joey King.
Despite her age, King isn’t a newcomer to the Hollywood scene. She’s appeared in quite a few notable films. Her first lead role came from 2010’s Ramona and Beezus. King’s stock has only grown from that point, as she has been seen in White House Down, Wish You Were Here, and Oz.
It’s no surprise that King has been able to find success in Hollywood at such a young age. She has been acting since the age of four, being featured in a Life cereal commercial. King’s first appearance on film came at the age of six.
Most child actors and actresses fizzle out, but King has been able to find the roles that fit her best, and has maintained her relevancy in Hollywood. She’s been seen in family comedies, action films, and dramas. All of these different genres do a great job of showing off her range and versatility.
At such an early point in her career, King has already received praise from numerous critics and festivals such as, the Gotham Awards, Canadian Filmmakers Festival, and the Vancouver Film Festival. And as a 16-year-old there is no question she will add many awards and accolades for herself.
It’s no surprise critics love King. She will do whatever it takes to make a role her own. That includes shaving off her hair to play a staring role in Wish You Were Here, and a supporting role in the Dark Knight Rises. It’s pretty easy to see she’s already well beyond her years, and is passionate about acting.
It’s that kind of dedication and drive that make King so special. She’s still very young, but is also incredibly talented. Hopefully Independence Day: Resurgence opens up more opportunities for her in the future, and she can rise up the Hollywood ranks.
Posted on June 14, 2016 Written byAdmin Comments Off on Joey King Hopes to Launch Young Career With Independence Day: Resurgence
Courtney Love and Joey King will star as mother and daughter in the coming-of-age movie drama “The Possibility of Fireflies.”
Deborah Chow (“The High Cost of Living”) is directing from a screenplay written by Dominique Paul, the author of the original novel. Filming is set to begin this summer in Canada.
Producers are Amy Green, Chantal Kreviazuk and Raine Maida of ARC49 Entertainment. Epic Pictures is launching international sales at the Cannes Film Festival and UTA Independent Film Group will be representing the film domestically.
The story takes place during the summer of 1989 in suburban Maryland and follows a precocious teenager with dreams of becoming a writer who must cope with her chaotic, self destructive mother and a volatile metal-head sister. When she falls in love with her older neighbor, she finds herself caught in the alluring undertow of reckless rock n’ roll freedom.
“We’re so thrilled to secure such an incredibly talented duo in Joey King and Courtney Love to lead this cast,” Chow said. “Joey has proven herself to be one of the most talented young actresses working today, and as an iconic rock musician, who is also a versatile and fearless actress, Courtney is the perfect fit for this music-infused story.”
Raine Maida and Chantal Kreviazuk will team up with music producer and composer BT for the ’80s-themed soundtrack. BT will also compose the original score for the film.
Love’s acting credits include “The People vs. Larry Flynt,” “Sid and Nancy” and “Man on the Moon,” as well as the television series “Sons of Anarchy” and “Empire.” King’s credits include “Ramona and Beezus,” “White House Down,” “Wish You Were Here” and the upcoming “Independence Day: Resurgence.”
Slender Man tells the story of a tall, thin, horrifying figure with unnaturally long arms and a featureless face, who is reputed to be responsible for the haunting and disappearance of countless children and teens.

According to the Montreal national post mafia member Paolo Renda vanished in 2012. Renda rarely left his house as a result of mafia related disputes in Canada. He was reported missing on the 4th of May 2012. Recently Canadian authorities have appealed for help in finding the missing Renda. During his time of being in the mafia in Canada the Montreal national post alleges he was a Senior member of the late Vito Rizzuto's rain. More media attention is expected in the future in finding Renda.
1. Losev’s inventor’s certificates. In his portrait of Losev, Graham states that Losev had 16 inventor’s certificates, the Soviet version of a patent. In actual fact, Losev had 10 patents and 6 inventor’s certificates. In 1924 the Soviet government, largely influenced by the concessions policy, enacted a patent law that remained in force until 1931. After the 1924 law was issued, Russians had patent rights. Losev’s ability to sell his radios in the 1920s seems to related to his having had such real patent rights. In 1931 patriotic Soviets were supposed to sign over their past exclusive patent rights to the state and to apply for future invention rights using the inventor’s certificate. Not everybody toed the line, but most did. In 1931 6,071 Soviet citizens received Soviet patents; in 1932, 97 did. From 1939 to 1956 no Soviet citizen received a Soviet patent.
2. Privileges. Most Soviet legal historians considered the Russian "Regulations on privileges for inventions and improvements" (May 20, 1896 [not 1895, p. 119]) to have closely approximated many Western patent laws. Graham states: The tsar as autocrat (samoderzhavets) saw himself as the source of all power, whether wielded directly or indirectly. Therefore, a privilege given to a merchant or inventor was not seen as a right, but a dispensation, a charitable act, something given reluctantly and easily rescinded.” [p.119] The Russian use of the term privilege differs little from the origins of many 19th century European patent systems, which which also were rooted in royal prerogatives to issue monopolies, sometimes called monopoly privileges. Graham seems unaware of this history and attributes more negative significance to the use of the term privilege than is merited.
3. Compulsory working. Graham notes [p. 120] that privileges could be revoked if not “worked” and that the length of protection was shorter than in most other countries. In other words, he believes that Russian patent law was unusually restrictive. However, other countries also insisted that patents be worked (that issue sometimes turned on whether importing constituted working.) The comments on excessively slow processing are also difficult to interpret. These complaints arose in other countries as well.
3. Corruption. The Soviet patent system does present an issue that possibly fits under the rubric of corruption. A patent office should be a truly independent agency, uninfluenced by money or politics. Documents from in the Moscow State Economic Archive spelled out how Soviet officials in the early 1930s devised a special procedure for foreign applications, sending them via secret NKVD channels to relevant Soviet enterprises for input on whether or not to grant the patent and how to narrow the scope of the claims in case the invention was especially important. In other words, the patent office took foreigners’ money for patent applications, but it didn’t give their inventions an objective analysis.
The ultimate effect of this ruse was to discourage foreign applicants for decades. (When interviewed in the 1970s about filing in the Soviet Union, American patent attorneys evinced considerable skepticism about the objectivity of Soviet patent examinations.) The above ruse spills over, perhaps, to the chapter on attitudinal questions: do Russians today believe that any government agency is truly independent? What affect does this ingrained distrust have on forming a new business?
4. Copying. Graham made the following comment in the legal chapter [p.121]: “Gur’ev, openly advocated in the 1880s a policy of illicitly copying the best Western technologies under government protection, a policy that membership in international conventions on patents would have contravened.” This comment isn’t clear. If Graham is asserting that it’s not legal for a Russian to copy an invention that’s patented in Germany, but not in Russia, then he’s wrong. Ironically, Russia would probably have been better off if such copying had been illegal. An analysis of secret Soviet inventions raises the suspicion that legal copying was rampant in the Soviet Union, which, if true, would have hamstrung domestic innovation and created a culture of technological followers.
5. Listing Soviet invention laws. Graham lists the major Soviet invention laws as [p.122]: 1930, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1959, 1961, 1968 and 1973. Soviet jurists cite only the following laws: 1924, 1931, 1941, 1959, 1973 and 1991. Graham’s incorrect list is an unfortunate error, for it undermines his credibility with Russian legal experts. If he gets this wrong, what else is wrong?
He also states that the 1931 law “banned ownership of intellectual property by Soviet citizens.” That’s wrong. [See table A5.8, Annual Number of U.S.S.R. and Russian Federation Patent Grants, 1924-2007, in Martens, John, Secret Patenting in the U.S.S.R. and Russia, pp. 256-257.] Legally Soviet citizens could obtain patents, and some did, but social pressures made such a choice anti-social. Moreover, it was costly for a Soviet inventor to pay the annual patent fees. Ayn Rand draws directly on the text of the 1931 law in Atlas Shrugged, wryly calling author’s certificates Gift Certificates. (Her novel, which stresses the problems of innovation, is actually a critique of the Soviet economy; she unsuccessfully tries to apply these observations to the American economy. [Atlas Shrugged.)]
6. Discoveries and Suggestions. Graham also writes: “Since the goal of the Soviet system of invention law was to advance the government’s interests, the coverage of the law was much broader than in most Western states. Author’s certificates could be given not only for inventions themselves but also for ‘technical improvements,’ ‘rationalization,’ and ‘scientific discoveries.’” That’s wrong. Inventor’s [aka Author’s] certificates were only given for inventions. “Technical improvements” and “rationalizations,” the equivalent to suggestions in company suggestion plans, were handled entirely at the enterprise level and discoveries received formal diplomas. There never was such a unified system as he suggests. It’s true that each was defined in the law, but the administration was quite separate. The discovery appeared largely to accommodate the wishes of Academy researchers, giving them recognition for work that, perhaps, wasn’t churning out stacks of inventor’s certificates that many non-academicians pocketed.
7. Not By Bread Alone. Graham insists that Vladimir Dudintsev’s 1956 novel, Not By Bread Alone, was repressed [p. 123]. It’s not clear what he means. I easily found copies of Dudintsev’s novel on Soviet library shelves and in used book stores (the original 1956 edition and the later 1968 and 1979 editions). Maybe Dudintsev found general disfavor among good writers, but that’s a different issue. The biblical title was, perhaps, provocative, but the book was carefully written to explain the recentralization of inventing management soon to be enshrined in the 1959 law. It’s classic socialist realism, a book to promote Party policies. Dudintsev shows a detailed knowledge of the 1941 law and the problems caused by the abolition of the Committee for Inventing and decentralizing its operations. (Under the 1941 law individual ministries examined and granted inventor’s certificates. Gosplan [State Planning Agency] provided a central registry service.) The novel signaled the Party’s decision to rebuild a centralized invention system and link it with state planning to promote better industrial innovation.

One evening last week our neighbor on the left side, the saloon owner Tim O'Brien, had his laundry stolen off the clothesline, his wife having left them hanging overnight in the courtyard. Our clever police discovered the robbery quickly and also the thief or thieves. It was a pair of black kids 15 and 16 years old who had stolen the washing and brought it to another black family named Matthews who live on the prairie. During the house search the items were found and all of the participants were brought in front of His Honor Police Judge Hubbard, who undertook a hearing to establish the facts. After talking back and forth, the kids admitted to the robbery, but the receivers of the stolen goods tried to deny it, and they were fined $25, which they paid. The boys received a couple of week's free board in the county jail. As the judge asked the older of the two boys about the reasons for the theft, the boy answered after very little thought: "he did it to show the victim that it was really a stupid habit to leave the laundry overnight on the line!"

I noticed this post sitting in my Draft box since May of last year… Although it’s outdated, I think it’s still worth calling attention to given the Gold Rush to Online education climate we’re currently experiencing… If anyone knows how how well it’s been working since Last year or has personally taken one of their courses, please post about your experience within the comments.
I don’t know whether to feel excited by this announcement from Harvard and MIT’s new online education program, or sigh out a ho-hum–the way they talk, it’s as if no one has ever thought about online education before.(“Hey, there’s this new thing that’s going to revolutionize the world–it’s called “electronic mail!”).
Rather than the self-praise about innovation, I think what’s important to the rest of us is that two gorillas of education have made such a publicly formal declaration supporting online education. What they haven’t talked about however, is how what they are going to be doing is any different from anyone else–I’ve listened to a number of courses via Open Universities, YouTube in general, Udacity.com, Great Courses, as well as how my own university is approaching online education (asynchronously). What I would like to see is more discussion on different types of courses based on different subject matter (a physics course is/should work differently than a literature course online or in class). I would also like to see more discussion on costs–not only for the classes but also for the universities. In addition, I would like more discussion also on who “owns” the course content (or how it is determined).
One of the things this announcement kept focusing on was the numbers–they keep referencing thousands and millions. I can see their website now: “Over 1 billion served.”

So, it has been three months since I posted here. The main reason for the hiatus is boring and has to do with age - I've fucked up my arm and shoulder from being on the computer so much, and so I am trying to minimize how much time I spend on a computer when I am not at work.
Also, the last half of 2016 was so full of heavy shit that writing about music seemed like the least important thing I could be doing.
Maybe I'll keep this up, maybe not. I do want to write more in 2017, but I also want to spend more time with my daughter, exercise more, meditate more, and limit screen time so we'll see how that all pans out - many of those are mutually exclusive.
My final thought on 2016 and the year ahead is this: sometimes life kicks you in the fucking teeth. Everything is impermanent, change is the only constant, bad things happen, everything you love and hold dear to you will be taken away from you at some point, so enjoy the time you have with the people you love and when shit goes haywire, which it always will, try to be strong enough to get back up.

Hi there most people, welcome to the Pixel Gun 3D Strategy Guide. This kind of guide is from level 1 to the maximum level to kick start you guys without having to get worried regarding in-app purchases.
The initial issue you need to perform is proceed into Experience then proceed to Advertising campaign. And what you need to perform is complete every a single of the Campaign realms on Hard.
Try to get 2 stars about them and get mainly because much XP as you can right from them. You should level up to around level 5 simply by undertaking them and every level you obtain gems.
When you have finished all the campaigns you can start playing multiplayer. You could possibly be new or perhaps rusty nevertheless I’m likely to show you guys what you should start out with.
You happen to be gonna start with the simple equipment gun, the simple shotgun, and if perhaps you hyperlink your Fb account to the video game you will certainly get the social uzi. If you don’t obtain the uzi, the shotgun is the better option.
Next issue you should go with is the Pixel Gun, it’s a great gun and better than the others that’ll cost you gold. Carry out not pressure other guns you do not need all of them.
So another issue I perform is experience a daily goal intended for myself. The first issue I perform is complete the daily quests, they consist of victories, eliminates, and objectives.
The victories are usually 2 to your five wins about a particular map. The kills are usually 30 eliminates with possibly melee or perhaps special category. And the objective is often to record a specific amount of items on record or a specific amount of flags in capturing the flag.
Pertaining to limitless coins and gems you actually can work with pixel gun 3d hack 2018. It works rapid thus you tend not to waste your current time.
So if you complete each and every one three of those objectives every moment you can easily get everywhere from 75 to 75 XP every single day simply by going for all those quests. So the earliest one you usually obtain, which is the victories, the very best place to perform these will be in Place 52.
So go into multiplayer, crew match, and play hard. Even with the standard weapons, you can earn pretty easily and with every earn, you obtain about four coins and 10 XP.
So occasions those figures by your five you’ll become making regarding 25 gold coins and 60 XP intended for 5 games. Plus you get your five extra gold coins and twelve XP.
So that should level you up once or 2 times if you are low level. The next a single is going to obtain you a gem this kind of one is gonna obtain you twelve coins, you gem, and 15 XP.
So this kind of one is gonna become the 30 kills with a particular weapon. It’s usually likely to be a special weapon or Melee weapon.
So with Melee using the combat cutting knife, it’s going to become time-consuming and you’re likely to die a lot although that’s good. Just proceed into a match and start dogging at all of them till you get the 30 eliminates.
Once you do that you’ll obtain the XP you need to obtain further in level and it’s really worth the time used to get that. As intended for the top quality that’s likely to be factors like Rocket launchers and all that.
Understand the very best situations for every weapon. Long-range pick-offs are very best done with the sniper rifle. Mid-range gunfights will be where the machine gun shines. Employ shotguns or perhaps other heavy weaponry intended for short range battles to ensure that you can easily quick-fire and run. Melee weapons will be strong nevertheless put you at risk, and will be best used against zombie hordes in arena and co-op success. Special weapons are each and every one over the map – some will be good intended for long varies, some intended for short varies, some intended for in among.
You do not really need to get a single but if perhaps you perform I recommend the Nutcracker. It’s not expensive and it gets the job done intended for Special Category kills.
So to recap you wanna set a goal intended for yourself, you wanna conserve your gold coins and gemstones, set a daily target for yourself. Once you have reached level 10 you wanna place your gold coins and gemstones into Battle suits.
Armor is important since around that level men and women are likely to have battle suits so it could be gonna become harder to kill all of them. So you wanna give yourself battle suits to experience that durability then purchase a gun from the Primary category.
For Coins, I’d declare save up until you can obtain Hellraiser. A lot of the guns looks a lot cooler but intended for power and for successful the Hellraiser is a good decision.
You do not need to buy virtually any other gun just conserve your gold coins and upgrade it. So if you put the coins into one weapon and simply focus on that instead of trying to purchase all the guns it’ll pay off in the conclusion and you’ll conserve a lot of funds.
Be sure in order to check out the devices inside of the base shop, as these types of can substantially increase the currency benefit. Buy a Treasury and you will certainly be in a position to drill out 2 coins per day. Acquire a Driller to get paid one jewel every moment. A Lucky Clover will certainly give you one daily possiblity to wide open a lucky chest. A Jukebox will certainly enable you to pick more diverse kinds of lobby music in configurations. Amplifiers will certainly incubate the eggs 2 times as quickly.
But if perhaps you perform have gemstones or desire to purchase them I just definitely recommend waiting till there is a 3x sale. You get even more for fewer and they happen generally so it is good to look out for all of them.
Then when you have gemstones I’m likely to give you a suggestion on what to purchase. For key weapons, Im gonna declare the Amazingly Laser cannon.
It might not look mainly because cool mainly because other guns and become somewhat extravagant but that will unquestionably destroy persons. It is 100% really worth 120 gemstones.
Now if you need a Sniper, the Laserlight Crossbow is a great one nevertheless you can easily get the Prototype intended for Coins or perhaps the Impulse Sniper depending if youre going intended for Coins or perhaps Gems.
The main point is to save the coins and golds. Just purchase the one key, one sniper, and it could be one exceptional or top quality but you don’t experience to purchase all these types of weapons.
You’ll waste a lot of money and earned gemstones and gold coins that method. Just place your funds into changing one weapon and ordering armor.
Of course, given its large popularity, this can be hardly worth saying. Pretty much everyone is a Clash of Clans fan, or about to become one. But, popular as it is, I believe that it’s a little sad that this prevalence has stunted a lot of the conversation about among Supercell’s other large matches, HayDay Game. Much like CoC, HayDay Game has complex plans, time-based challenges, and copious quantities of resource management, all of which must be navigated in order for one to progress.
But as it is a completely different video game (with completely different objectives and design aesthetics), this implies there is a whole new set of techniques and strategies that a participant must learn in order to do well. Some would just say play until you learn it. In problem solving terms, this is what is referred to as”brute force”: attempting every possible combination of solutions until you receive the set up that meets your needs. Yes, this may be just as irritating, boring, and time-consuming since it seems. It is definitely better to have a system set up, and some tried but true tips to get you started. I’d say take all the HayDay Game tips you can get and leap frog the competition within a matter of days.
Below I provide some of the best tips and tricks which will make certain to give you the competitive advantage, no matter your experience level. Remember some of those secrets are more beginner and some more innovative.
Without keeping you waiting no more, let us dig into some of those tips you have been waiting for. If you do not already have the app installed, simply head to the App Store in your iPhone or even Android and download the app. It is completely free but you will find some in app purchases which will make the video game go by a little quicker. Normally these are in the form of currency packs which you can use to speed things together. Many individuals will sink a good deal of money into these matches and”buy electricity” (in video game design terms, these gamers are known as”whales”), and some have set up elaborate workarounds to keep from ever having to pay a penny. As for me, I like to strike a middle-ground: since I love those games so much, I like to be certain that the developers get a little something out of me, therefore I might put a couple bucks into it if I could afford it. But you don’t have to pay anything in order to have a good time.
Let’s be honest, a lot of us playing HayDay Game just need to make money and a lot of it, quickly. Although, I would like to create real world cash quickly, too. But you can find better ways to do that than by enjoying HayDay Game.) There are some ways that will get you there a little quicker than many others and planting wheat is just one of these. I suggest planting wheat as often as you can and at any nook and cranny which you could afford.
When you receive the wheat plants up and developing you can harvest them and sell off what you do not require.
If you are invested in the long hallway of farming wheat, then you could always use the extra cash to buy more property which will then give you more areas to grow and harvest your wheat. Other good option is to try cheat for hay day.
Most of us know coins are a useful currency in HayDay Game but ultimately they pale in comparison to the diamond. Of course, you can always buy packs of diamonds within an in-app purchase, however there are plenty of ways you can also earn them in-game. To help you in that quest, here are a number of approaches you can score diamonds.
If you’d like an excess diamond, just follow HayDay Game on Facebook. Easiest diamond you’ll ever get. Once you’re a fan, you are able to enter competitions that HayDay Game boosts in their Facebook page.
On top of that, to continue to invite you to link HayDay Game and Facebook, if you login to Facebook with HayDay Game you may get another 5 diamonds.
As you progress through the video game it’s possible to get more diamonds by completing an achievement.
If you find a film ticket this is a way to get HayDay Game to make additional cash. Fundamentally, they’re promoting a 30 second trailer of some other app to get a free diamond.
Last, if you get to level 24 then it is possible to get a lot of diamonds by simply mining, however you will have to make it to that degree first.
You might have seen newspapers around when enjoying HayDay Game and did not think anything about these. It can be easy to miss, but newspapers can be a super fast and easy way to create additional cash. Don’t limit yourself to just using your own newspaper, it is possible to steal someone else’s newspaper and use that too. That’s correct, although this is a much more peaceful video game than Clash of all Clans, there is exactly the same prospect for one to screw over your fellow gamers which you have in these matches. Be warned, however: they could just as readily screw with you.
Look around for earnings since they’re always worth it. You will find 5 for 400 sale for building equipment, merchandise, dynamite, etc.. Go right ahead and invest the money to buy it and you can then offer them separately to get a sign up. Typically, I find you can sell them for approximately 200 coins a piece. Super easy cash.
You might find yourself in a situation in which someone would like to buy your merchandise but won’t cover as much as you would like for them. Provided that you’re within a sensible selection, it will always be helpful to hold out and wait patiently until you receive a better offer.
Make sure you keep your video game so that you’re never urgently in need for cash because you will be forced to sell things at lower than ideal prices. I find that selling your merchandise is best done along the roadside stores, where you are able to get better prices.
The creators of HayDay Game want the video game to be as realistic as you can so they will build at a natural level of supply and demand in which you have to balance both during the video game. Of course, economics 101 claims to market when there is high demand and reduced supply and buy when there is low demand and higher supply. This is going to be a fast way to get ahead.
Even if you’re playing HayDay Game that does not mean that the video game has stopped and you will notice there is a difference of time while you sleep or are in school or work which you’re able to get the best use from.
I would recommend planting crops, especially ones which take a very long time to return, throughout the evenings or right before a long stretch where you can’t check in your video game. These plants take hours to return so they will be growing while you are sleeping.
Afterward, when you wake up everything you have to do is crop them and you are all set to go. You can also use the identical technique if you would like to with many different things. If you find a process or manufacturing takes a very long time then just start it right before you go to bed and it will be ready to go when you wake up.
Should you have a look at the newspaper and do not enjoy any of the deals, you do not have to worry. These deals could be swapped out for new bargains like that. When you receive a newspaper deal it will not automatically load a new deal if you recheck the newspaper.
But a little key is that if you close completely from the HayDay Game app and reopen it then it will show up with new HayDay Game newspaper bargains. If you are on an iPhone you will wish to double click on the home button and then swipe up on the HayDay Game app to get it to completely close the app. To close an app on Android, go to settings, then Application Manager. From there, search for HayDay Game, tap on it and tap on the drive stop button. This may completely close from the app.
If that is getting a bit too technical for you, you may simply turn your iPhone or Android off then restart it to in turn close the app.
You might want to just pull the trigger and then market all of your harvest, not keep your plants, but that will limit your expansion in the long term if you don’t manage all of your crops. Make sure you always have seeds left over on your silo, do not ever sell them as you will eventually just have to buy them again from another farmer in a higher price.
Additionally, keep in mind that every harvest you plant will double the crop’s return after harvest. No one wants to waste diamonds purchasing seeds which you used to possess sold for a few coins. Additionally, it is great to have a continuous supply of corn, wheat, and feed for your animals to keep on.
Among the greatest advice I have ever gotten is to continue to perform often and when I get a free moment. I have discovered if you stagger long and short play times during the day that is the best way to continue to remain in the groove of enjoying and continue to keep your plants, creatures, etc..
HayDay Game creators, Supercell, smartly made HayDay Game exactly the same manner since they created Clash of Clans. The video game is run on a server and so it never really stops. This proceeds to drive it is players to check it and perform throughout the day. Therefore, respecting the way the video game was built, it is important to keep to play it regularly.
The last tip I will give you is to help you obtain treasure out of treasure chests. To locate treasure hunt about for a tool box on a person’s farm. If you realize that the box is shut, consider tapping anywhere except that the x button. Next, you’ll want to go to another farm and find the identical tool box.
Now go back to your tool box and you need to have all of the tools available. If it does not work, continue to try several times until you receive it.
That wraps up this guide and hopefully provides you with a good sense of the HayDay Game hints you will have to succeed in the video game.

This monumental boom in a gambling area provides offered approach to different different struck portable game titles that employ returning game themes or templates or gameplay such as the ever before preferred online multiplayer Clash of Clans, where users build their small town and assault different players, to collection game titles like Dragon History where players accumulate and breed diverse types of dragons. While the mobile gambling market is pretty massive, these preferred portable titles aren’t unique to merely your smartphone or gadget as many portable game titles will be ported over from PC or vice versa where a mobile game will after that become available on your PC.
One case in point of this is going to be the overwhelmingly preferred Nice Crush created by Full that was only sold to Activision for a whopping $5.9 billion dollars; that’s billion with a m, not million. This addictive meet 3 duplicate is usually greatly preferred on both mobile devices and online gain access to from a user’s Facebook accounts. Coming from to the massive quantity of victory portable game titles have got got in the earlier, it is usually no surprise that people/programmers prefer to get in on the actions. However instead of creating a whole different game totally, the programmers will develop clones of good old game archetypes, like meet 3, and overlay a different shell or pores and skin on it to give it their personal flair.
A preferred instance of the aforementioned replicated game titles regarding gathering up is the ever growing user platform of My Singing Monsters App. For those who will be unaware of what accurately this portable game is usually all about, in this article is usually a easy synopsis. In My Singing Monsters App your purposeful is usually to accumulate diverse monsters with each monster creates a diverse audio or firmness or whip thus supplying off a wondrous melody of tracks like an orchestra; exclusively produced of monsters. When starting any different game, a person does not prefer to get halfway, spend a mass of information, just simply to recognize that they performed something wrong and have to restart. Luckily we will be in this article to support insure that you’re prepared to take on My Singing Monsters App with different guidelines, methods, and even a cheat to support raise your gameplay and increase your period and proficiency.
Like most gathering up video tutorial game titles there are period barriers that you have to wait for. When multiplying a different monster the children will take A quantity of period to hatch and turn into available. While you can employ a kind of ingame money that is usually very good even more uncommon to speed it up, you will absolutely become out of that money alternatively quickly and will become required to spend genuine personal life money on the game which after that ruins the fun as the game is usually then fork out to gain instead of free to play. While becoming patient in the game will considerably increase your game play and money, it will also coach you the genuine personal life virtue of patience.
You can expect to intuitively coach your whole body to be more patient as you wait hours and hours for your monsters to breed and for your eggs to hatch. This virtue can bring on into your everyday personal life or actually different collecting game titles like Dragon History. Once you commence spending genuine personal life money on My Singing Monsters App, or any mobile game for that subject, you will become hard constrained to make an effort and quit before the spending turns into out of control. By purchasing things with genuine money you will be permitting yourself to create a habit that will slowly evolve into a massive trouble as you drain hundreds of dollars into a mobile game.
If you want to earn cash quickly in My Singing Monsters App, there are some different ways you may do it. One approach is usually to breed two monsters, it does not subject which two, push the egg manufactured into the nursery and hold out for it to hatch. Then when the egg hatches, instead of placing the monster onto your island, promptly promote the children and do it again the method til your hearts content material.
Another way to earn coins above a longer period of time, is going to be to repeat the aforementioned process with hybrid monsters and sell all of your fundamental monsters as you fill up of your island with hybrid monsters. This method may seem to be callous nevertheless they will be digital monsters that lack emotions therefore you’re in the distinct to carry out this as longer as you prefer to while covering that you tray up tons of cash for different in game things.
Ever since My Singing Monsters App revolves around gathering up new and different monsters, it’s usually a good bummer when you get a good do it again monster that you already own instead of the new and nice monsters. This solution is usually very equivalent to the aforementioned Dragon History where you breed two variety in desires of having a larger collection. And once again equivalent to Dragon History is usually the sufficient quantity of multiplying courses available on the internet for My Singing Monsters App. You prefer monster C, very well place it into the calculator and find the probabilities of having monster C from reproduction monsters A and T.
In addition to acquiring reproduction courses that give you the odds of getting a particular type of monster, these courses will also go in more detail on how reproduction gets results just simply in case you’ve been doing it wrong. Armed with the expertise of what outcomes your multiplying of monsters will be allows you to package out your island in higher depth while also increasing your risk of having the monsters you prefer instead of repeats; approved you will be limited to get repeats when striving for the uncommon monsters, you will be even now elevating your probabilities of having the monsters you prefer.
Like most other collection or island/small town based game titles, My Singing Monsters App puts you in fee of an island where you place and organize your various items and monsters to whatever design you desire; even so the island isn’t completely available when you first start out your game. Rather than the whole island becoming totally open up, different pieces of debris lie down about your island that need you to spend cash on to distinct which in convert provides you even more space to arrange your monsters and things.
Whilst this may seem to be tedious, having an adequate amount of space while you are using is heavily required as you don’t want to run out of space when you level up and have even more gain access to to even more monsters and items. Look at the overlay of the island and make an effort to program out where you will be heading to place everything in addition to examining every component of the island as you may have overlooked some debris or have some misused space strewn about. As well the layout of your island/islands influences the beat performed by your monsters; the game is usually My Singing Monsters App after all. Only after you place a newly hatched monster will you hear how it alterations the orchestra of tracks already present on your island.
You may modification the location of monsters at any period by rearranging your islands. Finally each island you personal provides a castle. These castles will be the “homes” of your monsters; believe of it like a hotel where each monster gets a room for themselves. If your castle is usually full then you cannot put any different monsters to the island as you will be out of room. You after that have to update your castle to put even more monsters to the island. While this may seem to be like a location to modernize previous, by updating your castle’s first, you get gain access to to even more monsters which give even more cash which in convert works extremely well for even more things, monsters, etc…
A key component in My Singing Monsters App is keeping your monsters completely happy so they earn you more cash as you play the game. By placing monsters near things or monsters they like, their delight level will become very much bigger. If you don’t really know what your monster sees happy just simply choose your monster and struck the “?” which will present you what your monster enjoys. That approach you can usually help to make sure your monsters will be at optimum delight. While this characteristic may seem to be a lttle bit lackluster, you should even now continue to keep it in head. Not only will it support you set up your islands even more proficiently but you will also acquire the virtually all out of your monsters.
Simply because very well as keeping your monsters happy you also want to regularly level them up in buy to earn even more silver and maximize your island. In buy to level up a monster you want to have sweets which is often produced from the bakery or bought from the market. All you have to carry out is usually tap your monster and mouse click on the cupcake icon until the monster is usually fed plenty of to level up. Aspect word, you should have all of your monsters to at least level 4 as that is usually when they can become carefully bred with different monsters. When you modernize your monsters not only carry out the monsters produce even more cash for your island nevertheless they also modification in physical overall look growing larger and larger the even more you level it up. This provides an added reward to regularly update your monsters as the physical style of the monster turn into even more and even more visually pleasing the bigger the monsters level.
Once again funding from different diverse game titles, My Singing Monsters App also implements a approach to support players gain resources throughout their gameplay to support continue to keep them interested. In My Singing Monsters App you have a “goals” display with diverse goals that you should carry out. Once the requirements for the “target” will be achieved you can after that accumulate the incentive. When you will be low on information or will be stuck at a level while requiring to accumulate information, the “goals” offer a remedial process with different rewards that you should complete. On your passive game display appearance at the leading left at the “goals” icon. If you have volumes visible on the icon after that you have some finished goals anticipating that you should move and experience the rewards and rewards. Some things available from “goals” will be as ensues; gems, foodstuff, XP (experience details), and cash. Once you complete a sole target another target will promptly replace it. I recommend doing the quests generously all the approach up to level 15 to insure that your early game play is usually clean as you prepare for the late game.
As stated previously your monsters have foodstuff to level up and earn even more cash. In buy to increase your foodstuff productions you will have to modernize your bakeries. To order a bakery, open up up the market and mouse click on the “buildings” hook and specific a bakery. Once you order the bakery, choose it after that struck modernize. To modernize the bakery you need to employ cash. Improving your bakery won’t become low-cost at all but will become worth it when you will be in a position to help to make a mass of foodstuff for your monsters. Improving these bakeries should usually become a priority as you can modernize your monsters quicker with a larger foodstuff supply. The more rapidly you upgrade your monsters, the more rapidly you get cash, the more rapidly you get to carry out anything in My Singing Monsters App.
Hopefully this guide of principles can help you and your numerous islands. Nowadays informed with the expertise of everything My Singing Monsters App, ok not all of it but a fair quantity of information, you can easily maximize the productions and leveling in order to play through the game without very damaging period. After all throwing away period just simply prolongs your chances of boredom instead of the fun that My Singing Monsters App provides to present you. Consequently get out there and develop your chosen composition of monsters as they all develop noises in a coinciding melody that will keep you wanting even more.

They are the numbers under the name of the automobile. PP is the BHP of the automobile in stock or upgraded type & Evo is the extra efficiency you receive for using fusion parts or tuning your vehicle. For instance, you’ve got 300 +100. In this, 300 is the PP and +100 is the EVO or EP as NM identifies it. Will this mean 400 total? NO! Just about all people think its more likely to end up being: 300 + (100/10) = 310 in total (this is just a guess simply NM knows the real value of these 2 numbers combined).
For tier 1 through tier 3, in live races, it’s usually better to have a low PP and a higher EVO (you’re aiming for an EVO of somewhere between 500-700+). After we had been playing for a few months, we stumbled after a video tutorial that talked about how to succeed keys in live racing utilizing a Golf GTi, hence we upgraded the NOS, tires, and trans on a GTi (one we’d gotten from a crate) and left the rest stock, added fusion parts to those upgrades, tuned it, and found it was a pretty great way to start out grinding for keys. The figures for that build and tune were 231 +527 (we retained track of those figures, because we were curious if it would work and wished to bear in mind them if it do.).
For tiers 4 & 5, possess a tune that may race close to, or somewhat under, your dyno period and has an EVO of somewhere between 700-1000+; this is your goal. You’re buying a 50% succeed ratio. Winning a whole lot of races in a row & having a succeed ratio over 50% feels great, but it will most likely bump you right into a more rapidly lobby (e.g. you can be forced to race more rapidly & more rapidly opponents). It’s also significant to obtain the right lobby for just about any live racing you do. In the event that you lose several in a row (plus they are killing your run occasions), back again out and re-enter. There are a lot of complaints about match-producing in the multi-player component of CSR2 and quite often we get frustrated aswell, but with effort and time, you can do it.
These give extra RP than the non-starred version and also have more fusion slots, making them quicker in the end (when compared to non-starred version).
First, win some bronze keys in live racing. Second, gather the free of charge bronze crate Donna offers you every four hours. Next, get a component from earning a Daily Struggle. Also, race every glass & trial race you can to succeed fusion parts &/or keys. Lastly, buy autos and strip them for fusion parts (for example, you can buy extra t1 Fiesta STs to strip to receive fusion parts for your t3 Mustangs or purchase extra t2 m235i to strip for your t3 BMW M4s). You won’t receive Mustang or M4 stage 6 fusion parts this way, but rather common, unusual, and epic parts which happen to be usable on any Ford or BMW autos in the overall game (Ford for Ford and BMW for BMW). To get stage 6 parts for the Mustang or M4, you’ll have to strip Mustangs and M4s.
It’s usually better to use gold and silver keys during 10x or perhaps 20x events. Soon after a new season starts, there will be a multiplier for the times of year Prestige car. With the Prestige car, you can do the Prestige Cup and possibly earn a whole lot of RP, nevertheless, just starting out this is often a little difficult to do, because upgrades can be expense prohibitive and you have to be in a crew. There’s no assurance that you’ll receive that car, but your chances of pulling what could be one of “your” solid early autos is a little much better than just randomly wasting keys on non-multiplier crate openings.
IMO, the best make use of for gold in CSR Racing 2 is to re-fill your gas tank. More gas PiPs equals extra RP. In the event that you put it to use to increase your upgrades, that’s not going to be efficent. Simply wait and do several of your upgrades simultaneously when you’re from the game. One other possible use will be a one time gold buy of your first good car which, we believe is the Porsche 718 Boxster S. It’s a solid t2 car.
Most of the period, you’ll need a specific set-up to race in a cup or trial event. Our primary thought was “Dang, we now have to spend your time building that specific car.” This was incorrect; down-grade or adjust a car you possess to meet up with the requirements of the event.
IMO, it’s better to upgrade the NOS, accompanied by the tires, then your trans in order to tune the automobile ASAP. From there, it’s a subject of preference. We generally do intake, accompanied by turbo, in that case engine, and end up upgrading body last. This, actually, is our own, personal procedure. A couple other things to consider about upgrading autos: If your patient more than enough, wait on obtaining tier 3, 4 & 5 starred autos to upgrade. That’s hard to do because you would like to progress through the overall game, but it will be more efficent. If you have to make use of non-starred version, only do the minimal sum of upgrades you can to achieve your objective. Finally, we wouldn’t make use of any stage 6 upgrades on non-starred cars.
(’s ) Upgrade NOS to at least stage 2 Upgrade Wheels to at least stage 3 Upgrade Transmission to at least stage 4 You’ll want these upgrades at the very least to tune a car.
What car(s) conduct we use? Below are a few suggestions for autos to start out with. These autos can be bought with in-game currency. Hopefully, you’ll get a starred release of tiers 3, 4 & 5 but if not, it’s ok to purchase them because you can strip them later.
You’ll probably get a starred release of the 650’s, 570’s, 700-4, &/or 488 early and think “They are nice..”. These were a few of our t5 early crate pulls. We believe we get these relatively early to greatly help us get through t5 ladder, crew battles and regulation races. Do not use a whole lot of fusion parts on them. Better cars should come and you’ll want you hadn’t employed so many fusion parts on them( you’ll almost certainly pull a few t4 cars early aswell).
The first one is for general game use. Upgrade everything to stage 5 and add fusion parts, as you can. The second one is for live racing. Upgrade the transmission, NOS, and tires to stage 5 and leave the rest stock, adding fusion parts, as you can. Try to receive the EVO as huge as feasible when tuning it then study what rpm to release it, shift it, in that case start live racing it. Try to achieve around a 50% succeed ratio; that’s your goal. Remember, beating the dyno again and again will get you bumped into more rapidly lobbies. One other thing/, if someone difficulties right after they lose, it may be a set-up to a huge bet.They are probably trying to sandbag you into a huge fat loss.
Next, we would understand this video tutorial: CSR 2 | Winning Tier Boss Cars Easy – Best Cars for funds and Times
This video is older, so please remember MN can tweak numbers whenever they want, but this is an example of a basic set-up & tune for a t3 car with no stage 6 or fusion parts that can be utilised for t3 regulation races. It teaches you that you do not need stage 6 upgrades and a lot of fusion parts to enjoy through some game content.
(you’ll need two autos for each portion of the challenge, 1 for period trials and someone to race for the Boss car.)
Do a little Youtube or Reddit study for boss occasions. Be sure to have the most recent results for enough time to defeat them. Natural Motion has tweaked the quantity before, hence they could repeat. Don’t do this last race until you’re 100% sure of the time it takes to win the automobile, you will not get a second prospect.Winning the t3 race against Amelia is significant. The LB M4 Coupe you succeed is pretty fast, once it’s upgraded and tuned. Here are our recommendations for Tempest 1. Don’t use your more rapidly cars for enough time trials conserve those for the Boss Races
Occasionally, you’ll get a pop-up for some special offer in the game. Sometimes they can be really good, if you want to spend a little funds. IMO, the premium currency in CSR2 is silver & gold keys. In terms of bronze, however, not so much, but silver & gold keys are usually okay to purchase in the beginning. It only makes sense for them to give you deals to attract you in and prevalent theory says you’ll get better cars early hence you’ll keep playing.

As Criterion prepares to release its Eclipse box-set "Presenting Sacha Guitry", I thought I might share this quote from François Truffaut’s (writing as Robert Lachenay) review of Guitry’s Si Versailles m'était conté which appeared in the April 1954 issue of Cahiers du Cinema.
Two of the three Guitry films which Truffaut can “watch and rewatch” Les Perles de la couronne and Le Roman d’un tricheur are included in the Eclipse set. La Poison is a Guitry from 1951, a year - and the only year other than the war years - in which no Prix Louis Delluc was awarded. Les Fâcheux modernes better known as Les Casse-pieds took the Delluc in 1948. In the last sentence quoted, Truffaut plays with the French language as “casse-pied” = “boring”.

I've been training with James now for just under 16 weeks and in that time I've lost 2 ½ stone and dropped from a size 16 to a 10 and I feel fantastic. I've got so much self confidence and I've never felt better.
Prior to training with James I tried losing weight through various fad diets and half hearted gym sessions without any real success. As most women will testify, losing weight through quick fix diets isn't just difficult but is impossible to maintain.
Now with the help of James and his team, I feel motivated to stay in shape and carry on with the one to one sessions on a regular basis. For me as an individual, personal training is the only way to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
I needed to get back in shape to climb Mt Kilimanjaro after a few years on the sauce for a living as a showbiz reporter at The Sun.
When we started off I could barely manage 15 minutes continuous running without struggling. Now we're boxing, skipping, on the weights, running and rattling out circuits like I'd never let my fitness slip in the first place.
For that reason he's an essential part of my job - keeping my mind clear for the gruelling graft of a showbiz editor.

Gaining 3 stone during pregnancy affected my confidence as I was used to being a size 10 and not a size 14. However, working out regularly with James and following the diet plan he gave me helped me to get fit, look slim, and most importantly have confidence in myself again.
It was great being able to exercise outdoors rather than just on the same old machines in the gym and the wide variety of different exercises James introduced into our sessions meant that there was no chance of getting bored. Every session was hard work but good fun at the same time and this definitely helped me stick at it.
I recommend JD Personal Training to anyone who needs help with their body. After having my second child the training got me back down to a size 10 and now I am definitely a yummy mummy!
After ten years, sitting on my backside, watching the television for The Sun, a minor miracle has occurred. I'm fit again.
And it was all thanks to James Daly. A charming but tough task master who I didn't always thank, while I was flat on my back, doing "just 10 more press ups" and sweating for Scotland.
But the results were undeniable. For the first time since I picked up a TV remote control, back in 1999, I was back in shape, enjoying exercise and feeling brilliant.
Many thanks, James. But, please, don't wear the England football top next time. There’s only so much punishment I can take...

"You see, I haven't been to a gym since 1988, when, as a key member of the Manchester All Stars Youth team (American Football) I was told to go work on my strength conditioning…some things never change!"
As the triathlon gets closer and closer training is getting tougher! Today was no exception. James Daly (No relation to Tess!) our trainer really put me through my paces as he did on Monday with Gordon (Smarty) from The Sun, who is also taking part. I assume James had a bad weekend and decided to take it out on us!
James (our PT) and I are now getting into a rhythm in the gym. Ok I admit that work travels are getting in the way of regular sessions but I feel I'm coming on strong with the stuff we are doing. This pot belly is doing my head in, we are doing lots and lots of core training as the three disciplines in the triathlon require you to have a good strong core.
So how do we achieve the perfect abs...? Simple - Exercise and a good diet. James is insistent that the right exercises and a good healthy intake of the right foods will almost guarantee the perfect physique
It's getting more and more obvious to us all that the prospect of this Olympic Triathlon is now becoming a reality. It's all well and good calling up a couple of pals and asking if they fancy it but to actually get on with it and train HARD for it is not that easy. Don't get me wrong, I'm loving working with James our personal trainer. The results are fantastic.
James our personal trainer has really stepped it up a gear with shuttle runs and increasingly difficult circuits. "Let's move outside onto the kerb and do 50 little jumps on and off".....Sounds pretty easy? You try it!!!!!! I never thought that something I found so easy as a kid would be such a nightmare in my 30's...
Every morning I worked out and after having all the right techniques drilled into me by James the results have been fantastic. It goes to show that if you use the right technique when exercising it don't matter what you use to achieve great results. I think Smarty and I are lucky to have a total BEAST of an instructor looking after us.

This year I'm one of the organisers of the Joy of Coding conference. It's a small conference in Rotterdam to celebrate, as the title says, the joy of coding. We have invited 8 great speakers to talk about their passion. This conference is for all developers, regardless of the language they program in.
There is a call for papers for a session that we'll fill with lightning talks to help out new speakers to get some practice in. So if you're quick you can still submit! There will also be speedmeeting sessions to get to know some of the other people at the conference. AND there is a somewhat alternative workshop that you can try out at any time during the day! (The subject of which is still a bit of a secret, but there is a hidden hint that can be found on the website.)
Devoxx UK returns to London May 11th & 12th, 2017. We want you, the developer community, to help make it amazing again. The Call for Papers is open and we want to share valuable knowledge and precious experiences, making everyone better informed.
Do you have any insights and ideas for sessions? You can check our youtube channel and see the talks given last year for inspiration.
Talks can be in the form of a Conference Session (a 50-minute in-depth talk), a 2-hour Hands-on Lab, evening BOFs or 15-minute Quickie sessions.If you are new to public speaking and don’t want to dive straight into a main conference talk, lunchtime Quickies are a great option. Alternatively, consider pairing up with a colleague and giving a joint presentation.
If you have a great idea for a conference talk, but haven't given one before, sign up for the New Speaker Mentoring program. We will pair you up with an experienced speaker, who will advise you on your proposal before you submit it.
If your proposal is accepted, they will dedicate time to you every month, and in the crucial run up to the conference. Their role will be to advise you, give you valuable feedback and hear previews of your talk before you present it. They will also be on hand just before your talk, and during it so you will have a friendly face in the audience.
Then spread some Christmas cheer to our Program Committee by submitting a talk. Send some of your insights, hopes and dreams our way.
As well as submitting a proposal for a talk, you can join the Buddies Program. Brain child of Java Champion Linda van der Pal, this aims to pair up new conference attendees with more experienced attendees. Whether you are a Devoxx expert or novice, why not share your time and help to truly enrich the conference experience.
I just received a message from Peter Kopfler who is organising the Global Day of Code Retreat in Vienna. He would love to have a female facilitator for the 22 of October. Sadly I can't go myself, as my October and November months are filled to the brim already. He mentioned that his sponsor would help cover expenses, so if you are interested you can contact us.
This year at Devoxx UK, I organized the buddy program. This program was intended to introduce people who didn’t know anybody at the conference to some other people, to make the times between the sessions (lunch, evenings, etc.) a bit more enjoyable. My hopes are that this program will make conferences more diverse, by appealing to people who might not come exactly _because_ they don’t know anybody there.
Initially it looked as if we would have nine people, but there was a surge at the last minute, adding another seven participants. So there were sixteen participants in total, of which four were speakers. About half of them had never been to Devoxx UK before. All of the feedback I got was positive, people really liked sharing their experiences with each other.
As I was listening to the introductory keynote, I realized I hadn't asked the organization to mention the program. This could have helped the program to reach more people. Next year we'll have to make more of a fuss about the program in general, as many people never heard of it, despite it being mentioned in the newsletter and the link on the site. So if you were in the program, please blog or tweet about your experiences!
I wasn't around for setup, so I could only arrange for a table after the attendees were inside already. And with everybody coming in at once, the organization had no time to spare to help arrange such things. (Mind you they were very helpful, just also extremely busy.)
Once again, the organization was very busy. And I could have easily prepared all this at home. And with more signs, hanging all over the place before people even enter, I think I might have pulled off what I really had in mind: an actual registration desk. The round table was a nice meeting point, but so few people had heard of the program, that it didn't feel worth my time to hang around there at all times to hook people up.
It would have been nice if we could have all participants meet up with each other before the conference. I even heard the idea of doing speed dating to get people to know each other. So maybe next year we can do some pre-conference activity.
I got four more registrations during the first day, but as I'm usually offline during conferences, I didn't see them until the next morning. So either I should stay online to monitor them, or I should make sure the online registration is closed as if the night before the conference.
I had intended there to be boards where people could share information about dinner, meeting up, taxi rides to the airport and the like. I tried to put up static notes on the wall behind the meeting point, but they were not visible enough and therefore not used.
Some other ideas that were mentioned during my session were to make the buddies more visible (stickers on the badge?), or even to add them to Huntly. The list of questions should be shorter, I cash probably make do with just name, contact details, conference experience and interest in tracks. In the end I didn't use the other data, as there were so few participants. It was also suggested that there might be a checks on the general Devoxx registration form to indicate being a first-timer, which would result in extra information about the buddy program being shown.
And finally, during the workshops the last day, we realized that having such workshops at the beginning (and in particular those like the one about retrospectives) as they help to introduce you to your fellow participants.
All in all, I thought the program was a success, despite being so much smaller than I'd hoped for. And I would love to do this again. So if you are a conference organizer and would like this at your own event, feel free to contact me! Even when I can't make it to your conference, we can certainly talk about getting this on the rails! I'd love to see this becoming a default aspect of all conferences. (And there's no way I can actually visit all conferences myself, sadly.)
So all our incessant nagging has paid off, and you are considering becoming a public speaker. You'd really like to give a talk at that one great conference, but you really have no clue what to talk about. Don't worry, this is pretty common, and it's bugged us quite a few times as well. There has been many an event that I didn't submit anything for, despite planning to attend (and wishing I did have something I could submit). But today I've found this great article that I think can help us all:
This is a checklist of questions that prompt you to come up with good ideas. So my advice will be to download that list, print it and hang it in a visible space. Then any time another CFP comes by that makes you wish you had a talk to give, spend the requested 30 minutes to come up with something. And remember, we're always willing to help you finetune your idea if you drop us an email!
Last year at JFall I gave an ignite talk about Sketchnoting. It wasn't until after the conference that I realized I had been the only female speaker at the event. 5 minutes of presentation by a woman at a conference with about 40 hours worth of content. Knowing very well that this was no deliberate discrimination by the organizers, I determined to do something about it. So this year I have joined the program committee and have set myself the goal of 10% female speakers. I counted 55 names on the program last year, so that would amount to only 5 or 6 female speakers. Surely that should be attainable.
So help me reach my goal by flooding the CFP with proposals this year, as soon as it opens. It's supposed to open on the 16th of June, so I'm giving you a head start to think about your subjects.
Entry level presentations are perfectly fine. Lots of people have never started with that one technology you have worked with.
Feel free to submit several talks. If you only want to give one talk, just let me know, and I'll make sure the rest of the committee knows as well.
Talking in front of a crowd is scary, but you have to know that the audience wants you to succeed. They have come to learn, not to gloat about your incompetence. Just think about yourself for a second when you visit a conference, you didn't come to gloat either, did you? Most people are there for the same reasons. :)
There will be several different formats of talks from an ignite talk to a hands on lab so maybe a shorter talk will suite your topic more. (But beware that the ignite talk is in my opinion the hardest format of all, despite it's short length!)
Talks at jFall are both in Dutch and English so feel free to select the language you are most comfortable with.
Drop us a line if you want some help with your proposal or want to practice your talk in front of a small group.
Even if you’ve been attending developer conferences for years, sometimes they can just feel like lonely places.
If you’re attending Devoxx UK this year and don’t know anyone else coming, but do know that you’ll want share your experience with others, there’s a solution.
Long time Devoxx attendee, Java Champion and JDuchess founder Linda van der Pal has stepped up to the plate to conceive and coordinate the Devoxx Buddies Program.
We’ll match you with two or three other people with similar interests. Together, you can discuss the sessions you’ve seen, grab a drink (if that’s what you enjoy), have dinner, and ultimately get so much more out of the conference experience than you would on your own.
The plan is to match up all Buddies groups with at least one person who has been to Devoxx UK before. There will be an information desk at the event where you can find and leave information on what your dinner and other social plans are. It’s also possible to switch in and out of groups to help you meet as many people as possible.
Even if you know a heap of people coming to the event already, you can still sign-up to meet new people and help share the Devoxx experience more. Maybe you can introduce others to all the people you already know, can tell them where and when to get the best food or coffee, or where the best restaurants in town are. Or perhaps you could be a mentor for less experienced conference goers and first-time attendees.

You can add any image size and the system will expand it to fit the slide. However, if you want the image to fit our slide perfectly, here are our slide dimensions:
Expands to full screen width and adjusts hight accordingly. (Units on mobile are more slender and higher)
A shortcut at the top of the screen (no matter what page you're on) that opens the whole outstanding reservations list without having to click on BookEasy – Reservations – All outstanding – Search – 50 (that’s 5 clicks…)
Obviously we need to be careful not to get too carried away and add multiple options under here and will still require an extra click.
Yes that would work as the top right hand corner stays the same no matter what page you're on, have a link in there that opens your whole list of all outstanding reservations, that would be so much more practical :)
The NY legislature passed changes in sexual harassment law that Governor Cuomo signed into law on April 17, 2018. These laws went into effect 90 days after being enacted, which means they are currently in effect.
Prohibited clauses in employment contracts make arbitration mandatory for allegations or claims that employees file regarding sexual harassment (or any discriminatory action). Any contracts that contain such clauses no longer have legal standing and will not be enforced by the NY courts. The fact that a mandatory arbitration clause exists in a contract does not make the other clauses the contract contains invalid. The only clause that is null and void is the clause that makes arbitration mandatory.
In the past, employers could prevent disclosure of sexual harassment by including a nondisclosure or confidentiality clause in a contract. Under the new change in NY law, employers cannot require a claimant to keep confidential the underlying facts and circumstance that led to the claim or action. The only exception is if confidentiality is the complainant’s preference. Nondisclosure prohibition also applies to an agreed upon judgment, decree, settlement or stipulation in a legal proceeding regarding the sexual harassment claim.
If a nondisclosure agreement is being considered, all parties must be allowed to consider it for a period of 21 days. Additionally, if used, the individual has seven days to revoke the agreement, which does not become effective until the revocation period has ended.
If you are uncertain about complying with employment laws or face a dispute or lawsuit brought against you by an employee, our attorneys at Stephen Hans & Associates are glad to discuss your concerns and determine how we can assist you.

Shannon Ward and Diana Stirling are the authors of Babyproofing Your Business, teaching entrepreneurs how to build wildly successful businesses without sacrificing themselves or their families. These moms, entrepreneurs and change-makers have figured out that work-life balance is a myth and redefining success is the key to living an amazing life. They have been extensively quoted, listed and ranked since they tore down their 7-figure business and rebuilt it on a new business model called Pretirement that earns them freedom, financial gain and fulfillment.
Join us on the evening of November 1 in the sumptuous ballroom at Hycroft Mansion for a glass of wine, some nibbles and of course lots of laughs, insights and maybe some misty tears as only Leading Moms can deliver.
Now in our 7th year, we’re talking all about the body: not just about the importance of putting yourself first and self care, but also how to have better sex after kids, how to keep your mindset positive as a mom pulled in multiple directions, as well as explore “why mommy drinks” and add even add in a bit of politics too.
I know a lot of parents (like me) who feel stretched really, really thin. There’s not a lot of time for routine tasks, let alone big personal creative projects. Here’s how I’m chipping away at a few grand endeavors. And how my yoga teacher reminded me that ‘family time’ is also going into the long-term creative hopper.
OK. I totally love my family. And I’m so grateful to be a parent. AND it’s also tough to deal with what feels like a big setback to productivity and creativity. Now that my kid is six, parenting is a little less hands-on. But still my creative time, space, and energy are not as abundant as they were six years ago.
And now my yoga teacher is asking me to welcome the pauses. To relax into and embrace all the moments surrounding the doing and the making. To relax into all these times of waiting for my kid at the Kindergarten door, of sitting with my kid while he cries it out, of holding my kid after the last book of the night.
There is calm and clarity–and maybe there is perspective that comes–when I accept stillness… without thinking about the next breath just yet… (And serenity, clarity, and perspective all fuel creativity.)
I’ll admit that I’ve cooked a lot of family meals while putting laundry away. I’ve checked email while my kid practiced crawling. I probably had a wrinkly brow during most diaper changes. And that’s okay–I needed to get stuff done, and I was doing my best.
But the times I’ve remembered to drink enough water, or to plant my feet comfortably while rocking my kid to sleep… well, the tasks have gotten done all the same. But I’ve felt better throughout it all. And really, if life is just a series of moments, why not find comfort through all those moments, including the mundane and exhausting ones.
The more I remember to find that extra ease, the better I feel. And when I feel recharged and comfortable, my body and mind tend to cooperate when I DO find those pockets of time for creative work.
Practicing an instrument, writing a new composition, producing a podcast episode–it all requires time and space. With little dudes running around the house, it’s hard to just CREATE when the creative impulse sparks. There are supplies I can’t just leave out (my flute, or even a rough draft of a new piece–last time I did that, there were little fighting Ninja drawn all over the viola part…)
But deep creative work doesn’t always have mean doing the work. In fact, I think most insights come when I am “just” listening and paying attention. In Episode 03 of my Irish Music Stories podcast, fiddle player and teacher Laurel Martin spoke about how listening is a powerful act:
“I feel as though what’s being forgotten—and that’s maybe also an American cultural thing—is that we don’t feel that listening is a thing to do. We listen while we’re doing something else. We listen while we’re driving, or we listen to a podcast while we’re cooking. But to just sit and listen.. and just absorb what’s happening—we don’t tend to think of that as a thing to do. And yet it is.”
Laurel goes on to describe what she sees and notices in an Irish music session, outside of the music. “You see people helping each other, reminding each other. It’s such a human thing that’s really about kindness and good spiritedness and generosity. As much as it is about the music itself.”
And when relaxed, present minds wander while, say, changing diapers, this might lead to GREAT creative work later!
Huge chunks of uninterrupted time are mostly a thing of the past for me. So I now do my best to use the title moments I DO have.
And while it’s especially effective for me if I’ve already dreamt up my big project (while making dinner for my family), and I’ve already identified a few concrete action items (while Dad and son are playing Magical Creatures in the backyard), just forcing myself to do 10 minutes of creative work badly is almost always useful. My mantra: Do it badly!
In 10 minutes I can: Write a few bad paragraphs! Write a really crappy 8 bar intro to the new flute piece! Make quick and sloppy edits to an Irish Music Stories Podcast script! Upload a new instructional video.
This is how I’ve begun a lot of work, some of which has ended up being enduring and sustaining. I wrote a post about doing it badly …
When I DO make un-hampered, un-hurried time to work… and I find myself putting in a load of laundry or checking my Facebook feed… I try to say this out loud:
I try to yell at my internal call to organize my pens, or dust my desk, or check the mail. I try to remind myself that I can do this stuff when I’m hanging out with my kid. Hell, I can do it with him by putting socks on his hands and telling him to paint in the dust!
And I also try to be kind to myself and remember that I am lulled by these distractions because creative work is really hard and really scary. What if I don’t do a good job? What if I DO?
But I can do it, maybe because of the diaper changes and dinner preparations that I did manage to do mindfully. Because all along, I’ve been doing the most important work of all, which is practicing to listen and to seek stillness.

a valid debit or credit card for payment (Visa, Mastercard, Delta, Visa Electron, Switch/Maestro and Solo cards are accepted)
To book a practical test by post you will need an application form. Application forms are available online or on request from the Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency booking line.
a passenger head restraint, this need not be adjustable but must be fitted as an integral part of the seat. ‘Slip on’ type head restraints are not permissable
L-plates displayed on the front and rear of the vehicle but not interfering with the driver or examiner’s view
You must take the following items with you to your driving test. If you do not, your test may be cancelled and you may lose your fee.
an appropriately insured and licensed vehicle, displaying L- plates that is suitable for the purpose of the test
your photo card licence. If you misplace your licence, you must apply for a replacement from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), which could take up to 15 days. If this happens, you may have to rearrange your test
The test will include an eyesight test (if you fail this, your test will not continue). After the eyesight test you will be examined on your general driving and a reversing exercise. The reversing exercise will be chosen from:
During the driving test the examiner will give you directions which you should follow. Test routes are designed to be as uniform as possible and will include a range of typical road and traffic conditions. During the test, the examiner will ask you to carry out set exercises.
Throughout the test you should drive in the way your instructor has taught you. If you make a mistake, don’t worry about it, it might be a less serious driving fault and may not affect your result. The examiner will be looking for an overall safe standard of driving.
You can make up to 15 driving faults and still pass the test (16 or more results in failure). However, if you commit one serious or dangerous fault you will fail the test. If at any time your examiner considers you to be a danger to other road users your test will be stopped.
You are allowed to take someone with you on the test, this person must be over 16 years old and cannot take any part in the test.
All examiners are trained to carry out the test to the same standard, they do not have pass or fail quotas. So as long as you demonstrate the standard required you will pass your driving test.
DVSA do not conduct tests in bad light or in adverse weather conditions for the safety of the candidate and the examiner. Another appointment will be arranged at no further cost, but compensation is not payable. Candidates should call the telephone number quoted on the appointment letter to check whether their test will go ahead. If the driving test is not completed for reasons attributable to you or your vehicle, you will have to take another test at your own cost.
Candidates will be asked two questions, one ‘show me’ and one ‘tell me’. One or both questions answered incorrectly will result in one driving fault being recorded. Please find examples of safety check questions here.
When the driving test is over, the examiner will tell you whether you passed or failed. You can request feedback on your test from the examiner, who will then go through your performance during the test.
If you pass and have a photocard driving licence issued after 1 March, 2004 the examiner will ask you if you want your full driving licence issued to you automatically.If you want to use this service, the examiner will take your old licence off you, scan the details and send them electronically to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). You will then be given a pass certificate to prove you passed your test. DVLA will then send you your new full licence by post within three weeks of you passing your practical test.
If you pass your test but do not want to use this automatic service, or have a licence issued before 1 March 2004, you will be given a pass certificate by the examiner. On the back of the pass certificate it tells you what you need to do next. This involves sending your licence and appropriate fee to DVLA who will then check your application and issue you with a new full licence.
DSA recommend that new drivers who have just passed their practical test consider taking Pass Plus modules. Pass Plus is a course of six extra modules taken with a driving instructor after passing your test. Please find further information here.
If you fail the test you should ask the examiner for some feedback to help prepare yourself for your next test. Your driving report form will also show you where you made any mistakes. You can take another practical test 10 working days after your test.
The Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency is committed to equal opportunities for all, providing a number of facilities for candidates with special needs or physical disabilities. When booking your practical test, please let the DSA know if you:
No matter how serious your disability might be, you will still take the same driving test as every other test candidate. However, more time is allowed for the test. This is to allow the examiner to talk to you about your disability and any adaptations fitted to your vehicle.
More information about vehicle adaptations for disabled motorists and the elderly can be obtained from the Mobility Advice and Vehicle Information Service (MAVIS).

RIXG (the Renal Information EXchange Group) first met in July 2003, tasked with thinking how to make the best use of modern IT to improve information and care for kidney patients. A number of things were discussed, including better websites to provide information about renal services and organisations. However the strongest feeling at the first meeting was the desire to make a difference to the patient experience. It was pointed out that despite developments in computing and the invention of the Internet, and a number of notable developments inside healthcare, the experience for patients was largely unchanged.
In further discussions, patients said they would value access to the type of data already held in renal unit IT systems. So a small group explored this, seeking to find out whether this could be extracted and presented alongside explanatory information about tests, diagnosis, and targeted information about treatments such as dialysis, transplants, and general management of kidney diseases. In many ways this was close to the ‘electronic care plan’ which was one of the visions in the government’s massive NHS IT project at the time. However RIXG thought that as a small minority with particular requirements, renal patients would inevitably receive a low priority in that project. Important background to this was that renal units had been pioneers in investing in IT since the 1980s, creating some of the first electronic patient records, and most units already held a lot of valuable information on dedicated (but often old) IT systems.
The feedback from the exploratory studies was that it was technically achievable, so in 2004 RIXG initiated what became PatientView as its first project. Funding was obtained for a pilot project and suppliers were sought and interviewed. One was selected to develop the online application, and another to work on the mechanism of data transmission from renal units. Work began in June 2004, with a timetable to have results for patients from one or two pilot units online inside six months. A lot of effort was needed to work out how to do it, not only technically, but also to make sure that it was easy to use, sustainable in renal units, safe and secure, and to get approval to show patient data to patients in this way.
Alternative ways of giving electronic information to patients were in vogue at the time, including computer terminals in healthcare settings, and issuing a USB stick or CD with records on it. However in order to be scaleable and useful, it was felt that the solution must be Internet-based.
Because of concerns about confidentiality, only patients who signed up for the project were included. It was not easy to find out how to get approval for the project. There seemed to be many ways to get a ‘no’, but nobody empowered to say how this type of development could be done. After extensive discussions with individuals in senior positions in NHS IT in England and Scotland, and in NHS Connecting for Health, and Caldicott guardians, a way through was reached.
Security policies were established and further developed in response to feedback from patient and staff users as well as IT governance professionals. ‘Penetration tests’ to ensure system security were undertaken initially and regularly thereafter.
The initial content of the system was agreed in meetings between patient groups, clinicians, and renal IT specialists, to work out what would be most useful to patients, what was feasible technically, and what was likely to be practical and implementable. Kidney Research UK organised helpful additional focus groups with patients. At the same time, ways to match diagnostic and treatment codes to information sources were explored. Our information links policy was developed.
An early requirement was that implementation must require minimal extra input from staff in local units, which were and remain hard-pressed. Requiring extra staff time would threaten both implementation and sustainability.
However it was decided that management of users must be local, where the patients were known, and where responsibility lay for the data shown. It also simplified confirmation of identity of patients requesting access, and the same applied to adding staff users. As the information shown (results, letters etc) came from local systems, it was important that local units saw their responsibility for the data quality too. This devolved management also made the system scaleable and reduced the size of the central organisation needed to maintain it.
The project initiated as a pilot with a limited dataset and it was not clear what the best way to implement it would be, or how extensive the data shown would be. We therefore adopted an agile development model in which work was agreed and commissioned in small parcels, rather than as a fully described project.
Where difficult issues came up, it was decided to test a simple solution first rather than build in complexity from the outset. An example was the uncertain effect of releasing bad news or dangerous results (see below). We were unsure of the best way to manage this; pre-screening would have created significant issues for patients and staff (extra work, delay). So we piloted release without pre-screening. In practice it did not creat difficulties and this experience has been the same with wider implementation, so we have not needed to develop a technical solution.
On the other hand, it emerged that Transplant Status shown in local records could be wrong, and a way to show it directly from the central database at UK Transplant was desirable.
This fitted our agile commissioning model for the work with our web developer. It was very different from the model used for most IT projects at the time, which required detailed advance planning of final functionality. While this may seem to reduce risks, it can make it difficult or expensive to deviate from the prior plan.
It was realised that by using the NHS number as the primary identifier we could also aid the care of patients who attend more than one unit, including those who go to another centre to receive a renal transplant. PatientView forced use of the NHS number as the primary identifier, and aggregated data from anywhere that could send it to the same record.
The patient’s diagnosis was shown with links to information about the condition and its treatment, for both patients and for staff – explanations for patients; treatment guidelines and decision support for healthcare staff. Recent test results, particularly important to renal patients, are also shown.
Data transmission required local IT systems to construct a simple file type in a format that we developed (RPV-XML). No system for sending this type of data was generally accepted for use at the time. This format has been expanded but remains in use still at the time of transfer to PV2 in early 2015.
Focus groups and others had detailed discussions about releasing bad or dangerous results (e.g. very high potassium, or worsened kidney function) to patients without pre-screening by clinicians. Requiring all results to be pre-screened would add extra work for clinicians, and delay return of results to patients. Patients we spoke to said they didn’t want that, but some clinicians were anxious about the possible effects. Building in pre-screening would also have been much more complex technically and in local implementation.
In practice releasing live results has not created difficulties. This is an important area that we have researched further.
Funding for the pilot project in 2004 came from the Department of Health in England supported by proportional contributions from Scotland and Wales. This was intended to permit a pilot for 4-6 units. However in response to early feedback, RIXG agreed to an expansion of the scope of the scheme. Subject to availability of a small amount of local funding, the system was offered much more widely from mid-2005. Maintenance costs continue to be covered by a modest annual charge to participating units, except in Scotland where funding has come directly from the Scottish Government.
PatientView’s original steering group was Neil Turner, Keith Simpson (Adult Nephrologists), Kate Verrier-Jones (Paediatric Nephrologist), Cherry Bartlett (local IT system manager), Andrew Scott (Consultant to Department of Health) but it also drew on much external expertise from RIXG’s constituent groups.
Responsibility later passed to the Renal Association, where a small steering group continues to make operational decisions.

Acclaimed book designer Chip Kidd takes a playful look at the importance of first impressions — in design and in life — in his new book. In Judge This, Kidd argues that first impressions dictate whether something stands out, how we engage with it, whether we buy it, and how we feel. Kidd takes readers through his day as he encounters and engages with everyday design, breaking down the good, the bad, the absurd, and the brilliant. From the design of the morning paper to the subway ticket machine to books to smartphone to food packaging, Kidd uses photographs and insights to reveal the hidden secrets behind each of the design choices. He also introduces the Mysteri-o-meter, his personal judgement scale which illustrates his contention that much of design rests on a spectrum that ranges from clarity to mystery, and much of the book demonstrates how to use the tool to “judge this.” Kidd was a GDUSA Person To Watch and appeared on the cover of GDUSA January 2014.

Just a slight diversion before we jump back into the Jonah Hex books. Marvel Premiere was Marvel's answer to DC's Showcase, a series of one-shots to see what would work and what. In 1980 they produced this western, written by Peter B. Gillis, penciled by Gene Day, and inked by Tony DeZuniga. Here the, is the story of Caleb Hammer.
Our story starts in 1890, in Manacle, Wyoming. A young buck walks up to a man in a bar and calls him out. The young man draws and the man, Caleb Hammer, rushes him and knocks him clean out, tossing him into the street. The sheriff comes by, wanting to know what is going on. Hammer explains that he is with the Pinkertons and that he is looking for two men, Crawford McKie and Jake Lovelace.
They took part in the campaign to capture Geronimo but after that they took up bank robbery, murder, and other things. The sheriff explains that they did come through, but Manacle wasn't worth their time and they moved on, up in the valley. The sheriff offers Hammer a drink, but he declines and moving on.
In the morning, Hammer is riding into the valley when the youngster that he trounced the night before comes riding up, saying Hammer won't get away with treating him that way.
FLASHBACK: 1885. A Union soldier storms into a woman's bedroom, calling her Molly. The woman isn't Molly and the soldier shoots her dead, claiming that she cheated on him. A crowd gathers and Hammer is among them. He realizes that his wife has been killed and the soldier, drunk out of his mind, starts shouting that he had the wrong hotel room. Hammer had been training for the ministry and his faith has abandoned him.
Present day: The young gun demands his chance to have revenge. Hammer dismounts, picking up a fist-sized stone. The young gun jumps off his horse and draws on Hammer, who responds with throwing the stone into the young man's shoulder, breaking it. The man goes down and Hammer walks over, picks up his pistols and snaps the cylinders off and rides off.
Night falls and Hammer comes upon a ranch, having followed the outlaws trail. The cabin shows signs of a struggle and when he checks the barn, he snags his boot on a tripwire and the barn explodes, he manages to grab a colt and rescue it from the flames.
FLASHBACK: 1886, the McCormick Harvesting Machine factory in Chicago, Illinois. There is a union strike and as scabs try to cross the picket line a fight breaks out and six men are killed in the riot. One of them is Isaak Hammer, Caleb's younger brother. Caleb was visiting his brother to get over his wife's death, but once again his faith crushed him.
Present day: Hammer notices that there is a cabin on the cliff overlooking the ranch he just found. He spots a reflection from inside the cabin and realizes that his prey is up there, watching the burning barn.
Inside the cabin, Crawford and Jake are sure that 'the Pinkerton' is dead, but just in case, they still have the ranch family as hostages. Nora, the wife, has had enough and demands to be let go because Jimmy has 'got himself a sickness'. The crooks ignore her.
Outside the cabin, Hammer gets closer and realizes the cabin sits on The Devil's Anvil, a solid piece of rock outcropping that offers no cover whatsoever. Hammer realizes that the only weapon that he has is..... fear. He puts his hands near his mouth and start howling like a wolf.
In the cabin, Crawford gets a little spooked but the rancher explains that there are no wolves. It must be the Indian wolf-spirit whose lands they have defiled. Just then they look out the window and spot Hammer outlined against the full moon, his arms raised and draped in some cloth. Just as quickly he vanishes.
FLASHBACK: 1888, Montana. Hammer bursts into a cabin to bring in an outlaw and ends up shooting the man in the shoulder but a huge snowstorm moves in and they are snowed in for five months. Sadly, the shot man dies and when Hammer leaves the cabin he is a man completely devoid of any faith at all.
Present day: The rancher explains that the Devil's Anvil was an Indian holy place and the two crooks actually helped capture Geronimo. The Wolf-Spirit wants to punish them for that. Hammer pulls his ghost stunt once more and the crooks are getting more and more edgy, starting to believe the rancher.
Just then Jimmy falls to the floor in convulsions and one of the crooks takes that as evidence of the wolf-spirit trying to get into the cabin. He lets loose with a barrage of bullets, killing teh boy just as Hammer kicks in the door. He punches the crooks senseless as one of them starts screaming that it was the wolf-spirit that was trying to get them.
It is then that Caleb Hammer realizes that it was the fear that HE instilled in the crooks that led them to kill Jimmy. Hammer picks up the boy's body and takes him outside...to look at the stars.
Thirty four years ago I loved the heck outta this book. Re-reading it, Marvel was doing their spin on Jonah Hex with some slight twists (unscarred, not a bounty hunter). Caleb Hammer was a man whose life was full of tragedy but he didn't turn to booze and he didn't shoot to kill. He just turned his back on God and busted guns with his bare hands. Of course, Marvel got DeZuniga to do the inks so that it would even LOOK like a Jonah Hex book.
A lot of this artwork was muddy and in some places they had white letters on a black background, darn near unreadable on newsprint
I can understand why this never took off, the Western was pretty much dead at this point except for Jonah and he only had five years left as a Western himself. It would be fun for Justin and Jimmy to 'borrow' this character from Marvel and clash with Hex once he gets back to his own time.
Got this one a few years ago after reading about it in Back Issue Magazine. Great issue, and a shame they didn't do any more (though I hear-tell Caleb Hammer appeared in one of those "Blaze of Glory" specials).
"I have been awed and amazed by the amount of interesting material available on your Matching Dragoons website, and I want to congratulate you on your thoughtful, copious, excellent work." - Michael Fleisher
"For those who loved the DC comic book, the Matching Dragoons blog is your "one stop shop" for all things Hex. Enthusiastically written and with a great sense of humor, the blog also has a thorough recap of the entire comic series. Hexwise, it's the best site out there." - Jim Phelps at Film Score Monthly Forums
"This is an excellent site to catch up on your Jonah Hex for the movie next summer. It gives a summary (often very humorous) of nearly every Hex issue made, including running body counts, injury lists, and bounty conversions!" - Newton Grimius at Wild West Online: Gunfighter Forums
"Dwayne who runs this swell Jonah Hex weblog and I hope doesn't mind me encroaching on his territory a bit, here" - Mike Sterling at Mike Sterling's Progressive Ruin.
"Have you checked out this Jonah Hex site? I love it, especially the often-humorous take on the comics. It's clearly a labor of love for the blogger, who wasn't even born when DC Comics published Jonah Hex." - Nathan Dodge at the Fedora Lounge
"What I love about this blog are his regular features of comic book mail order ads from the '70s -- e.g., combat games with exploding pieces -- and the Weekly Wonderous Moment in Comics -- often featuring gorillas." - Batesline
"This one's for Dwayne, "the canoe guy," over at Matching Dragoons, certainly the blogosphere's number one site for Jonah Hex. If you have even a nodding familiarity with Jonah past, present, or future (I really liked Hex, honestly) then you need to be over there on a regular basis. He does more than just Hex coverage, but hell, that's enough!" - Random Happenstance
"For some fine on-going reviews and summaries of Jonah Hex' entire career, hitch up your cayuse and mosey on over to Matching Dragoons." - Lady, That's My Skull
"There's a blog that's entirely about Jonah Freakin' Hex, man! Why have you kept this from me? I thought we were friends." - Noetic Concordance
"but go visit Dwayne over at Matching Dragoons, for LOTS of pictures of Jonah with his shirt off." - Green Lanterns Butts FOREVER!
"Also, I mentioned Matching Dragoons once up top this entry, but I’ll plug it again as not just an outstanding Jonah Hex blog, but one which keeps a running total of Hex’s body count in all his stories and converts the bounty values into present day terms. That’s the kind of story-reading record-keeping that deserves a second plug. - The Comic Treadmill
"Need more Hex in your life? Check out Matching Dragoons, there's a guy there also writing about the various Hex books. I salute him, he's trying to figure out the historical time line, which is a mystery to me." - Ginger Mayerson at Sequential Tart

diffstat reads the output of diff and displays a histogram of the insertions, deletions, and modifications per-file. It is useful for reviewing large, complex patch files.
I originally wrote this in 1992, along with an associated utility rcshist, to trace the change history of collections of files. Since then, I've found it most useful for summarizing source patches.
Initially, I used diff and diffstat in a script named diff-patch. In 1994, I started using makepatch which gave more consistent results.
It was not until early 1996 that there was much attention by others to the tool. At that point, developers on both XFree86 and ncurses mailing lists started using it.
One of those developers (Tony Nugent) pointed it out to Linus Torvalds in July 1996, on linux.dev.kernel. Much later (in 2002), it was documented as part of the process for submitting Linux kernel patches for BitKeeper (BK) in Linux 2.4.20. Linus commented on the process:
Ok, pulled. But _please_ do this the regular way next time. There's even a script to help you do it in linux/Documentation/BK-usage/bk-mak-sum, which does it all for you for BK patches.
(many people end up doing their own thing, you don't have to use that particular script, of course. But the important thing I want is that the _email_ should contain enough information to make a good first pass judgement on what the patch does, and in particular it is important for me to see what a "bk pull" will actually change.)
That's why the "diffstat" is important to me if I do a BK pull – and why I want to see the patches as plaintext if I apply stuff to generic files..
Later, in 2005 Linus wrote git, which has the ability to generate a diffstat. There are some enhancements (git is able to track moves and renames of files).
Of course, I did not write diffstat as an isolated program. Rather, it provides a useful summary of the output of diff. That same output is typically processed by the patch program to apply changes to programs. Early on, this was the predominant method for distributing changes to programs. That was for two reasons:
For both of these reasons, I still provide diff's for the larger programs (in addition to complete sources):
Unix diff was not the first file-comparison program which I had encountered. Some of those were close enough that I thought I might extend diffstat to analyze those.
Unix diff programs on different systems gave different results. Some of these differences were later addressed by standardization; however diffstat has a few quirks to handle some of these variations.
While I used other systems (IBM, Univac) during the 1970s, the first where I recall a file-comparison program were the DEC systems where I developed (RT-11, TENEX or DEC System 10). The Utility Programs page by D A Duce is a useful summary for systems at the time—1976—noting (for DEC System 10):
According to manuals and other summaries, the PDP-10 program was named “filcom” while RT-11 had “srccom”:
PDP-10's filcom and RT-11's srccom marked chunks of difference with asterisks, but did not number lines. Rather, they showed page numbers, and also used numbers 1 and 2 to refer to the two files.
By the time I wrote diffstat in 1992, I had encountered examples such as this (from dead-systems) on VMS, showing line-numbers:
The file-comparison on VAX/VMS was named “differences” rather than “filcom” largely because it was a redesign, discarding old cruft. Some of that hides quirks: the VMS command interpreter stored only 4 characters to make a unique command. Because it also permitted abbreviations, anything beginning "diff" would run the "differences" command.
Like the Unix command, the VMS file-comparison utility was designed with the notion that its output could be used to apply changes via another tool such as ed. The VMS equivalent is sumslp (originally slp), which was probably inspired by the Univac slp processor.
The fc program on MS-DOS was influenced by filcom. Infoworld (February 14, 1979) had a short article:
Microsoft has announced the availability of Edit-80, a random access, line-oriented text editor for 8080 and Z-80 systems.
According to the company, Edit-80 features random line access to disk files, providing almost instantaneous access to any record of the file, even if the available memory is smaller than the file being edited.
In addition to the standard line commands to insert, delete, print or replace lines of text, the package offers such features as automatic line renumbering, global find and substitute, multiple page files and the ability to read files without line numbers. There is also an Alter Mode which allows editing portions of individual lines.
The edited files are not written to disk until a write command is given, and the original file is always saved as back-up.
The Edit-80 package includes a utility called Filcom, which compares source or binary files and outputs the differences between them. The editor runs on any 8080 or Z-80 system which uses the CP/M operating system. Price of the package is $120. The manual alone can be purchased for $10. Contact Microsoft, 819 Two Park Central Tower, Albuquerque, NM 87108.
The choice of name is not just a coincidence. Microsoft's 1980 catalog description shows the influence of DEC on their thinking:
EDIT-80 is a random access, line oriented text editor similar to those used on large computers like the DEC PDP-10 and IBM 360.
In MS-DOS, the program was renamed “fc” and is still provided in Windows. It supports Unicode now. Any of the other documented options could have been in the initial version in 1979.
I used superc in 1983 to develop a program which compared text at the word-level (rather than the line-level as diff does).
In 1988, I wrote a program to compare Interleaf documents, and produce a marked-up document with change-bars. That was about 5,000 lines of C, and used a crude algorithm (about as good as filcom).
In 1989, John Chludzinski and I wrote a diff-like program using the algorithm presented in A File Comparison Program, by Webb Miller and Eugene W. Myers published in Software: Practice and Experience, Vol 15 (11, 1025-1040 November 1985). GNU diff (written about the same time) also used this, according to its documentation. Our motivation for writing this was the same as GNU diff: to have an implementation free of the AT&T license. I later added a copy of that code to my utilities library as part of the work I did on rcshist.
Paul Heckel's paper A Technique for Isolating Differences Between Files (April 1978, CACM) described an algorithm which he stated he had used five years earlier. For comparison, Heckel cited filcom because it was a well-known implementation. He mentioned a few other algorithms in his paper (including Hunt and McIlroy An algorithm for differential file comparison, Computer Science Technical Report 41, Bell Telephone Labs, August 1976), but none had been used in a product such as filcom. Hunt and McIlroy's paper cited research results, described a prototype of diff and did not compare it with other implementations.
My interest here, is of course, on the output format used rather than nuances of the particular algorithm underneath. The original diff paper gave an example of its output which hints at the description in the Unix V6 manual page for diff:
The 3BSD source-code for /usr/src/cmd/diff.c (dated 1979, corresponding to Unix V7's diff) shows them used as “< ” and “> ” markers in the change() function. Although the manual page at that point mentioned the brackets, it did not mention the space which the program added after the brackets:
That is the oldest version of diff for which I found source code (in the CSRG cd-images from myrnet.com). The comments in the code attributed the algorithm used to Harold Stone, and used backspace-sequences to underline keywords, e.g.,
The only attribution in the code was for Harold Stone; the backspace-sequences were removed. Jonathan Gray has a Git repository of CSRG sources. For what it's worth, the initial check-in was by Bill Joy, but that source already implemented context diff (there is no useful source-history to determine who did what).
That posting appeared in volume 14, issue 70 (Davison apparently submitted this on August 22, the posting appeared early August 31, and it was archived September 6, 1990). From his announcement:
A motivation was to reduce the size of patches (the output of diff as used in the usenet source groups to distribute changes to a program.
Although few used “unidiff” as such, Davison's patches for GNU diff and Larry Wall's patch program were used:
There were earlier programs named “patch” (for example, DEC's binary-patch program which I used with RT-11 in the mid-1970s). Here we are only concerned with the source-patching program starting with Larry Wall's version in the mid-1980s. He announced more than one version to net.sources:
The patches do not appear in the mod.sources or net.sources archives; I have established dates for those as I did for the other sources (by inspection), and reconstructed the different fully-patched versions. Two of the patches (7 and 12) do not apply cleanly:
Besides being used in the usenet sources groups, Larry Wall's program was distributed as part of X11. The file sizes and dates indicate that there were ongoing improvements (data gleaned from the X distribution tarballs):
Because Larry Wall made no changes to patch after releasing patch 12 to version 2.0, David J. MacKenzie (who worked on GNU diff and patch) incorporated Davison's patch, and worked with Davison to make a followup fix:
Most of the changes (86%) listed in the X11R6 ChangeLog file for patch were from David J. MacKenzie. Wayne Davison's initial set of changes accounts for about 15 percent of that (177 lines added, 8 lines removed). At the same time, MacKenzie was the main developer working on GNU patch: 68% versus Paul Eggert with 26%. As MacKenzie noted in the README file for patch 2.1 (released June 11, 1993):
I distinguish contributors versus authors based on a 20% threshold. By this rule, patch had two authors: Larry Wall and David J. MacKenzie.
Here is a summary of changes made between Larry Wall's 2.0.12 (version 2.0 with patches 1-12 applied) and the updated version using MacKenzie's work:
The X11R6 version is (except for a small change by Steve Gildea) identical to 2.0.12u9 by MacKenzie and Eggert. I found the corresponding patches and tarballs here:
Before releasing GNU patch 2.1, David MacKenzie provided patches for the non-GNU version of patch. From the timeline, it appears that patch12u8 and patch12u9 reflected a change in direction, or finishing, since the GNU patch changelog does not not mention these, calling them patch12g8 and patch12g9.
Most of Eggert's changes past patch12u8 dealt with configuration (using the autoconf-generated script and adjusting the makefile). The README in these tarballs provides an explanation which is omitted in the 2.1 release:
diff 1.15, grep/egrep 1.5, fgrep 1.1, and patch 2.0.12u5 The diff and [ef]grep programs are GNU's versions of the Unix programs of the same name. They are much faster than their traditional Unix versions. patch is Larry Wall's program to take diff's output and apply those differences to an original file to generate the patched version.
diff 1.15, grep/egrep 1.5, fgrep 1.1, and patch 2.0.12u6 The diff and [ef]grep programs are GNU's versions of the Unix programs of the same name. They are much faster than the traditional Unix versions. patch is Larry Wall's program to take diff's output and apply those differences to an original file to generate the patched version.
patch 2.0.12g8 patch is our version of Larry Wall's program to take diff's output and apply those differences to an original file to generate the modified version.
The feature is useful; the name (and the lack of a short option) are problematic. Calling it -n would have been preferable, like the make program. However, Larry Wall's original program provided options for overrriding the patch program's detection of the type of patch: -c, -e and -n for context, ed-script and normal diffs, respectively.
In writing this investigation, I am reminded that Pohl-Henning Kamp added a -C (--check) option to FreeBSD's patch program in mid-1993. However, GNU patch is used in many more places than FreeBSD's patch program.
This did not happen all at once, though Eggert spent a couple of years working on patch. My note in the ncurses FAQ indicates that the initial changes worsened the behavior. But finally, I saw that 2.5.4 in 1999 was an improvement over all of the preceding versions.
My experience here is illustrated by my reply to a user who was having trouble applying a set of diffs with NetBSD's patch program:
Regarding Solaris, I see that Solaris 9 provided unified diffs. At that point in time, I was still using Solaris 8.
According to the change-log, this was done in 1993—after release 2.1. The next release (2.2) was in 1997. The Git repository has no detailed information going back that far.
However, my updates for the ncurses FAQ show that I modified the scheme for doing rollup patches early in 1998 to work around line-length problems with patch 2.1, by putting "wide" files into a tar-file and applying patches as such only to files whose lines were no longer than 1024 characters. At the time, I noted that I tested the rollup patches with versions 2.1 and 2.5 (and found that the interim versions were not suitable).
In later releases, I dropped the too-wide files (generated HTML in the Ada95 tree), and that problem became moot.
A few years later, in 2002, a user reported on the bug-ncurses mailing list that patch had dumped core while applying one of my patches. Paul Eggert sent mail pointing to a newer release without that problem. On the whole, however, bug reports implicating GNU patch are rare.
Later versions added other improvments, but 2.5.4 is “good enough.” Here is a summary of change between patch-2.0.12g11 and patch-2.5.4, ignoring the generated configure script and its utilities config.guess, config.sub:
Given all of that background, you can see that while the X11R6 patch utility is the non-copylefted GNU patch referred to in the README file, the GNU developers continued to improve the copylefted version, leaving the X11R6 version behind.
GNU patch has more of an impact on developers than the corresponding diff utility, because the patch program is expected to handle the output of diff no matter where it came from.
The BSD patch recognizes many of the GNU patch long options, although starting from patch12u8, because the corresponding patch12g8 supported long options (predating any modern BSD). Linux-based systems such as Debian as well as the BSD-derived OSX simply provide GNU patch.
In the FreeBSD release 10 series, a different version of the patch program was copied early in 2013 from DragonFly,
Initially, FreeBSD could install either one as /usr/bin/patch; the other would be renamed to gnupatch or bsdpatch, respectively.
However, the copied program did not provide these options: -I, -index-first (modified by FreeBSD), -S, and -skip.
The legacy Unix systems were slower to adopt patch at all, much less the improved version. For instance, Sun did not provide patch in SunOS 4, nor in Solaris 2.4, but only in the later Solaris releases starting around 1995. HP provided patch in HPUX 10.10 (February 1996).
The manual pages for AIX, HPUX and IRIX64 were adapted from Larry Wall's manual page from 2.0 patch 12 (2.0.12). The manual page for Solaris 5 has more substantial changes, by omitting the description of -s, -S and -x. It also shows a -i option (perhaps 2-3 lines of source code, using freopen and checking for error), which also is in SUSV2. Because OpenSolaris did not include Sun's version of the patch utility, it is only possible to gauge influence by comparing documentation (whether Sun's patch is a reimplementation or direct reuse is unknown).
After (sometimes lengthy) discussion, changes are submitted for review based largely upon existing practice. Sometimes the changes are limited to making the descriptions more precise, or providing explanations for the inclusion (or exclusion) of features. Compare the 1997 and 2004 descriptions to see how this applies to them.
Occasionally, new(er) features are added. Toward that end, Paul Eggert reported the omission of unified diff from the standard as a defect in June 2006 on the Austin review mailing list, proposing the changes to make to the document to rectify the problem. The original documentation for unified diff by Davison lacked sufficient detail to be useful; e.g., this:
Eggert supplied the details. Eggert also reported problems in the document relating to empty files, special files, symbolic links (which are not of direct interest to me).
I have been a subscriber to the Austin Group mailing lists (review and general discussion) since June 3, 1999, and when I find the topic interesting, keep a copy.
There does not appear to be a usable mail-archive for the lists; I rely upon my mail-archives when discussing the Austin Group lists. However, some of the working notes are visible, e.g., these from October 2006. The Austin Group board finally adopted unified diff and the matching option in early 2007, for changes in Issue 7, using Eggert's proposed changes. You can read the rationale for diff:
The -u and -U options of GNU diff have been included. Their output format, designed by Wayne Davison, takes up less space than -c and -C format, and in many cases is easier to read. The format's timestamps do not vary by locale, so LC_TIME does not affect it. The format's line numbers are rendered with the %1d format, not %d , because the file format notation rules would allow extra <blank> characters to appear around the numbers.
The patch utility is moved from the User Portability Utilities option to the Base. User Portability Utilities is now an option for interactive utilities.
Although the pace of standardization may seem slow (innovation in 1991, widespread use over the next ten years, proposal for standardization in 2006, approval in 2007, and publication in 2013), you have to remember who pays the bills: manufacturers of turnkey computer systems and systems integrators who are reluctant to have differences among these manufactured systems. New features are most readily accepted if all agree that adding (and documenting them) is trivial, e.g, the -i option added to patch in SUSv2.
To get new features, some manufacturers acknowledge that their users may choose to install programs which the manufacturers did not provide. For instance, in the comp.unix.solaris newsgroup thread in Which shell? (December 2005: alternate link), one of Sun's developers commented that
Schilling copied 12u5 (calling it 12u10, implying that it is the successor to 12u9), rather than the last implementation from Larry Wall. That ignores a year's work by MacKenzie and others.
The term “fork” might be applicable if there had been an alternative line of development. There was none. GNU initiated the development of both BSD and “GNU” patch programs.
Whether it "tries to be closer to the POSIX standard" is misleading, and unsubstantiated. The statement bears more on the vendors who have been certified (with versions derived from 2.0.12, the last implementation from Larry Wall), rather than at GNU patch,
introduced the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable, adding checks for this as well as whether the program was run as “opatch” to decide what options are permitted.
changed a few variables from long to off_t. This affected 10 lines of code, and is the "large file support" which he cited in the manual page as his specific contribution:
changed three functions in util.c (and calls to those functions) ostensibly to use stdarg, but actually as part of a larger change of the #include's to make the program rely upon his library rather than standard C.
Here is an amended diffstat ignoring (most of) the whitespace changes, as well as the removed files:
Thereafter, Schilling copied selected features from GNU patch. However, he has not noticed all of the fixes which apply to his version. The next version, 12u6, included a bug-fix for fetchname which is still not present in any of Schilling's updates as of March 2017:
Ubuntu #209537 introduced a misfeature. Briefly, it checks if a COLUMNS environment variable is set, and uses whatever value atoi decodes to override the default of 80 columns for the report width. My advice was overruled (the bug report offers a disingenuous reason—see this for the context in which the remarks were made).
The change is redundant (the "-w option already provides the desired functionality). Assuming that COLUMNS were set reliably to a useful value, one could do
The patch hardcodes STDOUT as a variable in the main function, rather than using STDOUT_FILENO (POSIX).
The COLUMNS and LINES environment variables are set by only a few applications (resize being one), and bash being another. A third does not come to mind (certainly not another shell).
The resize program's environment variables are generally discarded (not applied to the shell); it is useful for making system calls to tell the the computer the actual size of the terminal window. On the other hand, bash does set the variables.
In some configurations (Debian), bash sets a shell variable (which is not exported to subprocesses). In others (apparently the case with OpenSuSE), bash exports environment variables. This is without the complication of scripts which do an export of the shell variables.
Some programs use these variables. In ncurses for instance, this is a standard legacy feature, useful for cases where the operating system cannot provide the required information (see use_env, compare with use_tioctl). Otherwise it is a nuisance because it interferes with programs that are able to obtain the screensize without this crutch (xterm sets the variable only on a few very old platforms for this reason). A few other programs which do not use ncurses (such as ps as noted in Novell #793536) can be overridden by COLUMNS.
This behavior of bash's has been seen as a nuisance, e.g., Novell #828877, along with these threads from bug-bash in 2013-01, 2013-07. After reading several reports, e.g., ArchLinux #32821, Debian #628638 (and blogs), a common thread emerges: bash has tied two behaviors together:
As long as the two behaviors (making bash work properly, and telling applications to use that information) are tied together, the feature is going to be a nuisance.
Because there is no relevant standard (for the behavior of shell programs), users with scripts which happen to set the variable would be impacted. Debian for instance switched from bash to dash years ago. The latter does nothing with COLUMNS, so that scripts which work properly with dash would behave differently on a machine where bash was preferred.
The change was applied to the Debian package two years later, without discussion immediately after a change of package maintainers, (see Debian #588876). A user pointed out part of the problem with the change in Debian #697696, but made no headway with yet another maintainer.
I changed the copyright notice of diffstat to use MIT-X11 licensing at the beginning of 1998 (version 1.26). Before that, I had used the same wording as I did in other works distributed from 1994 onward, e.g., the resizeterm patch. The reason for this change was likely prompted by my work to relicense ncurses, but also taking into account an old (October 1996) discussion with Joey Hess.
The license is (of course) given in full as a comment at the top of the files which comprise the program. Nothwithstanding this, some packagers find it inconvenient to cite the license properly. Here are a few examples:
A bug report for Haiku in 2010 commented that the packager had trouble finding the license, and referred to it as “DEC”, apparently unfamiliar with MIT-X11. A followup patch for the package script referred to it as the “diffstat” license.
Some packagers get closer. OpenPkg labels diffstat as “MIT-style” which sounds better than “DEC” except for raising the question of what reference text they use.
On the other hand, OpenPkg labels luit (also MIT-X11) as GPL. I notified them about that (having seen the 20130217 package), as well as misattribution in their pdcurses package in February 2014 without receiving a response.
That is analogous to a pet-shop owner who puts a sign saying “dog-like” in front of a feline. Some people might object.
Possibly related, Mageia did this with diffstat 1.57 as of 2014. I notified them in February 2014, received no response. Finally, in July 2015, a different developer reported that the problem was addressed with diffstat 1.60 (on updating this page July 26, 2015, the released-packages page still shows 1.59 with “GPL-like” — the correction shows up in the "cauldron" page).
As of May, 2014, I found no package labeling diffstat as “GPL” (there have been instances which have been resolved).
A few tools extend one or more of the version control systems, enabling their diffstat features to be used via the tool:
The Caterplate®is made from 100% recyclable polystyrene (PS). The innovative all-in-one design is ideal for all catering needs. A clear 'snap on' lid is also available making it ideal for stacking and presentation.
The ‘Ripple Wrap’ food container’s innovative design provides excellent insulation ensuring hand comfort. Also available is the vented plastic lid which is made from Polystyrene and designed to fit all 3 ‘Ripple Wrap’ food containers.
Major rainstorms with wind are predicted for Oregon. It was supposed to start tonight. Guess what? The rain and wind kicked up on our way south to The Oregon Garden in Silverton. As we drove south from Tigard, the rain decreased. By the time we got to the garden, we had wind and a few sprinkles. That was about to change.
We used my Groupon for half-price admission for four people ($22) which was pretty good. As soon as our hands were stamped to prove we paid, the docent in the visitor center said, "A tram should be arriving right about now." The 25-minute tram tour is included in the admission.
Sure enough, as soon as we walked out to the tram stop, a tram arrived. The tram is open air, but has plastic "windows" that can be rolled down to provide protection from wind and rain. Mom and Jan rolled their windows down, but I wanted to take photos and so did the lady next to me. We left our window up. There wasn't any rain, but the wind was chilly.
The garden is 120 acres, 80 acres are developed. Water for the garden is provided by twice-filtered water reclaimed from the sewage treatment plant. In order to meet water-quality standards, the water has to be cooled as it is too warm as it comes from the treatment plant. The first area the tram took us through was the wetlands. A number of ponds were created so the water could flow from pond to pond, thus cooling it.
The large tree on the left in the photo below is a protected signature oak, one of the oldest on earth.
The trees in the following photo are poplars. These are planted as a crop and can grow eight feet in one year. Their bark is ground up, mixed with water and used to create pressboard, cardboard and high-quality paper. This is a great renewable resource.
A few weeks ago, the tree below was hit by lightning. The garden is leaving it as it is to show the power and destructive force of Mother Nature.
Our tram driver spent quite a bit of time talking about the Oregon Garden Resort next to The Oregon Garden. All stays include free admission to The Oregon Garden and you can walk from the resort, through a gate, and be at a tram stop or on a trail to take you into the garden.
We finished our tram tour, then walked through part of the garden. As we were walking up to the reflecting pools, I started to have a vertigo attack and became very dizzy. My sister had me sit down on the rock wall that goes around the reflecting pool. I closed my eyes and stayed very still for a couple of minutes. Luckily the episode passed and we continued on.
It was lunch time, so we walked up the path to The Oregon Garden Resort to have lunch in their dining room. (Most lunches are under $10.) What a lovely place to have lunch. The view overlooks the gardens and the Willamette Valley. Today was not the best day to enjoy the view because the rains came while we were eating. The clouds lowered giving limited views.
In October, The Oregon Garden is having an event called "Scarecrows in the Garden." The resort is getting in on the fun and created these two lovely scarecrows.
After our healthy lunch, we headed out to wait for the tram to take us back to the visitor center. Picture if you will, strong, gusty winds and driving rain. We have ten minutes to wait for the tram in the gazebo. The gazebo has no walls. Mom and Jan went up to the covered patio to wait. Mike and I kept an eye out for the tram from the gazebo. Brr. Four chilled people boarded the tram. Thankfully, all the "windows" were rolled down and zipped up. So ended our day at The Oregon Garden.
Back at Mom's by early afternoon, we decided to watch a DVD called "Evening" that we had checked out from the library. The cover description sounded pretty good with an all-star cast: Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Toni Collette, Claire Danes, Hugh Dancy, and Glenn Close. It's supposed to be about the power of the past and the unbreakable bonds between mothers and daughters, family, and the loves of their lives. Our recommendation: don't bother. We didn't finish watching it. About half-way through Mom and Jan stopped watching to finish dinner preparations. It was a weird, boring movie.
For dinner we had dark turkey meat that had been in the slow cooker all day, broccoli, mashed yams, and cranberry sauce. Such a good meal for a cold, wet day. For dessert, Mom made peach crisp from peaches we bought in the orchard yesterday.
Jan took off after dinner to go to a singles social at church. Mike, Mom and I played Rummikub. Mike headed home about 8 p.m. At 9 p.m., Mom and I watched Shark Tank, which we absolutely love.
In all the driving we've been doing the past couple of days, we have seen many RVs out and about...many heading south, but some probably heading out for the start of hunting season. I'm thinking they've been hearing the weather forecast and decided to skedaddle out of here.
Plans for us to go to the coast tomorrow are off. Weather maps are showing red, there are weather alerts on TV about heavy rain, with wind gusts up to 60 mph, and possible flooding. No way do I want to drive two hours out and two hours back in that kind of weather.
Dalan and I have been dating for 5 years and married on June 11th 2010 it was the happiest day of our lives. This blog that I finally started is about US, and our life together
So for our one year anniversary me and dalan got to adventure to beautiful HAWAII!!! Thanks to my sister. My mom and dad had lived on Oahu for a couple of years and all through my childhood I heard stories of how beautiful it was and warm and friendly. Never thinking I would some day go there with my husband. It was really nice to, since we paid for our wedding by ourselves and we were really low on funds for an actual honeymoon when the time came so dalans grandparents let us use there time share to venture down to vegas, I had been there before but dalan hadn't, dont get me wrong it was nice just for the fact that it was our honeymoon, BUT dalan got sick, my flow came to town, so really there was not very much Bow Chika Bow Wow (Which there is supposed to be tons of on your honeymoon) which was pretty lame,
so when the time came for our one year dalan and I decided that we wanted something a little better......ALOT better. SO we flew into Oahu at 11:00 AM there time leaving utah @ four in the morning so we were pretty bushed the whole plane ride but the minute our wheels landed on Hawaii's soil we were wide awake. We experienced the polynesian cultural center, went horseback riding, snorkeled with turtles, saw spinner dophins, parsailed, went to pearl harbor, & experienced a flash flood to name a few things :) IT WAS AMAZING needless to say . So even though we still didn't get much Bow chika bow wow this time either (Thanks flow) It was the best trip I have ever had and it was amazing to experience it with my best friend. So without futher adeiu here are some hawaii pictures :) ENJOY
Dalan is currently attending school to obtain his bachelors degree in environmental engineering, I couldn't be more proud of him, he is really doing a big thing for us. I love him so much.
I'm currently on etsy and trying to start a buisness slowly but surely, I would love to own my own boutique of some sorts one day, my main goal though is to become a mommy :) but that is still a ways out so I'm biding my time.
In the meanwhile in October of 2010 we got a puppy!!!! :) her name is Sophie and she is enough of a handful for us for now we love her to pieces.
SO I have updated pictures of me and dalan now, and of our cute puppy sohpie, I promise I'm going to get better at this blogging thing and try to write more often....lol
Ok people Im the worst person at this blog thing I have no Idea how to keep things going so Im not going months without posting bloggy stuff so for all you readers out there.....if there are any left, please send me a message via facebook or text and HELP ME
It was everything I dreamed of. Pictures are coming soon I promise, I haven't even seen them so I'm just as anxious, I haven't wrote in a while because I'm still adjusting to being a wife I guess we have our own place, our own little family. I couldn't be happier, now we just have minor events to move forward with. Such as Dalan going to school for a bachelors in buisness and me possibly looking into opening my own bridal shop..... I haven't decided what I want to do. I mainly want to be a mama, but that isn't going to happen for a while so I need something to bide my time with.
Not much left to do and it still feels like its still so FAR away, I know what your thinking, in reality its not. But still, we just have a couple of loose ends to tie up I have one more flower girl dress to get, we send out the invitations April 30th my birthday :) and my bridals then next day HAPPY BIRTHDAY to me hahaha. I will post the bridal pictures asap when I get them back. My two little flower girls are THE CUTEST in the world both named Chloe & Khloe one is my cousins cute girl the other is my bridesmaid's daughter there dresses are purple & green.
Dalan is working for a law firm as a credit counsler, and I have recently obtained a job at an Endodontic office and its great!!! But I just work part time and I also work part time at a pediatric office. Were still waiting on the big day to get closer and finishing up on final touches. 78 Days and counting
My Bridesmaids, My MOH (maid of honor) is my little sister Chelsea who has had a VERY hard year and has over come the odds, regardless of how much of a little snot she is, I still love her. Second in command LOL is my Best friend Karina and last the best of all the game is my old childhood friend who was also my best friend Rachel. I met Karina in Junior High and have been good friend since, we have recently become closer since working at the law firm together and the fact that she lives five minutes from my house :)
Rachel used to be my next door neighbor she has a little sister named Ruth so me and my sister were best friends with them for the LOOONGGEESSTT Time then they moved away :( and just this past year I found Rachel on facebook and we have exchanged numbers and updated eachother only a little bit on eachothers lives, she is married and has a cute baby girl. So when I needed another bridesmaid she came to my Aid and I am so excited to get together with her again this wedding is going to be awesome!!!!
Well as the title says 109 days till I marry the love of my life, its still not getting her fast enough I feel just like I felt when he first proposed.

BugGuide.net: "Adults are slightly elongated in shape, from 4-7 mm in length. Prominent black and white pattern behind the head, and black spots on red forewings. They may have a full complement of 13 spots or only a few. The white lines that converge behind the head are common to all individuals"
H. convergens adults are flatter and more elongate than other Bay Area lady beetles. The pronotum is black with white borders on the forward and lateral margins and always bears a pair of white, longitudinal lines that converge posteriorly. Elytra are red to pale orange with a shortened white border where the elytra attach. Typically, there are 13 black spots, but spots may be merged or absent. The head is black with a transverse white stripe. Legs are black. Antennae are pale brown with a dark brown club.
Both larval and adult stages prey on aphids and other soft bodied insects on plants. They will sometimes consume pollen. If no other prey is present they may cannibalize other eggs and larvae. Their first meal is the egg shell, then sometimes an unhatched egg or larval sibling. They can adjust their life cycle according to the availability of aphids.
H. covergens is found wherever aphids are present, in meadows, fields, agricultural crops, gardens, parks, and forests. They are frequently found in "ladybird wash-ups" on the beach and sometimes cluster in pinecones and log piles throughout the state.
H. convergens is used commercially for biological control in gardens and agriculture. They are effective predators in both adult and larval stages.
Adults overwinter in masses in areas protected by trees or other land features. Females lay clusters of small, pale yellow, football-shaped eggs. Eggs are affixed where there are abundant aphids, but also on other substrates. Eggs hatch in about a week. Emerging larvae resemble tiny alligators. They consume their egg shells, then start to consume aphids. There are four instars. Mature larvae anchor to plants or other substrates, and flex if disturbed. Pupation lasts from a few days to more than a week. Eclosing adults are very pale with no visible markings, and darken over a few hours.
The Guzzle Buddy was created by a Jennifer Sullivan and Randy Rothfus, a sister and brother-in-law in the Medford, Oregon. They both loved drinking wine and had joked around about creating a more "efficient" way to drink wine straight from the bottle without getting "those looks" of judgement! Then one day Jennifer saw an old sit com episode where they were drinking wine from a glass attached to the top of a wine bottle. Thus they created the Guzzle Buddy: It turns your bottle into your glass!

Here's one of my favorite projects. Claude Hurd, lead animator, did all the animation. I did the lighting, comping and effects. Written by Noah Eichen and voiced by Andrew Volpe.
I loved working on this project. The first 2 images were tests I did to get the client on board for the job. The last images are taken from the commercial. I had a lot of fun learning about materials.
I'm rummaging through old work that has outlived it's NDA ;D This is a frame where I was experimenting with materials, lighting and mood. A cool experiment I found here was a "curvature pass." A curvature pass is a render element in Vray. If you look in the cracks between the lips and also the eyes you'll see the color turns brown. The brown comes from the curvature pass. It's similar to an ambient occlusion pass except it's sharper and really finds any area that has a recess. It's a great way to add an extra layer of depth to a material like marble.
The above image is a front and side view of a warthog warrior. Leon, the 3D modeler, will take this plan and build a model of it in Maya 3D software. The small yellow dots and orange lines represent joints and bones. Jeff, the trigger, will place joints and bones inside of Leon's model so the character can move. The warrior will move on to the animators desk where he will be brought to life.
In the meantime I'll draw some armor. Leon will take the armor drawings into Maya and the process continues... :)

I find it difficult to understand a simple shape for the pelvis. Like, I get "it". I can describe it as this bowl shape that muscles/tendons attach to, but it's abstract for me.

Throughout the series the producers used stylized visual sequences to illustrate Sam's intuitive leaps. Because the show debuted at the same time as the similarly themed Millennium (1996), which stared a profiler with actual psychic abilities illustrated with similar stylized segments, many assumed that Sam was supposed to be psychic. In reality the flashes were never supposed to be psychic. Instead they were supposed to illustrate Sam's thought process as she made intuitive leaps. See more »
The actor Dennis Christopher, who plays "Jack", is never credited as Dennis Christopher, the credits just say "and jack". This is because the identity of Jack is a secret (for the characters in the series, they don't know who he is), his identity is unmasked in the first two episodes of the 4th season, from this moment he is credited as "dennis christopher as jack" in the credits. (There are two episodes, where he is credited in his role as "Albert Newquay", in fact, "Albert Newquay" is "Jack", also revealed in the meantioned episodes). See more »
I started tuning into this show when Samantha (Ally Walker) was still the lead and pretty soon I was hooked. I think it was great. The stories were always interesting, because always there was some new psycho with a different reason and a different twist than the last one. Also there was the whole Jack-of-all-trades- background which gave Samantha and the whole series an immense driving force. After Samantha left the VCTF in came a new profiler, called Rachel (Jamie Luner), who is actually the reason why I'm writing this, for changing lead's often result in a lessening of the quality of a series. First I want to say that Rachel is kind of the same as Samantha because she has the sixth sense. But she brings a whole other character on the tube which I had to start to like and eventually I did, although she can never replace Ally Walker whom I still find much better on screen, plus I liked Walker's character much better. Soon after the replacement of Walker the creators or the writers must have felt what I felt while watching, that without Samantha and Jack-of-all-trades a huge driving force was gone and so they created a new one, ex detective Joel Marks, I don't know about other people, but I like the way they inserted him into the continuous part of the show.
As for the others, they are still great, they were great with Sam and now are on Rachel's side. You have the sarcastic forensic Grace (Roma Maffia) the friendly, in-control and always know what to do Bailey (Robert Davi) and George (Peter Frechette) and of course John (Julian McMahon). Those two last ones are actually the only persons who have really changed on the tube since Samantha lived. I always found that George and Samantha were very good together and I miss that and now she's gone we have a lot more of McMahon with Luner. Not that McMahon and Walker were bad together, but George has been pushed into the background a bit, I feel. Still a good show though, because it still is intelligent and original, because as a viewer you always tend to try a bit of profiling yourself.

You've probably heard a lot of opposing information about Investing in Real Estate, which is completely annoying! The straight-forward fact about Real Estate is that it is probably the best and safest investment you'll ever make, especially if you live in it, and that you are far more likely to make money in this market than with any other type of investing. The chances are very slim that you'll wake up one morning and the housing market will have dropped by 40%.
Real Estate is a multi-faceted investment arena - there are MANY different methods to earn money from different niches in real estate. One or several may work for YOU!Here's the typical experience: "buy your own residence and sell it when its all paid off and you want to retire, oh my gosh look at all the money its worth".
Hello, Please I would like my question to be answered soon as I am so scared to death. I was with this new girl 2 weeks ago now. We had protected sex with my condom properly worn. The light was off, and after I removed the condom also properly, I jerked myself off to cum. I switched on the light and realized she had a tear, and I was stained with her blood on my groin. The stain has occured I removed the condom, which means I had masturbated with the blood. Please can I get infected wth hiv through this if she is positive, cos she didnt know her status. Please answer, I'm so scared to dealth right now..Thanks.
Couple of days before i went to a massage parlor. while giving massage, the girl put my dick in her mouth and sucked it. the processed lasted for not more than a minute.i didn't ejaculate in her mouth.After clean up,i asked her if she had any oral injury or so. The girl has had a tooth implanted 2 months before. does that pose me at any kind risk for contracting HIV. Little worried about it. I am just assuming that she might have bled while giving me Oral. Request a prompt reply. Thanks.
75 days ago, I met a ladyboy at a guesthouse. First, I pressed her breasts and nipples and I also sucked and licked her breasts and nipples. Second, I kissed her abdomen. Third, I rubbed my bare penis against her breasts and nipples. Last, I had rubbed my penis against her penis for 10 minutes ( note: while I was rubbing my penis against her penis, I was wearing my shorts and my underpants and she was wearing her panties only), and I noted that during this rubbing, her penis was not erect and I did not see any fluids on my shorts. And, she and I did not ejaculate .
1 Can I be infected with HIV from my pressing her breasts and nipples and my sucking and licking her breasts and nipples?
3 Can I be infected with HIV from my rubbing my bare penis against her breasts and nipples because my penis's tip touched her breasts and nipples?
4 Can I be infected with HIV from my rubbing my penis against her penis, which is mentioned in the last activity? One more thing, if she leaked her pre-cum and/or semen on my shorts that I could not see, can I be infected with HIV because after this encounter I still wore my shorts to sleep for one night without my underpants?
Please answer my questions soon because I am really worried about this so much, and thank you for your helps.
One week before i sex with a prostitute and on her dress i got a wound(1 cm) in my finger. Next morning while bathing only i have noticed the wound and i did fingering also (some seconds). Is that any chance for hiv ?now(after six days) i am feeling light fever and light throat pain. When i can take the hiv test, please help me on this i am really scared.
A week ago, I had a protected blow job form a hooker. I inserted my penis in her mouth and came twice inside the condom. I would change the condom each time. However, she was licking my balls which were not covered by condom. I had no cuts or wounds on them.
I also deep kissed her for minutes. I did not noticed any blood or wound in her mouth,,or even my mouth.
i recently witnessed the one of the most regretful moment in my life.i went to a massage parlour on 8 july (due to peer pressure) , had a body to body massage where she applied some sort of cream on my penis and started rubbing her upper part of body and stomach.I was tensed and ejacuated within minutes. i was terrified from that very moment whether my penis had brushed or rubbed her vagina or maybe penetrated her (i'm still a virgin so i have no idea how does it feel to be inside) , on 11th july i started experiencing hot body but not more than 99.4 f , night sweats ,white tongue and mostly it remained normal.i was in anxiety from that very moment , on 13th july i had a hiv test which came back negative (i wasn't aware of window period).i checked myself to a local med , he told me i having a minor viral and prescribed me medicines on 15th july. Fever(reoccuring) subsided till 18th but i had fatigue and body aches till 23 0r 24 (maybe side effects of meds) .But still anxiety was not letting me sleep , i visited the parlour again and ask her about her status she told me its no risk and was wearing a brief(but i dont remember that).i requested her to show me her past hiv report , next day she showed it to me it was 3 months old and negative. on 25 july i was completely feeling normal till i read about swollen glands and started checking on them , i didn't notice them initially but i guess after rigorous checking i guess i irritated two nodes , in my neck and other between neck and shoulder and now i can feel them they are elastic and does not cause pain(the only symptom i'm facing) .Anxiety is killing me that how the hell can i have hiv . please suggest me if i m at risk or are these ARS symptoms.i know its foolish but i m panicking like hell please help me with your valuable expertise.
Another thing happened on 5th july when barber was shaving me via blade behind my neck , he kind of cut him on finger , he noticed it for 5 or 6 secs and continued . i didn'nt paid much attention to it and after 3 days massage parlour thing happened.I'am just thinking of all the possible scenarios
4 weeks later admitted to hospital with fever and pneumonia (No rash or lymphadenopathy) - worried about ARS.
The thing is, I had my first sexual encounter a while ago. It consisted of unprotected oral sex (I was on the receiving end) a few times about a month ago, all encounters with the same person. During those times I also received a rimjob (also unprotected) and mutual masturbation that involved contact between my penis and the other guy's, there was a lot of contact with pre-cum, none of us got to ejaculate during the act, I know mutual masturbation isn't considered a risky activity but... I wonder, is there any risk of HIV (or any other STI) from the contact of body fluids such as pre-cum or semen with the opening of the urethra??
I'm mostly worried about the HIV risk of these activities. I've read that they are low risk activities, however, should I consider being tested for HIV? Or am I just overreacting?
I had protected oral sex from a CSW couple of weeks back. I wore condom throughout the act. She perform oral sex on me twice each time with different condom. Also, during the act I fingered her vagina but I didn't had any cuts or sores or any thing. I am worried about HIV and considering the nature of this whole incident do you think I need to get tested?

Everyone’s smashing statues. From Islamic State hotheads sledgehammering ancient artefacts in old Mesopotamian cities to plummy students at Oxford demanding the removal of busts of old colonialists, waging war on the past is all the rage.
A Year Zero mentality is on the march. People seem hellbent on wiping out history, making it invisible, and starting society all over again, cleansed of the likenesses of dead people of whom they disapprove.
This fury against monuments is presented as good and radical. The statue-smashers say they simply want to erase the faces and names of people who did bad things to show how far society has progressed and to make minority groups feel more comfortable when they’re out in public.
In truth, there’s nothing good in this mob-like erasure of history. It’s a reactionary, even Orwellian, movement. The urge to ethically cleanse public life of “bad history”, to shove down the memory hole any bust or tribute to past folk whose values make us bristle today, is intolerant, illiberal and profoundly paternalistic.
During the past week, the irrational fury against inanimate objects moved up a gear. First, there were the disturbances in Charlottesville, Virginia, when disagreements over a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee descended into violent clashes between leftists and neo-fascists.
A couple of days later, protesters in North Carolina tied rope around the neck of a statue of a Confederate soldier and dragged it down. They kicked and spat on it. There was a weird intensity to their statue abuse, bringing to mind the wide-eyed fury of Islamic State agitators as they stamp on what they view as idolatrous historic carvings in the ancient cities of Palmyra and Nimrud.
Then, in an extraordinary move, the mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, ordered the removal of four Confederate statues in the city. In the dead of night, workmen dragged them down. What had been everyday monuments for decades, seen by people as they walked to work or went for a jog, suddenly were viewed as a poisonous presence, liable to harm people’s self-esteem and the city’s stability. And so they were memory-holed, in the black of night, exposing the febrile streak to this statuephobia.
Year Zero agitation has been gaining ground for a few years. Students at Oxford want a bust of old British colonialist Cecil Rhodes removed. They describe the statue as “problematic”, a word PC zealots use in the same way Islamists say “haram”: to indicate something is wicked and should ideally be extinguished.
One of the protesters against Rhodes says, “There is a violence in having to walk past the statue every day.” There’s a medieval feel to this, this idea that even things made of stone have great power and evil in them.
For an Oxford student to describe a statue as an act of violence really is similar to the Islamic State hammer-wielders’ belief that pre-Islamic icons have the power to pollute men’s souls and thus must be destroyed.
Anyone who thinks this policing of the past will stop once all statues of Confederates and colonialists have been knocked down is in for a shock.
In the US, the Year Zero mob has turned its sights to statues of the great Thomas Jefferson (he owned slaves). And this week Yarra council in Melbourne decreed that it would no longer refer to January 26 as Australia Day, out of respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
So a historic fact – the arrival of the First Fleet into New South Wales in 1788, the basis of Australia Day – is made unmentionable. It’s unremembered, erased, as surely as Winston Smith in Nineteen Eighty-Four must erase old newspaper reports about events that now embarrass the party. Today’s cleansing of images of history smacks of the dark antics of that fictional Ministry of Truth.
The history erasers claim they only want to show how fair our societies now are. Rubbish. This isn’t about making the present better, it’s a projection of political correctness into the past. It’s the punishment of historical figures – even good historical figures, such as Jefferson, and good historical events, such as the settlement of Australia – for not sharing our exact modern world view.
And it reeks of PC paternalism. The idea that minority groups can’t cope with seeing statues of dead people who did some dodgy things is an affront to their intelligence and autonomy. It infantil­ises them, even suggesting they will feel physically wounded by history: after all, “there is a violence” to these statues.
It’s disturbingly ironic: this treatment of certain groups as fragile, as needing to have public life sanitised on their behalf in the way a new mum might baby-proof her home, is riddled with some fairly racist assumptions of its own.
One of the great things about public life is that it’s a patchwork of the historical events that made our nations. Take a walk through a city and you’ll see statues of soldiers, politicians, authors, suffragettes and others who shaped our societies. And most of them will have held views or done things we would consider questionable in 2017. So what? The point is they made history, and it’s right for the public sphere to reflect that.
The logic of the Year Zero crew is that we should see only historical figures they approve of (if there are any). They police history with an eye for policing what we citizens can see and by extension think about the societies we live in.

b. Herman Parker Jnr., 3 March 1927, West Memphis, Arkansas, USA, d. 18 November 1971, Blue Island, Illinois, USA. Despite his later fame some confusion still exists regarding the parents and date and place of birth of Little Junior Parker. Clarksdale, Mississippi and 1932 are sometimes quoted and his parents names are given in combinations of Herman Snr., Willie, Jeanetta or Jeremeter. It is certain is that they were a farming family situated near enough to West Memphis for Little Junior, (who had started singing in church) to involve himself in the local music scene at an early age. His biggest influence in those early days was Sonny Boy Williamson in whose band Junior worked for a while before moving on to work for Howlin' Wolf, before assuming the leadership of the latter's backing band. He was a member of the ad hoc group, the Beale Streeters, with Bobby ‘Blue’ Bland and B.B. King, prior to forming his own band, the Blue Flames in 1951, which included the well regarded guitarist Auburn ‘Pat’ Hare. His first, fairly primitive, recordings were made for Joe Bihari and Ike Turner in 1952 for the Modern label. This brought him to the attention of Sam Phillips and Sun Records where Junior enjoyed some success with his recordings of Feeling Good although the period is better recalled for the doomy Mystery Train, which was later taken up by the young Elvis Presley. His greatest fame on record stemmed from his work on Don Robey's Duke label operating out of Houston, Texas, and it was along with fellow Duke artist Bobby ‘Blue’ Bland that Little Junior headed the highly successful Blues Consolidated Revue which became a staple part of the southern blues circuit. His tenure with Robey lasted until the mid-'60s with his work moving progressively away from his hard blues base. In his later, days Parker appeared on such labels as Mercury, United Artists and Capitol, enjoying intermittent chart success with Driving Wheel (1961), Annie Get Your Yo-Yo (1962) and Man Or Mouse (1966). His premature death in 1971 occurred while he was undergoing surgery for a brain tumour and robbed R&B of one of its most influential figures.

Water horses need safety and a trustworthy rider. They can be brilliant show horses but panic easily. They perform well in events that call for animation and excitement, and are motivated by cheering crowds. They need steady riders to help them through scary situations.
The Water horse needs to move and when his movement is properly guided he can be a brilliant performer. The Water horse is highly intelligent and sensitive and he needs a safe environment to learn. It is much easier to start a Water horse slowly than to try and bring him back once he has become frightened and distrustful of people.
The Water horse is full of life energy and he wants to keep moving. The energy of the Water horse can be channeled and carefully harnessed into brilliant performance. In addition, like the never-ending flow of a strong river, the Water horse can have tremendous endurance and athletic ability. However, without clear direction the Water horse can become unpredictable and even dangerous. Efforts to subdue the Water horse will be met with disaster. Never underestimate the power of the Water horse and his need for movement.
The weakness of the Water horse is in his teeth and bones. He needs extra minerals to be strong and flexible. Lower back pain and weakness can occur if adequate minerals are not available. Water horses do well with alfalfa hay. Micro algae are another good source of minerals for the Water horse. The older Water horse may need soaked hay cubes if his teeth become weak. Warming herbs such as hawthorne will help with circulation to the kidneys if lower back weakness occurs. Joint supplements containing sulfur, such as MSM, may be beneficial for short term use in the Water horse showing signs of joint stiffness but they should not be used in place of balanced mineral intake from whole foods.
When allowed freedom to move the Water horse will rarely become overweight but chronic stress can shift the Water horse into the metabolic state of insulin resistance. The insulin resistant water horse will develop excess fat over his crest and loins. In the early stages this condition can be reversed by exercise and the addition of minerals, especially magnesium. Once the condition is advanced the metabolism of the horse changes so a permanent, strict low starch diet will be required.
The Water horse needs plenty of good quality, food based minerals to support healthy bones and teeth. He can be susceptible to lower back soreness and stiffness that will respond to herbs that increase circulation to his kidneys. Long term stress and confinement can lead to insulin resistance and this can be reversed in it's early stages by plenty of exercise and mineral supplementation.
Disclaimer: These products are meant to aid in balancing and supporting health, they are not formulated to resolve a disease state in the horse.

Nashville area building inspections completed by HABITEC Home and Building Inspections, LLC, involve inspecting the roof drainage systems. These systems are critical to maintain the condition of the foundation and avoid issues with mold. These components of the roof drainage systems commonly take the form or splash blocks, plastic extensions across the ground, plastic extensions under the ground, or rigid underground piping systems.
Look at the pic below of a downspout to extension system at a Church. This is a metal downspout connecting to a plastic extension that goes out across the ground. What's wrong?
ANSWER: First, it should be apparent that the downspout-to-plastic extension connection has separated and should be repaired. Failure to do so will allow water from the roof to be deposited at the foundation wall. This defect is known to cause foundation movement and resultant structural failure as well as water intrusion into crawl spaces and basements.
What may not be so apparent is the open plastic underground drain pipe in the background and below the downspout. What's up with that? Some may think this is there to catch the downspout water, which was true at one time. Originally the downspout connected to an underground drainage system that carried water away from the building to hopefully a functioning termination point. But, in this case, that underground system has been abandoned and the above ground extension has been installed to carry the roof drainage away. This is OK, but the Client who is buying this property needs to know that, in addition to the disconnected downspout, there is an underground system present but that it has been abandoned, versus being repaired to work properly.

The Grand History Trail is a proposed 250+ mile off-road trail connecting Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Stops on the trail include Washington D.C., Annapolis, Baltimore, Fells Point, York, Gettysburg, Frederick, Antietam Battlefield, and Harper's Ferry. Existing trails comprise over half the Grand History Trail. Approximately two thirds of the trail exists or is planned but Adams County only has on-road components of the GHT.
Here is a 30-page "Vision for the Grand History Trail" put together by the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy.
Health: Residents and tourists can enjoy health benefits of walking and bicycling on local trails that are part of the GHT.
Wealth: Many travelers plan vacations where trails take them to interesting and historical places. Bikers, walkers and joggers bring millions of dollars of revenue to businesses and towns along good trails with no damage to the environment.
Joy: People enjoy walking, talking, bicycling, and jogging on off-road trails like rail trails. They feel good and are friendly to others on the trail.
History: The area for the GHT is rich in history and it just makes good sense to connect these places with a trail that promotes tourism while reducing pollution.
Meetings have been held with state officials from Pennsylvania and Maryland and officials from Washington D.C., under the auspices of the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy.
Trail and bicycle advocacy groups have been involved in the meetings and are working with local and state officials to facilitate development of the GHT.
County and local government officials are working to plan and develop trails which will be part of the GHT.
A group of riders from York, PA rode the entire loop in September 2015 and met with government officials along the way.
In 2017 HABPI partnered with the Gettysburg Area Recreation Authority (GARA) to seek funding for a trail feasibility study for an off-road, multiuse trail from Gettysburg to the Maryland border near Emmitsburg. The PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) awarded a grant for half the cost. To match the DCNR grant, money was received from the Adams County Greenspace Grant Program, Destination Gettysburg, the Rotary Club of Gettysburg, Adams Electric Cooperative, Thrivent Financial, and numerous individual donors. A professional firm with expertise in conducting trail feasibility studies will be contracted in early 2018 to begin the work. Here is a map of the study area. Background information can be found here.

Clickers are also known as Audience Response System (sometimes referred to as Classroom or Student Response System). Their use is to support student interaction and feedback, particularly in large lecture environments. The clickers mentioned in this post are web-based apps rather than the physical devices you may have seen or used before.
In this interview with an academic at the University of North Carolina, we can see how clickers are being used with a class of 400 biology students.
Here are a couple of examples of web-based clicker apps (freely available) that I have used – Mentimeter and mQlicker
There are, however, a lot of others available out there if you Google Search the word ‘clickers’ or ‘polling’.
Mentimeter is a cloud-based tool that lets you engage and interact with your students in real-time. You set the questions and your students can give their input via a smart mobile phone or any other internet connected device.
This example video shows a step-by-step set up and use of the Mentimeter app and its application to teaching.
There is a demo on their site so you can see what type of interaction occurs. There may be priced features that are desirable but the standard account is very useful ‘as-is’ and it is quite intuitive to set up.
If you can see an application for polling with clickers in your class, contact your faculty-assigned Learning Technologist at https://help.online.uts.edu.au/information-for-staff/support-for-staff/ for further support.

Hans R Jenemann (1920-1996) probably has contributed more to research into the history of balances, weighing and much beyond than any other individual.
He has published extensively on the subjects of balance development, balance makers, history of weighing and others across three decades of the last century. In so doing he collected an enormous amount of information in many formats: books, catalogues, pamphlets and many other types of written information, as well as many thousand photographs – again in several formats. All of the latter he took himself, either by photographing the original item in situ, or by taking a photographic reproduction of printed material.
He was also an avid collector of antique and historic balances, especially analytical/chemical and microbalances.
This website is an attempt to collect, preserve and archive written material and images by Hans Jenemann. We intend to make this treasure accessible to fellow researchers and balance enthusiasts.
The project is very much a work in progress, mostly due to the astonishing amount of pictures which have to be digitised and tidied up. So check back from time to time, we update the pages as we go along.
There are also links to other sites of related interest and a contact page should you want to get in touch.

Have you noticed that your dog’s nose has been drier than usual lately? A crusty, flaky nose on your dog is not just an eyesore – it can actually be quite sore and uncomfortable for your dog. Dry, cracked skin isn’t just painful. A wet nose is actually required for your dog to smell properly. Since dogs rely heavily on their sense of smell, it’s unfair to take that away from them by failing to treat their dry nose. Let’s talk about what causes dry noses and how to heal your dog’s dry nose naturally.
-Aversion to plastic – some dogs don’t like the way water tastes in a plastic bowl and won’t drink enough water
If you aren’t sure what’s causing your dog’s dry nose, you may want to take him to the vet, especially if he has any other symptoms, since a dry nose can be a sign of a serious health problem.
Hyperkeratosis is the result of excessive skin growth on your dog’s nose or paw pads due to your dog producing too much keratin, which is the protein that the nose and paw pads are made from. The resulting brittle skin can become cracked and even infected!
Some dogs are more prone to hyperkeratosis, like Golden Retrievers, Irish and Bedlington Terriers, Labradors, and Dogues de Bordeaux, although any dog can suffer. Older dogs seem more prone than younger dogs.
As you can imagine, having an infection on your dog’s nose is a bad situation, so you want to heal your dog’s nose before it gets so dry that it starts to crack and allow infections in.
Luckily, there are natural ingredients that can help soothe and heal your dog’s nose. Some of these ingredients include:
-Coconut oil: one of the safest, most effective natural moisturizers you’ll find. You’ll want to stick with 100% organic cold-pressed extra virgin coconut oil for safety reasons. According to the American Kennel Club:
“[Coconut oil has] been known to help skin conditions like hot spots, bites, stings, or itchy, dry skin. Shampoos made with organic oils such as coconut oil can improve damaged skin and reduce allergens. Some pet owners have even made a DIY paw balm with coconut oil as one of the ingredients.”
-Olive oil: rubbed well onto your dog’s nose, this common household oil can help soothe and moisturize it, and it’s safe if your dog licks a little bit off. Olive oil penetrates deeply into your dog’s skin for long-lasting moisture.
-Shea butter: a popular ingredient in human skincare products, and it’s just as fabulous for your dog’s dry nose, too. According to 24 Karite Gold:
“Shea butter contains a unique substance known as cinnamic acid, and cinnamic acid has natural antibacterial properties that help to ward off infection and speed up wound healing. Shea butter also contains naturally occurring vitamin A, which is known to speed up the recovery and regeneration of the skin.”
Why not combine all these natural ingredients with several more for one fabulous product that helps safely heal your dog’s nose and also helps feed shelter dogs? Our Project Paws® Nature’s Butter™ Snout Balm for Dogs is an unscented formula that is packed with soothing oils and butters that seep into your dog’s skin at different levels, locking in healthy moisture for longer periods of time.
Every Nature’s Butter™ balm is made in far northern Minnesota on a beautiful and very unique 40-acre farm and each purchase provides 5 healthy meals for dogs in shelters!

Guess what is the best thing to have in the world of hosting – a free hosting that is super reliable. Unfortunately there is no such thing as free hosting that is reliable, the next best thing is to have a hosting with a discount coupon code such as HostGator. These coupon codes come in many types and forms. You can get a certain percentage off from hosting. As an example there is currently a 25% off code on reseller hosting. There is also a HostGator discount code for those just starting out in the world of web hosting. The best coupon of all in our opinion is the one that gets you web hosting just for a cent for the first month. This coupon code is given below along with other coupons.
There are several choices of accounts available for HostGator customers. With those hosting account choices discount available for first time customers also vary. As an example those just starting out can use an account in Hatchling category. There are discount coupon codes for hatchling accounts. This discount offers the maximum deal on hatchling account type.
Those with more experience might find that business hosting account is more suited for their needs. This account comes with several options not available with other shared hosting accounts. These include a dedicated IP which generally costs in a few dollars per month for free and an SSL certificate which is another few dollars a month. When you add these free things up and add a business hosting coupon code on top it makes for an excellent hosting proposition.
Nart Villeneuve has published a detailed summary of recent malware attacks on media and human rights groups who work on Chinese issues. He highlights a disturbing new trend. On Wednesday, Amnesty Hong Kong's website was repurposed by hackers to infect visitors with a wide variety of nasty malware. The Nobel Prize's website was also defaced earlier this month, for the same ends.
As with the e-mailed Nobel invite malware CPJ described earlier this week, these attacks target one vulnerable member of the dissident community, then use that person's own communications to infect others.
If you're an organization whose audience in China is of interest to the authorities, please take extra care with the security of your website. As Villeneuve says, even if this spate of attacks ebbs, attacking online news sites to spread targeted spyware is a trend that is bound to continue.
