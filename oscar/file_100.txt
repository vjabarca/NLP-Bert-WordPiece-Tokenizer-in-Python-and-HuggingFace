Welcome to my personal blog, where I write about whatever is going on in my life at the moment and how little sleep I am getting!
I've probably been more tired but it's hard to quantify just how tired I am at present. The heat isn't helping as that has been interrupting the kids' sleeping patterns, and hence ours. We've had two really bad nights in a row and I'm almost at the point of using matches to keep my eyes open. On top of that our internet stopped working this morning, so we had to come to Anna's parents' house so I could work.
We had some rain overnight but it's still really warm and humid, I just wish we could have one massive storm to clear the air and then the sun can come back! We did have two cooler days over the weekend, especially Sunday morning when I went out for my last big ride before the RideLondon-Surrey 100 - I did 50 miles, half of which was going against all of the cyclists doing London-Southend (which I'd forgotten about). When I first got a bike, London-Southend was my main target for this year as I thought doing 50 miles would be a challenge - it's strange how much further I've progressed with the target of doing RideLondon. Maybe by next year I'll be doing Alpe d'Huez? (In my dreams, perhaps).
Speaking of Alpe d'Huez, I'm feeling slightly bereft this week without the Tour de France to watch. I was gutted that Mark Cavendish didn't win on Sunday, but at least we finally got to see a proper sprint between Cav, Greipel and Kittel - shame we didn't see more of them. It'll be a long few weeks until the Vuelta now!
Apparently someone gave birth in London yesterday - you wouldn't know it from the media frenzy(!) I'm mildly interested as he will be a future monarch, but a simple 'congratulations' would suffice - leave them in peace now! I do wonder what people gathering outside the hospital or the palace hope to achieve - at best they'll catch a slight glimpse of a baby. It is slightly sobering to consider that in all probability I won't be alive when the young prince is crowned king.
I wasn't feeling so well mentally last week. I can't think of any cause for it but for a few days I was very anxious about things. I managed to work and exercise as usual but part of me just wanted to go back to bed for the day. I'm feeling better this week thankfully.
Things seem to be getting back on track with training for RideLondon - I managed an 80km ride last week and 100km this week. My legs are suffering a bit so I've booked myself in for a bike fit and physio session next month which will hopefully get things back to normal.
Yesterday marked 16 years since Anna and I first met - I don't think either of us remembered (I thought it was today!) We went to see Avengers: Infinity War yesterday which was really good, but the year-long wait for the sequel is going to feel like a long time.
Got a busy week ahead - I went out last night for a meal with my brother, tonight I'm going out with some friends for a curry, tomorrow I'm meeting another friend for …
Kitty was seven years old yesterday. What with that and the BRIT Awards last night I'm feeling very old at the moment!
Her main present was a pair of heelys which she was very happy about. She invited a couple of friends to go to the local soft play which is much easier than organising a party!
Things seem pretty hectic at the moment and I'm not getting much rest, but Anna and I have a night away this weekend which should allow us some peace! We also saw Black Panther yesterday which was very good.
My calves are a little sore at the moment from cycling/exercise but otherwise I'm feeling OK. I managed a 50 mile ride last week so my base fitness isn't too bad, I just need to start training properly. Hopefully it will warm up soon!
Only eleven days to go until Christmas now. All the presents have been bought, just need to wrap everything up. I might try and do some during the day whilst the kids are still at school, to keep last-minute panicking to a minimum!
I've been doing circuit training for seven weeks now and seem to be fitter. This is mainly in the sense that I can continue a little longer before it starts hurting! It no longer aches horribly afterwards though so my muscles must be getting used to it. I keep pulling muscles - I pulled my left calf on Tuesday to follow my right calf a couple of weeks ago, and my right hamstring the week before that. I just need my left hamstring to go for the full set!
I've taken some time off over Christmas for the first time in years, so the kids' last day at school will be my last day of work, then I'll be back to work in the new year. So in theory this will be slightly more relaxing but it means I no longer have an excuse to hide away upstairs! Work has…

‘Getting Closer’ at Colour A run through the ‘news’ page on Colour’s website (www.colour.ca) will quickly reveal a business playing full out and succeeding in the advertising world. They are a co-creative company with a conscience. I am interested in the intention Colour, and in particular, President, Chris Keevill, brings to his employees, his clients and his community. Is this a business manifesting some form of spirituality in the workplace? It didn’t take long for me to answer in the affirmative. Chris is a genuine human being. He is able and willing to share his experience. He listens with care and curiosity, and responds thoughtfully. He is generous with his time and energy. I immediately felt comfortable in his presence I think what I experienced first hand, is the approach Colour uses with their clients. They call it, ‘getting closer’. This approach requires one person to be fully present to another. There are many kinds of distractions competing for our attention all the time. The ‘getting closer’ approach requires that one skillfully filter distractions by consciously setting a priority in one’s mind and heart to be present. Not a rigid form of attention. More like a wine taster, using all their senses. Being fully present requires the heart, mind and body be all in one place, at the same time. An authentic inquiry. How inspiring to find a business, particularly in the media, that senses the public’s need and the desire to be heard. This can only be accomplished when we slow down and take the time to listen. I don’t know if it is a factor of...

Today's the day! The day BOFF2 is released! WOOHOO!!! BOFF? you ask... That’d be Best of Friday Flash :) I’m pretty stoked about it. And very excited that one of my stories has been included! Woohoo! It’s especially exciting for me since I haven’t had time to write much fiction recently, so it brings back happy memories.
A friend of mine first invited me to try submitting a story to Friday Flash a couple years ago. It was the first story I'd written that I let anybody other than my mother read, and was a bit trepidatiously that I posted the link. But the response from the (then very small) community was incredibly supportive and I quickly came to enjoy contributing and reading the stories others shared. And while the number of people involved grew rapidly, the small-town, welcoming environment stuck.
After a while, I'm not sure who suggested it first, but at some point Jon (our fearless leader!) decided it'd be a good idea for a Best Of compilation. Anybody interested was encouraged to submit up to three stories for consideration and after a few rounds, the stories were selected. I was thrilled to be included, although I suspected our community was small enough that the powers that be were trying hard to include anybody who wished to be included :)
However, by the time a second book was being considered, the FF community had grown significantly and a large number of "real" writers were now participating. A little more intimidating for those like me who write occasionally when we have time but with no plans or expectations to ever make a living from it. And yet, I discovered very quickly that those professional writers were just as supportive of any effort as everybody else. And in many cases had good advice to give and always great stories to read.
And along with the growing community came a company interested in publishing BOFF2. Wow. So this time I was a little more nervous about submitting my story -- only one submission was allowed (how do I know which one to submit?) and I suspected (although I certainly don't know for sure) that the competition would be a little more fierce.
Time crawled slowly, as it will when you're waiting for anything, but eventually I got the news that my story had been accepted for inclusion into BOFF2! Woohoo! And today is the day the wait comes to its conclusion. Because BOFF2 is being released :)
BOFF2 can be purchased direct from the publisher at eMergent Publishing or from Amazon at Best of Friday Flash: Volume 2 . And for those who missed it, US Amazon still has Best Of Friday Flash - Volume One: A Collection Of Short Fiction.
Friday Flash attracts authors from the far reaches of the world. To the best of my knowledge there are four other Canadian authors included in this anthology – check out their posts below!
Jen Brubacher (who lives in England but is definitely Canadian - in fact, Jen is a little jet-lagged and may not be able to post today but she's hoping)
And what's Mum doing on her birthday? Riding :) hahaha and *that* is a statement I never thought I'd make. And I'd just like to announce she entirely accomplished her goal of cantering before her birthday. Woohoo! Congrats :)
So I contemplated writing a slightly exaggerated but highly entertaining bio of some sort, but it really - that's hard to do since I only really know what's happened since my life story became my own and not just a continuation of hers. The before is tricky when you can't ask the primary participant questions without giving away the plans *g*
So instead I thought we'd review some of the things that've changed since the world has been blessed with her presence -- all entirely her doing of course. And I was starting to have some fun with that, but really -- that's a book all in itself! When the blog was getting WAY too long I aborted that idea entirely. Then I thought maybe a birthday news post. But it turns out most of the news sites that are archived online didn't post on whatever day of the week Oct 29 was that year *sigh* Horrible fail. I did find one that amused me though - want to know what happened the day Bev was born? Check out 60yearsagotoday.com. There's a website for everything :)
On a side note (because there were a LOT of side notes in this post :) Entirely too ancient for the purposes of this post, but kept me entertained (ummm distracted) for entirely too long is Historic American Newspapers. Very kewl site. Discover history the way it was told at the time. I have a book that's 100 years of NY Times -- super interesting for the same reason. And as far as birthday gifts go -- http://www.historic-newspapers.co.uk/ is an interesting idea. Sadly not one I thought Mum'd really like (more of a Dad type gift) but I still thought it was kinda kewl. And closer to home: http://ink.ourontario.ca/ -- who knew Acton's had a paper since 1875??? hahaha
Anyways - next I decided, why invent the wheel? Surely somebody's already done this for me :) And sure enough... hahaha the framing couch people aren't really worth watching, but the video being presented is somewhat amusing.
I had high hopes of writing a Friday Flash tonight -- the first in over a year! *gasp* how sad. But worse, it turns out the creative portion of my mind isn't functional tonight. *sigh* I did, however, have a ton of fun reading through old flashes I wrote ages ago that are little more than a flicker of a memory. Which, in turn, killed whatever time I had left to write something new. hahaha ah well. Maybe next week >;-P
hahaha if you take the time to read any of em - let me know what you think! Comments always welcome and appreciated :)
Had a lot of fun teaching yesterday and today -- now that my head is clear enough to think! Ugh - I've been sick more this season than the last few years combined. No fun at all! My own lesson this am was just kinda silly. Did nothing particularly productive, but had a lot of fun doing it *g* By far the best lesson-related post of the week was Brena's: "Somehow the best lessons are the ones where you bounce around trying to hold someone else's whip, get your tack taken away, and end up sitting backwards on your pony..." hahaha so there is actually a reasonable explanation for all of this -- but that's no fun at all. So I'm just going to say you had to be there. Or maybe you're a horse person who already *has* been there at some point and is now grinning away remembering...
Polo... The sport of kings! Alas but I'm neither king nor queen and as such have never had the opportunity to play this fantastic sport. But then today, thanks to a wicked combination of Facebook and Groupon, I finally got that chance!
This story begins last summer -- Laura and I were discussing how much fun it'd be to try polo. Sadly when I went home and researched, I decided it was prohibitively expensive and that dream was shelved.
Well a few months later a facebook acquaintance posted something asking if anybody was interested in a polo lesson -- I was one of several who responded positively. And then nothing really came of it. But a couple months after that, that same friend posted a link to GroupOn and tagged everybody who had expressed an interest in polo from her original post. The link offered a variety of options -- but the one I liked was a semi-private polo lesson for $99. Sweet. Called Laura who was all for it and ordered the tickets. Lesson had to be used by November.
But then show season hit. And sailing. And puppy class. And general all-round insanity. And we thought we had a good date but then Laura came off a young horse and was going to be off for six weeks *sigh* So it got put on hold again. But eventually we had a date that'd work for both of us and two sound riders. Sweet.
And then, this morning, Laura's daughter was sick. *sigh* So being the good mom she is, she was out. Too late at this point to reschedule as they polo guys require 48h for a make-up. Which meant I was going regardless, but this kind of thing would be way more fun with a friend, so I put the word out. I called my working students first but they were all working real jobs. Imagine that >;-P So then I called some of my riding friends -- most of them were busy too, but one was able to *very* quickly rearrange life to come play. Woohoo!
So now polo... Have you ever played golf? How about ridden a dirt bike? Played hockey? How about all three at the same time? Cause, well, that's pretty much polo. hahaha - and have I mentioned I've never been successful at any of the above three sports? Oh dear.
We started our polo lesson on the ground. Definitely a wise move. First step -- how to hold the mallet. Stick your thumb through a loop, twist it around a few times, hook your hand between the loop and the mallet, and hang on. Good to go. Actually did make for a fairly secure hold. From there we were introduced to each of the four swings. Off-side fore, off-side back, near-side back, and near-side fore. Ummm for the non-horse-people out there, off-side is right and near-side is left -- which in this circumstance seemed very backwards to me since the mallet is in the right hand and so the near-side is farthest away *g* hahaha Keep in mind, the mallet doesn't change hands -- so hitting the ball when it's on the near-side of the horse is a bit of a challenge.
So first one is hitting the ball forward when it's on the off-side (aka the right -- where the mallet is). This one works pretty much as you'd expect -- the only challenge is that in the follow through you have to really make sure the mallet goes forward and doesn't arc around (ie golf). Because if it arcs around, you'll hit your horse. Boo on that. Trickier was the second swing -- hitting the ball backwards when it's on the off-side. Same general concept but with the theory that you've gone past the ball and are sending it the opposite direction. I liked that one :) Then the same two concepts on the near-side. The forward one on the near side is all technique -- twisted at that angle, strength does very little good. Jen got a good giggle at the fact that as soon as Janet (our awesome clinician) mentioned that one particular one was hard and not to expect to get it on the first day and isn't that the one I do best *g*. Classic. The easy ones otoh... hahaha oh dear.
A wooden one. hahaha seriously. I so want one of these for the school. When we were chatting earlier, Janet had mentioned she'd actually had people fall off said wooden horse -- this seemed really funny until I was leaning WAAAAAYYYYY off the side to hit a ball and suddenly realized *exactly* how one could end on the ground. But I did manage to follow rule 1 on the wooden horse.
So we practiced swinging on the wooden horse a few times (poor Janet had to keep sending them back to us -- she could've used Sasha :) -- key details: the ground is a LOT farther away. And don't hit the horse!
Then way too early, time to get on a horse. You've heard that before right? Yeah but this time, it was a real live polo pony. One just off the competitive season about to be turned out to gain pony fat. One whose name I could hardly pronounce much less spell so...
First step - tack. I was surprised the ponies weren't nearly as bubble-wrapped as I would've thought. Polos (aptly named for once!) were the only leg protection (although in games they wear tendon boots and bell boots). The bridle was a gag with double reins. Martingale was the most intense I've ever seen -- leather was as thick as a usual stirrup leather. But the fit was the same as I'd expect and all the tack was in good condition. The breastplate had similarly intense straps, but again all well fitting and good to go.
The stirrup irons were also very thick -- at least double the traditional size. My guess is to give you more security when you're leaning off the side! No kneerolls on the saddle and I found the saddle balance tipped me very backward -- but when I was leaning off the side trying to hit the ball, I felt very secure, so my thought is they're balanced that way on purpose. As with any riding sport -- trying to use the wrong saddle won't go well. Jumping in dressage tack or dressaging in a jockey saddle are not impossible, but not easy either. So while I felt off-balance at first in this one, it definitely worked for what we were doing :)
Stirrup length was between show-jump length and xc length. You want your knee bent enough that you can move around, but enough leg to wrap around the horse and hang on!
And then the reins. All four of them. And unlike in a double bridle -- neither set is skinny. Booo. Even more unusual for me -- all four reins in one hand. Fun :) So Janet told us how to separate the reins and hold them all in one hand and reminded us that these horses neck rein and should be on essentially no contact. Sweet.
Then the other difference -- steering is almost all rein aids. My legs did very little to turn the horse and I will be forever grateful they don't respond to shifts in balance! Can you imagine taking a top level dressage horse, one who'll swap leads at the slightest weight shift, and suddenly leaning so far off the side that you're parallel to the ground? hahaha oh dear. Can only imagine the reaction. These ponies just held their line. Very patient and very well trained.
Jen and I rode around for a bit hitting balls. A couple challenges on a real horse -- the wooden one always faced forwards. The live ones turn their heads! Imagine that! But how much does it suck when the horse turns to look at the mallet as you're swinging it! Stopped just short of walloping my horse in the jowl. Poor sainted pony :( I would've been so upset. But fortunately my swing really didn't have any strength behind it, so easy to stop it. But that definitely made me even more hesitant as we were going.
Eventually though we were getting the hang of it and starting to read better how and where our horses would move and just generally getting more comfortable. The ponies knew the game and would follow the ball after hitting it. I thought that was pretty kewl. Now you have to realize, both Jen and I are pretty type-A personalities. I know, you're so surprised! hahaha so of course as soon as we mastered (and by "mastered" I mean "were barely competent at") the basic skills we had to turn it into a game. But we both acknowledged that chasing the *same* ball swinging mallets directly beside each other would probably not be a good idea for either us OR our sainted ponies, so we simply decided to race from one end of the arena to the other. hahaha Jen won the first round and I won the second. We were debating whether we should have a tie breaker when we ran out of time. Probably for the best!
So yeah it was So. Much. Fun. I haven't laughed that hard in ages. I'm quite certain I'll be sore tomorrow, but totally worth it :) I love any time I get to try something completely new (see the sailing posts :) but getting to do something completely new on horseback is a rarity for me and it was so very much fun. And Janet was awesome; we were there quite a bit longer than we had actually paid for *g* So the question for my GRS students is -- any interest in a clinic? It's an hour - 1.5h away. But so very entertaining!
Oh and as for the subject line -- the debate reigns re whether "the sport of kings" is polo or horse racing, but polo is the sport that actually counts multiple kings among its participants :) So for the sake of my subject line, we're going with polo.
Next somebody called for a tour, interested in boarding. Alright, get them to come right before w/s lesson at noon.
Then I had somebody coming who wants to be a w/s. hmmm ok, well I can make it early from the off-site lesson, so she can ride at 11:30. Np.
Then another assessment signed up, so without looking at my calendar I considered my usual Sunday schedule and put them at 3. And an intermediate student wanted a private so I put her in at 4.
Ok does anybody else notice a 2:45 assessment and a 3:00 assessment? Tricky. Very tricky. But I actually decided that with a little help from my awesome working student Brena, I could pull it off. Just have her give a tour and fill out paperwork and at 3:15 they can ride the same horse as the first rider. No worries.
Then through a whole variety of reasons, my off-site lesson changed from an hour to an hour and a half. Very tricky as that now means I have to leave there at 11:30 and be at my barn at 11:30 -- with no time inbetween. But I really like those people so...
Then my 1 and 1:45 (who come together) had to cancel due to illness, so I promptly rescheduled the 4 for 1 and the 3 for 2. Woohoo! And since I have such awesome students, they were all good with this.
Ok so now the only issue is getting from off-site to home with enough time to teach the new w/s AND give a tour at noon. So I was *really* ok with it when Rebecca told me tentative w/s didn't show up. hahaha classic eh? No email or phone but, it saves me half an hour. Which promptly put me back on schedule.
Sweet. Then I get to the barn and check my messages and unfortunately potential boarder isn't well, so that'll be rescheduled as well. And suddenly I'm at the barn *early* with time to relax between lessons. Wow.
W/s lesson was fun as always and the 4 private which got bumped up to 1 went really well too. The 2 lesson appeared just as I was finishing with 4 -- almost perfect timing. When I finished with them no sign of the 2:45. Open arena so I let Brena get in some extra riding (working student perk :) and found a message that they're half-hour late. No problem.
They got there just as Brena finished. Horse was warmed up and good to go for the new student. And all was well with the world.
But from an easy day to an almost impossible day and back to a fairly simple day again, all within a few hours. hahaha. Just one of those days I guess :)
And my goal of being in bed by 10pm to catch up on some sleep? Yeah - you can stop laughing now. Sheesh.
First off -- HUGE thanks to Kennedy, Katlyn, Rebecca, Brena and Amy who covered for me so I could disappear for a couple days! Greatly appreciated :)
My thought was to feed and turnout the horses, get home and run some errands and leave around noonish. Right. Let's revisit that shall we? By the time I was done at the barn (since it's never *just* feed and turnout -- esp when I'm going away for almost 3 days!). So I got home around 11:30. hmmmm oops. Then both the second and third errand took significantly longer than anticipated. They got done, just not quickly *sigh*. And about that point as it was getting close to 3:30 I deemed the rest of the list could be ignored and hopped in the car.
So the next day was pretty much just relaxing. Soooo nice. Spent most of the day on the couch with a book -- broken up with the occasional frisbee game with Sasha and riding a dirt bike for the first time -- but mostly relaxing.
What was that? Oh the frisbee -- yeah, Sasha's favourite game. She was so well behaved at the cottage. Had a ton of fun playing with the boys :) And remember her manners well enough that with a dozen people in a tiny cottage she wasn't a problem. I was pretty happy with her.
Hmmmm? Oh - the dirt bike. Ummm yeah -- it doesn't interpret my aids quite as well as my horse does *g* hahaha actually it was So. Much. Fun! I had such a HUGE little-kid grin on my face :) So it turns out, that when you crash a bike it's very much like when you crash your horse -- time slows down. What's going through my head as I'm heading straight towards a tree on my first *ever* attempt on a bike is "if I fall with my legs out to the side like this, I'll break a leg". Nothing useful like maybe - hit the breaks :) *sigh* Oh no, just how to fix it so that when I fall I won't get tooooo hurt. Sheesh. Fortunately while I couldn't for the life of me find the breaks, I *did* know where the clutch was. hahaha AND had enough presence of mind to engage it so that said bike was instantly in neutral. Didn't slow down very fast, but at least it stopped the accelleration *g* Oh dear. I *did* in-fact manage to get stopped a good 6" from the tree >;-P hahaha but I think that was sheer beginner's luck.
The second try (yes there was a second try - you're not new here) - was significantly better. hahaha and so very much fun. Got going and didn't realize till after that my cousin was following along behind just in case I needed rescue :) And just as I was debating a switch to second gear, I realized I was running out of driveway! Booo. So I stopped instead :( So sad. And it *almost* worked -- I aimed for neutral and promptly stalled it instead. *sigh* Ah well - I stopped where I intended to stop and under control, it just wasn't as graceful as I would've liked. hahaha Daniel got the bike turned around and started again for me and I drove it back :) This time I'd been warned about neutral being a challenge and just went for off when I got there. But omg so much fun. Grinning just remembering it now.
So yeah - something entertaining always happens at Thanksgiving :) The rest of the weekend was a pretty traditional cottage weekend and as always, I really enjoyed it. Hope yours was as much fun!

The interest in comics as a tool for education has been slowly gaining speed over recent years. From American Born Chinese cartoonist (and high school teacher) Gene Luen Yang's small but informative Comics in Education website to the advocacy of university lecturer Christina Blanch, the power of comics to inspire and educate is beginning to garner some notice.
Blanch organised the online course/MOOC 'Gender in Comic Books' earlier this year, and had some fascinating stories about introducing comics from Y: The Last Man to Swamp Thing in the classroom.
With some comics there's no debate or argument as to their educational value. Here are five of our favourite comics that feature not only great writing and beautiful artwork but will leave you feeling smarter than you did before:
Springing from the minds of neuroscientists Dr Hana RoÅ¡ and Dr Matteo Farinella, this joint project between Nobrow and the Wellcome Trust is an expert marriage of information and storytelling.
The narrative draws the unnamed protagonist into the world of the mind in a Wonderland-like adventure. Drawing on the literal and metaphorical descriptions on the mind, Neurocomic builds a beautiful world populated by the greatest neuroscientists of history who are all ready to share their theories and discoveries with the reader. It spins out into a story that brings theories of the mind together with the action of reading comics, cleverly illustrating complex metatextual concepts with an accessibility that prose would struggle to deliver.
Neurocomic is a brilliant example of how graphic storytelling can be married with scientific information to create a whole that is both entertaining and educational. On top of all this, the finished book is an irresistibly beautiful object that you won't be able to resist adding to your shelf.
Russ Kick's anthology is a true work of art. The three-volume series covers the entire history of literature and storytelling, featuring hundreds of works, starting with Gilgamesh and ending with David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest and including Greek epic and tragedy, Shakespeare, the BrÃ¶ntes, George Orwell and a host of religious texts.
The beauty of The Graphic Canon - beyond the consistently exquisite contributions of its many cartoonists - is the breadth of the material, drawing from across cultures and eras. Each entry is a learning experience, from Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji (adapted by Molly Kiely) - often regarded as the world's first novel - to Caroline Picard's startling interpretation of Apu Ollantay, the last surviving Incan play. The referencing is also impressive, making this a great jumping off point on any books which particularly capture your imagination.
These three volumes are a perfect example of the value of comics as both informative and educational books and as things of beauty.
An important figure in 20th century history who we don't think is praised as loudly as he deserves is the brilliant Nobel Laureate Professor Richard Feynman, pioneer in quantum electrodynamics, a subject this book will leave you feeling you have a vague understanding of (which is more than most people can hope).
Jim Ottaviani and Leland Myrick's graphic biography wisely stays clear of the minutiae of physics for the most part. It is worth a read alone for a better understanding of the complex and fascinating Feynman, who filled his spare time as a scientist on The Manhattan Project by learning the art of safecracking.
But when it does get down to the nitty gritty of quantum, the combination of textbook style images with the friendly, narrative figure of Feynman makes for a unique way of offering the subject. It's still an incredibly difficult subject, but Feynman makes for an approachable way of dealing with it.
'Beautiful' possibly isn't the word you would use to describe Warren Ellis and Raulo Caceres's CrÃ©cy. The short graphic novel focuses on the Battle of CrÃ©cy in 1346 and is a brilliant example of presenting a narrative in an overtly educational (and very adult) way.
The foot soldier narrator leads us through visceral scenes of war, explaining how the tactics and technology used during the famous battle changed the face of warfare. It also explains something of the political and social situation at the time. As a period in British history frequently left out of the classroom, it makes for a particularly compelling tale.
After reading CrÃ©cy, you will forevermore be correcting people on the proper plural of 'cannon' (its 'cannon', FYI) and have picked up a sneering contempt for the crossbow over the dependable old British longbow. It shows just how effective a comic can be at teaching.
The popular and long-running webcomic launched in 2005 with a blend of "romance, sarcasm, maths and language". Known for its science, maths and computing jokes, xkcd has nevertheless maintained an accessible style that makes the subject matter interesting and informative rather than alienating.
Beyond the educational qualities of the comic, it has also been praised for its innovative and engaging approach to webcomics, including an improbably huge click and drag world and the celebrated 'Time' strip - a single image updated regularly over 123 days.
For a comic featuring simple stick figures, xkcd is amazingly complex, funny, moving, imaginative and informative. The 'Bee Orchid' strip below captures everything we love about the webcomic.

Leave it to SuperTwink to show up on the set of a real porno shoot and help out a poor stud who can't keep an erection for the camera. Not only does he get it up again, he keeps it there for a long time in this great scene! You must see this one for yourself!
A critical mission for SuperTwink: Stop this boy in his tracks from any further thoughts of turning straight! Not only does SuperTwink succeed in his mission but our fence riding friend says that his days of confusion are over and he's on the right track for good now!
Since the early 1960's, meteorologists have studied severe storms with the aid of numerical models. These computer models are programmed to solve the mathematical equations describing the flow of air in the atmosphere including the development and evolution of storms. These equations describe changes in wind, temperature, pressure, water vapor amount, cloud water amount, etc. at selected points in the atmosphere. For example, a modeler might start solving the equations at some time T, calculating values at the selected points 10 seconds later. Using these new values, the solution can be computed at time T + 20 seconds. This process is often continued for hours as storms grow and decay within the modeled atmosphere.
Today scientists produce billions of numbers during a single storm simulation and this continues to increase as computer power grows. Visualization of this data is used to understand what these numbers are describing and why some storms are severe and others are not. In this module some of these visualizations are used in discussing the behavior of simulated storms and their relationship to storms seen in nature.
Illustrations and visualizations help explain these powerful storms which are the most likely to produce strong tornadoes.
Convective line initiation, squall lines, and non-supercell thunderstorms which produce tornadoes will be discussed
"I went up in FIFI's first flight of the day on Saturday! And, as if flying in a B-29 wasn’t cool enough, our flight carried Colonel Charles McGee, a Tuskegee Airman among his other military accomplishments, and Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cole, Jimmy Doolittle’s copilot. I’m an unrepentant military groupie and can now die in peace."
"That was a truly unique experience; one had only to look at the faces of the attendees, whether they were veterans reliving old memories or young students learning about the war for the first time, to recognize that this was a truly special and important occasion."

Preschool reports are done and ready to go their folders! Even my stint as a proof reader is done, so after a little happy dance I fell on my crochet bag with gusto.
I have been thinking about crocheting Christmas decorations for months now and when I saw the post about how to make these stars from Jodie at Jellywares I was most excited.
They worked so well and are extremely quick and easy to make (thank you Jodie) so friends and family beware. You may just end up with a new star for your tree this year.﻿
Hi kate-these look gorgeous! Having a go at crochet might have to be on my new year resolutions list!
I adore these stars Kate...last Christmas I bought some from Jodie and loved them so much! The perfect little gift :) Yes, I am baking some gifts and making wreaths.
You inspired me months ago to pick up a crochet hook again after 20 odd years - I am enjoying learning it all over again.
I totally relate to the reports done feeling - yipppeee. A few parent may never speak to me again but they are done and dusted.
Those crochet decorations are lovely! Do you sell them anywhere? I think all white ones would be gorgeous too :)
Thank you Jess. I made white ones too and they looked great. I only make them to entertain myself and to give as gifts to a lucky few!
Thank you for your comments. I love knowing that you're reading and appreciate the time taken to comment.
A quick note for you this weekend about the Friday Five. For the next six weeks or so my Friday Five posts will be sporadic, if at all.
My concert schedule for this spring is super intense - 16 concerts between now and mid-June. That's on top of my "normal" work day, of course. Just another lazy, greedy teacher... :)
Anyway, I have not had the time to read all of your wonderful posts with the consistency I'd like to. There are whole days when I get behind, and then have to skim, which I really hate to do. Until things calm down and I can keep up with my google reader, I'll have to take a little break from the Five. I'm sure you understand. :)
You can still play, though! Feel free to grab the icon from the "Friday Five" tab at the top of the page!

Déraciné is a story adventure game from Sony Interactive Entertainment, SIE Japan Studio, FromSoftware and Hidetaka Miyazaki, known for their collaboration on Bloodborne. Taking the role as an unseen faerie in a secluded boarding school, the player moves around in frozen time, collecting various bits of information that serve to unfold an overarching mystery. The story is a new take on classic adventure games and utilizes PS VR’s technology to take gamers on an entirely unique and personal experience.… Expand
Déraciné has a fantastic atmosphere and wonderful storytelling. It utilizes VR and PlayStation Move to create a type of interaction not seen in other games. The innocence characters show to the player add a warm and friendly feeling to what is already a fascinating adventure game.
Déraciné is one of the best exponents of traditional video games on PlayStation VR, for the artistic work done by From Software and Japan Studio, and is recommended to those who are already familiar with smaller games and want a "complete" title to savor in virtual reality.
Déraciné subverts Japanese horror tropes as easily as it conceals the limitations of virtual reality. By casting the player in an active and passive role in its narrative, it juxtaposes agency with accountability as it creates a tranquil, sinister story. Déraciné is a return to FromSoftware practicing their talent inside of darkness, but mercifully away from Souls.
I love seeing From Software getting out of their comfort zone. It’s a nice change of pace and a good way to challenge themselves creatively, but I would have liked to see a little bit more out of the game. I want them to play against the expectations of the genre a bit more because if you strip away the atmosphere and the story, there’s nothing here you haven’t played before.
Déraciné approaches VR in the right way, letting the player soak in the environment at their leisure, but the teleportation movement is awkward and most of your engagement outside the narrative hinges on how much you enjoy picking up objects, looking at them, and putting them somewhere else. The world is interesting, and the narrative features a handful of fun, dark twists, but the ultimate experience is bland, even if it does have its charms.
Déraciné isn't really a true VR title as the VR doesn't bring much to the experience. Still it's an enjoyable ride as From Software has loads of know-how in terms of narrative and artistic direction.
FromSoftware’s first VR game is full of interesting ideas but very little entertainment, with frustrating storytelling and tiresome puzzles.
Déraciné is a delicately told melancholy short where you play a faerie in a small boarding school. A gentle narrative, which has charactersDéraciné is a delicately told melancholy short where you play a faerie in a small boarding school. A gentle narrative, which has characters with fully animated faces (abnormal for From Software), that will move you to solve it's tender story-teller's puzzles as you attempt to right the wrongs of their past. The string duo soundtrack perfectly conveys the character's woeful innocence as the sullen melodies chase each other down the hallowed halls of this unforgettable school. It's end will likely leave you with a heavy heart and throughout it's unfolding, your head will be spinning with how characters, settings, and details from this faerie tale might possibly connect to other FS titles...… Expand

When Hamiltonian Gallery opened at 14th and U Streets in 2007, it was something of an oddity. Paul So, a theoretical physicist and professor at George Mason University, launched his unlikely gallery as a way to give artists something akin to the post-doc model for professional opportunities available in the sciences. Every two years, Hamiltonian endows a new class of fellows: young and emerging artists who get a chance to show their work but also take in mentorship, seminars, grant-writing workshops, placement advice, and other benefits that artists can almost never expect, much less receive.
In the 10 years since the fellowship program got its start, Hamiltonian has grown from an upstart experiment to an outstanding platform. (Lin-Manuel Miranda’s got nothing to do with it: In physics, a “Hamiltonian” refers to the total measure of energy within a system.) Where other gallery stables mix sure bets with promising rookies, Hamiltonian is all about the untested artists. The gallery typically mounts shows pairing two aspiring artists working with similar (or wildly contrasting) themes or media. When artist fellows are ready for a breakout solo show—rising stars such as Christie Neptune, Larry Cook, and Naoko Wowsugi—the gallery gives them room to flex. And the mostly unseen professional-services dimension of the fellowship program helps D.C. retain young artists, something that’s harder and harder to do for a city with such high housing costs.
Dan Perkins, Rob Hackett, Amy Boone-McCreesh, Elena Volkova, Jonathan Monaghan, Jessica van Brakle, James Rieck: Hamiltonian has a proven record in finding and drafting fellows who go on to be mainstays in the art community. Quietly, the gallery has built a reputation for allowing young artists to go all out, to put on the kinds of intensive and immersive sculpture, installation, and video-art shows that are so difficult for artists to do after leaving their MFA cocoons. The annual Hamiltonian fellow group shows are more than a preview of what’s coming next for the gallery—they’re a document of what’s happening now in the District.

Trump employing a “wag the dog” strategy, in which he highlights his leadership on an international crisis to divert attention from domestic political problems, is reminiscent of President Bill Clinton’s threats to attack Serbia in early 1999 as his impeachment trial was underway over his sexual relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky. – Robert Parry, posted on Consortiumnews.com
Robert Parry has a blue chip track record as an investigative reporter. He broke many news stories about the Iran-Contra affair for AP and Newsweek (back when mainstream news sources were a lot less fake) and he broke the story revealing the CIA was trafficking cocaine with the Contras in the United States in the 1980’s (we’re confident the CIA has upped its drug dealing game now that it has control of the poppy crops in Afghanistan).
Despite apparent internal dispute over the validity of the intelligence that Assad’s regime unleased a poison gas attack on ISIS, president Trump bombed Syrian air force assets. According one of Parry’s CIA sources, the gas attack was a staged “false flag” event designed to provoke Trump into reversing his recent policy pronouncement that it would not seek regime change in Syria. It’s also been questioned as to whether or not the gas released was even Sarin.
Amusingly, the staunch neoconservative propaganda rag known as the “Washing Post” published an editorial questioning the legitimacy of Trump’s missile attack. Even some of the war-thirsty lunatics on Fox News were questioning the decision.
The U.S. has lost its economic and political edge in the global community. The evidence of this mounts. Russia and China (and other eastern bloc countries) are accumulating physical gold hand-over-fist as part of a strategy to bolster their currencies and remove the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.
China and Japan, the two largest financiers of the United States’ debt-fueled consumerism and Government deficit spending, have been quietly reducing the amount of Treasuries they hold and are willing to buy.
It’s become apparent to most outside of the United States, and to some inside, that the U.S. has become one big fraud. The stock market is artificially propped up to prevent a crash that would wipe out America’s retirement funding assets and collapse the banking system; via the Fed, the U.S. has orchestrated a flow of funds system by which a few of its puppet Central Banks (Belgium, Swizterland and Ireland – the value of Ireland’s U.S. Treasury holdings now exceeds its GDP) fund Treasury debt auctions; and a propaganda-based political system has been created that would make Joseph Goebbels blind with envy.
At the root of this fraud is a fraudulent monetary system that requires the Central Bank, together with the Treasury Department, to control the price of gold for as long as possible. This is accomplished via the issuance of an unending supply of paper “fake” gold to help keep the “market” price of gold in check on the Comex and the LBMA.
At some point the demand for physically delivered gold and silver from the east will sabotage the paper manipulation operation. That’s point at which the United States will collapse. In today’s episode, the Shadow of Truth discusses the latest events driving U.S. politics and markets:

Hong Kong and London -- (November 2, 2015) - Mirae Asset Global Investments (Hong Kong) Limited ("Mirae Asset Global Investments"), announced the launch of the Mirae Asset Next Asia Pacific Equity Fund (the "Fund"), which is its first product to be co-managed with Daiwa Asset Management Co. Ltd. ("Daiwa Asset Management").
The Fund seeks to achieve long-term capital growth by investing in Asia Pacific including Japan equities in multiple industries which are expected to benefit from long term trends in the region. Investor appetite for Asian Pacific equities is steadily increasing as the region continues to achieve greater economic integration and open trade, while long term trends such as the growth of a burgeoning middle class and upgrades in economic efficiency and liberalization achieved by new administrations in several Asian countries underpin strong structural tailwinds for long term growth.
The Fund is managed by Masaki Takebayashi, Senior Portfolio Manager at Daiwa Asset Management, and Joohee An, Senior Portfolio Manager at Mirae Asset Global Investments. The portfolio managers leverage the two companies' extensive on-the-ground research presence of 138 investment professionals in the Asia Pacific including Japan region. The collaborative investment process is driven by fundamental bottom-up research analysis and high conviction stock selection.
Jung Ho Rhee, Chief Executive Officer at Mirae Asset Global Investments said: "We are excited to partner with Daiwa Asset Management, which is one of Japan's largest asset managers. Both Daiwa Asset Management and Mirae Asset Global Investments possess excellent track records in managing Japanese and emerging market equities, respectively. We will work together seamlessly to achieve alpha by leveraging our breadth and depth of local market insights."
"With greater levels of trade liberalization and economic integration, Asia Pacific including Japan has potential to be viewed as a single region for asset allocation by investors. The region continues to show dynamism and is rapidly becoming one of the world's largest and most populous consumer markets. Growth in the investible universe of companies and improvements in corporate governance means that the region is becoming more accessible for investors looking for diversified investment opportunities."
Daiwa Asset Management and Mirae Asset Global Investments have a long-standing partnership. Since 2010, both companies jointly distributed 14 funds together in Korea and Japan, ranging from single country funds, thematic funds, a dividend equity fund and a fixed income fund. Daiwa Asset Management and Mirae Asset Global Investments aim to launch the Fund in a wide range of markets, including countries in Asia and Europe.
The Mirae Asset Next Asia Pacific Equity Fund is a Sub-Fund of the Mirae Asset Global Discovery Fund SICAV, a Luxembourg-domiciled UCITS. It will be registered for public distribution in selected jurisdictions in Asia and Europe and will be made available to both retail and institutional investors.
Launched in 1997, Mirae Asset Global Investments Group has over 120 investment professionals focusing on emerging market portfolio construction. As of end September 2015, Mirae Asset manages over US$73 billion in client assets, spread across the full spectrum of asset classes and investment solutions.. This makes us one of the world's largest managers of emerging market equities[1]. We focus on actively managed, high-conviction emerging market portfolios through a bottom-up investment process rooted in team-based on-the-ground research. Mirae Asset has offices across regions worldwide, including in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom the United States, and Vietnam.
Daiwa Asset Management Co. Ltd. is a fully owned subsidiary of "Daiwa Securities Group Inc.". Daiwa Asset Management Co. Ltd. has been operating since 1959, and is the second-largest asset management company in Japan based on assets under management of publicly offered investment trusts. As the end of September 2015, we manage over 550 funds, with an AUM of US$125 billion across various asset classes. Daiwa Asset Management maintains its offices in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore and India along with a branch office in Shanghai. Daiwa Asset Management has exceptional track record in Asian equities including Japanese equities and global bond funds. We have extensive experience in the asset management business and we manage outstanding professional teams to achieve our goals.

This highly acclaimed blog is primarily focused on private money management, financial services, and investments. John Mauldin demonstrates an unusual breadth of expertise, as illustrated by the wide variety of issues addressed in-depth in his writings.
This week we survey the economic landscape that the new president will inherit. It is a polite understatement to say that he will be getting a serious mess. In reality, the US goes to the polls this next Tuesday to elect a Janitor-in-Chief. He will face a task that rivals that of Hercules in cleaning out the Stygian stables (legendary huge stables that had not been mucked out for ten years). However, there are no convenient rivers at hand for a probable President Obama to redirect that will quickly be able to clean out the mess left in the stables of our economy. This will indeed be an Herculean task and one that will take most of the first term of the next administration. So, let's look at what will face the next president. It should make for an interesting, even if not optimistic, letter....
Warren Buffett says buy. Jeremy Grantham says it will get worse. Both are celebrated value investors. Who is right? It all depends upon your view of the third derivative of investing. Today we look at valuations in the stock market. This is the second part of a speech I have given in the past few weeks in California and Stockholm. I am updating the numbers, as the target keeps moving. While from one perspective things look rather difficult, from another there is a ray of hope. What can you expect to earn from stocks over the next five years? It should make for an interesting letter. Note: this will be a little longer than usual, but part of it is there are a LOT of charts. I should note that I am rewriting this on Monday. For the first time in over 8 years, I missed my Friday night deadline (see below). Last week's title for the letter was "The Economic Blue Screen of Death." By that I referred to the old "blue screen of death" that we used to get on early versions of Microsoft MS-DOS and Windows. You could be working away and suddenly, for no apparent reason, the computer would freeze up and you would get a blue screen. The only thing you could do was unplug the computer and hit the reset button - losing everything that was not saved when the computer crashed....
This week I am in California giving two speeches to the Financial Planning Associations of San Diego and Orange County. This and next week's letters will be the broad outline of the speech. We will look at how the retreat of the American consumer will affect the stock market. Has the recent drop (can we say crash, gentle reader?) in stock market valuations given us an opportunity to find value? We look at some very powerful evidence that suggests that may be so. Then we look at the counter to that view. Are we at the bottom, or is there more pain? And given the current state of affairs, how should we then invest? Where do we put our money to work when the dust settles, as it surely will. As I noted above, this will be a two-part letter, finishing up next week. It will also print out a lot longer than normal as I have a lot of PowerPoint slides that are really important for you to see. A note to the 25% of my one million-plus readers who are outside the US: I am using illustrations from the US stock market to discuss timing and valuations, but the principles will translate to markets worldwide. In fact, considering that most stock markets worldwide are down even more than the US markets, they may be even more applicable. The time to become bullish on a lot of markets may be closer than we think. Let's jump right in....
I have been writing for almost a year that the next shoe to drop on US banks would be commercial construction lending. Today we look at some hard numbers. We look across the pond to sort out the problems in Europe. We look at the consequences of the losses stemming from Lehman. Then we look at one of the more serious consequences of the banking crisis, one that will bring the crisis home to you. Finally, we look at what the various governments of the world must do in response. It may not be fun, but it should be interesting. And it is important. Feel free to forward this letter to anyone who asks why we not only need the bailout but will need even more coordinated government action....
The 'Bailout Plan' was passed. Will it work? The answer depends on what your definition of 'work' is. If by work you mean no more government intervention and no further costly programs and a functioning market, then the answer is no. But there are things it will do. This week I try to help you see what might lie ahead around the Curve in the Road. We look at how the rescue plan will function, see what is happening in the economy, and finally muse as to whether Muddle Through is really in our future. It will make for an interesting, if not very upbeat, letter, so strap in. I would like your promise to not shoot the messenger. I am just trying to give you some of my thoughts as to what may lie in our future. And remember, as you read this, we will get through it. There are better days a'coming....

Today is the International Day of Peace at the United Nations. It is celebrated with a theme, with meetings, with videos, and is undertaken each year with a view to bringing the voice of peace into the halls of the United Nations during the Organization’s plenary opening sessions each year. It is a beautiful event.
I had the opportunity to be present the day before to moderate an important event entitled “Completing the Legacy of Nuremberg: Activating the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over the crime of aggression in 2017”. The meeting was convened by the Permanent Mission of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, and featured remarks by the Foreign Ministers of Lichtenstein and Costa Rica, and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein. Former Nuremberg Prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz could not attend, having been opportuned by Hurricane Irma’s untimely and tempestuous appearance, but sent his best wishes and encouragement.
The meeting was well-attended with many governments and NGOs taking the floor. The overall sentiment of the room was that the aggression amendments are an important element of completing the Rome Statute, and should be activated promptly in December when the ICC Assembly of States Parties is in session. Divisions amongst States remained regarding the jurisdictional regime, with the UK and France urging that ICC States Parties needed to “opt in” to the regime and others asserting that ICC States Parties needed to “opt out” of the aggression amendments, if they did not want to bound by them. All States attending, however, seemed eager to resolve these differences and show their support for the Court. Earlier that day, an important new treaty was opened for signature, the treaty banning nuclear weapons, a treaty supported by 122 countries, but no NATO members, all of whom refused to attend the negotiations except for The Netherlands, which attended, called for a vote, and then voted “no.”
U.S. President Donald Trump addressing the UN General Assembly, September 19, 2017 (Source: UN Photos/Kim Haughton)
In spite of the progress the meeting and the adoption of this new treaty represented, however, a shadow hung over the room, and the United Nations more generally. It was, alas, the shadow of the mushroom cloud. For in the halls of that organization, the only place in the entire world in which every nation in the world can come, and in the words of Eleanor Roosevelt, “meet and talk,” the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, had just the day before threatened to “totally destroy” an entire country.
Of course, Trump could have been employing a figure of speech, but it seems unlikely. Just days before, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations had noted that the U.S. military were looking at their options, and Trump had threatened “fire and fury” earlier in the summer. “Destroy” means to “end the existence of something by damaging or attacking it,” or to “defiant (someone) entirely.” It’s not an ambiguous term, and Trump has subsequently doubled down on it.
Trump’s speech violates international law, not just the niceties of international diplomacy. Article 2(4) of the Charter condemns the “threat” as well as the “use” of force, as the International Court of Justice noted in its Advisory Opinion on the Legality of Nuclear Weapons has observed. Threats that escalate potentially volatile situations are not only unhelpful, as they are unlikely to calm the nerves of the leaders of would be victim States (and may even provoke them to action), but are unlawful. As a Head of State, Trump engages the international responsibility of the United States of America. In other words, we the people, are technically legally responsible for, even if opposed to, his actions.
Threats accompanied by action are even more problematic. Any first strike by the United States against North Korea at this time would undoubtedly violate the UN Charter, and constitute an act of aggression as defined in Article 8bis of the International Criminal Court Statute. Any military action taken with the aim of “destroying” an entire country of 25 million people would also presumably involve the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity and, potentially, genocide, as well.
The appalling tenor of the 45th President’s speech taken in context with his other remarks, and the upset it caused not only at the United Nations itself but throughout the world is why Justice Weeramntry wrote, in his separate and Dissenting Opinion in the Nuclear Weapons case, that the “existential threat” of the mushroom cloud is one of the evils of nuclear weapons and why they should be per se unlawful. He noted that this threat “pervades all thoughts about the human future [and hangs] . . . like a blanket of doom over the thoughts of children in particular, is an evil in itself and will [be so as] long as nuclear weapons remain.”

Church of Christ ! I new of your Dad through I believe your uncle Jim Exum, & his wife Clara. We worshiped together,also Clara’s sister Wanda
a rascale because he had to beat Him(your Dad) to be first to be with the LORD! Talking to you is a special treat to me First because we have in common some of your family,but most of all We are Family(brothers in the LORD!!!) I am really sorry for your Loss of a GREAT Man & Woman.The LORDS Church Will be somewhat empty without them!!! I know we can rejoice in that they are with the LORD!!!
I just came across this book Church Issues can we survive,must we divide. Have to tell you Just seeing your Dads name took me back to the late 70’s &the relatationships I was blessed to have!!!. I am in Kingman Arizona right now. I just had a tradgey in my life,I lost my wife to cancer in march of 2014. Look forward to hearing from you.
It is so nice to hear from one who knew mom and dad. I heard dad saying the same thing about Uncle Jimmy.
For a time, dad didn’t (couldn’t) share his pain when he lost his brother. Dad’s passing has left an obvious
‘void’ in the church. I still get phone calls and letters from people who knew, loved and appreciated him.
He was one of the few who had the courage to speak out on God’s grace, the Holy Spirit, as well as ‘church issues’.
Now, I listen to him on tape and watch him on VHS and am just amazed. I remember listening to his audio tape on
the Holy Spirit while driving home from Alabama (I was trying out for the job of minister there), and I was
amazed! I had to replay it all the way home… His presentation was followed up with a Q and A session. His lesson
changed everything for me, as did his message on “Amazing Grace.” Now, I am considering putting dad’s TUD lessons
I am glad that you have set up this website and that I ran across it. Years ago we hosted TUD and found it to be the most positive preaching I ever heard. I had made the first contact with the program and was told that Jack was so busy that er would have to wait two or three years for him to conduct the meeting, but could have another speaker sooner. We decided to wait and I am so glad that we did. I was a fairly young Christian when w held the first TUD and continued to schedule them regularly in about three year intervals. You don’t mention his appearances in Southern California, where we live, but there are many in our area who still remember the meetings.
This has become too long but someday I would like to tell you a personal incident that went on here involving Jack and a touching thing my wife did for Ann.
Last thing is, I am so glad to have had a little of Jack in my life. The audio “Wisdom Box” was touching and brought tears as I was reminded of his very special manner of preaching.
Beginning this year I began and am continuing dad’s Three Unusual Days ministry and am booking into 2015… and am using much of his materials and illustrations. Of course I have ‘made them my own’ and use my own style…
Saying thank you, hardly expresses my thanks for the good work you have done on this site. Your efforts have made it possible for people around the world to be blessed by this web site. I highly recommend any and all to visit Earl’s site http://www.earlshelpdesk.com. I believe he will do a great job in helping you. All the best Earl,
Jack ~ I am so grateful to be able to take part in helping you to build this site. ~ I have memories of being very young and reading your dad’s articles in the Lake City Reporter. No matter what the topic was each time, I always felt as if I had walked away a better person having read it. The articles always expressed such a sense of power and knowledge to me. As I worked with each article, I once again felt that feeling. It seems that you also possess this gift of writing; this power to “move” people. I’ve enjoyed your recent articles both here and in the local newspaper. It is my sincere hope that as you continue to build this site and fill it with both memories and with new articles that people all over the world will also be able to walk away feeling like a better person having visited this site.

The mass of the neutrino is one of the most intriguing questions of particle physics. On the one hand, there is no fundamental principle for the neutrino to be massless; on the other hand, a neutrino mass implies an extension of the Standard Model (Fig.1) of elementary physics. "An answer" would represent a fundamental milestone in particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Most likely, the neutrino mass is too small and therefore out of reach of precision studies of the kinematics of decays involving neutrinos. The only possibility to get information is the observation of a process which can only occur if the neutrino has non vanishing mass. Neutrino oscillations are such a process. For a massive neutrino, a given weak interaction eigenstate (nu_e, nu_mu, nu_tau) may be seen as a different eigenstate at some distance from the source. The corresponding probability has an "oscillatory" behavior (hence oscillation) with parameters which can be determined by experiments. In the simplified scheme in which oscillation "occurs" dominantly between a pair of neutrino flavours, they are described by two quantities: the mixing parameter sin²2(Theta) (related to the oscillation amplitude) and the mass squared difference Delta m² between the two mass eigenstates (related to the "frequency oscillation"). The sensitivity of the experimental searches to the above parameters depends on the neutrino energy E and on the distance L of the detector from the neutrino source. The oscillation probability is given by the following equation:
So far only the disappearance of neutrinos has been experimentaly observed. The conclusive test of the nu_mu <-> nu_tau oscillation hypothesis will be the direct observation of nu_tau appearance in an initially pure nu_mu beam, as proposed in OPERA. The sensitivity of OPERA covers the Delta m² region allowed by the present atmospheric data (Fig. 1). In the case of a positive signal, the observation of even a few nu_tau events will be significant, because of the very low expected background. The number of observed nu_tau events will provide a measurement of the product of the two oscillation parameters sin²2(Theta) and Delta m² in the two flavour mixing scheme. Given the already known constraint of nearly maximum mixing (sin²2(Theta) ~1), OPERA can improve the determination of Delta m².

On June 7, 1797, the US Senate ratified a treaty with Tripoli, which President John Adams signed into law three days later. This Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1796 was one of four maritime agreement between the infantile United States and the Maghrib States (Tripoli, Algiers, Morocco, and Tunis), known in the west as the Barbary Coast. These treaties were meant to protect American ships in the Mediterranean from pirates operating in the region.
The treaties soon failed, largely because of the toll of payments owed to the Maghrib States and the pirates’ continued ransoming of American sailors. President Adams opted to pay the ransoms and tributes, but his slave-owning Southern successor Thomas Jefferson refused to pay the North African states, sparking a war during the first year of Jefferson’s presidency, the first of two conflicts known as the Barbary Wars.
Late during the Obama Administration, several commentators on both the left and right compared Obama’s foreign policies to the Barbary Wars. An article in The Atlantic called US involvement in the 2011 Libyan Civil War “The Third Barbary War.” Others compared the Barbary pirates to ISIS, while those on the far right erroneously claimed that Jefferson went to war with Islamic terrorists.
Both camps miss the point: as usual, those on the right conflate terrorists with literally every other state-with-Muslims-in-it in history, while liberal commentators misrepresent Barbary piracy as comparable to religious terrorism. Historian Max Boot notes that both the US and Britain utilized piracy in the same ways, noting that “the corsairs of North Africa were no more–and no less–piratical than Sir Francis Drake or Sir John Hawkins. . . both of whom operated as privateers” and that “the US government was so attached to this practice that it refused to sign the 1856 Declaration of Paris outlawing privateering as a weapon of war” (8).
Furthermore, twenty-first century US Middle-Eastern policy differs ideologically from Jefferson’s. Edward Said points out that in the US, unlike Britain and France during this period, “there was no deeply invested tradition of Orientalism. . . the imaginative investment [in the Orient] was never made either, perhaps because the American frontier, the one that counted, was the westward one” (290). The US was interested in controlling the narrative, and therefore the economic value, of the American West (e.g. the Louisiana Purchase) rather than North Africa, which is perhaps the opposite of the Bush/Obama/Trump era.
While the Barbary Wars are easy to exploit for ideological op-eds, the pre-war treaties are more instructive. Specifically, the 1796 Treaty demonstrates that the early US conceptualized itself on equal footing with other seafaring powers, and was willing to alter the national identity it presented to that end.
Consisting of twelve articles, the 1796 Treaty proclaims first that there “is a firm and perpetual Peace and friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and subjects of Tripoli of Barbary” (Article I) and that the two states should avoid naval conflicts with one another. As such, the Treaty states that trade “is on the same footing with those of the most favoured nations respectively (Article IX).
Article XI is now controversial for its implications, and is worth quoting at length: “As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion,-as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of [Muslims],-and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any [Islamic] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.”
Here, the US emphasizes at length that it does not have a bias against the Maghrib States on religious grounds. Yet Article XI is still out-of-place. In a strictly economic treaty, the US stresses religious difference, or its indifference to religion. Despite Article XI’s clear message, there is overwhelming evidence of a legalized bias against non-Christians after Independence. Gaustad and Schmidt write that “Delaware’s 1776 constitution required all public officials to swear their belief ‘in God the Father, in Jesus Christ His only Son, and in the Holy Ghost.’. . Pennsylvania in 1790 vowed to deny state offices to any atheist as well as to anyone who did not believe in ‘a future state of awards and punishments.’ Only Protestants could be elected in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia–according to their constitutions” (131).
And yet, in the 1796 Treaty, the US publicly reshaped its cultural identity in order to make the treaty more appealing. American culture warriors insist that national identity is non-negotiable, but Article XI contradicts this at an international level. In contrast, the US crafted its national identity as an open slate, not just for states but as a union. From the beginning, malleability was intentional, not a growing list of exceptions to the rule. Malleability was the whole point of America.
I want to argue here that the US had a global consciousness from its inception, and not just when it entered World War One. Instead, it built its global consciousness on the trading and military strategies of Britain and France, as well as its own perception of itself as a frontier space, as a blank chalkboard upon which its leaders could draw and erase American identity. Like the imagined Frontier, America was made to sustain multiple contradictions in what it was. A savage but easily conquered wilderness, a piratical state against piracy, not built on Christianity but where only Christians can be elected.
The land-owning businessmen who created America self-consciously crafted a flexible state that was easy to change as needed. The problem is that the mechanisms of change, of political dynamics, are still in the hands of economic elites.
The Barbary Treaties demonstrate a deliberate American flexibility, an exchange of identity for financial expansion. If this flexibility is more openly acknowledged, even utilized–if we finally recognized America’s founding blankness–then more people might be able to survive and even thrive in America. Until then, the nation is a chalkboard ruled by people who only know how to use the erasers.

Author : Thomas Dixon Original Title : The Southerner – A Romance of the Real Lincoln Ebook Format : PDF Language : English Description : Southern regional writer Thomas Dixon explores the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln in this 1913 novel. Tom seated himself at the table and looked into his wife’s face with a smile: “Nancy, it’s a meal fit for a king!” The supper over, he smoked his pipe before the cabin fire of blazing logs, while she cleared the wooden dishes. He watched her get the paper, goose-quill pen and ink as a prisoner sees the scaffold building for his execution. “Now we’re all ready,” she said cheerfully. The man laid his pipe down with a helpless look. A brief respite flashed through his mind. Maybe he could sidestep the lessons before she pinned him down. “Lord, Nancy, I forgot my gun. I must grease her right away,” he cried. He rose with a quick decisive movement and took his rifle from the rack. She knew it was useless to protest and let him have his way. Over every inch of its heavy barrel and polished walnut stock he rubbed a piece of greased linen with loving…
Author : – Ebook Format : PDF Language : English Description : Aesop’s Fables, or the Aesopica, is a collection of fables credited to Aesop, a slave and storyteller believed to have lived in ancient Greece between 620 and 564 BCE. Of diverse origins, the stories associated with his name have descended to modern times through a number of sources and continue to be reinterpreted in different verbal registers and in popular as well as artistic media. The fables originally belonged to the oral tradition and were not collected for some three centuries after Aesop’s death. By that time a variety of other stories, jokes and proverbs were being ascribed to him, although some of that material was from sources earlier than him or came from beyond the Greek cultural sphere. The process of inclusion has continued until the present, with some of the fables unrecorded before the later Middle Ages and others arriving from outside Europe. The process is continuous and new stories are still being added to the Aesop corpus, even when they are demonstrably more recent work and sometimes from known authors. Manuscripts in Latin and Greek were important avenues of transmission, although poetical treatments in European…
Author : Charles Dickens Ebook Format : PDF Language : English Description : A Christmas Carol. In Prose.

Carrie Underwood has unveiled her brand-new single, "Cry Pretty." Readers can press play above to hear the track and see its lyric video, released Wednesday morning (April 11).
Written by Underwood, Hillary Lindsey, Liz Rose and Lori McKenny, Underwood says the title of "Cry Pretty" refers to when emotions take over and you just can’t hold them back."
"It really speaks to a lot of things that have happened in the past year, and I hope when you hear it, you can relate those feelings to those times in your life," she adds. "It’s emotional. It’s real. And it ROCKS!"
In "Cry Pretty," Underwood sings, "You can pretty lie, and say it’s okay / You can pretty smile, and just walk away / Pretty much fake your way through anything / But you can’t cry pretty." The song is the first single from Underwood's forthcoming, yet-to-be-announced new album; she will officially debut the track at the 2018 ACM Awards.
Fans know that Underwood has been working on new music; she recently shared a photo of herself in the recording studio. Whenever she releases her next album, it will be her first since she released Storyteller in 2015. She's co-producing the project with writer and producer David Garcia, whom she met in 2017.
"We hit it off in a big way," Underwood says. "I’ve always been lucky to have a voice in the writing and recording process, but this is the first time I am this involved in the production of my music. It’s been challenging and incredibly rewarding to be involved in every aspect from start to finish. David has been an amazing teacher and partner, and I’m so proud of what we have created."
After co-hosting the 2017 CMA Awards in November, Underwood suffered a serious fall outside her Nashville-area home that required surgery on her wrist and dozens of stitches in her face. She has been careful to conceal her face in most of her social media posts in the months since then; in fact, her recent in-studio photo is one of the few in which fans can see her unobscured face.

After Storyteller came out, Underwood spent much of 2016 touring in support of the record, and then, for the most part, took 2017 off. Underwood's 2018 calendar is still largely open, though she will headline WE Fest 2018, in Detroit Lakes, Minn., in August. She recently shared a photo of herself in rehearsals for some sort of live performance; she admits that she and her team are "already talking about a tour," but hasn't yet shared any details.
This post is an attempt to come up with a Law on the fundamental nature of power, which I call ‘Aragorn’s Law’. To begin with, we state three propositions.

Jargon is a nerd’s best friend Economists love to talk about ‘externalities’. ‘Externality’ is a wonderfully complex-sounding word that makes you feel more intelligent just by saying it.

As with birth rates, we use data for 4 categories of countries from 1990 to 2015 (100 observations total). We have two explanatory variables, AGE and Y, where AGE is defined as the percentage of the population aged over 65 and Y is per capita GDP.
While the results are not as good as with the birth rates calculations, it is nevertheless a good enough fit and the explanatory variables have a strong enough confidence factor to be usable in our estimations.
While the t-scores on the squared and cubed terms are low, the number of observations are also limited.

The processes and questions that come along with taking a large teaching hospital into Web 2.0 territory
One of the things that I have yet to master in this position is how to collect and measure the impact of our use of social media in spreading our message. Currently I have this crazy 8 tabbed excel document where I collect statistics from Twitter, Youtube, Facebook, Podcast listens, and blogger mentions.
I am not sure what each piece really means but when I put it all together on the summary page, I think the numbers tell a story.
The one problem I have with collecting this report is the fact that is has been up to this point so manual. However, I am starting to find all kinds of great little tools that wrap the data up in a nice format that makes it easy to dump into my report.
Today I happened upon a really nice tool called Twitterholic! Twitterholic gives me all pf the twitter stats I really care about aside from our mentions... which I pull from my SM2 reports anyway. You can also get competitive data!
Do you have any tools that you use to collect data, that you would care to share with the readers? If so leave comments! I am really exited to see what else might be out there to help us to really understand the impact of social media use in buisness / healthcare communications.
I had the pleasure of meeting with our development office a few days ago. They had been quite hesitant about venturing into social media as a communications tool until now. What is different about now?
2) A patient/donor went and started a Facebook causes for the hospital without our knowledge or permission, and with the wrong non profit information!
I went into the meeting with my trusty presentation. I presented the user data I talked about the current online giving trends, and how according to the Washington Post In September, his single biggest month of fund raising, Obama amassed more than 65 percent of his record-shattering haul -- $100 million of the $150 million -- from online donations. Then I started showing examples of our national competitors and their use of social media to raise money... That is when the snickering started to subside.
I all honesty I did not know much about social media in the philanthropy space until I started researching to prepare for this. I learned a great deal from James at Convio. who sent me some great examples of applications. I read a few blog post, most from the Chronicle of Philanthropy... but those left me with more questions than answers.
Then I just started to search. I began to try to think like a donor. Someone who has been affected by cancer, and who might be searching online or in their existing social networks for a way to give back. That is when I started to see some overwhelming trends. I honestly found just a handful of organizations that were even making themselves available to be found and accept financial gifts online for cancer research. Those are the examples I put in my presentation.
For one organization I found at least 5 social channels where they were attempting to raise funds, when I added all of the funds that were donated to them through these 5 channels it added up to over $20,000. Now I know that is not the 10 million dollar gift that some hospitals may be accustomed to. But that is 20,000 that they did not have before, and $20,000 that they spend $0 to solicit for and collect. No mailing, no postage, no donor event... nothing.
In the question and answer part of the discussion there were lots of air quotes being thrown around in disbelief of the intentions "fans" and concern over not being able to "capture" the donor information. A few still did not really understand why or how, but I think the last word came from one of initial naysayers. After all of the discussions he mentioned once again how he could not believe or understand why so many people would put so much information online about themselves... "It must be an ego thing" but he began making an effort to verbalize how he saw this working into his vision of the campaign. He may not have really gone away understanding how it works, but I think that they began to understand that it is indeed going to have to be an essential part of their fundraiser communications mix.
Overall I am excited about working on this project. I love to see the evolution of thinking that occurs as a new group learns this method of communication. I think however this ends up fitting into the donation raising communications mix it will be beneficial to their overall goal of getting people involved in the fight against cancer.
I knew this was coming, but could not have predicted that it would happen so soon. I have 2 examples of the business of medicine actually taking place within twitter. I just had to share my excitement.
A colleague here at the hospital told me about this one. What is happening here is a Doctor in South Africa is at bedside asking a Doctor in India for real time assistance with a diagnosis. From other correspondence he has with this doctor in India, it is clear that he knows him personally and/or professionally, so he is a trusted source from the requestor's position.
From the message it sounds like he was probably bedside, maybe in a rural area. If you follow the stream it ends there. I expect that if the doctor replied it was probably in the form of a direct message. Which is a private message between 2 twitter users.
My colleague said that "if this was not a first, it was among the first time that he has seen this happen." Especially in places where you might not have access to experts. The personal relationships you develop could extend all the way to the bedside, no matter where the bedside is.
This one may be a little contriversial, but there is no doubt in it's effectiveness. A researcher in her process of tweeting about what she is doing in the process of her work day. She mentions that she is looking for study participants. She is not cohersive, she mentions no less, no more.
Let me first say that it is clear that she is still a new twitter user. She has very few followers. Also, from what I can tell, no one re-tweeted this information. Despite that, right away someone who fits the criteria thanks her for the information and signs up for the study.
Clearly there is potential here. I am excited to keep watching to see how this develops. If you have any good examples of the business of medicine happening in twitter, please share. Thank's to both of these twitterers for seeing the possiblities and testing the envelope.

Unlike many strong, able-bodied young men who prefer to idle, 101-year-old Joseph Alexander Morgan is lamenting his inability to work.
"I was born as a hustler, and when the body won't allow me to do something, it bothers me a lot," said Morgan, beaming.
"According to my desire, I was never a street idler like others. I born to work and I love to work. The body is just not in the best of health. The joints are weak. I am confused sometimes because I am not able to work."
Last Saturday, Morgan was the eldest of 40 members - 12 males and 28 females - 70 years old and over, who were recognised for faithful service to the Asia Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) Church in south Manchester. He was also coincidentally celebrating his 101st birthday, a rare privilege for a man, as it is women who generally make it to the century club in Jamaica.
'Tata', as he is affectionately called, is the father of five children - two sons and three daughters. He was born on April 3, 1909 in the quiet district of Farm, a neighbouring community of Asia, Manchester. He is one of two siblings who grew up without much education and decided to make a living from the soil.
"He grew every crop you could think of," said his 71-year-old daughter, Kathline. "He also grew lots of citrus, which he sold at the market for a living."
She added: "He is very nice to be around. He gives a lot of jokes and loves to talk. Sometimes he would talk until I fall asleep, but if no one is around, he sits quietly and meditate, you would think that no one is in the house."
Mention the name Tata and the words 'kind', 'caring' and 'hard-working' will come from the lips of church and community members in Asia.
"His eyes were on us as children that we do the right things as we grew up," said Ezra Fider, a former neighbour of Tata and an elder at the Asia church.
"He is one of the kindest human being, who never spared anything to share. My brother and I would wonder if he would ever have enough to give everybody, because he was so kind," Fider added.
"God keeps me. I still enjoy my yellow yam, sweet potato, banana and dumpling now and then," he said.
Morgan does not suffer from the lifestyle illnesses that are common among people his age, and even much younger.
"His main problem is his knees," said Kathline. "He can still walk by himself with a stick and does not suffer from diabetes or pressure like me. He does a medical check-up every three months and the doctor is always quite pleased with the result."
A touch from God about 38 years ago, through inspirational music Tata heard at the Asia SDA one Friday evening, led him to his neighbour Rosetta Fider. Subsequently, he became a member of the church.
"From the first day I went to church and returned for lunch that day, I looked at the pipe and it's like the pipe said, 'Si mi yah,' and I said, 'Wait little fus,' and from that day I told it 'wait little fus' I have not smoked again."
Thomas Rose, pastor of Asia SDA, said Morgan, who lives near the church, can recall who preaches each Sabbath.
"He has a special seat where he sits at home and listens to the sermons and song services when he is not able to attend church," said the pastor.
"Prior to capitalism, the way people amassed great wealth was by looting, plundering and enslaving their fellow man." -Walter E. Williams
With Obama winning the elections (Ohio just went for Obama), a fraction of us are asking ourselves how low will the US go? It's not so much Obama that you should be worried about. He's reasonably smart and has taken steps toward the center after winning the primaries. But the real worry is that the Democrats could get sixty Senators elected. This would strip the Republicans of their ability to use filibuster. The US federal budget could get out of hands. (In all fairness, it already is out of hands.) Keynesian economic policies with emphasis on short-term results (Keynes himself stated that "In the long run we're all dead.") could once again dominate. Obama is known for not going against his party so I don't think we will be seeing many vetoes. (Again, in all fairness, not that we have seen many vetoes during the Bush years.) Also, Obama has already surrounded himself with questionable individuals who may end up in powerful positions. However, despite Obama's will to tax & spend it may be reality, according to a Nobel laureate economist, that will prescribe Obama with a dose of moderation. Taxing capital gains and dividens won't help the "Main Street", particularly not now when incentives to invest and produce have suffered so much. Worth noting is that Obama's advisors don't even seem to agree on one of Obama's central campaign issues, moving health insurance toward universal coverage.
Funny how those left-wingies who complained about money and media coverage during the last presidential elections are now silent because it's their candidate who's loaded and portrayed in a positive light by the media, unlike John McCain. Compared to MSNCB, FoxNews is fair & balanced. But dominating television and the print media is not enough. Left-wingies in American Congress want to bring the traditionally conservative talk radio closer to the political center via legislation. With Obama in the White House and the Democrats heavily present in Congress the so called Fairness Doctrine may very well pass. (Obama has stated that he opposes it, but since when has Obama had the guts to go against his party?) And if Americans have it bad then Europeans are in a much worse situation. No one endorses McCain. Hell, even The Economist went for Obama after initially supporting McCain. (Not that this was a surprise: you could clearly see The Economist turning toward Obama as a result of McCain's moves toward the religious right.)
Some will wrongfully praise Obama for bringing the troops home, but they're already coming home. It was Bush and McCain who went against public opinion (and that of the Iraq Study Group) and increased the amount of troops in Iraq. This move has brought violence down by more than 90%. Obama says he wants to send more troops after bin Laden, which is not a bad idea (Al Qaeda has seen its repuation fade and killing bin Laden would only increase their peril) but even this has been made possible by the success of the troop surge in Iraq. I have no idea how Obama is going to respond to a nuclear-ambitious Iran.
McCain could have won. He was trailing his fellow Republicans in the primaries and was running out of money. But he managed to attract moderates and independents by being a maverick and a tough SOB in general. Some years back he blasted the religious right by calling them "Agents of Intolerance" and has fought against his own party on many issues such as torture, immigration and climate change. He has staunchly advocated free trade, even slashing farm subsidies in front of a crowd consisting of farmers (though he has also advocated silly ideas such as gas tax holidays). But then he picked Sarah Palin, an inexperienced religious nut, as his vice presidential candidate to attract the Evangelical vote. This naturally contributed to alienating many independents and moderates by turning culture wars into an issue, although not a highly visible issue. Also, McCain didn't fare too well in the debates. Obama sounded smart, like he had a plan to every problem, but he was wrong on the issues. McCain had every opportunity to prove Obama wrong, but it wasn't until the second debate that McCain managed to link Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac to the Democratic establishment and the current credit crisis. McCain's best hope has been his experience on foreign policy issues, a strenght clearly visible in the debates. But that never was enough.
Had Obama lost, the defeat certainly would have been blamed on rednecks and racists, but by now it should be obvious that Obama's race has been a major advantage. At least Europeans are enthusiastic to have a black man in the White House, but this may reflect their own sense of failure concerning Europe's failed immigration policies. It's been a running joke everywhere for years that Republican voters are stupid, but just hear why people support Obama and it's all about some vague change. Many will be voting for Obama strictly because of his skin color, not even knowing what he stands for, as Howard Stern here so vividly demonstrates.
Hopefully the Republicans are able to stage a comeback but only after distancing themselves from the big-government compassionate conservatism of the past eight years. The credit crisis will pose a problem but also an opportunity, so hopefully the Republicans are back in the next midterm elections with plenty of small-government candidates. A new Clintonite era is possible.
Edit: McCain's concession speech made my eyes tear up. I'd like to see a Finnish politican hold a speech like that.

It is with great sorrow that we must report that a terrible tragedy has taken the life of our very close friend and beloved brother Stu Cook. Stu died yesterday (May 5, 2010) at the scene of a horrible head-on traffic accident. Marilyn was with him and she has suffered eleven broken ribs, a deep wound in her upper leg at her hip joint, plus multiple lacerations on her arms and legs, and severe bruising all over her body.
The collision was with a man in a pickup truck. Stu and Marilyn were traveling to attend a regular evening of fellowship with their Bible Study Group.
Pray for Marilyn's healing and comfort. Also for their children and grandchildren and many, many friends...although there's good comfort in knowing that Stu is with the Lord, we will all miss him terribly.
Marilyn's recovery has been remarkable. While there are problems that will remain that impair her somewhat, they have not hindered the work with the children at Lesideng. She is still overseeing the running of the feeding and teaching. She has the love and able assistance of a good sized group of young people from the small congregation of believers in Lesideng that they have been nurturing for years.
We just returned from a 2 month short-term Mission trip to South Africa. Marilyn has recovered and returned to her mission... loving the children of the Lesideng community in Limpopo, South Africa. See "The Faces of Lesideng"

A French walnut enfilade from Burgundy with three drawers and three doors from the 18th century. This French walnut enfilade was born in the 18th century, during the reign of King Louis XV, which saw the development of the Rocaille style in France and spread throughout Europe as the Rococo. This piece features a rectangular planked top with beveled edges sitting above three dovetailed drawers with wooden pulls. Each drawer is separated from its neighbor with a carved oval medallion with Greek cross motif. The three single doors below with their carved panel open to reveal two inner shelves offering ample storage opportunities. The ensemble is raised on four legs, the two in the back being straight and the two in the front being slightly scrolled. A beautifully scalloped apron visually connects the two front legs to one another and creates a perfect counterpoint to the movement designed on the facade. With its rich patina, elegantly balanced lines and great dimensions, this French, 18th century walnut enfilade will be a great decorative choice for any living room or dining room.

This essay analyzes social and political contexts surrounding the phenomenon of feminist books becoming bestsellers during 2015~2016. The formation of feminist reading culture, mostly made up of the young female generation in their 20s and 30s, intersects with the movement for eliminating the discrimination against women in Korea. Women who have been discriminated against as hated objects in their daily lives, working places, mass culture, and political society started to identify themselves as feminists while responding to ongoing current feminist issues. The hashtag movement, “#I_am_a_Feminist”, figuratively reveals this change. Identification as the feminist also occurred in the publishing market, where introductory essay books, strongly asserting the importance of “becoming feminists”, became popular. Furthermore, the increasing number of feminist books published by the crowd funding resources such as “tumblbug” shows one aspect of new feminism that has developed in the mass culture and on the Internet. Another feature of the feminist books bestseller phenomenon is that the number of books are inquiring into the problem of “language.” Books published after the incident of “a murder case in Kangnam station” not only showed the practice of remembrance, sympathy and solidarity, but also became a significant medium for preserving female voices that likely to be fade away. Meanwhile, the books provided an activity for people to find practical words from books, which can be used as a weapon to fight against discrimination. This article tried to reconstruct the contexts and its essential elements related to the phenomenon of feminist books` popularity in 2015-2016. Other topics which are not mentioned in this article, such as the various “Pink spectrum” of feminist books and “changes occurring after reading”, are left for future research and will be discussed later.

Sports betting is popular all around the world and numerous punters enjoy making bets on some of the biggest sporting events almost every day. Being the only type of gambling legalised in many countries, betting on sports was the reason for the launch of many land-based and virtual sportsbooks.
Online bookmakers have become a preferred destination for a large number of betting enthusiasts from different countries. This is all due to the fact that interactive betting expands the wagering options of punters and they can pick the best odds for numerous sporting events. The best part is that they can do it while relaxing in their own homes.
Since virtual betting is constantly evolving, in the past few years, it has also become available to Android users. This is no surprise as people are constantly on their phones and they are looking for convenient ways to stay connected to the world and entertain themselves.
Mobile betting allows punters to enjoy a thrilling adventure and maybe even win money out of it. For those who are excited to try sports betting on their mobile devices, there are a couple of options that allow them to run a virtual sportsbook on their Android smartphones or tablets.
You can opt for placing bets directly by accessing the mobile version of the betting site or installing its app on your Android device. Either way, you can have full control over the stakes you make and the sporting events you are betting on.
If you are eager to place your stakes via your smartphone or tablet, you can use two options to access a virtual sportsbook. There are certain advantages to each one of them but at the end of the day, you are guaranteed to have a great time no matter which option you will choose. Android users can either load the betting site via the browser on their device, or they can download and install a dedicated app that will allow them to make real-money bets.
Android smartphones and tablets are definitely known for their excellent work and great design. Thanks to the constant updates that are done, mobile punters have the chance to enjoy a top-notch betting experience wherever they are, at any time of the day.
Browser-based mobile bookies give bettors the opportunity to access instantly an abundance of sports markets that offer the best odds for some of the most popular sporting events in the world. Thanks to the HTML5 technology, most Android devices can easily load the website of any mobile sportsbook. This means that bettors will benefit from the convenience to bet on numerous games, teams and players as soon as they load the website on their smartphone or tablet.
Some punters believe that browser-based betting is more hassle-free since they will not have to download any additional app. This would mean that they can save the memory storage of their mobile devices. This is definitely something they would have to sacrifice if they want to install the mobile app of the sportsbook.
Those bettors who are lucky enough to have access to betting mobile apps in the Google Play Store can be sure that they will place their stakes at trustworthy bookmakers. This is due to the fact that Android’s designated app store only distributes the betting apps of operators that have met all of its requirements.
The great thing about using mobile betting apps is that the majority of them allow punters to manage their funds through their Android devices. This makes their betting experience a lot more convenient and bettors can make real-money stakes anytime and anywhere.
Since the majority of good interactive sportsbooks are fully compatible with almost every Android device, you can be sure that you will be able to make the same bets, with the same odds, as you would while betting on your desktop device. This means that your experience will be very thrilling even if you bet while on the move.
If this is your first time trying to bet on sports via your smartphone or tablet, you will soon realise that there is nothing complex about utilising this method. In fact, placing your stakes via your Android device is extremely easy and it will take you no time.
Once you have chosen the online sportsbook where you would put your wagers, you can head to the Google Play Store or the official website of the bookie to download and install its mobile app. Do not worry, if you cannot find an application that you can download. You can always opt for accessing the interactive bookmaker straight from the browser of your portable device. No matter which version of mobile betting you will pick, you are guaranteed to have a smooth and fun betting experience.
After choosing the best sportsbook for you, you can use your username and password to log into your existing account. If you are a new member, you can easily open an account both through the mobile app and the browser-based mobile version of the betting site.
The next step is to fund your betting balance. You can easily do that by loading the Cashier section of the app or the website. There, you will see all of the payment solutions accepted by the sportsbook and you will be able to pick your preferred method. Once you confirm the sum you would like to deposit, as well as your banking details, your money will appear in your sportsbook account instantly.
The thing that follows after topping up your balance is picking the stakes you would like to make. Head to the section with the sport you are interested in and you will see all of the available markets that offer some of the best odds for the current popular events. Click on the bet you would like to place and enter the amount of the wager you wish to make. Once you confirm your bet, you are ready to sit back and enjoy the game you have placed your bets on.
Betting on Android devices might seem to you as a strange method to bet money on sports, however, it definitely presents punters with various advantages. Take a look at the positive and negative sides of betting via smartphones and tablets and decide for yourself whether it is worth it to embark on such adventures.
The first and most obvious perk about using your smartphone or tablet for sports betting is the convenience it presents. No matter where you are or what time of the day it is, you can simply grab your mobile device and bet on your current favourite teams and sporting events. Interactive sportsbooks offer a wide range of sports bets and you cannot risk missing some of the best odds on numerous worldwide popular games. If you have a stable Internet connection, you can simply use your Android device to instantly make successful sports bets.
Safety is always an important issue when we are talking about any form of interactive gambling. It is only natural to worry about placing real-money bets at virtual sportsbooks. However, you can be sure that the majority of online bookmakers are holding licences issued by some of the most reliable gambling authorities. This ensures that the sportsbook operator is obliged to comply with the regulations imposed by the jurisdictions in which it offers its services and products.
Since a lot of major virtual bookmakers make sure to fully optimise their mobile apps, punters have the opportunity to make transactions via their Android devices. This will allow them to make fast and secure deposits and withdrawals even when they do not have access to a desktop device. This is considered a great advantage for punters who are constantly on the move.
Another advantage that may motivate you to join a mobile sportsbook is that majority of them offer special deals which are available only for punters who utilise the mobile app of the bookie. This can definitely make your mobile betting more lucrative and fun.
When it comes to interactive betting, in general, there is one major advantage and this is the diversity of betting options. No matter the country you reside in and the sports that are in season where you live, there are always events played in other parts of the world. Virtual sportsbooks allow punters to place stakes on matches played in different locations across the world. What is more, there are so many markets that offer the best odds for various events. Since mobile betting sites are fully compatible to run on almost any Android device, this means that mobile punters will also have the chance to place their stakes on numerous sporting events and enjoy the best odds available.
As for disadvantages, mobile sportsbooks rarely have any. Even though mobile apps can be difficult to be found at the Google Play Store, punters have other options to enjoy their mobile betting. Some virtual bookmakers offer their apps on their official websites. However, if you are using third-party websites to download a sportsbook app, you may put yourself at risk. This is why it is advised to stay away from such mobile apps or opt for browser-based mobile betting sites.
When it comes to placing real-money bets via your Android device, you might have a difficult time to find a mobile app at the Google Play Store. This is because the store abides by the strict laws of various countries and its policy does not allow distributing apps that promote real-money gambling.
Punters had no chance to download real-money betting apps from the Google Play Store, or at least that was the case until recently. In August 2017, Google Play Store has updated its rules about distributing real-money gambling apps. It was announced that punters from the UK, Ireland and France will be able to find betting apps in the company’s dedicated app store and could download them on their Android devices.
This launched a whole host of mobile betting apps in the Google Play Store. However, in order to be able to offer their apps in the store, virtual sportsbooks must meet several requirements. The first one is to hold a valid license issued by the jurisdictions they are targeting. These type of apps also must not use Google payment services and they must be free to download by Android users.
Although bettors from the aforementioned three countries will be able to download betting apps from the Google Play Store, the rest of virtual punters will have to look for alternative methods for installing such apps. Thankfully, many virtual sportsbooks offer their mobile apps on their official websites. Another option is also to use the browser on your smartphone or tablet to simply load the mobile version of the bookie.
You should check the interactive gambling laws in your country, Chances are, you are not allowed to place real-money wagers through your smartphone or tablet.

As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly irritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on to the scene to make it work … Weiterlesen →
If you are like me, you just can't get fresh local ripe tomatoes for most of the year. In fact, for us, our summers are so short that we barely have enough time to harvest our tomatoes before it starts getting cold again! The amount of time we have up here for gardening is very short. It often makes me long to live in a warmer climate where we can enjoy our garden for a longer period of time. The upside is that we are so excited for fresh local produce in the summer that we hit all the local farmers markets as often as possible so we can get our hands on produce we don't grow ourselves. Summer is a fun and wonderful time of year in Vermont, not to mention beautiful!
Since there are about 9 months a year where we can not get fresh local tomatoes, I have put together a homemade salsa that can be made any time of the year. Yes, the tomatoes come from a can, but it still has the homemade "flavor" to it. And hey, anything that's homemade is better for you than store bought! This recipe also comes in handy when you have company and need to whip up something to munch on fast. It's worth a try....you just may like it ☺
Place all ingredients in the bowl of a food processor or chopper. Pulse to a few times until all the ingredients are chopped to your desired consistency. If you like somewhat chunky salsa, add only half of the can of tomatoes at first. After you chop up all the other ingredients, add the second half of the can of tomatoes and pulse once or twice. Store in refrigerator for up to 7 days.

As someone who's been immersed in a number of online industries for quite some time, I know a thing or two about what it takes to succeed in this arena. However, just like you, I started at ground zero with little knowledge, but a great deal of passion. What I learned along the way were some invaluable lessons from failure that hurt at the time, but helped immensely in the grand scheme of things.
If you'd like to make money with ClickBank, you're not alone. ClickBank facilitates around 30,000 digital sales each day and has over six million registered users who create and promote digital products. There are two main ways to make money using ClickBank: one is to create your own product and list it, and the other is to skip the product creation step and list other people's products while taking a commission from each sale. ClickBank commission rates range from 5%–75% depending on the product being promoted.
If you offer freelance services or have a physical services business, then creating a blog is a must. On your blog you can write about the services you offer and how they will benefit your clients. Importantly you can add a ‘Services’ page, outlining the services you provide, what they include, and any other important information potential clients may need. This is an effective way to promote your services, generate leads, and increase your revenue.
ClickBank is being an intermediator between affiliates and product owners where both wanted to make money. Product owners can advertise their products on ClickBank mentioning with the unique features and commission rate. Affiliates select a product based on the authority and commission rate that meets their requirements. Then they start marketing or promoting in their own way.

Another strategy to make money online is to become a social marketing manager. Being present on social media is key for any business that wants to attract new customers, promote their products and grow their following. However, constantly posting, liking and commenting on the numerous social media channels is extremely time consuming. More and more businesses are recruiting social media managers to run and organize all their social media. And to save money, social media employees are often employed as online freelancers.

Dr. Rose wrote that she was about to give on in frustration, then, fortuitously, she ran across a pin that blared, “How To Make Your First Affiliate Sale in 24 Hours Using Pinterest.” She clicked it out o fcuriousity, then found out what the “catch” was. The link was to a purchase page for a book by that name. Not wanting to make the purchase — after all ,she’s been blogging for a couple of months, but still ahdn’t made any money, she thought to herself “How’s this possible?”

It is a good idea to take some time, so you can carefully select your product before you promote it. As affiliate marketers, we make a great effort when promoting a product. To make a decent number of sales you will probably need to set up advertising campaigns, build a custom site around your Clickbank product or do viral marketing. Nothing can be worse to have a product that does not convert. Allow me to give you a few pointers on how the statistics for each product works and how to choose the best one.
Thanks for sharing your experience. It was a real eye-opener for me. I am new to affiliate marketing and am looking for ways to make a steady income. Your affiliate program seems to fit my needs.

I've made money using this method, and I'm hoping to start making even more by learning list building details in another of his courses that I just started. So glad I came across his courses.
The affiliate marketing scam is equal in size if not greater in size to the Nigerian 401 scam. Yes, you really have a person willing to give you $ 1 Million. BS you say? Then how come you buy the same BS packaged in a different way, when someone tells you how you can make millions in affiliate marketing by buying their for $X?

In simple terms affiliate marketing means selling another person’s or company’s products and services. It’s like a referral service. You set up a website or blog and join affiliate programs that are relevant to your audience. You can connect to these programs through affiliate networks that provide you with a link that you include on your site. When someone clicks the link and purchases the product or service you’re marketing, you receive a percentage of the sale proceeds as a commission.
One factor that you must be aware of though is that Care.com is a peer-to-peer arrangement. That means that you will be in direct competition with other pet sitters in your area. You must price your services competitively in order to get business. Once you begin to develop a list of regular clients, you will be in a better position to raise your rates. This will be particularly true as you get referrals from those customers.
The affiliate market is a wide place for opportunity and with places like Shareasale, Rakuten etc., you have the option of joining their program as they are constantly seeking for publishers who can promote well. To join these programs, you need to qualify first and if you don’t have enough content, not sharing relevant posts or you don’t have an established platform then you may not be qualified to apply at all. So it is important that you have quality content (from your accounts) in order to be considered as a good source.
Once you’re financially stable, I hope you start giving back. It feels good and people like the idea of supporting a good cause (they will be more likely to click your affiliate link in your disclaimer). This also means you don’t have to use as many links in your content and risk getting a penalized. Last year I donated $3,000 to Red Cross At Hurricane Harvey.
MozBar – MozBar is a Google Chrome extension that lets you Google any keyword and see how competitive the search results are. The higher the DA (domain authority) and PA (page authority) the more competitive the keyword is. However you still want to click on the top results and browse the content to make sure you can creating an article/video that is better than whoever’s in the top results. That is really what “researching the competition” is all about.
Due to the fact we thousands of different business-related templates, we are asking ourselves, if it possible to setup clickbank in such a way it adapts the Clickbank presented content to a keyword we give so that it's matches up with the content on our website. For example, if our page contains a drop shipping agreement template only drop shipping related Clickbank content if presented.

This is a VERY high quality course with an Instructor who really cares about his students. I learned so much in such a short amount of time and loved that KC covered all bases throughout this course!! I will be giving this oh-so-simple system a go tomorrow and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an easy way to get in the affiliate game." – Jamie Briggs
Once you sign up to become an affiliate with ClickBank, you will immediately be able to browse the different products available to sell. ClickBank has tens of thousands of products available, so in the beginning it's helpful to search by niche and commission percentage until you locate offers that you want to promote. Make sure you take the time to look at the vendor's sales page before promoting their product. They might be offering a 75% commission rate, but if their website doesn't look trustworthy or put together you aren't going to generate many sales, no matter how much traffic you drive their way.

Does your flesh really want to conform to the ways of Christ? Do you really want to conform to the ways of Christ? It should be a pastor’s goal to help each of those under him (as God directs him) to become more like Jesus in every way. Is this your desire? When you are corrected, are you thankful or resentful? What is your first emotion? Consider, what would have happened to Peter, if Jesus chose not to correct him, because he became easily offended and did not desire correction?
Is there anyone that should not desire correction? We all need to be corrected. Often, we are corrected for something we are doing that is biblically incorrect, yet we may think it is right. Thus, we each need correction in order to grow.
If we each knew perfectly what is right and wrong in the eyes of God, would we not be walking just like Jesus? If we are not currently walking just like Jesus, does this not indicate that we need much correction? How is it then that those who need correction the most, often seek it the least?
Some Christians desire and ask for correction. Others refuse to come and ask (to find out if they are doing something that is not in line with the Bible). Some will hear correction often and show remorse (or godly sorrow for their sins), but afterward, they do not change.
Let us receive correction now, as a little child, that we may not say at the end of our days, HOW HAVE I HATED INSTRUCTION, AND MY HEART DESPISED REPROOF; AND HAVE NOT OBEYED THE VOICE OF MY TEACHERS, NOR INCLINED MINE EAR TO THEM THAT INSTRUCTED ME!-Pv 5:12,13.
Peter had gone back to his old occupation after the resurrection of Jesus. Others had also gone with him. Jesus confronted Peter three times with the question, "Lovest thou Me?" It is written, SO WHEN THEY HAD DINED, JESUS SAITH TO SIMON PETER, SIMON, SON OF JONAS, LOVEST THOU ME MORE THAN THESE? HE SAITH UNTO HIM, YEA, LORD; THOU KNOWEST THAT I LOVE THEE. HE SAITH UNTO HIM, FEED MY LAMBS. HE SAITH TO HIM AGAIN THE SECOND TIME, SIMON, SON OF JONAS, LOVEST THOU ME? HE SAITH UNTO HIM, YEA, LORD; THOU KNOWEST THAT I LOVE THEE. HE SAITH UNTO HIM, FEED MY SHEEP. HE SAITH UNTO HIM THE THIRD TIME, SIMON, SON OF JONAS, LOVEST THOU ME? PETER WAS GRIEVED BECAUSE HE SAID UNTO HIM THE THIRD TIME, LOVEST THOU ME? AND HE SAID UNTO HIM, LORD, THOU KNOWEST ALL THINGS; THOU KNOWEST THAT I LOVE THEE. JESUS SAITH UNTO HIM, FEED MY SHEEP. VERILY, VERILY, I SAY UNTO THEE, WHEN THOU WAST YOUNG, THOU GIRDEDST THYSELF, AND WALKEDST WHITHER THOU WOULDEST: BUT WHEN THOU SHALT BE OLD, THOU SHALT STRETCH FORTH THY HANDS, AND ANOTHER SHALL GIRD THEE, AND CARRY THEE WHITHER THOU WOULDEST NOT. THIS SPAKE HE, SIGNIFYING BY WHAT DEATH HE SHOULD GLORIFY GOD. AND WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN THIS, HE SAITH UNTO HIM, FOLLOW ME. Peter was being told to feed the lambs and sheep of Jesus and not to go back to his worldly job, as proof that he loved Jesus.
Prideful people often resent correction; however, correction is a way of life for those that truly follow Jesus. The Scriptures relate to us many that were very religious, but they would not follow Jesus and receive correction. Many in the Bible appeared to be saved, but Jesus showed them they were not. They would not receive correction humbly, as a little child. Many Pharisees, scribes, lawyers, Herodians, Sadducees, and others had the appearance of being saved. People thought they were saved and followed them. Yet the one indicator that they were not saved is that they would not humbly receive the correction of God’s Word and obey it. They obeyed their own ways and traditions. They were positive they were saved, even when Jesus clearly showed them that they were not. Jesus would tell them such things as:
Jesus showed those who would not receive correction that they were not saved. Note the words of Jesus to them:
Even though Jesus showed them they were not saved, they were still positive they were; as it is written, BUT NOW YE SAY, WE SEE-Jn 9:41. The people were sure they understood things correctly and were saved.
Jesus Himself showed how the people believed that the Father in heaven was their God; as it is written, MY FATHER…YE SAY, THAT HE IS YOUR GOD-Jn 8:54.
The people heard the voice of truth, which is God’s Word. They heard the voice of the devil in their thoughts, which were lies. Their heart chose to believe the voice of lies.
Some people choose to believe the deceptions of unsaved pastors. Others choose to believe God’s Word, as they examine themselves in truth.

Passing the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists Part 1 examination is a prerequisite for any doctor who wants a career in Radiology.

Hi there! Today I have three very easy to make Christmas cards to share with you that all have one thing in common. The patterned paper. I used “A Perfect Christmas” by Echo Park to create all three cards. The only difference is that I used different dies on each one. If I were doing […]
As the country reels under an acute shortage of petroleum products owing to the “blockade” imposed by India, people are resorting to unsafe ferrying of fuel in passenger vehicles risking flames on leakage.
Many of the buses coming from places close to the Indian border have been stealthily bringing petrol to Kathmandu without proper safety measures.
Such unsafe ferrying became a cause for concern when eight people died while more than 10 sustained serious burn injuries after a passenger bus loaded with petroleum products caught fire in Banke. The bus (Lu 1 Kha 5828), en route to Kohalpur from Butwal, was set ablaze immediately after an accident at Khaskushma-8 in Banke district. Police said most of the passengers were carrying petroleum products with them which fuelled the fire.
Dr Raja Ram Pradhananga, former head of the Central Department of Chemistry, Tribhuvan University, said petrol needs special carriages as it is volatile. “In high temperature, more vapour is formed. If it comes in contact with an electric spark or any source of fire, it burns,” said Dr Pradhananga. “Plastic containers are not suitable for carrying petrol which needs non-porous metal objects for safe transport.”
The danger of an untoward situation in the buses is heightened also by the poor state of highways and a high rate of traffic accidents. In a major impact of an accident, ensuing sparks cause ignition in the vehicle.
On Friday and Saturday morning in Kalanki, where buses entering the Capital from the plains meet, people were seen carrying jerry cans full of petrol and refilling plastic bottles. Roman Kafle of Koteshwor ordered 10 litres of fuel from Kakadvitta, Jhapa, from his relatives.
His bill was Rs180 for each litre of petrol smuggled from India, Rs80 for the plastic container plus extra charge for the bus ferrying it. “I don’t think I got quality fuel but I have no option,” said Kafle.
Interviews with the people in the area suggest that fuel is being brought from Hetauda, where people travel to Raxaul, India, to refuel their vehicles. Fuel was brought also from Nepalgunj and Bhairahawa. There was also a stark difference in the price people pay to get the fuel--from Rs180 to Rs250 a litre. Even police did not take the case seriously until the Banke disaster. Deputy Superintendent of Police Dilli Raj Panta, chief of the Metropolitan Police Circle, Thankot, admits that no strict prohibition has been imposed. “It’s up to the transport management committee to take up the issue. Until grave danger was seen, I saw no point in cracking down on such vehicles,” said DSP Panta. Officials from the Federation of Nepalese Transport Entrepreneurs said they have asked all their committees across the country to restrain from carrying such flammable goods. Dol Nath Khanal, general secretary of the FNTE, said they were also working closely with the District Administration Offices to curb the practice.
And it’s all for a great cause. Saturday, March 13, Seattle Dances! is Seattle’s own version of “Dancing with the Stars.” Put on by the Plymouth Housing Group in collaboration with Hallie Kuperman and the Century Ballroom. Proceeds from Seattle Dances! will go on to support Plymouth Housing Group’s cause and dedication to providing opportunities for the homeless and low-income people to improve their lives.
I’ll be dancing along with six other Seattle Celebs………(Joyce Taylor’s been practicing a lot I hear!). I’ll be doing the Charleston and promise to throw in a few fun suprises… you know I have to be a bit theatrical! I’ll also be shaking up the signature cocktail that evening too, to get things rolling.

It never seems to fail. I’ll be at a foodie event, dinner party or a swanky shindig somewhere — we will all be nibbling on the finest cuisine and patting our lips so sophisticated-like with our linen napkins — and what does the conversation turn to? a lot of the time — macaroni and cheese. And it certainly becomes quite a lively topic at that!
Here’s how the conversation goes: “Oh, yes, homemade is the best, but Stoffer’s is still pretty good sometimes — I can’t believe I’m saying that at this table!” “My mom used to make it from scratch with loads of sharp Tillamook Cheddar, but I looooooove it made with Cougar Gold… Have you had the lobster mac and cheese at so and so’s?
In fact tried-and-true old mac and cheese has come into its own. Don’t feel, that when crafting this classic that taking a lot of creative liberties is shunned. You could use almost any kind of pasta shape — bows, shells, spirals, penne. Fancy or not cheeses – but a lot of them! Then there are the add ins: bacon, sausage, fresh herbs, crab, roasted garlic, artichokes… a drizzle of truffle oil… the possibilities are endless!
My recipe is for a 4-cheese mac — penne pasta bound with a garlic and Parmesan white sauce, then tossed with loads of cheese — Jack, Cheddar, mozzarella and Parmesan. It’s covered with fresh, herby, seasoned bread crumbs that get all nice and crunchy.
It’s more classic style – but jacked up a bit… it’s ooey gooey and d’lish and may be just the little bit of comfort we could all use this time of year.
To make bread crumbs: Place bread crumb ingredients in a food processor, and pulse until the bread becomes fine crumbs and is well mixed. Set aside.
In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and stir for about 20 seconds; do not let garlic brown. Stir in the flour and cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly. While stirring vigorously with a whisk, add the milk. Whisk well. Bring to a simmer and whisk occasionally until sauce is thickened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in salt, pepper, sour cream and Parmesan cheese, and set aside. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook pasta per package directions until done. Drain well. In a very large bowl, mix together the pasta and sauce, then fold in the grated cheeses until well combined. Place mixture into a lightly pan-sprayed or buttered, 13-by-9-inch baking pan. Sprinkle with Herb Bread Crumbs and bake in a 375°F oven for about 30 -35 minutes, or until pasta is heated through, sides are slightly bubbling and top is golden brown.
** Four-, five- and six-cheese blends are available in most grocers’ dairy sections. If you wish to make your own grated cheese blend, try using a mixture of any of the following: Jack, mozzarella, Gouda, Swiss, Havarti.

From Twitter friend @Lavesta who pens the blog Months of Edible Celebrations, below is a link to the most wonderful article on Pierre Franey; legendary NY Chef and great friend and collaborator with the New York Times’ Craig Claiborne. The story touts Chef Pierre Franey, as the grand father of all food bloggers, who was born on January 13, 1921.
I had the most fabulous opportunity to meet Pierre when I was invited to cook at Craig’s house in the East Hamptons for a feature article he wrote on me for the NY Times. Well it was my luck that the “assistant” was sick that day and so Craig’s neighbor Pierre came to help me that afternoon. WOW what an honor. That evening Pierre asked me to dinner with him… in the big city… to – go – to …La Cirque! What an evening for a young chef; greeted by the famed restaurant owner Sirio Maccioni, dining with Pierre Franey, and lavished with wine and delicious dishes …OMG it was an experience I will never forget. I also had the pleasure of dining with Pierre again on his birthday a few years later– so today though he is no longer with us … he is in my heart on this day he was born.

When you haven’t seen the sun for days on end and last summer’s soft fruits are a distant memory, citrus can definitely brighten the winter blahs. Tangerines stuff our stockings at Christmas; I love the teeny tiny ones–sooo easy to peel and their segments so easy to pull apart. Orange marmalade brightens up our morning toast. I even love to adorn my dining table with a big, sunny bowl of bright lemons and tangerines.
For centuries citrus has had a medicinal role, too–fighting off winter colds, tarting up hot, brandy-laced toddies, and, combined with honey in lemon cough drops, soothing dry throats.
Citrus is so versatile, being totally edible from the juice to the flesh to the peel. Citrus is a perfect accouterment for those cutting down on sodium in their diets. A squeeze of lemon or lime can bring out the flavor of food just as salt does. The tart juice also brightens sauces or vinaigrettes, and a quick squeeze of lemon brings a bit of sunshine to a simple glass of water.
Citrus skin brings you its big-flavored zest to use in baking, marinades and dressings. Strips are twisted and swiped around the rim of martinis and Manhattans, the skin’s oils are used in extracts to flavor cakes and candies and cookies. Citrus peel is even delicious on its own; candied orange, lemon or grapefruit rinds make a nice little something to nibble on after a big dinner.
No longer just the generic “orange” to meet the lunchbox fruit obligation, a plethora of specialty citrus varieties is available during short seasons between September and mid-March or later. There are so many types nowadays that you can try a different one every week of the winter! You could even have a tasting.
I’ve included 2 recipes this week – both are tasty tasty! If you’re an oyster lover you’ll want to try my recipe for Oysters on the Half Shell with Citrus Splash- made with pink grapefruit and tangerine the splash really lets the oyster itself come through – even oyster purists will love this tangy bivalve adornment. And Orange Pound Cake with Macerated Oranges & Orange Flower Cream – incorporates everything orange in this lovely dessert … from zest to flesh to floral orange water!
And don’t forget those wonderful orange pomanders you used to make as a kid! Star with a nice thick-skinned orange – stick it with whole cloves until it is totally encased. Nothing brings back fonder scent memories than one of these hanging in my closet or sitting on a dresser. If you’ve never made one, you should. It provides a bit of aromatherapy, and sitting, poking in the cloves can be quite relaxing…
When serving freshly shucked oysters on a buffet, lay them on pine or spruce boughs for a stunning presentation. Depending on your or your guests’ tastes, count from 4-5 oysters per person as a starter or 3-4 per person for a buffet.
Rinse the oysters and scrub the shells with a vegetable brush to remove any debris. Refrigerate until ready to shuck. Right before serving, shuck the oysters, discarding the top shell and inspecting the oysters for any bits of broken shell, picking it out carefully. Set the oysters on a platter or individual plates spread with crushed ice and bits of pine or spruce boughs if using. Top each oyster with about 1 – 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Citrus Splash and pass the remainder, or if serving buffet style set the Splash out in a small bowl so guests themselves can spoon a little over each oyster.
With a sharp knife peel grapefruit and tangerine just deep enough to expose the fruit, removing all white pulp. Section the citrus over a bowl to catch the juices, then finely chop fruit sections. Return fruit to the bowl and add remaining ingredients.
3 very large or 4 small oranges, (or use 2 regular oranges and 2 blood oranges for a spectacular look and taste)
Cut a thin slice off the ends of each orange, then holding the orange cut-side down on a cutting board, cut the rind off of the orange all the way around, using downwards cutting motions. After you have cut away all the rind from the oranges, slice them in 1/4-inch slices. Place the oranges in a large, shallow glass or stainless bowl or baking dish. Sprinkle with the Cointreau or Grand Marnier. Meanwhile, in a small sauce pan combine the orange juice and sugar, bring to a boil over high heat and boil 1 minute. Let cool, then pour half of the orange syrup over the sliced oranges. Cover oranges with plastic wrap and let marinate refrigerated at least 30 minutes and up to 4 hours. Reserve the remaining orange syrup for finishing the cake.
In a chilled mixing bowl, mix together the cream, sugar and orange flower water. Whip the cream until it is just softly whipped and soft peaks are forming. Refrigerate until needed and rewhip slightly if needed before serving.
With an electric mixer cream the butter and orange zest until very fluffy in a large bowl. Slowly add the sugar. Then continue creaming for 3 minutes. Beat in eggs one at time until well beaten in, scraping down the sides of the bowl often. Then add the vanilla, orange flower water and orange juice and combine. With the mixer on low speed slowly add the flour, baking powder and salt to the creamed butter egg mixture. Mix only until just combined. Do not overmix at this point. Place the batter in a prepared (greased and floured) 1 1/2 quart (4 1/2-inch x 8 1/2-inch) loaf pan. Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or until cake tests done. Let cool in pan 5 minutes, then with a long wooden skewer poke cake at 1/2-inch intervals all over. Drizzle the cake, still in the pan, with the remaining half of the orange syrup. Let set at least 1 hour before serving.
Slice a very thin slice of cake off both ends; eat it or save it for a snack. Then cut the cake into 12 even slices. On each of 6 large dinner plates arrange 2 of the cake slices, overlapping slightly. Divide the macerated oranges evenly over each plate of cake. Drizzle any juice around and over the cake slices. Dollop each serving with the Orange Cream.

In the 1970s, the modern feminism attempted to take into account maternal instinct from a feministic perspective, leading to form a new understanding of the existing concept. The motherhood that we can observe in modern feminism started from a female`s biological roles such as pregnancy, childbirth and upbringing, and came to limit women to the domestic part of roles including rearing children and doing housework. Moreover, as the social structure was divided into the public sphere for males and the private one for females, women were required to raise children, do housework labor and carry out various activities regarded as reproduction for their families, resulting in driving them into a more isolated private realm. Such dichotomous thinking and gender division basically derived from maternal instinct, and in terms of a social structure, they combined and engaged with a capitalist system, patriarchy, male chauvinism, males` strengthening the public sphere and seeking the perpetuity of male dominance, which has generated a gender inequality theory and a gender oppression theory. Liberal feminism, a gender inequality theory, made an argument of respect to the freedom and equal opportunities of women, as well as raised the need of the equal roles and rights when bringing up children in a family. According to Marxist feminism connecting to capitalism and economic structure, a severe disparity appears due to the inequality between the ranks of the capitalist and laborer and the ruler and subject, and in the end, women who subordinate to men end up being exploited by being asked for what we call a double labor, domestic labor and production labor. When it comes to the cause of gender oppression, socialist feminism, which is considered as a gender oppression theory, pointed out the social structural contradiction stemming from a combination of capitalism and patriarchic system, while radical feminism sought the source of female oppression in a combination of patriarchic system and power structure. In the meanwhile, radical feminism saw maternal instinct as the source of female oppression, while psychoanalytic feminism understood that the relationship and experiences with mother during childhood have an influence on psychological mechanism. Such mother`s affection towards children can be seen on TV commercials very often, where we only witness the ideal type of mother, so triggering the need of looking into the critical opinions from a feministic perspective. If we look at the mother appearing on TV advertisements, which depict that the life of mother is ruled by the patriarchic system, subordinate to men, has a limited private area, and is supposed to take care of children and manage the household, these aspects of women as mother, when dealing with them from the critical viewpoint of feminism, can be interpreted as the products of a social structural contradiction playing a significant role in the process where the life of women under the patriarchy is adored, and their restricted life is beautified, inducing women into receiving and accepting those ideas naturally on their own accord.
BY MADELEINE NEIMAN, 2014–2015 Samuel H. Kress Conservation Fellow at the Kelsey Museum. During her time here, Madeleine’s work will focus on the technical analysis and treatment of objects from Seleucia on the Tigris, a site approximately 18 miles south of modern-day Baghdad, Iraq.
One of my major projects here at the Kelsey is conducting a survey of artifacts from the Seleucia collection. The goal of this work is to answer three questions:
What is the condition of the object? More simply, is there any evidence of damage or deterioration (e.g., breaks, cracks, discoloration) present?
Conservators utilize a number of tools to help us answer these questions. Today I thought I would share with you a bit about one of our most commonly employed techniques — examination under ultraviolet light.
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and exits as part of a large electromagnetic spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation, often called UV light, refers to that area just below what is visible to the human eye. While we can’t see UV light, when it illuminates the surface of an artifact, certain types of materials, including some dyes, minerals, and resins commonly found on archaeological objects, fluoresce. These materials glow different colors!
Among the over 13,000 objects in the Seleucia collection are a group of bone figurines. Several of these are decorated with a reddish-pink paint that displays a unique orangey-pink fluorescence.
Images of bone figurine (KM 16187) with pink paint captured under visible (left) and UV (right) illumination.
In antiquity, people created paints using mineral pigments as well as organic colorants found in plants and animals. Among the most common sources of red were the pigments hematite (iron oxide), cinnabar (mercury sulfide), and red lead as well as the dyes kermes (from the Kermes vermilio insect) and madder (from the plant Rubia tinctorium). When viewed in visible light all five appear red. However, when examined under UV light, one stands out: madder. Madder contains four principal colorants: alizarin (red), purpurin (red), pseudopurprin (red) and xanthine (yellow). The purpurin and pseudopurpurin glow a bright orangey-pink when exposed to UV light, making it easy to distinguish.
By examining the figurines under UV light we can tell that an ancient artist used madder to decorate these figurines!

The Kelsey Museum’s current special exhibit Leisure and Luxury in the Age of Nero is full of insanely gorgeous objects from the villas of Oplontis near Pompeii. But guess what? The Kelsey has a few objects on view in this exhibit, too, and you probably won’t be surprised to learn that some of them are, you know, not insanely gorgeous.
This month’s Ugly Object is a marble sample — basically, a polished rock — and it’s on view in a section of the exhibit that demonstrates how the villas’ surfaces were adorned with decorative stones. You see the object here before conservation treatment to remove the collector’s label. The label — which we saved, of course — says: “From the Great Theater at Ephesus, Sept 6th 1867.”
It was collected and given to the Kelsey by James D. Candler, a businessman, builder, and traveler who was based in Detroit in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
This stone sample and others like it have been the focus of recent research at the Kelsey. IPCAA alumnae Leah Long and Lynley McAlpine, U-M professor and Kelsey curator Elaine Gazda, and University of Akron emeritus professor Clayton Fant have been studying the Kelsey’s stone samples, in part to see if analytical techniques like stable isotope analysis can connect samples like this one to their sources and buildings of origin.
France / China: Will France hand over Chinese religious refugees to their persecutors? Appeal to President Macron | Human Rights Without Frontiers
France / China: Will France hand over Chinese religious refugees to their persecutors? Appeal to President Macron
In France, 335 Chinese citizens who are members of The Church of Almighty God (CAG), one of the largest new religious movements in China, have been denied asylum. 156 of them have received a departure order and are now under threat of deportation. Only six applications for asylum have been accepted.
We have been studying the situation of the CAG for several years and we are morally sure that once they are extradited back to China, the CAG members living currently in France will be immediately arrested, tortured and detained for several years. *
The Chinese government considers the CAG « an heterodox belief system » (xie jiao), and article 300 of the Chinese Criminal Code provides prison terms of three to seven years or more for those who “use” a xie jiao – the jurisprudence interprets this as active membership in such movements. The CAG also denounced cases of torture and suspicious deaths in prisons.
The Chinese government accuses the CAG of several crimes but the scholars who have studied these issues have concluded that it is pure propaganda. A French brochure published by the DIDR (the Research and Documentation Branch of the Refugee Office) in 2016 echoed one of these accusations. Four well–known scholars wrote to the DIDR in February to ask for an update of this brochure, published before the CAG started being the object of significant scientific research.
The issue is not purely academic but it is a human rights issue. It is about the protection of the freedom and the life of people who have already suffered a lot and who expect from France the protection they are entitled to.
We call upon you, Mr President, upon the relevant French authorities and upon all the friends of human rights to prohibit the handing over of victims to their persecutors.
CAP CL (12.03.2018) – On 9 March 2018, CAP Liberté de Conscience held a press conference in Paris about France’s rejection of applications for asylum filed by Chinese refugees belonging to the Church of Almighty God.
Several scholars and representatives of human rights organizations gathered to expose the dramatic situation to which these asylum seekers will be submitted if they are sent back to China.
The well–known Prof. Massimo Introvigne, Director of the Center for the Studies of New Religions (CESNUR) presented the Church of Almighty God from a scholarly perspective, insisting on the fact that several university studies and expertise have demonstrated and confirmed that most of the accusations against this Church were false and were the product of Chinese propaganda.
Mr Willy Fautré, the director of Human Rights Without Frontiers International (HRWF) presented disturbing statistics about the number of asylum denials concerning members of the Church of Almighty God in European countries, and particularly in France.
Mrs Marie Holzman, a well=known sinologist, writer and journalist who is a specialist of contemporary China and Chinese dissidence, described the political roots of the persecution of religious minorities in China and explained the socio=psychological context which might have created some misunderstanding between the asylum seekers of this Church and French institutions.
Mr Eric Roux, President of the European Interreligious Forum for Religious Freedom, (EIFRF) analyzed the difficulties faced by asylum seekers in France and the way French authorities can mistakenly rely on outdated or false information when they take negative decisions.
The participants have also watched a video in which two members of the Church of Almighty God testified about the persecution, imprisonment and torture they were victims of in China.
Mr Thierry Valle, President of the Coordination des Associations et des Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience, CAP LC, and organizer of this event, announced that a Call to President Macron had been launched by a group of human rights organizations, scholars and other personalities to inform him about the tragic consequences entailed by the denial of asylum for the members of this Church in France and to urge him to make sure that they find a safe haven in France.

The Ferrari 250 series is probably one of the most desired series of Ferrari’s. Multiple models were released in the 250 series including this 250GT SWB. Among these series also belong the 250 GTO, 250 GTE and 250 GT California Spyder. All these cars were made between 1952 and 1964 and have a V12 engine with 250cc per cylinder. The 250 GTE is the version that is produced the most, this is also the model Ferrari Enzo himself drove.

For many people this was their introduction to the joys of home computing before the days of 'real' PCs. We are talking early 1980s.
I had mine during the final year at University and quickly started writing games - initially for fun, later for real money. I also wrote my Masters dissertation on it using a very basic (but quite capable) word processing program.
The thing I loved about the Spectrum, was that when you threw the mains switch it was instantly 'on' - no boot time like you get with modern PCs, which still drives me up the wall. And with a nifty device called a Microdrive, you could load up software in a matter of seconds.
The most successful game I wrote was a strategy game (loosly based on the board game 'Risk') called 'Conquest' which I eventually sold to a company called CheetahSoft.
Here you can see the cassette format that it was sold in - in shops like WHSmith, or by mail order ...remember, no Internet back then - so no buying on-line!
To my amazement, the amount of money I was paid covered all the tuition fees for my Masters degree (with some to spare) - which was very handy, as Jersey (where I grew up) were not inclined to offer any grant or student loan for this second degree.
So there is a very soft spot in my heart for my old Spectrum and I never threw it away, although it is boxed up in my loft and hasn't been powered up for 25 years. In truth, I feared to plug it in after so long in case it just went 'pop' and that would be that!
Then in 2011, I was amazed to be contacted by a gentleman from the World of Spectrum website asking for permission for my game to be made available for free download.
He introduced me to the world of Spectrum emulation - yes, believe it or not, you can emulate the Spectrum on a PC with pretty much 100% accuracy and realism - even down to loading and saving from cassette tape if you want the ultimate retro experience!
For me, just wanting to see my old game running again, it was a matter of seconds to download an emulator, download my game in a format suitable for the emulator, and be playing... instantly transported back in time to my University room of nearly 30 years ago! Sigh!
Above you can see the title screen and a view after several rounds of play. My empire (in red, with a capital on Rome) has borders protected by lines of legions and forts - but is being hard-pressed by two computer-controlled empires (pink and yellow). I've also had to survive barbarian attacks, plagues, civil wars and assassination attempts to get to this point! Great fun and still very addictive even with the Noddy graphics.

At the start of the year I planned to read 150 books for my Goodreads challenge - I'm pleased to say that ....I did it !!!!!!
This is a powerful and emotional look at families and sibling relationships and the darker undercurrents that can so easily be glossed over. Linda Gillard is never afraid to be different - her books don't conform to the norm but they are always a darn good read.
This is the first in a series of books featuring forensic archaeologist, Ruth Galloway. When bones are discovered on the Norfolk coast, Ruth is called in to help determine the age of the bones. This introduces her to DCI Harry Nelson who is the policeman leading the investigation. The discovery of these ancient bones leads to the Ruth's involvement in a current police investigation.
The Norfolk coast is beautifully stark and its involvement in the story is evocative and atmospheric.
If I could give this book more stars I would - sometimes a book comes along that just blows every other book out of the water - this is one such book. Probably my read of 2011, unless something remarkable comes along in the next few months.
Set in the Norfolk marshes with more than enough Gothic gloom to feed the soul, the dark and dirty 13C is brought gloriously to life in this third novel by Karen Maitland. Beautifully crafted from the beginning, and teeming with superstition, this story transports you back to the brutal days in our history, when dark and Godless forces roamed freely, and violent crimes were accepted without question.
I have total admiration for an author who can recreate a world so entirely that as you read, you can feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, and when you are forced back to the 21C ,the smell of wood smoke still lingers in the air, and you can almost imagine you are still there......
Vulnerable Fen comes with the burden of carried secrets, and yet is a wonderfully supportive mother to her damaged child. When an equally damaged Sean enters her life , Fen is overcome with desire for him but allows him the time and space to find her in his own way. This beautifully written story of love, loss and the power of redemption captures the intricacies of relationships with extraordinary perception.
From the start of The Absolutist, I was engrossed in Tristan and Will's story, and found myself really hurrying the pages to see what happened next.
The description of the time in the trenches is poignant, desperately sad, and hugely horrific, but never without tender philosophy.I loved both characters, and wanted everything to work out for them - but like all those who fought and died in the Great war, nothing will ever be the same again.
John Boyne is a master storyteller, who manages in a few short sentences to convey a complete world, and a time and place that really exists in your subconscious, with characters that come to life, and who live on in your memory, long after the last page is turned.
Like a jewel in India’s crown, this beautifully written historical novel layers together a multifaceted story of love, loss, hope and redemption.From the beginning of this book I was enchanted with the sights, sounds and smells of India; all are beautifully described, and perfectly represent time and place. The switch between the dual time elements is seamless and absorbing, as both stories capture the imagination perfectly. The history of India is explained with great precision and empathy, and whilst the politics is complicated and shocking, nothing is allowed to detract from the stark beauty of this troubled landscape.
I was saddened to learn that Elle Newmark died in July 2011, her exceptional writing talent will be sadly missed.
This tense psychological thriller grips you from the opening page and takes you on a roller-coaster of a ride until its thrilling conclusions.
Christine has severe amnesia, when she wakes everyday she needs to be reminded of her life, her cherished memories have been wiped out, and nothing of what she holds dear remains in her mind for more than a few minutes. When she is encouraged to record her limited memories in a journal, she begins to doubt everything she has been told by her husband.
What scared me about this book is how easily it could happen - and just how precious are our memories.
This book is a beautifully written, and lively romp through Restoration England. Gillian Bagwell has captured the very essence of the period with a charm and wit that keeps you turning the pages.
It's saucy and sexually explicit throughout, but overall the humour and the sheer joie de vivre emphasises the utter glory of being alive and young in one of the most glittering of Royal courts.
Reminiscent of the Gothic splendour of a modern day Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, I thought that this was a really accomplished novel. Louise Douglas certainly knows how to write a good story and involves the reader in an imaginative and consuming way. The plot is twisted and convoluted right to the very end, and yet is beautifully atmospheric, with some genuinely creepy moments. The characterisation is subtle, and yet all consuming as we begin genuinely to care for Alexander who is flawed and vulnerable, Jamie who is damaged and precocious, and Sarah, who whilst fighting her own demons, must try and keep this family together.
The Secrets between Us is a haunting and passionate love story, which will entertain and keep you guessing from the opening page.
Homespun America in 1950’s is beautifully described in this accomplished debut novel which interweaves the lives of the Lake and Moses family. Samuel Lake is a preacher without a congregation and without any hope of a ministry of his own he is forced to return to his wife’s family farm in Arkansas with his eccentrically named offspring. Of his three children, it is eleven year old Swan Lake who is the formidable ringleader, who is tomboy enough to run wild through the rural landscape, and yet has a heart bigger than the Arkansas sky.
Reminiscent of Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mocking Bird, this emotionally charged book reveals a story that is at times dark and dirty, and yet has a theme of faith, and family that transcends pure evil. There is an abundance of rich and varied characters who bring the story to life, from grandmother Calla who tends her flowers, and dispenses wholesome wisdom, through to the bravery of Uncle Toy who keeps the bar at ‘Never Closes’, and who loves the Lake children as he would his own.
I stayed up late and long in order to finish reading this story, it made me laugh, it made me cry and ultimately, it made me believe in the power of storytelling.
This is storytelling at its absolute best, and I would recommend this novel wholeheartedly to my book group. If I could give it more than five stars I would do so without hesitation.
Primarily, Warhorse is a book for young adults, however, this is one of those stories that easily crosses the great divide as it slips into an adult read quite seamlessly.
Joey doesn't get off to the best of starts when he taken away from his young master. and forced to serve as a war horse during the worst battles of WW1.
During WW1 the life of an infantry horse was fraught with danger, Michael Morpurgo conveys this story in beautiful writing, which conjures the horror, depredation, and sheer waste of life, in such a strong and meaningful way.
Research historian Diana Bishop is a witch from a long line of esteemed witches, and yet she refuses to use her skills. Whilst researching ancient documents in Oxford's Bodleian Library, she unwittingly unleashes the power of Ashmole782 an ancient alchemical manuscript. But once unleashed, the catalytic effect of this ancient document will turn Diana's well ordered life upside down.
Meticulously researched, Deborah Harkness has created a world within a world, which is believable and utterly compelling to read.
Diana Gabaldon's skill as a writer turns this adventure story into a series of violent escapades, from sword fights and treachery, to pistols at dawn, but throughout the narrative, she blends quite seamlessly the story of two very different men, forced together by circumstances, and whose shared history creates more questions than it does answers.
For me this book worked on several levels. As a continuation of the Lord John books, the story was a well thought out adventure, both fast and furious in equal measure, and a commendable continuation of the Lord John catalogue. On the other hand, as a fully paid up member of the Jamie Fraser appreciation society, this book allowed a rare glimpse into Jamie's hidden time at Helswater, where the loss of his beloved wife Claire runs like a silken thread throughout the narrative,and as ever his love and need of her is palpable and painful. His constant prayer that she and their child be safe, is heart breaking, and utterly believable. On a lighter note, his burgeoning relationship with his son William is a joyful glimpse into Jamie's role as protector, teacher and fatherly mentor.
A very big Thank you to all those talented authors who have fired my imagination with their written word.
Thanks so much if you've managed to stay with us for the whole of the 30 day book talk - jaffa and appreciate all your views and comments. We've really enjoyed putting our bookish thoughts into such a fascinating challenge.
By now you all know what my favourite book of all time will be - Outlander by Diana Gabaldon......it's the one book I would want with me if I was marooned on a desert island...
I think hated is rather a strong word for my book choice, but this book certainly divided opinion - it's a Marmite book , you were either in the' loved it', or 'hated it' camp - but when it won the 2009 Man Booker prize my interest in it was vindicated ...
This ambitious reworking of Thomas Cromwell's story, detailed not only his rise to power during the reign of Henry VIII, but also explained the humble origin, and volatile upbringing of this dangerously influential statesman.
Thomas Cromwell became the most instrumental political figure of his generation, he was largely responsible for the papal reform of England, and the subsequent break with Rome. Always the power behind Henry's throne, Cromwell's plotting behind the scenes resulted in both the downfall of Anne Boleyn in 1536, and the failure of Henry's disastrous fourth marriage to Anne of Cleves in 1540.
Hilary Mantel's novel captures the essence of this dangerous time, meticulously researched, the Tudor court is seen as a living breathing hotch potch of disharmony and chaos, and where the ever present threat of danger and corruption, is never far away...
Wolf Hall's sequel Bring up the Bodies is due for publication in May 2012 - it's already on my wishlist....
A book about the world's most lovable dog doesn't feature too highly on many feline reading lists - but I enjoyed this one ...and Marley has such a cute expression.......
With bookshelves groaning under the weight of unread books, to have that one book title that literally jumps off the shelf and which screams "READ ME "is such a superb marketing tool....
I'm not going to tell you what the surprise is in case you haven't read this, because that would spoil this fabulous book for you , so I urge you to read it for yourself -
This story from the beloved 1902 Just So stories by Rudyard Kipling proves that the cat will always be true to himself, and will go his own way.
This stunning book reminded me that some women do not have the easy life that I am privileged to enjoy and that the power of good literature can shake your world and make you appreciate all that you have.....
Bold and complex, this novels slaps you in the face, and delivers the message that to struggle against adversity is not a sign of weakness, but of overwhelming pride.
The one character I would like to relate to the most is Claire Beauchamp Fraser from the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon.
She's a 20th century nurse who is transported back in time to 18th century Scotland, and has a fraught but very interesting life with Scottish highlander, Jamie Fraser.
My choice is a quiet little book, primarily aimed at young adults, but in my opinion anything written by Michael Morpurgo crosses the great divide into adult fiction. It's also one of those books I think should be on the national curriculum...maybe it already is....
This is a stunning little book , with a story so sad it, will break your heart into a million little pieces.....

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) recently charged Polycom CEO Andrew Miller with using nearly $200,000 in corporate funds for personal perks that were not disclosed to investors, including travel to luxury resorts with his girlfriend. Specifically, the SEC alleges that Miller engaged in a long-running scheme to surreptitiously use Polycom funds to pay for his personal expenses, including lavish meals, foreign and domestic travel, clothing, gifts and entertainment for himself, and his relatives and friends. The SEC also alleges that from approximately 2010 until his resignation as CEO on July 19, 2013, Miller falsified, and caused others to falsify, business records in order to hide his scheme. The SEC also alleges that Polycom repeatedly made misleading public statements to investors concerning such perquisites.
On July 23, 2013, Polycom announced that Miller had resigned and that the Company had found irregularities in Miller’s expense submissions, for which Miller had accepted responsibility.

In the history of feminism, french feminism takes an important status. What is interesting however is that, for most french feminists, this reality can not be accepted uncritically. Moreover, they do not hesitate to affirm that the french feminism, which deals with importance in the feminist discourse today is not their own feminism. According to them, the concept of french feminism, which is recognized everywhere in the world, is only a result produced by the anglophone feminists, which does not take at all into account the full context of feminism in France. In this context, they claim forcefully the need to distinguish the french feminism developed by themselves of the feminism invented by the anglophone feminist, that is to say, of the ``french feminism``. Our study, based on the basic agreement with questioning of this reality of french feminists, is primarily to examine the process in which the french feminism came to deform, revive and spread by anglophone feminists, and, moreover, to understand the reasons for this situation. It is for us to question how they ``represent`` the french feminism; well, we will suspend the judgment on the rightness of their perspective on feminism or concrete context of their discourse. The first occasion of this situation is given by an internal crisis of the french feminist society: the conflict between the participants in the MLF, which refers to the collective political struggle of french women in 1970 whose claim is truly to deconstruct the patriarchal system. The conflict stemmed from the fundamental difference in the positions about the priority to lead the struggle, between a group called ≪Psych and Po≫ and other participants of MLF. ≪Psych and Po≫ differs mainly clear from other participants in his major way to struggle against patriarchal system : for the latter, the women`s movement must concentrate in a struggle against the social system, because the subordination of women is essentially the result of social condition. On the other side, ≪Psych and Po≫ claimed that the symbolic system must be subverted first, since it is the most responsible for the oppression of woman. In this position, the group developed the necessary theories for discourses on the subversion of symbolic system of patriarchy. However, it is not this difference itself that caused the conflict in MLF; one can find the determining factor in the mistaken ambition of this group, who wanted to present itself as the political and intellectual center of the MLF by appropriating the history and struggles of MLF. Indeed, he put this ambition into practice by appropriating the right to speak of MLF through his organizational strength and influence on publishing market. Finally, this attempt has arrived with the result that the groupe has succeeded to legally gain the exclusive property on the name MLF in 1979. The alteration of french feminism, started by this inner conflict, arrives to worsen in the process where it was introduced in the United States. The american feminist academy, interested in the new french feminism since 1968, began to introduce it to american readers, but under the perspective of ≪Psych and Po≫. Therefore, in the United States, the prospect that the new french feminism is not anything other than the idea of ?this group was installed. It was defined as an idea that prefers the theory to practice, the Lacan`s psychoanalysis to materialism, literary and philosophical discourses to the social and historical. And in this context, they confered the title of representative of the french feminism on ≪Psych et Po≫ and the trio, Julia Kristeva, Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray, who in that time in France, were not even considered as feminist. When we consider that they knew already the conflict between french feminists and that a certain regularity was revealed in their way to deform the french feminism, this situation must be considered as a result produced by their intention to remake the french feminism according their own need. If it was, why did they invent the french feminism? We can answer this question according to three factors. First, the hegemony of literature who took the lead in american women`s studies, second, the imperialism of american feminists who wanted to appropriate a part of french culture for their purpose, and, finally, their desire to escape criticism on their choice for a return to essentialism by using the french feminism. And today, through this process, the diversity of discourses developed by french feminist happens to hardly be noticed in the international intellectual society.
Today`s dominant cultural ideology indoctrinates people to believe that age-related changes can be avoided. Hence one who displays visible signs of aging is stigmatized and excluded as a result of ageism, but the ultimate truth of the human condition is that we cannot stop aging unless we die. In a sexist society, aging women suffer more from age issues and oppression because "youthfulness" in women is especially valuable symbolic capital. Feminism, like other social movements, has undertaken numerous strategies to reach its fundamental goal of a better life for women. Aging or older women, however, have been a largely ignored group. They have been the "Other" within feminism, not to mention outside of it. The gerontophobic nature of modern society provides one explanation for this exclusion. Another is the fact that many feminists themselves were young in the 1970s, a fact that is reflected in their emphasis upon their young age and social location at that time, since, "after all, the personal is political." In order to uncover the relationship between aging and feminism, this study explores three representative works on aging/ageism: The Coming of Age by Simone de Beauvoir, The Fountain of Age by Betty Friedan, and The Change: Women, Ageing and the Menopause by Germaine Greer. Though each work reveals some problems and limitations in regard to the complex interrelatedness of all forms of domination, these books nonetheless help to lay the foundations for feminist studies of ageism. They compel us to examine how to make the later years of life worthwhile and successful for today`s and tomorrow`s older women.
This study focuses on the discourse of the crisis of feminism and feminist pedagogy. It asks what should he on the agenda of contemporary feminism, so that proper strategies and visions of feminist pedagogy can be invented. Based on the awareness of positioned and situated knowledges, feminism goes against mainstream schemes of thinking and evaluating on the one hand, and makes efforts to transform the experiences of women into knowledge on the other, If feminism and feminist pedagogy have recently fallen into crisis, it can he a good opportunity for feminists to re-think the goals and methods of feminism and feminist pedagogy. The classroom is a battlefield of diverse ideologies and experiences, and a place not only for transmission hut also production of knowledge. From this perspective, feminist pedagogy should allow for diverse voices and not he afraid of being partial. What students need in a society of greater risk and competition is nut a compromised feminist theory, which adapts itself to the so-called post-feminist era, hut a sharpened. and more elaborated feminist theory.

The foundation of Unearthed lies in two opposite movements. Firstly the outward one (the objective). I try to engage the world as openly as possible, putting aside preconceived ideas of subject matter and form. My goal is simply to experience. To try to capture the essence of the experience I use the macro lens as my tool. It serves as my microscope, and through it I engage the objects I encounter - my discoveries. Initially there seems to be no hierarchy of these discoveries, as they all contain their own unique visual secrets or traits. As a result, I get the sense that in every location; room, field or street, there is an image waiting to be found. This is the fuel that carries the project forward. I always have the feeling that there is more to be had. More to reveal and examine. The images interest me on many different levels. For example, similar patterns begin to emerge from within completely different materials, revealing that in the world of the very small, movements and structures begin to assimilate each other. This idea fascinates me, while – from a biological and chemical standpoint – everything is built from the same molecular building blocks. And I feel that is why I as a human being, made from exactly the same resources, feel deeply connected to this whole process. In other words, I search for logic or coherence in what can seem a chaotic existence. In this sense, the work can also be viewed as a quest for unity, or a cosmic whole, if you will. Furthermore, time as a transformative force is also very present in the work. All things – animate or inanimate – undergo different stages of presence or vibrancy of life. Everything is in an everlasting state of change, and my photographic images offer a way to capture this transformation of matter, albeit in a very fleeting way. And then we arrive at the second movement; the inward one (the subjective). As referred to by the title Unearthed, I feel that the work is deeply connected to the metaphorical idea of “digging up” something from the soil and revealing it. To me this is the core of Unearthed. I went into the project without a clear cut narrative, but as the images started to appear they became pieces of a greater puzzle. Titled chapters were formed containing various numbers of the selected images, which also received short names reflecting what I saw as their primary appearance, sensation or quality. Many of the original photographs became sketches forming completely new ideas and visual manifestations. This approach has granted me a framework from which I find it natural to display the work, and established the hierarchy lacking in the first phase. However, the puzzle is in no sense complete, or might never be. At the moment there are five chapters, but many more could follow and enrich the tapestry of Unearthed. In a way, I feel like the mad scientist searching high and low for the next clue or piece of evidence to prove his theory. In this case, however, there is no thesis, just a desire to delve into the unbounded visual potential of all that is us.
The Void The Void was created during a difficult time in my life, in which I was trying to sort out a lot of personal issues. It thus became a sturdy line to which I could hold firm when I otherwise would have fallen. A guiding light in a tunnel of darkness if you will. As a concept, The Void, is built around a poem I wrote in Prague 2011. The poem and the style of photographs I was taking at the time seemed to fuse and I knew I had a project on my hands. The poem deals with the idea of an individual facing a society or world, which he can’t or won’t comprehend. A loner dwarfed by some majestic force outside his grasp. It also introduces themes such as the construction of the self, primordial powers and the search for coherence in an incoherent life. From these words and emotions sprang a series of stark black & white images – 13 in total – that I wanted to form a greater whole. It was my intention to create a labyrinthine universe with stark contrasts, geometric shapes, verticals, horizontals and sharp angels. An urban universe completely without the trace of people, and only small glimpses of Mother Nature. I tried to make it vibrate between the “real” world we all inhabit and a conceived one of the mind’s eye. Thus, welcome to The Void.
The headline of this project was "Efterlysning". It served as a missing person add for Marie Schmidt - a fictional character/artist created by the show's curators. The idea was to challenge us photographers to create our own idea of who Marie Schmidt was, if she ever existed, and how to make her visible in a photographic sense. Inspired by the sensation of a real search for this person, I choose to create distorted night images hinting of something lost in the dark. And maybe a fatal encounter..

The hash (not the file) will be sent to our servers to see if the hash has previously been registered by someone else.
This is an important aspect: your files will NOT be uploaded anywhere. We will not see the contents of your file, they remain securely in your computer.
If you're not familiar with cryptographic hashes, here's a quick starter: a hash is a huge number that uniquely identifies digital content. The hash of a specific file or document will always be the same as long as the content isn't modified, and each file or document will always have its own unique hash. Because of this, a hash can be used as a unique identifier for any piece of content.
Hashes are not compressed or encrypted versions of the content. They do not contain any information about the content for which they are calculated, and it's impossible to reverse the process and to recreate the content from its hash. That's important, and it means that our process respects your privacy: your files and your information does not leave the safetly of your computer.
Drop a file here to either check if it's registered, or to register your ownership of it. No files will be uploaded, so the process is completely confidential.
Music is the popular literature of our modern culture. Songs often have interesting messages and meanings and certainly a wide range of vocabulary and expressions is used in many but not all song lyrics. So spending an hour studying a song and its meaning can be time very well spent. Every time your hear the song you will remember the words so this is a good way to learn new English words or expressions contained in a song. You will also enjoy songs more having understood the meaning of what is being sung. Finally Many web sites have discussions about the singer or group and the meanings of their songs so you can compare your interpretation to that of other people.

In his book In Praise of Forgetting: Historical Memory and Its Ironies, David Rieff questions whether the age-long “consensus that it is moral to remember, immoral to forget” still stands in our contemporary era. What should we remember, what should we forget, and why? Do we need to reconfigure the way that we think about memory and its potential impact on issues such as reconciliation and healing in the wake of war? Is memory impotent as a social, political, or aesthetic tool? Rieff’s questions appear more pertinent than ever as wars and conflicts continue to rage in many parts of the world with no end in sight.
These questions of memory (and forgetting) are intensely political and have far-reaching consequences. Yet, how do they reverberate in the context of post-war societies, post-conflict reconciliation, conflict prevention, questions of memory and past events? To what extent do we remember the past and how do we choose what to remember and why we remember? How could and should (consciously and unconsciously) memory processes shape the present and future? How might public institutions (such as museums and other heritage sites that support education/awareness) deal with the past? What is the difference between commemoration and memorialization? Where do they intersect and how might they impact the process of reconciliation and prevention?
For summer 2018 we continue the conversations on aesthetics that we initiated in our 2017 conference but with a more specific focus on “ruins, remains and reconstructions.” In his book The Texture of Memory James E. Young states that public art can often been static and is “seemingly frozen face in the landscape”. In light of this, we are interested in papers that consider the contemporary status of not only what “ruins or remains” are and how they are construed, but also the ways that post-conflict societies remember through reconstructions (material—such as renovations—or philosophical or theoretical). What are landscapes of memory? How do reconstructions remember memory? What kind of art is produced in conversation with remains and ruins? What is the role of remains (human/material) and ruins in relation to the communities that live with them? How are communities established around memorials and what impact might a memorial have on a community? What kind of role does visual culture, such as photography, play in these considerations?
We seek papers from a wide-range of historical and geographical spaces that address the discursive limits of contemporary memory studies, particularly drawing on these areas of study:
We welcome formal paper abstract submissions from early career researchers and post-docs as well as established scholars. We encourage applications from a range of academics, current PhD students, particularly from those outside of Western European institutions. All papers will be delivered in English.
This academic conference is part of the larger WARM festival, which takes place in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina each summer, and “is dedicated to war reporting, war art, war memory. WARM is bringing together people – journalists, artists, historians, researchers, activists – with a common passion for ‘telling the story with excellence and integrity’.” See here for more information.
Registration cost: 150 Euros. Concessionary rates are available for all graduate students, for faculty applying from non-EU/US institutions, and for those can present a case for reduced fees. Information about hostels and hotels will be provided for participants upon acceptance.
Please submit your proposals no later than February 15th, 2018 to why.remember.conference@gmail.com.

With all the chest-thumping going on in Nashville today, where bluster and swagger have replaced heart and soul, you half expect some of country music’s male stars to be sporting bruises. Which is what makes Midland, a trio of friends based in Dripping Springs, Texas, so undeniably refreshing. Made up of singer Mark Wystrach, lead guitarist Jess Carson and bass player Cameron Duddy, Midland is the embodiment of Seventies California country, all smooth Eagles harmonies and heart-on-your-sleeve lyrics. Their songs are intoxicating, sung with the twang of George Strait.
Now, after endearing themselves to fans with the hit radio single “Drinkin’ Problem” and a self-titled EP, Midland unveil their full-length debut, On the Rocks (Big Machine Records).
A collection of 13 tracks all written or co-written by Midland – the guys took their name from a Dwight Yoakam song – On the Rocks excels at setting a mood, transporting the listener to another place and time. It’s an album made for wide-open skies, endless deserts and wondering where the road is going to take you next.
“Drinkin’ Problem,” written with Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, who produced the album with Dann Huff, reclaims the drinking song for classic country music, making it less about an endless party and more about self-medicating. “They call it a problem, I call it a solution / just sitting here with all my grand illusions,” sings Wystrach, evoking the best booze ballads of both Gary Stewart and Merle Haggard, two of the trio’s chief influences.
“Make a Little,” a rollicking ditty, is more optimistic, soaring with the brotherly harmonies of Wystrach, Duddy and Carson and a timely message: “There’s just not enough love in the world.” The rapid-fire lyrics embody the clever wordplay that is unique to country music – “we should make a little, generate a little / maybe even make the world a better place a little” – and also nod to Alabama, another country band that helped spark a revolution in the genre.
Midland hearken back to a time when an artist’s personal style – colorful suits, tailored denim and well-worn hats – dovetailed with the music. And they tip their hats to other groundbreaking artists throughout On the Rocks.
The kick-back and get-high ode “Altitude Adjustment” name-checks John Denver, the majestic “Nothin’ New Under the Neon” sounds like vintage Eddie Rabbit, and the glorious “At Least You Cried” channels Dwight Yoakam. By album’s end, the band 2 returns to the Eagles, recalling their famous intro to “Seven Bridges Road,” with the closing “Somewhere on the Wind.”
“On the Rocks is a confluence of our musical tastes and our reverence for classic country,” says Duddy, whose wife, photographer Harper Smith, shoots all of the group’s stylish photos.
“This record is truly a nod to the time period we are influenced by,” says Carson, a Pacific Northwest native, “and is an effort to bring that sound and that pageantry back to the forefront.”
“We write with a very visual storytelling approach. We paint that big picture and go to that place,” says Wystrach. “Where is this story going? Let’s paint it.”
“Electric Rodeo,” with its plaintive piano, sweeping strings and high-in-the-saddle chorus, is a prime example of the “picture” the band talks about creating. And “Check Cashin’ Country,” a solo composition by Carson, stands as the band’s true-life road diary: the tale of a country-rock band trying to find time to sleep as they hustle from gig to gig, barely making enough money to put gas in the tank. It’s the country equivalent of Seger’s “On the Road.”
Midland first came together at Duddy’s wedding in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the three members ended up jamming onstage at the rehearsal dinner.
“It was this serendipitous chain of events, and it was the best week ever,” says Wystrach, who, despite his hippie persona, was actually raised on an Arizona cattle ranch. “By the end, we knew the three of us had amazing chemistry.”
“Midland isn’t manufactured,” says Duddy, born in California. “We are three real friends who stumbled upon making music together.”
Whether they intended it or not, Midland are filling a void in country, with songs that run the gamut from lush Urban Cowboy anthems to loose campfire sing-alongs. Putting their own spin on a classic sound, they’re making something old relevant again.
“We are a band,” says Carson, declaratively. “That’s a big part of the spirit of what we do, that group experience and camaraderie.”
Says Wystrach, “We’ve poured our hearts and souls into writing and making these songs and are extremely proud of what we’ve been able to create.”
With On the Rocks, Midland have captured a sound decades in the making that is just right for today.
It would be an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Whiskey Myers was last in the recording studio. Over two whirlwind years, the gritty Texas band hit #1 on the iTunes Country Chart with their breakout third album ‘Early Morning Shakes,’ earned raves everywhere from Rolling Stone to USA Today, and toured the US and UK relentlessly, slaying massive festival crowds and sharing stages with Lynyrd Skynyrd, Hank Williams Jr., Jamey Johnson, and more along the way. You’d be forgiven, then, for expecting things to work a little differently this time around when the band reunited with acclaimed producer Dave Cobb for their stellar new album, ‘Mud.’ But as it turns out, success doesn’t change a Southern gentleman, and they don’t come any more Southern than Whiskey Myers.
Fueled by larger-than-life performances honed tight from countless nights on the road, ‘Mud’ finds the band scaling new heights of songwriting and musicianship, with searing guitars, soulful vocals, and indelible hooks. While their approach to the music and humble, hard-working attitudes may not have altered, there have been developments in the Whiskey Myers world, most notably with the arrival of new faces. For the recording sessions, the band’s five founding members—Cody Cannon on lead vocals and guitar, Cody Tate and John Jeffers on guitars, Gary Brown on bass, and Jeff Hogg on drums—fleshed out their sound with the addition of fiddler/keyboard player Jon Knudson and percussionist Tony Kent, who are both now full-time members. “They bring a great energy, and I think it’s really helped our sound and makes the band more versatile,” explains Cannon. “There’s less room onstage now, but sometimes a family grows.”
For the Ninth consecutive year, Columbus musicians will play all 215 officially released Beatles songs, in a single performance. Beginning with the album, Please Please Me at 12:30 PM, and ending with Abbey Road some time after midnight, The Beatles Marathon is currently, the only single performance of every Beatles song.
The Beatles Marathon is arguably the most ambitious musical feat attempted in Columbus each year, and it has also become a beloved community event. For Peppercorn, who’s now known more for the Beatles show than for his band the Whiles, the event isn’t some excuse to play a bunch of covers and make some money. It’s an essential, sacred part of his life.
“You could find better musicians – especially with me,” Peppercorn said. “There are always at least 100 people in the Bluestone who could sing the song I am singing better than me. [But] we are the island of misfit toys, and this show is our home.” -Columbus Alive
“We wanted to show a different side and make a record that sounds like us,” Stephen Barker Liles says of Love and Theft’s boundary-pushing new album Whiskey On My Breath. “Country music has always been about honest performances and songs that mean something, and that’s the kind of record that we wanted to make.”
“We’re at a different place, in our music and in our lives, than we were when we made our earlier records, and we wanted this album to reflect that,” agrees his longstanding musical partner Eric Gunderson. “We worked harder and more passionately on this record than anything we’ve ever done. The whole experience was refreshing and inspiring for us.”
Whiskey On My Breath—the duo’s third album—marks a significant creative statement for the two singer-songwriter-guitarists, whose resume already includes a long series of career highlights. Having already established themselves as one of country’s hottest young acts with such memorable hits as the #1 country smash “Angel Eyes” and the Top 10 hit “Runaway,” and their widely acclaimed albums World Wide Open and Love and Theft, the ACM/CMA/CMT-nominated twosome take their music to the next level on Whiskey On My Breath.
Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in 1968 by Jimmy Page (guitar), Robert Plant (vocals), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin) and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven sound, Led Zeppelin are regarded as one of the first heavy metal bands. Rolling Stone has called the band, "the most influential and successful heavy-metal pioneer". However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Their rock-infused interpretation of the blues and folk genres also incorporated rockabilly, reggae, soul, funk, classical, Celtic, Indian, Arabic, pop, Latin and country. The band did not release the popular songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of "album-oriented rock". They charted ten singles in the US.
Dark-Rearing (DR) precludes the initiating event in OIR and eliminates the pathology seen in the second phase of disease: Rationale for novel non-invasive treatment for ROP.

Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 201657(12):.
Methods : 4 groups of SD rats were examined at P14 & P18: 1) Room Air + normal light reared (NLR); 2) Room air + dark rearing (DR). 3) 50/10 OIR + normal light 4) 50/10 OIR + dark rearing. Retinae were examined for vascular density index (VDI), vaso-obliteration & neovascularization, hypoxyprobe-1, astrocyte ensheathment, ultrastructure via TEM and gene expression via qPCR. Electroretinograms (ERG) were recorded at P18 & P25 in OIR, & in long term DR rats (P30/60/90). Retinal O2 profiles were modeled for P14 at 60 & 75% inspired O2 in NLR & DR.
Results : Confirming our proof of principle, DR rats had a higher vascular density than NLR rats in room air (VDI=43±1.0 vs.38±1.1 p<0.05 - P7). DR protected vessels from vaso-obliteration (20.6% ± 4.9 v 39.0% ± 4.0 p<0.05). In the hypoxic 2nd phase of OIR, DR reduced pre-retinal neovascularization (4.1% ± 0.9 v 15.8% ± 1.3 p<0.05); tissue hypoxia as evidenced by reduced HP1; protected astrocytes & pericytes from hypoxic damage; and preserved retinal ultrastructure. DR prevented upregulation of HIF1a (65.5% ± 27.2 v -20.4 ± 4.6 p<0.05), VEGF164 (496.6% ± 11.1 v 291.2% ± 60.1 p<0.05) and AP1/Jun (179.8% ± 26.9 v -51.7 ± 16.7, p<0.05) in peripheral retina at P14. DR had no detrimental effects on retinal function as evidenced by ERG at P18 and P25 in OIR, & after long-term DR. O2 profile modeling under DR at 60% inspired O2 at P14 showed that inner retina maintains 'physiological hypoxia' in DR but not in NLR ,whilst 75% O2 overwhelms the protective effect of DR.
Conclusions : DR precludes the initiation of ROP by maintaining retinal vascularization during the 1st phase of OIR. As a consequence, when neonates are returned to RA, the retina is protected from hypoxia-induced vaso-proliferation in phase 2 of ROP and it’s associated damaging effects on retinal structure and function. This cost-effective, non-invasive intervention by reducing disease severity can supplement current therapies and, may negate the need for invasive therapies including laser and anti-VEGF.

This paper reviewed the concept of labor proposed by radical feminism and socialist feminism in order to find out a clue about how to dissolve the most serious labor contradictions of mass unemployment and job insecurity. As a result, it figured out that both radical feminism and socialist feminism have the same vision for the structural shift of labor from slaving to freedom. The two of them dream of the world in which all labor of the human is transformed into the vital activity of caring, the creative work of self-realization, and the political action of expanding their sphere of freedom to the cosmos. In spite of that, they failed in gaining the political hegemony for social change, because their lack of awareness of spirituality entrapped them into separatism and elitism. When all of us anchor off our innermost spirituality, through which any ruling powers can hold out no longer, then and only then, will we have the ability to see and actualize such a new feminist vision of craft labor, of holistic labor, and of free labor, thus reducing the working hours, overturning the set of labor value, and narrowing the wage gap.

The last thing a person wants to worry about while staying in the ICU is the cost of their stay, but it is a realistic concern for many. Depending on the services the patient requires, and the length of stay, patients can expect to pay roughly $3000 to $5000 for a typical stay. If the stay is prolonged, and you require more care, expect to pay roughly $50,000 for one week of service. The intensive care unit is usually only necessary in cases of extreme health risks and treatments and so the expense is always worth it.

This booklet was written primarily as a resource for police, educators, trainers, social service and health care providers, and senior high school, college and university students. It provides information on commonly used mood-altering or psychoactive drugs. In this booklet, the term “drug” is used to refer to any psychoactive or mood-altering substance, including alcohol, inhalants, tobacco, over-the-counter and prescription medication and psychoactive substances which are illegally possessed or distributed. Today, there are more drugs available than ever before, both legally and illegally. Drug-related problems, including personal and family unhappiness, dependency, physical and mental health problems, premature death, lost productivity, increased crime, highway crashes, and ever-growing costs of law enforcement and health care, are a major social concern. The widespread availability and use of drugs means that drug-related problems will impact all Canadians in one way or another. As a result, there is a need for accurate information about different types of drugs and their effects, how people use them, and how they can affect our lives. How This Booklet Works There are three main parts: The first part looks at drug issues from a general point of view, without going into detail about individual drugs except when they are used as examples. This part is divided into six major sections, each one dealing with a separate drug abuse -related issue.
The second part of the booklet consists of nine charts designed as a quick, ready reference for more detailed information on drugs. Each chart covers a major drug group or family:
The charts contain detailed information on the individual drugs within each drug abuse group or family, including a description of each drug, its origin and medical uses, its short- and long-term effects, its tolerance and dependence properties, and legal status.
The third part of the booklet, the Appendix, contains more information on specific topics associated with drug use. For quick reference, the booklet also includes a summary listing of each of the drug families and an index of individual drugs. Prescription drugs are listed by their generic designations; for each drug, an example of a widely-used brand name product which contains that drug is also listed and is indicated by the symbol “®”. It should be recognized that some drugs may be available under other brand names and in other forms (e.g., capsule rather than tablet). The final section of the booklet lists useful names and addresses and sources of information. For additional information and statistics on drug use, see the web sites listed in this section. Information specifically on substances that are banned by national and international athletic and sports regulatory bodies is available from the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, whose toll-free number is listed on page 57.
The information in this booklet is based on current knowledge and may change as new research information becomes available. Much is known about drugs and their possible risks and benefits. Much remains to be found out. Many of the long-term effects of drugs may not be discovered for years. While many drugs have legitimate uses, no drug should be used without proper caution as to its possible short-term and long-term effects.
If you are looking for an Alcohol residential treatment program / rehab or drug rehabilitation program or center in Canada then please make sure you select one that you want to be in. An addict / alcoholic in Canada ( or anywhere else )will use any reason available to leave an Alcohol residential treatment / rehab / rehabilitation program. This is why it is so important for the addict / alcoholic to be involved in the choosing process. This applies to addicts / alcoholics going into an Alcohol residential treatment program / rehab or drug rehabilitation program or center in the USA, England, South Africa, Holland, Scotland, Spain etc and not just Canada.
Once the self work begins in an Alcohol residential treatment / rehab / rehabilitation program then the time is right for the addict / alcoholic to look for reasons to leave. It is with this in mind that it is recommended for the addict / alcoholic to be involved in the choosing of the Alcohol residential treatment / rehab / rehabilitation program. In Canada there is a massive choice, choose wisely and with help, this will hopefully lead to continuing ongoing recovery once time in the Alcohol residential treatment / drug abuse rehab / rehabilitation program finishes.

What do pro skaters do with the boards they skate and destroy? They recruit the help of friends like Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Adam Yauch, and they turn them into skateparks.
Legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk and Grammy Award-winning musician Ben Harper have invited their friends in the skate and music worlds to join them for the very special Boards + Bands project. A member of the nonprofit Tony Hawk Foundation Board Of Directors, Harper conceived the idea to use pro skaters’ old decks to write song lyrics on and raise funds to build positive recreational outlets for at-risk youth.
These special collaboration skateboards will be available in a celebrity auction launching December 3 on eBay, and will be on display through the end of the auction at the GRAMMY Museum in downtown Los Angeles, California.
“Skating and music have always been inseparably connected on a soul level,” said Harper. “For me, listening to great music evokes the same emotional connection as watching great skating. And the feeling that comes from playing music is the same feeling I get from skating. The backbone of skating is the board—the backbone of music are the lyrics. If I had to choose between Beethoven’s piano painted by Da Vinci or Tony Hawk’s ridden skateboard with Paul McCartney’s lyrics to Blackbird … You don’t want to know which I’d choose.”
The Boards + Bands fundraising initiative merges the worlds of skateboarding and music to benefit the work of the Tony Hawk Foundation. Hawk invited a select group of professional skateboarders to donate their personally ridden skateboards and submit the name of their favorite songs. Harper then sent those boards on to the appropriate artists with one simple message: “Please write the lyrics to this skater’s favorite song on his skateboard, and we’ll use it to create more skateparks for kids.”
The chosen recording artists have hand-written the lyrics on these one-of-a-kind skateboards. Included in this unprecedented auction are board collaborations by the following artists and skaters: Adam Yauch and Bucky Lasek; Ben Harper and Rodney Mullen; Bob Dylan and Jamie Thomas; Tom Petty and Mike Vallely; Jimmy Cliff and Lance Mountain; Metallica and Steve Caballero; Ben Harper and Bob Burnquist; and Paul McCartney and Tony Hawk.
“This is literally a dream come true,” said Hawk. “When Ben first approached me with the idea, I was skeptical because the list of musicians requested was legendary. But they came through, proving that skateboarding’s reach is even broader than we imagined.”
Among the boards is a set of four decks that Adam Yauch used to meticulously stylize the lyrics to the Beastie Boys’ Bodhisattva Vow. Undergoing treatment for cancer at the time, Yauch completed the boards shortly before he passed away this Spring.
Funds raised through this effort will benefit the Tony Hawk Foundation, which supports at-risk youth through the creation of public skateparks in low-income communities across the U.S. These skateparks are safe, sanctioned places for youth to come together, form communities, and practice the sport they love in a healthy environment. Since 2002, the Foundation has helped to fund 512 public skateparks in 50 states.
The Boards + Bands skateboards will be on display at the GRAMMY Museum from December 3, 2012 through the close of the auction on December 13.
“We’re thrilled to partner with the Tony Hawk Foundation as the worlds of music and skateboarding continue to merge,” said Rita George, Deputy Director of the GRAMMY Museum. “The caliber of artists and skaters who are participating in the Boards + Bands project is incredible, and we’re excited to showcase their boards in our museum.”
The GRAMMY Museum is located in the L.A. Live district at 800 W. Olympic Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90015. Museum hours, admission, and other information can be found at www.grammymuseum.org, or by calling (213) 765-6800. All of the artists participating in the Boards + Bands program are Grammy Award winners.
A charitable, non-profit organization, the Tony Hawk Foundation was established in 2002 by its namesake, professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, to promote and provide funds for high-quality public skateparks in low-income areas throughout the United States—with an emphasis on the word “quality.” Since then, the Foundation has awarded over $4-million to 512 communities in all 50 states. The Foundation focuses on working with local officials and grassroots, community-based organizations that plan to hire designers and contractors with strong experience designing and building skateparks.
The Tony Hawk Foundation was established by a gift from Tony Hawk. Its directors raise additional funds through events, industry donations, and continuing contributions from Tony and other entities. In addition to skateparks, the Foundation also makes donations to other children-related charities, as chosen by its Board of Directors. For more information or to make a donation, visit the Foundation’s Web site at www.tonyhawkfoundation.org. You can also visit THF on Facebook at www.facebook.com/tonyhawkfoundation, and Twitter @THawkFoundation.

This study aims to figure out why the consumers watching SBS drama, of post-feminism text like it and what implied meaning it has. For the recent few years, people have keen interest in post-feminism text in the area of public culture, and discourse around it also has surged quantitatively. Although some view it negatively saying that it is a commercial genre that gets on product logic raising lookism and materialism, the needs of the consumers enjoying post-feminism text are highly diverse and reflect a new image of women in this new era. Thereupon, this study takes as its subject for analysis the viewers` board of SBS drama broadcast in 2008 having as its original work which is induced as one of the representative post-feminism novels in the literary circle. According to the result of analyzing 1209 viewers` reviews among total 3487 on the board with the internet ethnographic method, the first meaning and reason of the viewers` preference for post-feminism text is the reflection of modern consumers` preference for realistic stories. Although previous dramas tended to make a mystery of female characters from the male-oriented view, this drama reflects women`s sexual needs and modern women`s passion for social life. Second, it reflects the consumers` preference for women`s ties which has so far taken a smaller portion than family-centered or patriarchal relationships. Third, it reflects consumers` preference for aesthetic behavior. The consumption to adorn the body in this post-feminism era is not the behavior of purchasing items but ``aesthetic behavior`` to create and transform oneself newly and also is the power for women to shake the patriarchal gender norms. The fragmentary view to derogate women`s consuming culture discusses modern women that will actually practice the agenda of new feminism and also hinders the exploration of their identity.

Continuing from part #2 Biblical with this part #3 of my new series "Jesus was executed on a cross, not a stake!".
Yet another un-Biblical (see part #2) Watchtower Bible & Tract Society illustration of Jesus on a single-beamed stake, with His hands above His head, affixed by one nail (not "nails" as in Jn 20:25 NWT) and with the charge against Him above His hands (not "above His head" as in Mt 27:37 NWT) !]
The Watchtower's linguistic argument to support its claim that Jesus was executed on a single-beamed stake, not a two-beamed cross, is as follows: 1) "The Greek word translated `cross' is stauros"; 2) "It basically means `an upright pale or stake'"; 3) Therefore "Jesus Christ did not die on a cross":
"... Jesus Christ did not die on a cross. The Greek word generally translated `cross' is stau-ros'. It basically means `an upright pale or stake.'" (WB&TS, 2005, "What Does the Bible Really Teach?" p.205).
But this argument is not only fallacious, it is dishonest. It is fallacious because the basic meaning of a word is not its only meaning. It can be readily granted that the basic meaning of stauros is "an upright pale or stake." Quite clearly the stauros as "an upright pale or stake" came first and then using it as part of an instrument of torture and execution came later.
"The Witnesses say stauros `primarily denotes an upright stake or pole.' ... They wish ... the reader to understand ... that it can mean only that. In fact, the word has a broader sense. It means cross as well as stake":
"Jehovah's Witnesses insist stauros can mean only stake. They conclude that, since the New Testament says Jesus died on a stauros, he did not die on a cross but on a single vertical beam, with his hands nailed together directly over his head. ... The Witnesses say stauros `primarily denotes an upright stake or pole.' ["Reasoning from the Scriptures," Watchtower Bible & Tract Society, Second edition, 1989, p.89] They wish to suggest (and the reader to understand) that it can mean only that. In fact, the word has a broader sense. It means cross as well as stake. If you pick up a dictionary and look up the word `square,' you find diverse senses of the word; the dictionary does not confine itself to a single Euclidean definition. (By the way, notice that the Witnesses refer to `classical Greek.' The New Testament was not written in classical Greek, but in Koine Greek, which has a sense of its own, just as American English has a sense of its own, distinct from that of British English--but the difference between the two Greeks is greater.)" (Bower, C.F., Jr., "Cross or Torture Stake?," This Rock, Vol. 2, No. 5, October 1991).
"To argue that ... stauros could be used only for that form [a simple upright stake with no crosspiece], is ... a naive restriction of the term to its original or simplest meaning":
"Cross or Stake? The Jehovah's Witnesses fail to point out that the Greek word stauros was used to refer to a variety of wooden structures used for execution in ancient days. Robert Bowman notes that stauros as a wooden structure could represent shapes `similar to the Greek letter tau (T) and the plus sign (+), occasionally using two diagonal beams (X), as well as (infrequently) a simple upright stake with no crosspiece. To argue that only the last-named form was used, or that stauros could be used only for that form, is contradictory to the actual historical facts and is based on a naive restriction of the term to its original or simplest meaning.' [Bowman, R.M., "Understanding Jehovah's Witnesses," Baker: Grand Rapids, 1991, p.143]" (Rhodes, R., 1993, "Reasoning from the Scriptures with the Jehovah's Witnesses," Harvest House: Eugene OR, p.396. Emphasis original).
The dishonest part of the Watchtower's linguistic argument is it must know, but fails to tell its followers, that all New Testament Greek lexicons give "cross" as a secondary (and one even the primary) meaning of stauros in the New Testament (my emphasis red):
"stauros ... the cross ... in the sense 'upright pointed stake' or `pale' ... the instrument by which the capital punishment of crucifixion was carried out ... a stake sunk into the earth in an upright position; a cross-piece was oft ... attached to its upper part, so that it was shaped like a T or thus † ..." (Bauer, W., Arndt, W.F., Gingrich, F.W. & Danker, F.W., 1979, "A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament," University of Chicago Press, p.764. My transliteration).
"stauros [cross] ...1. stauros is an upright `stake' such as is used in fences or palisades. 2. The stauros is an instrument of torture for serious offenses. It may be a vertical pointed stake, an upright with a cross-beam above it, or a post with an intersecting beam of equal length." (Kittel, G. & Friedrich, G., eds. , 1988, "Theological Dictionary of the New Testament: Abridged in one Volume," Eerdmans, p.1071. Word in square brackets original).
"stauros ... A cross, a stake, often with a cross-piece, on which criminals were nailed for execution." (Zodhiates, S., 1992, "The Complete Word Study Dictionary: New Testament," AMG, pp.1308-1309).
Moreover, even by the Watchtower's own admission above, the word stauros does not mean "torture stake," but just "an upright pale or stake." So "There is no justification for inserting the word `torture', the Greek phrase used is simply `en stauros'":
"Paul showed that we should proudly boast about Jesus death on the cross. Its use is constant reminder of the importance of the ransom to our everlasting existence. Galatians 6:14 `Never may it occur that I should boast, except in the torture stake [cross] of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been impaled [crucified] to me and I to the world.' [New World Translation. ... There is no justification for inserting the word `torture', the Greek phrase used is simply `en stauros']" (Grundy, P., 2008, "Cross or Stake," Facts About Jehovah's Witnesses, 18 February).
So (as we saw in my last post) the Watchtower is here guilty of inserting the word "torture" into Scripture, when it isn't there in the Greek, the 27 times that stauros appears in the New Testament. This is putting words into God's mouth, thus making God conform to Watchtower doctrine, not the other way around.
“The Greek word for cross, [stauros’], properly signified a stake, an upright pole, or piece of paling, on which anything might be hung, or which might be used in impaling [fencing in] a piece of ground….Even amongst the Romans the crux (from which our cross is derived) appears to have been originally an upright pole.”
They left out some critical information by their use of ellipses, and they also moved the period placement at the end forward. Fortunately, the Imperial Bible Dictionary is available to read or download online through Internet Archive, so people can read page 376 for themselves.
Justus Lipsius' book that the WTS borrowed an illustration from to support their stake argument in the NWT study edition (Appendix) and in the KIT can also be found online. The Catholic forum has a scanned pdf.
It looks like you left off on your cross vs. torture stake articles. And after a year plus I had to dig up your latest article in this series. Sorry for the delay!
I would have wanted to see your selection of patristic evidence: I found out that at least some of the Ante-Nicene Fathers thought Jesus was crucified on a five-pointed cross with the fifth point used to *ahem* "crucify" in a most perverted manner (as the extant Pozzuoli and Vivat Crux graffiti show).
BTW the so-called "crackpot theologian" Gunnar Samuelsson is 100% correct but his work was misrepresented by the sensationalist press (nothing new). He still believes Jesus was crucified on a cross but the NT verbiage cannot support it for some reason, unless the NT was the first time staur-ow was used to mean crucify and not impale on top of a pointed stake. And yes, I agree with you that Jesus was NOT impaled on such nor nailed to a simple post!
Yes, but not necessarily permanently. But I have been focusing most of my blogging on my The Shroud of Turin blog.
>I would have wanted to see your selection of patristic evidence: I found out that at least some of the Ante-Nicene Fathers thought Jesus was crucified on a five-pointed cross with the fifth point used to *ahem* "crucify" in a most perverted manner (as the extant Pozzuoli and Vivat Crux graffiti show).
>BTW the so-called "crackpot theologian" Gunnar Samuelsson is 100% correct but his work was misrepresented by the sensationalist press (nothing new).
I disagree that he is "100% correct" in his reported claim that "Jesus did not die on [a] cross." He is 100% IN-correct"!
>He still believes Jesus was crucified on a cross but the NT verbiage cannot support it for some reason,
I disagree with the latter. The Gk. word stauros (like most words) is ambiguous. It can mean a single upright stake, or a two-beamed cross. But as I pointed out in my "Jesus was executed on a cross, not a stake! #2: Biblical," the New Testament makes it clear that Jesus was executed on a two-beamed cross and not a single beamed stake:
1. According to Mt 27:37 NWT, the charge against Jesus was posted "above his HEAD" not "above his HANDS" as it would be if Jesus was executed on a single upright stake.
2. According to Jn 20:25 NWT, Jesus had the "print of the NAILS" (plural) in His hands. Not ONE NAIL as the Watchtower has consistently depicted Jesus affixed to a single-beamed stake.
3. Jesus predicted the "sort of death" that Peter would die would be by him having to "stretch out" (Gk. ekteino) his hands (Jn 21:17-19 NWT). The Gk. word means stretch out sideways, not up.
Samuelsson's Ph.D dissertation committee should have failed him, for ignoring such clear evidence against his thesis.
>unless the NT was the first time staur-ow was used to mean crucify and not impale on top of a pointed stake.
It wasn't. There are plenty of examples in pre-NT history where stauros can only mean a two-beamed cross. See Leolaia, "The facts on crucifixion, stauros, and the `torture stake'," Jehovahs-Witness.Net, June 11, 2005.
Many modern `theologians' (so-called) like Samuelsson are mere careerists, working in theologial departments of secular universities (e.g. the "University of Gothenburg"), whose dominant philosophy is Naturalism ("nature is all there is-there is no supernatural"). They publish controversial works so that they get noticed and can be employed at such naturalistic theological departments.
They (including Samuelsson) will have to give account to Jesus (Mt 16:27; 2Cor 5:10; Acts 10:41-42; Rev 20:12, Rev 22:12) for such falsehoods they have written in the name of Christ and the support they have given to anti-Christian cults like the JWs.
For your information some biblical authors also used the word Xýlon which means "stick or wooden piece" and that's singular, so you can't assume that it was a "cross" since a cross consists of 2 wooden pieces
>For your information some biblical authors also used the word Xýlon which means "stick or wooden piece"
No. As I pointed out in my post, "Was Jesus executed on a cross or a stake? #2C: Linguistic", the New Testament Greek word "xylon", which primarily means "wood", can also mean "cross" (my emphasis bold below):
And as per these quotes from leading New Testament Greek lexicons, xy'lon can also mean "cross" ...:
>and that's singular, so you can't assume that it was a "cross" since a cross consists of 2 wooden pieces

This post is about three B's that are central to my week. I'm talking about the The Breman Jewish Museum, Brendan Murphy and Ben Walker. See, I'm enrolled in a week-long intensive course designed to help train educators to teach the Holocaust. The course is a specialized annual program offered by The Breman Institute in Atlanta. I have to say, it is only day two but I've gotten a lot out of the course and am very glad I enrolled.
Due to time, I probably won't blog about the course everyday but I hope to do at least a couple posts this week. We are in class from 8:15 to 3:15 each day and it is non-stop with only a small lunch break. Each day we spend time connected to the Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and also have a featured Holocaust Survivor who speaks to us and takes questions. Those two elements alone make the course a win for me but they aren't all that is happening but that is where I will start.
Today's Holocaust survivor was Ben Walker (pictured above). He is in his early 80's and was originally from rural Romania. He managed to survive the war with his mother but lost his father and sister. However, like many survivors, he avoided discussing his experiences for decades.
What changed his mindset about speaking out was 9/11 and the fear he saw in his daughter and kids after that event. For the last 16 years he's been the voice of a witness, sharing his personal journey through the tragedy that at the time destroyed his world.
What I noticed about Ben is a trait many survivors exhibit: a healthy sense of humor. He joked and asked face-to-face questions of his audience. In doing so, he shared the source of his strength - a renewed hope that had been rekindled somewhere down the line.
Ben focused on the Ukraine and Romania which are little discussed and his eventually aliyah to Israel where he lived on a kibbutz with other survivors. Apparently, in the desert hope does bloom. I highly encourage listening to Ben if you get the chance.
Well, that brings me to the third B. Dr. Brendan Murphy spoke for nearly three hours on antisemitism and the roots of this demented ideology which he traced back to the time of Jesus and then walked his class through the timeline of events since.
We spent a good deal of time (but the time flew by) in the Middle Ages talking about how the Catholic Church and especially Martin Luther incorporated antisemitism into their teachings. Martin Luther in particularly wrote what amounted to a foreshadowing of a Nazi Manifesto. It was disturbing to see religion twisted for the sake of prejudice and realize how often it goes unchecked from behind the pulpit.
Still, the hatred of Jews doesn't explain how mankind makes the leap to genocide which became a staple of the 20th century. Brendan Murphy fielded a theory that the ingredient that made genocide possible was racism. He explored the aspects of that and it was a thought-provoking session.
There is a lot to absorb. I am looking forward to tomorrow's Yad Vashem hookup as it is suppose to be about ghettos. I have like five questions already to ask so I will have to weed the list down tomorrow over morning coffee. I like a good challenge.

Press "Edit Properties..." button to edit button edges width. By default, when you add new button, its edges widths are set to 5. But if you will change preview button size to 100x50 or bigger, you will see that some image elements look "fuzzy" (left image on the picture below). It happened because the play buttons border is not within the edge area.
Set both horizontal and vertical edges width to 10. You can see that the result looks much more precise now. Border is not resized because it is within the edge area now (right image on the picture above).

What is the mission of the Warrenton Youth Soccer Club? The founders of WYSC created the league as a place where children of all ages and abilities could learn about sports while having fun. The emphasis is on learning, teamwork and sportsmanship.
Daily activity stations which will include multi -sports skill stations, learning basic fundamentals of different sports, craft time, outdoor activities (weather permitting)
WYSC runs a sports camp with many activities planned through out the day. We will have all of the equipment and materials avialable so attendees would be perfectly equiped with themselves, a water bottle, and food. Although there are lulls for a break or snack, there is no time for electronics/outside toy usage.
Cells phones fall under "electronics," however kids may need to contact parents at the end of the day or in the event of forgetting a lunch. We understand. If a kid needs to bring a cell phone to camp, we can keep it a safe box in the office. Otherwise, they should be kept at home. Thank you.
One (small) RV, a newly married couple, driving on the wrong side, map reading and a wish for an adventure - The Wearins do the USA.
Ready to leave the excess of LA we head down the the coast to San Diego. Along the way we stop in at the world famous "Trestle" surf break where Grant had his best surf of the trip. As you can see it was a sparkling day, a wetsuit was hardly required with this unusual warm current and warm air and the waves just kept rolling and rolling. I enjoyed viewing all the lovely Cali bodies coming in and out - of course no better than my husbands!
We are a bit pressed for time because we need to be in Vegas in a few days to get our flight to New York, so we have only allowed one day to see San Diego which I know is not enough. What better way to spend it than the world famous San Diego Zoo.
We saw a lot of this going on. Poor thing - there was 3 other males in with her and they were just playing tag team.
These two were hilarious - being brothers they were chasing each other around and around, butting and wetting each other.

These beautifully matched male and female Wedding Bands appear as though they were made to fit together like two parts of a puzzle, while sparkling diamonds only heighten the romance.
* Great online price inclusive of matching set, diamond, certificate and worldwide Fed Ex courier delivery. Price includes GST.
In particular the way that the engagement ring tapers its width as it nears the main stone is very pleasing to the eye. Furthermore the way in which the halo holds the stone so securely while leading all of the attention to that main stone and the surrounding diamonds is a really beautiful achievement.
All in all I cannot thank you enough for such a painless process and wonderful jewellery that you have sent us.
Although I was not down on one knee on this occasion my wife assures me that these beautiful rings would have more than persuaded her to say yes!
We are now officially engaged !My partner absolutely adored the ring, it was exactly what she was after and how she had imagined it would look. Sizing was perfect also....! Always good to get it right ! So, again a big thank you to you Erika, for all your help over the past few weeks you have been terrific and a pleasure to deal with...! Will be in touch re: some wedding bands in the not too distant future!
The Service and The Quality of my purchase far exceeded my expectations. I was Very Nervous spending Thousands of Dollars on line, I have to admit the 2 weeks waiting for the stunning ring to arrive to getting a valuation I did have my concerns. The ring was valued at over double what I paid for it, I did have a sigh of relief at that point. I can Categorically say I have told all my mates about one of the most magnificent purchase experience especially after seeing my Fiancee Face when she saw the ring that she is going to wear on her finger for the rest of her Life, Thanks 1791.

Appearance : Fearsome predators combining the features of a shark and squid. Giant Squidsharks can grow to be over 20' long.
Unlike regular sharks and squids these beasts can be found in both fresh and salt water. They are aggressive and often hunt in packs. Like a common shark they can smell blood up to 300' away. They use their tentacles to grasp prey on boats or near the water. Riverfolk have learned the hard way not to sleep along the waterline. On a successful hit the tentacles inflict 1d4 points of constrictive damage, and continue to inflict this constrictive damage on following rounds. A tentacle can be severed by causing 6 hit points of damage, after losing 4 tentacles a squidshark will likely (60% chance) swim away, but first it will release a 30' cloud of obscuring ink to cover its escape.
It's been ages since I posted anything of substance. I recently picked up the Weirdworld #1 comic. One of the beasts briefly encountered in it is the Giant Squidshark. Thought I'd dust off my books and stat this beastie up.
Thanks Venger, I actually thought about adding a section about them being a dangerous threat in and around the Islands of the Purple Haunted Putrescence!

In general, most motorists highly dislike roadworks for the traffic gridlocks that they cause during rush hour. However, now imagine driving through such roadworks and next to a worker on the road seeing a huge billboard of yourself, suddenly the busy traffic does not seem that bad. With this effect, you can place a picture of your choice on the billboard for public display next to a worker on the road undergoing roadworks. Give it a go today!

While changes in various forms, ideology of liberation of women was launched in feminism has led to the era of post-feminism that end of feminism today. This phenomenon is reflected in the age of mass media, popular sentiment making drawn in the past few years several regulatory roles, women`s roles was in the movie, regardless of genre and now being expanded into a variety of images. But in Korea in society`patriarchal system` and`female` that exists between `discrimination and oppression` has been completely resolved for a discussion of this study still needs to be pointed out as being the problem. The purpose of this study was started in the late 1990s, post-feminist era, women in Korea and the U.S. How would you describe the movie poster and to study the implications and make it objective. In particular, the movie poster criticism contained in the evaluation of women with signs of the times is done so that the women of appreciation for the study. Method of study in Korea and the U.S. in the late 1990s production and the simultaneous screening of two films starring women lead movie poster convenience to select four piece, and analysis of vessel and registration table, the mythology in the semiotics of Roland Barthes, were analyzed qualitatively the correlation between the dichotomous structure of the female image posters of South Korea and the U.S. in the semiotics of Greimas square basis. As a result, even in the film, such as South Korea and the United States is the opposite of a poster of the signifier and the opposition groups to form the structure was patriarchal system in Korea is deeply rooted in the post-feminist era, while remaining in the United States is based on liberal individualism notice that consciousness was reflected in the depth.
In light of recent theoretical discussions on cosmopolitanism and cosmofeminism, this article sets out to find a new feminist vision and aesthetic in Lynn Nottage’s 2009 Pulitzer Prize winning play Ruined(2009) that can counteract both nationalism and globalization. First, problematizing both the patriarchal ideology of nationalism and its counterforce globalization, which is easily coopted by neoliberalist global capitalism, I suggest cosmopolitanism as an alternative ethical/aesthetic project determined to conceptualize and develop communities across cultural borders. Second, I trace the genealogy of cosmofeminist discourses that combine cosmopolitanism and feminism from Virginia Woolf’s Three Guineas and Robin M org an’s “ Global Sisterhood” to t he most recent addition of Susan Stanford Friedman’s thesis on “cosmofeminism from the side.” Thirdly, drawing on Friedman’s delineation of “cosmofeminism from the side,” I analyze how Ruined challenges not only patriarchal nationalism and global capitalism but also the binary rhetorics of cosmopolitanism of “above” and “below,” “old” and “new,” “elite” and “vulgar,” and thereby creates a space for “horizontal cosmopoetics.” The essay particularly delves into how the play conceives ‘home’ as a part of the cosmopolitan that is itself a vital interlocutor in public laws and ethics and how Nottage’s dramaturgy achieves “gentle balance” and “fragile hope” by valorizing affective emotions and popular culture that had been ostracized by second-wave feminism. Finally, in the conclusion, I discuss three choices given to millenium feminist drama-postfeminism, postmodernism, cosmofeminism-of which I turn to the last as the most viable direction we should take.

STILL THE CLASS OF THE DISTRICT -- Kilgore junior Tori Shipman (above, 11) controls the ball against Tatum. Shipman had a second-half goal Wednesday afternoon in the Lady Bulldogs' 7-0 rout of the Lady Eagles. The KHS boys won, as well. Both Kilgore soccer programs, unbeaten in district play, face Henderson on Tuesday.
Contrary to popular belief among fans, coaches don’t talk a lot about getting “revenge,” especially when a team goes on to win a state title.
One of the few losses the Kilgore Bulldogs had last year came at Tatum, a bit of a head-scratcher, considering Kilgore’s district losses in the last eight years have been few and far between. Tatum pulled off the upset last year, but coach Tom Wait’s Bulldogs were having none of it Wednesday night.
Playing a day later than scheduled after thunderstorms forced the change, the Bulldogs got out with a hard-fought 1-0 win over the Eagles at Eagle Stadium. Kilgore’s Lady Bulldogs were especially impressive in a 7-0 rout of the Lady Eagles here at R.E. St. John Memorial Stadium, also played Wednesday.
Both Kilgore teams were to visit Gladewater on Friday night, following the deadline for this issue of the News Herald. On Tuesday, the Bulldogs will visit Henderson (a 5:15 p.m. junior varsity start) and the Lady ‘Dogs will host Henderson (JV starting at 5).
Kilgore 1, Tatum 0 (boys): The star of this one just might have been KHS goalkeeper Kaleb Jett, who had four saves to help keep the Eagles out of Kilgore’s net.
Offensively, Elian Torres had the Bulldogs’ only goal – the only goal of the game, in fact – scored in the first half. Kilgore’s defense stood tall. The ‘Dogs had 17 shots on goal, with Tatum’s keeper managing eight saves.
The Bulldogs, the defending District 16-4A and 4A state champions, are 7-5-2 overall, and a 2-0 in district play.
They actually started the game, and played about 20 minutes, on Tuesday, but lightning forced the stoppage. They re-started the contest on Wednesday, and Kilgore didn’t take long to pick up where it left off.
Coach Heidi Hagan has a talented group of freshmen who have played youth soccer together for years, to the point they don’t look like freshmen. One of them, Zoe Craven, gave Kilgore an early lead, scoring a goal with 24:09 showing on the first-half clock. Craven led the way for Kilgore’s cross-country team to compete in the state meet last year.
Senior Kaitlyn Word scored the first of her two goals in the game just about five minutes later, and then Cristina Rosas, another freshman, scored with 4:10 left. Word added her second goal with 1:38 left, and the Lady ‘Dogs held a very comfortable 4-0 lead at the halftime break.
They weren’t through. Tori Shipman, a junior, scored on a header with 26:39 left in the game. Rosas added her second goal, Kilgore’s sixth, with 22:51 showing, and Kylie Nichols had the final say, dropping one more into the net with 12:50 remaining.
The Lady ‘Dogs are also the defending district champs, and are also 2-0 in district play so far this season.

Progress happens swift for some and slow for others. In our days here of learning and integrating the messages of the soul, let us learn to be patient. Let us remember that a drop of water fills the bucket, and remember that we may not see all the drops someone is gathering inside them. We may have our physical measuring sticks for physical things, but this is about the non physical aspect of all beings. In this non physical aspect of who we are and who others are, let us remember that the awakening process of another is happening, whether we see proof of it or not. Awakening can happen in the flash of an instant. The progress is inevitable, light is a seed that will always grow, and not always on the logical timetable we come to understand in our limited experience of knowing. No matter the age or how justified we may feel in our pain and what it has taught us, should we ever think that the same thing is happening all over again. Similar, but not the same. Can you see the grain of the lesson you might have missed? Will you make something nourishing of it instead. These are questions to ask in your silent spaces, as you come into the fullness of your being. Enjoy this beautiful day. Sorrow or joy, it is all still a gift. Open it, and your heart too.

Hernia is a general term that describes an opening in the body between 2 spaces that are not normally connected. Hernia can occur in multiple areas of the body and the most common area is the abdominal region. In the abdomen, hernias occur when the inside layers of the abdominal muscle have weakened resulting in a bulge or tear. This can allow a loop of intestine or abdominal tissue to push into the sac. Symptoms of hernia can include pain, discomfort and they can be unsightly. Usually they are not life-threatening, however they can be dangerous if the organ becomes entrapped and the blood supply is disrupted. Both men and women get hernias. One may be born with a hernia. A hernia does not get better over time, nor will it go away by itself. There are no exercises or physical therapy regimen that can make a hernia go away.
How do I know if I have a hernia? The most common areas where hernias occur are in the groin (inguinal), belly button (umbilical), and the site of a previous operation (incisional). It is usually easy to recognize a hernia. You may notice a bulge under the skin. You may feel pain or discomfort when you lift heavy objects, cough, strain during urination or bowel movements, or during prolonged standing or sitting. Other times, a hernia may be detected by your doctor on a routine physical examination. The pain may be sharp and immediate or a dull ache that gets worse toward the end of the day. Severe, continuous pain, redness, and tenderness are signs that the hernia may be entrapped or strangulated. Another sign of this is, if the bulge used to come and go, but now is stuck out continuously. These symptoms are cause for concern and you should immediately contact your physician or surgeon.
The wall of the abdomen has natural areas of potential weakness. Hernias can develop at these or other areas due to heavy strain on the abdominal wall, aging, injury, an old incision or a weakness present from birth. Anyone can develop a hernia at any age. Most hernias in children are congenital. In adults, a natural weakness or strain from heavy lifting, persistent coughing, difficulty with bowel movements or urination can cause the abdominal wall to weaken or separate. The inguinal canal is found in the groin and both and women. The hernia occurs when the intestine pushes through this week spot in the abdominal wall. Symptoms of inguinal hernia include pain when you cough, bend or lift heavy objects in the groin area, pressure or weakness in the groin, swelling of the groin or testicles, physical protrusion or bulge of the intestine in the groin.
Ventral hernia is a general term to describe a bulge of tissue through an opening or weakness within the abdominal wall muscles and can occur at any location in the abdominal wall. When a ventral hernia occurs, it usually arises in the abdominal wall where a previous surgical incision was made. In this area the abdominal muscles have weakened; this results in a bulge or a tear. In the same way that an inner tube pushes through a damaged tire, the inner lining of the abdomen pushes through the weakened area of the abdominal wall to form a balloon-like sac. This can allow a loop of intestines or other abdominal contents to push into the sac. If the abdominal contents get stuck within the sac, they can become trapped or “incarcerated.” This could lead to potentially serious problems that might require emergency surgery. Other sites that ventral hernias can develop are the belly button (umbilicus) or any other area of the abdominal wall. A hernia does not get better over time, nor will it go away by itself.
A ventral hernia is usually recognized as a bulge under your skin. Occasionally, it causes no discomfort at all, but you may feel pain when you lift heavy objects, cough, strain during urination or bowel movements or with prolonged standing or sitting. The discomfort may be sharp or a dull ache that gets worse towards the end of the day. Any continuous or severe discomfort, redness, nausea or vomiting associated with the bulge are signs that the hernia may be entrapped or strangulated. These symptoms are cause for concern and immediate contact of your physician or surgeon is recommended.
An incision in your abdominal wall will always be an area of potential weakness. Hernias can develop at these sites due to heavy straining, aging, obesity, injury or following an infection at that site following surgery. They can occur immediately following surgery or may not become apparent for years later following the procedure. Anyone can get a hernia at any age. They are more common as we get older. Certain activities may increase the likelihood of a hernia including persistent coughing, difficulty with bowel movements or urination, or frequent need for straining.
In child development, the umbilical cord connects the fetus with the mother’s womb. It passes through a small opening in the stomach muscles. Normally, this hole closes shortly after birth. An umbilical hernia occurs when the canal through the stomach muscle does not close completely. This allows the intestine or other tissues to bulge through this week spot around the umbilicus (navel). Umbilical hernias are usually painless and don’t cause discomfort. Symptoms include swelling or bulging near the navel and sometimes can be painful.
The Spigelian fascia is a layer of tissues between the abdominal muscles. A spigelian hernia occurs when the intestine protrudes through this layer of tissues between the abdominal muscles. Symptoms include abdominal pain and discomfort, and often do not cause swelling or bulging.
The epigastric region of the abdomen defined by the area between the sternum and navel. Epigastric hernia forms when there is a hole or weak spot in the abdominal wall in this region. Symptoms of epigastric hernia include a bulge or bump in the area below the sternum and above the belly button. This raised area may be visible all the time, or only when a person coughs, sneezes or laughs. It can cause tenderness in the region, however, most often it is not painful and does not cause discomfort.
The femoral canal is the channel in the groin where the femoral artery and other nerves and vessels pass into the leg. A femoral hernia occurs when the abdominal tissues are pushed through this canal. It is most commonly caused by straining in a person with an already weakened area around the femoral canal. Often there are no symptoms associated with femoral hernias. One may see a bulge that is visible in the groin area or upper thigh. It may cause pain with lifting heavy objects or straining in any way.
Incarcerated hernia can be a life-threatening condition. It occurs when the intestine pushes through a weakened area of the abdominal muscle. The surrounding muscle cuts off the blood supply to the intestine resulting in intestinal perforation, bowel obstruction, shock and sepsis. Symptoms of incarcerated hernia include pain that may be severe, bloody stools, constipation, fever, inflammation and tenderness of the abdominal wall, nausea, vomiting and bowel obstruction.
Incisional hernia is caused by an incompletely healed surgical wound of the abdomen. After abdominal surgery there can be weakness or a hole in the abdominal wall that allows the intestine to perforate out through it. Often, they are caused by postoperative hematoma, seroma, infection and improper wound healing. Symptoms of incisional hernia include a bulge or protrusion in the area of the surgical incision, pain and discomfort in the area of the incision, and inflammation.
The gallbladder is a digestive organ in the right upper abdomen. It stores and releases bile which aids in the digestion of fat. Bile is released from the gallbladder after eating, aiding digestion. Bile travels through narrow tubular channels (bile ducts) into the small intestine. A gallstone is a hard collection of cholesterol, calcium salt or bilirubin. The stones harden when there is an increased concentration of these elements within the bile. This can occur from the liver producing too much or from the gallbladder failing to empty, causing an increased concentration. It is uncertain why some people form gallstones, but risk factors include being female, prior pregnancy, age over 40 years and being overweight. Gallstones are also more common as you get older and some people may have a family history of gallstones. There is no known means to prevent gallstones. These stones may block the flow of bile out of the gallbladder, causing it to swell and resulting in sharp abdominal pain, vomiting, indigestion and, occasionally, fever. If the gallstone blocks the common bile duct, jaundice (a yellowing of the skin) can occur. Ultrasound is most commonly used to find gallstones. In more complex cases, other X-ray test such as a CAT scan or a gallbladder nuclear medicine scan may be used to evaluate gallbladder disease. Gallstones do not go away on their own. Some can be temporarily managed by making dietary adjustments, such as reducing fat intake. This treatment has a low, short-term success rate. Symptoms will eventually continue unless the gallbladder is removed. Symptoms of gallstones include nausea, vomiting, dark colored urine, clay colored stools, abdominal pain, diarrhea and indigestion.
There are 2 adrenal glands in the body that are just above each kidney. They are triangular in shape and about the size of a thumb. The adrenal glands are known as endocrine glands because they produce hormones. These hormones are involved in control of blood pressure, chemical levels in the blood, water use in the body, glucose usage, and the “fight or flight” reaction during times of stress. These adrenal-produced hormones include cortisol, aldosterone, the adrenaline hormones – epinephrine and norepinephrine – and a small fraction of the body’s sex hormones (estrogen and androgens).
Diseases of the adrenal gland are relatively rare. The most common reason that a patient may need to have the adrenal gland removed is excess hormone production by a tumor located within the adrenal. Masses of the adrenal gland can be benign or cancerous. Most of these tumors are small and not cancers. They are known as benign growths that can usually be removed with laparoscopic techniques. Removal of the adrenal gland may also be required for certain tumors even if they aren’t producing excess hormones, such as very large tumors or if there is a suspicion that the tumor could be a cancer, referred to as malignant tumors. Fortunately, malignant adrenal tumors are rare. An adrenal mass or tumor is sometimes found by chance when a patient gets an X-ray study to evaluate another problem.
A cancerous tumor of the adrenal gland is called an adrenal cortical carcinoma. Benign tumor of the adrenal gland is called a benign adenoma. Benign adenomas are usually small and do not present with any symptoms. Adrenal cortical carcinoma are usually much larger and cause symptoms when they put pressure on other organs around them. Most symptoms of adrenal cortical carcinoma are multiple changes in the body due to the excessive production of hormones. They can produce androgen, estrogen, cortisol and aldosterone. Many times, the symptoms do not occur until the mass is large enough to press on other organs. Symptoms of these increased hormones in children can include excessive hair growth, enlarged venous, intermuscular risks, enlarged breasts in males, early puberty in girls. Symptoms of these increased hormones in adults include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, weight gain, easily bruising, irregular periods, and muscle cramps. If an adrenal tumor is suspected based on symptoms or has been identified by X-ray, the patient should undergo blood and urine tests to determine if the tumor is over-producing hormones. Special X-ray tests, such as a CAT scan, nuclear medicine scan, an MRI or selective venous sampling are commonly used to locate the suspected adrenal tumor.
Patients with adrenal gland problems may have a variety of symptoms related to excess hormone production by the abnormal gland. Adrenal tumors associated with excess hormone production include pheochromocytomas, aldosterone-producing tumors, and cortisol-producing tumors. Some of these tumors and their typical features are given below.
Pheochromocytomas produce excess hormones that can cause very high blood pressure and periodic spells characterized by severe headaches, excessive sweating, anxiety, palpitations, and rapid heart rate that may last from a few seconds to several minutes. Aldosterone producing tumors cause high blood pressure and low serum (blood) potassium levels. In some patients this may result in symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and frequent urination. Cortisol producing tumors cause a syndrome termed Cushing’s syndrome that can be characterized by obesity (especially of the face and trunk), high blood sugar, high blood pressure, menstrual irregularities, fragile skin, and prominent stretch marks. Most cases of Cushing’s syndrome, however, are caused by small pituitary tumors and are not treated by adrenal gland removal. Overall, adrenal tumors account for about 20% of cases of Cushing’s syndrome. An incidentally found mass in the adrenal may be any of the above types of tumors, or may produce no hormones at all. Most incidentally found adrenal masses do not make excess hormones, cause no symptoms, are benign, and do not need to be removed.
The colon is the large intestine. It is the lower part of your digestive tract. The intestine is a long, tubular organ consisting of the small intestine, the colon (large intestine) and the rectum, which is the last part of the colon. After food is swallowed, it begins to be digested in the stomach and then empties into the small intestine, where the nutritional part of the food is absorbed. The remaining waste moves through the colon to the rectum and is expelled from the body. The colon and rectum absorb water and hold the waste until you are ready to expel it. Colorectal cancer is a cancer that starts in the rectum or the large intestine. There are many different types of colon cancer. It is important to stage the cancer. There are progressive stages from 1-4, with 4 being the most advanced. Treatment depends on the type of cancer in the stage of the cancer. Symptoms of colon cancer include constipation, diarrhea, changes in the stool, blood in the stool, rectal bleeding, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain and abdominal cramps. It is not completely understood what causes colorectal cancer, however, in general it occurs when healthy cells become abnormal and multiply faster than they should or do not turn over as they should.
Diverticulosis occurs when there is a bulging sac within the large intestine or other parts of the digestive system. It often becomes inflamed or infected and is then called diverticulitis. Symptoms include pain and discomfort of the abdomen, abdominal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, constipation, fever, bloating, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. The cause of diverticulosis is not completely understood however it is thought to occur when there is increased pressure within the colon leading to the bulging out. Diverticulitis occurs when fecal matter gets lodged within the diverticula and cause inflammation and infection.
There are many causes of gastrointestinal bleeding. GI bleeding can occur in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, or anus. Causes may include: Stomach ulcers, peptic ulcers, esophageal varices, cirrhosis, acid reflux, Crohn’s disease, gastritis, intussusception, colorectal cancer, liver disease, esophageal cancer, rectal polyps, hemorrhoids, stomach cancer, liver cancer, diverticulitis, hemophilia, colitis, thrombocytopenia, and many types infections. The amount of bleeding can be very small to life-threatening hemorrhage. Symptoms include stool that can become dark or sticky black tar for the bleeding occurs in the upper GI tract. When there is bleeding of the lower GI tract, there is often red blood in the stool. Another symptom is vomiting blood that looks like coffee grounds. Other general symptoms include weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath and paleness.
Stomach cancer, also called gastric cancer, occurs when cancerous cells occur in the lining of the stomach organ. It occurs when the normal cells become cancerous, growing out of control and form a tumor in the stomach lining. Often stomach cancer is difficult to diagnose due to lack of symptoms. It is slow growing most of the time. When symptoms occur, they include nausea and vomiting, heartburn, loss of appetite, weight loss, bloating, GI bleeding, fatigue and stomach pain which occurs mostly after meals.
Stomach ulcer also called gastric ulcers. They occur when there is a sore in the stomach lining. Symptoms of stomach ulcers include pain that may be mild or severe, burning sensation, chest pain, weight loss, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, bloating, heartburn, blood in stool, anemia, and burping. Ulcers of the stomach may be caused by infection, long-term use of anti-inflammatory medications, and any other condition where the acid erodes through the stomach lining.
Dysphagia is a condition that describes difficulty swallowing. It is often caused by reflux of acid into the esophagus which causes scarring and narrowing of the esophagus, called esophageal stricture. It can also be caused by direct damage to the esophagus. Symptoms of dysphagia include difficulty swallowing, pain with swallowing, sore throat, choking, coughing, regurgitation or mood and stomach acid, the feeling of food stuck within the chest, burning of the chest, and pain with speaking.
Esophageal cancer occurs when normal cells of the esophagus lining become cancerous and grow out of control forming a tumor. There are two common types of esophageal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs when the cancer originates in the thin, flat cells that make of the lining of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma occurs when the cancer starts in the glandular cells of the esophagus. These cells are responsible for production of fluid and mucus within the esophagus. Symptoms of esophageal cancer include weight loss, indigestion, heartburn, painful swallowing, difficulty swallowing, choking while eating, vomiting, chest pain and fatigue.
There are many types of liver cancer. Some primary liver cancers include: Hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, liver angiosarcoma, and hepatoblastoma. Liver cancer occurs when the normal cells grow out of control and become tumors. Hepatocellular carcinoma originates in the hepatocyte cells. Cholangiocarcinoma originates in the bile ducts of the liver. Angiosarcoma originates in the blood vessels within the liver. Hepatoblastoma is nearly almost always found in children and is very rare. Symptoms are liver cancer include abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, tenderness of the abdomen, yellowing of the skin and lengths of the eyes cold jaundice, white, chalky stools, nausea, vomiting, easily bruising, fatigue and weakness.
Cancer of the pancreas occurs when the normal pancreas cells grow out of control and become a tumor. Pancreatic cancers are staged on a scale of 0-4 based on the tumor size, approximately to the lymph nodes, and whether it is present other organs. There are multiple types of pancreatic cancer. Common types including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and non—adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumors. Adenocarcinoma start within the part of the pancreas that make digestive enzymes. Neuroendocrine tumors arise from the pancreas cells are responsible for integrating the nervous and endocrine system. Symptoms of pancreatic cancer include pain in the upper abdomen or back, yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes called jaundice, weight loss, loss of appetite, improper digestion, pressure on other organs, diabetes, and many others.
Chronic pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas that does not improve over time by itself. Acute pancreatitis occurs when there is inflammation that occurs periodically, and lasts for a short period of time. It is considered chronic pancreatitis when the inflammation keeps coming back, and does not subside for many months or years. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to permanent scarring and damage of the pancreas. Calcium stones may develop within the pancreas. Cysts may develop within the pancreas. There can be blockage of bile ducts. Causes of chronic pancreatitis including autoimmune disease, narrowing of the pancreatic duct, blockage of the pancreatic duct, cystic fibrosis, hypercalcemia, hypertriglyceridemia and family history. Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis include pain in the upper abdomen, diarrhea, pale and loose fatty stools, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, weight loss, excessive thirst, fatigue, yellowing of the skin otherwise the eyes cold jaundice, bleeding, and intestinal blockage.
Cancer of the small intestine is also called small bowel cancer. It can occur in different parts of the small bowel including duodenal cancer, jejunum cancer or ilium cancer. Several different types of small intestine cancer include: adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, lymphoma, and carcinoid tumor. Cancer of the small bowel occurs when the normal cells grow out of control forming a tumor. Symptoms of small intestine cancer include constipation, diarrhea, changes in the stool, blood in the stool, rectal bleeding, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain and abdominal cramps.
Small intestine ulcers are also called duodenal ulcers. They occur when there is a sore in the intestine lining. Symptoms of small intestine ulcers include pain that may be mild or severe, burning sensation, chest pain, weight loss, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, bloating, heartburn, blood in stool, anemia, and burping. Ulcers of the stomach may be caused by infection, long-term use of anti-inflammatory medications, and any other condition where the acid erodes through the intestine lining.
The spleen is an organ that is found on the left side of the body below the rib cage. It is responsible for filtering antibiotic coated bacteria, reprocessing old red blood cells and recycling iron in hemoglobin. It is a storage organ for red blood cells and contains many specialized white blood cells called “macrophages” (disease fighting cells) which act to filter blood. The spleen is part of the immune system and also removes old and damaged blood particles from your system. The spleen helps the body identify and kill bacteria. The spleen can affect the platelet count, the red blood cell count and even the white blood count.
How are problems of the spleen found? An evaluation typically includes a complete blood count (CBC), to look at the amount, sizes and shapes of the cells in your blood. Sometimes it is important to get a specimen of bone marrow. The bone marrow is where red cells and other components of the blood are made and can be very helpful to understand the source of the problems. The spleen is also evanluated using imaging such as an ultrasound, a computerized tomography (CAT scan), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Evaluating the size and shape of the spleen is very helpful to understanding the cause of the problem as well as for surgical planning. In addition, sometimes a nuclear scan of the spleen can be helpful especially if satellites of the spleen known as accessory spleens or “splenules” are suspected.
An enlargement of the spleen is also called splenomegaly. Often, there are no symptoms associated with splenomegaly. When they are present, symptoms of splenomegaly include pain and discomfort on the upper left side of the abdomen, feeling of fullness after eating a small amount, pressure on the stomach, pressure on other organs, anemia, and infections due to lack of white blood cells. There are number of diseases that can cause splenomegaly including: Viral, bacterial or parasitic infections, cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, Hodgkin’s disease, leukemia, heart failure, cirrhosis, tumors of the spleen, lupus, sickle cell disease.
This is the most common reason. In this disease, a patient’s platelet count is low because the body makes antibodies to the platelets which cause them to be destroyed in the spleen. Since platelets are blood cells which aid in blood clotting, patients are at risk for bleeding. The first line of treatment is medical therapy but when this is not successful, removal of the spleen (splenectomy) can be curative or at least significantly improve the platelet count in the vast majority of cases.
In this disease the body makes antibodies to red blood cells which are subsequently destroyed in the spleen. When medical therapy fails, some patients require spleen removal to prevent or decrease the need for transfusion.
There are several diseases that affect the shape of red blood cells, such as, spherocystosis, sickle cell disease or thalassemia. In these patients, the spleen recognizes the red cells as abnormal and may reduce them, possibly requiring splenectomy to improve the symptoms.
Rarely, patients with cancers of the cells which fight infection, known as lymphoma or certain types of leukemia, require spleen removal. When the spleen gets enlarged, it sometimes removes too many platelets from your blood and has to be removed. Sometimes the spleen is removed to diagnose or treat a tumor.
The appendix is a narrow tube (a few inches in length) that attaches to the first part of the colon. It is usually located in the lower right quadrant of the abdominal cavity. The appendix produces bacterium destroying proteins called immunoglobulins, which help fight infection in the body. Its function, however, is not essential. Appendicitis occurs when there is inflammation of the appendix. It can be acute or chronic. Symptoms of appendicitis include pain in the abdomen, often on the right side, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fever, and abdominal swelling. Symptoms often include mild cramping that becomes more severe over time. Often the cause appendicitis is unknown. It may be due to obstruction of the appendix.
Although “heartburn” is often used to describe a variety of digestive problems, in medical terms, it is actually a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease. In this condition, stomach acids reflux or “back up”, from the stomach into the esophagus. Heartburn is described as a harsh, burning sensation in the area in between your ribs or just below the neck. The feeling may radiate through the chest and into the throat and neck. Many adults experience this uncomfortable, burning sensation at least once a month. Other symptoms may also include vomiting or regurgitation, difficulty swallowing and chronic coughing or wheezing. When eating, food travels from the mouth into the stomach through the tube called the esophagus. At the lower end of the esophagus is a small ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter. The lower esophageal sphincter acts like a one-way valve, allowing food to pass through into the stomach. Normally, the lower esophageal sphincter closes immediately after swallowing to prevent back-up of stomach content, which is highly acidic, into the esophagus. GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter does not function properly allowing acid to flow back and burn the lower esophagus. This irritates and inflames the esophagus, causing heartburn and eventually may damage the esophagus. Patients may develop a condition in which there is a change in the type of cells in the lining of the lower esophagus, called Barrett’s esophagus. This is important because having this condition increases the risk of developing cancer of the esophagus.
Some people are born with a naturally weak lower esophageal sphincter. For others, however, fatty and spicy foods, certain types of medication, tight clothing, smoking, drinking alcohol, vigorous exercise or changes in body position (bending over or lying down) may cause the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, causing reflux. A hiatal hernia is found in many patients who suffer from GERD. This refers to the condition in which the top part of the stomach bulges above the diaphragm and into the chest cavity. This phenomenon is thought to contribute to the development of acid reflux.
Chef is a great configuration management tool. It allows managing environments, supports multiple platforms, handles updates, but takes a lot of time to deploy software from scratch. Chef is not like Docker, which allows spinning up containers in seconds. If you are already using Chef, then you might not have time to rewrite all the Cookbooks into Dockerfiles. In this post, I’m showing how to build Docker images quickly using existing Chef Cookbooks.

The EU Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Mr Dimitris Avramopoulos, launched on January 25th in The Hague the new Europol-attached Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC). The decision to establish the ECTC was taken by EU Member States in the framework of the European Agenda on Security in April 2015. The necessity for such a centre was further reiterated during the EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers meeting, which was held in the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks. The ECTC has been established with the aim of strengthening and facilitating cooperation and collaboration between Member States, building trust among the different counter terrorism units of each country and helping them to share their capabilities. Furthermore, the ECTC work will also aim to promote multilateral fora, such as the Global Counter Terrorism Forum, in a bid to help identifying best practices and tools to counter narratives on the internet, as well as to find out new ways to address concerns over encryption standards.
On January 15, the United Nations Secretary General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, presented to the UN General Assembly a Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. Describing violent extremism as “a direct assault on the United Nations Charter and a grave threat for international peace and security”, the UN Secretary General called member states to unity and action. The proposed Plan of Action recommends that each Member State develop its own national action plan to prevent violent extremism, focusing on seven priority areas, namely: dialogue and conflict prevention; strengthening good governance; human rights and the rule of law; engaging communities; empowering youth; gender equality and empowering women; education, skill development and employment facilitation; strategic communications, including through the Internet and social media.
On February 12, however, diverging views emerged from the UN General Assembly during a review of the Secretary General proposed Plan of Action. In particular, the Assembly welcomed the initiative, but decided that “further consideration” to the plan was required before its adoption, especially since some delegates found that the proposal lacked a deep and precise focus on the root causes of radicalisation.
Excerpt from journal abstract: “This article addresses the potential to de-radicalize a terrorist, and if so how could this be achieved? The article also outlines the distinction between de-radicalization, counter-radicalization and disengagement. In order to understand the potential of de-radicalization techniques, research examines the factors that might lead to initial radicalization. The strategy of some state-based de-radicalization programs (…) and the importance of unique tailoring in these programs is identified. The relevance of ideology and life skill training within de-radicalization programs is also examined. The extensive impact that information communication technology has had on radicalization is also addressed and following on, the potential for de-radicalization and counter-radicalization through information communication platforms is also discussed. (…) The discussions in this article are relevant to policy-makers, de-radicalization program designers and security sector actors.
This paper from Owen Frazer & Christian Nünlist of the Zurich-based Center for Security Studies argues that structural causes lie at the very beginning of radicalisation processes, and that violent extremism cannot be exclusively fought with intelligence, police and military means, but must also be addressed through “soft” aspects of counterterrorism measures. Furthermore, the article discusses the growing traction enjoyed by the concept of Counter Violent Extremism (CVE) among political and diplomatic discourse, the challenges currently faced by work in this field, as well as the role that Switzerland could play in facilitating the development of an international dialogue and consensus on CVE-related matters and practices.
The EU FP7-funded project Vox-Pol has issued a call for papers and panel proposals for its mid-project conference scheduled to take place in Dublin in June 2016 under the title: Taking Stock Of Research On Violent Online Political Extremism.
The call particularly welcomes empirically grounded research, papers reporting significant new results, as well as methodologically innovative works covering a wide range of thematic areas pertinent to online violent political extremism. For further information, please visit the link below.

"The origins of the Hush Puppies name are decidedly low-tech. A company sales manager sat with a friend for a dinner of catfish and deep fried corn fritters called “hush puppys.” Intrigued by the name, the salesman discovered that farmers also used these hush puppys to quiet barking dogs. At the time, tired feet were known as “barking dogs” and the salesman reasoned that his soft, lightweight comfortable shoes could quiet them, too. The rest is history. The Hush Puppies trademark was registered on July 1, 1958 and soon after, the company purchased, for just $50, the photograph of a soft-eyed basset hound that would become its logo and grace millions of shoes, boxes, ads and displays."

Why did I wait so long to read this? I probably would have waited even longer to read this if a bunch of people hadn't told me how amazing it was and that I had to read it as soon as possible. They were so right.
From the moment the book started I needed to know what happened to Echo and what was going on with Noah. The story pulled me in and didn't let go. I probably would have stayed up all night to read it and I almost did but somehow I stopped myself.
The characters in this book moved me to tears. Especially Noah's little brother. Little kids have a way of making me cry. Jacob wasn't the only character that brought me to tears. Both Noah and Echo made me wish for a box of tissues. Even the characters that seemed like they were against Noah and Echo were amazing.
Both of the main character's stories were so heartbreaking and I couldn't help but feel bad for them. I'm pretty sure almost anyone could sympathize with them because their problems were so realistic.
I absolutely loved the romance in this book. At first it seems that Noah and Echo have nothing in common but then they realize that they have much more in common then they first thought. I loved watching their relationship grow. It was probably one of the best parts about the book.
Pushing the Limits was so good that I would recommend it to anyone looking for a book that will make you laugh, smile, and cry.
The battle over health reform turned up a few more notches on Tuesday, with the release of a new Congressional Budget Office report on a past GOP plan to repeal parts of the Obama health law, as Republicans argued that it didn’t take into account any of their ideas to replace Obamacare, while Democrats said the report showed that millions would lose their health coverage.
“This projection is meaningless,” said Ashlee Strong, a spokesperson for Speaker Paul Ryan, as she argued the CBO report “takes into account no measures to replace the law nor actions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual market that has been decimated by Obamacare.”
“CBO misses the point,” said House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA). “Obamacare will be replaced with lower costs and more choices.”
The CBO report assumes no Obamacare replacement. In reality, we will provide people with coverage that they want and can actually use.
But coming just days before President-Elect Trump takes the oath of office, Democrats were more than happy to seize on the headlines from the CBO report, painting a dark picture about GOP plans to get rid of the Obama health law, saying that over 30 million people could end up losing health coverage.
“A terrible toll on working American families,” said Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA), one of those Democrats who is boycotting Mr. Trump’s Inauguration.
Nonpartisan CBO estimates 32 million will lose healthcare and rates will go up 20-25 percent. Not terrific.
“If Republicans succeed in repealing the ACA, health care costs will explode, Americans in the individual market will see their premiums double by 2026, and the number of uninsured Americans will surge by 18 million in the first year alone and by 32 million by 2026,” said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.
CBO report says premiums will skyrocket under GOP's plan. Why are they raising costs & taking us from #CaretoChaos? #MakeAmericaSickAgain
What the CBO looked at was a bill approved by Republicans in 2015, and vetoed by President Obama early in 2016, which would have repealed large chunks of the Obama health law – H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.
The report also comes a day before testimony by Mr. Trump’s pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services, as Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) has been at the forefront of GOP efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
Supporters of Mr. Trump did their own work on social media to push back against the CBO report, with some painting it as fake news.
Whatever you think of the report and its conclusions, the quick firestorm it created is a reminder of just how animated the health care debate will be on Capitol Hill.
Republicans have said they will unveil plans in coming weeks for how best to ensure that millions have health insurance coverage.

This Essay is a comparative study of French feminism and Ecofeminism with Yimyunzydang`s thought from the Yi dynasty in Korea. First, I will survey feminist theories from postmodern feminism (or French feminism) to Ecofeminism and compare them with Yimyunzydang`s philosophy. In France, during the 1960s and 1970s, some French feminists, such as H??l??ne Cixous, Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, developed a system of analysis which was radically different to that which had been practiced in the UK and USA. For Kristeva, the suppressed feminine emerges in both men`s and women`s writings of the modernist avant-garde, which by concentrating on language shows subjectivity in the process of construction. For Irigaray and Cixous, writing `woman` is a more utopian quest which has not yet been written. These women use the sophisticated verbal and philosophical deconstructions of Lacan and Derrida in order to destabilise the notion of gender positions within texts. In the 1990s Ecofeminism or genoecology has come out with Deep Ecology. Ecofeminism regards nature as mother/woman which should be taken care of and also maintains that every living thing is equal to one another in their Nature. Men and women have no difference in quality but only difference in their role in society. So human beings should take care of and be reconciled with everything in the world. The Korean woman Yimyunzydang in the Yi dynasty also claimed that men and women have the same quality in original nature and they are a part of the nature. So humans should follow the rule of nature like the other things in the nature and should live according to the order of the nature. She also persists everything in the world should interact peacefully together. The maintaing of Ecofeminism presents similaries to Yimyunzydang`s philosophy written 200 years ago in Korea.
“MariMed continues on a solid trajectory of year over year growth that it has achieved each quarter since 2015,” stated Robert Fireman, CEO of MariMed Inc. “Our new Maryland cultivation and production facility, which came online in Q1, will bring increased rent, management and licensing fees, adding to our existing revenue streams from facilities in Illinois, Delaware, and Nevada. We anticipate increases in our revenue from our assets as the cannabis business in Maryland and Massachusetts continues to expand.”
Revenue: $2.08 million in first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.15 million first quarter of 2017, an increase of 81%. The increase is primarily due to the expanding operations of MariMed’s medical marijuana clients from real estate revenue, management fees and licensing fees.
Debt Reduction: reduced liabilities by $1.5 million through the conversion of $0.98 million of promissory notes into Common Stock and retiring $500,000 of additional promissory notes.
Capital Raised: raised approximately $1.5 million in equity through the sale of its 144 Common Stock in private placement in 2018 at prices averaging 15% below the market price.
·Began cultivation of Tikun Olam™ branded cannabis strains that have been proven effective in clinical research trials.
Continued construction of 68,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art cultivation and production cannabis facility in New Bedford.
Constructing licensed cannabis dispensary in Middleborough. Actively pursuing permit approval for development of two additional dispensaries in Boston area.
Continued distribution of licensed Kalm Fusion and Betty’s Eddies™ brands to 57 additional medical cannabis dispensaries.
Introduced MariMed’s new Nature’s Heritage Cannabis brand, MariMed’s branded products and flower grown by Kind Therapeutics USA to approximately 35 newly opened medical cannabis dispensaries in Maryland.
“We raised approximately $1.5 million in capital and reduced our debt by approximately $ 1.5 million in the quarter,” noted Jon Levine, MariMed CFO. “We are displaying to investors and shareholders our consistent performance on quarter over quarter growth.”
MariMed had $251,166 of operating income in first quarter of 2018, an increase from $228,552 in the comparable quarter in 2017. MariMed incurred a net loss of $1.83 million in the first quarter of 2018, versus net income of $0.11 million in the first quarter of 2017. The loss is primarily due to non-cash equity compensation and debt settlements in 2018 that have no impact on operations/cashflow.
“As cannabis legalization takes effect on July 1 in Massachusetts, we expect to supply dispensaries with our branded marijuana products across the state,” said Mr. Fireman. “We are scheduled to open our first dispensary in Massachusetts the third quarter of 2018, further bolstering our ongoing revenue streams from managed services and the leasing of our cannabis facilities.”
“With each new client, we generate significant revenue from fees for leases, licenses and managed services,” Jon Levine, continued. “We expect incremental growth in licensing from new product lines and organic growth from product sales as our licensed Nature’s Heritage Cannabis, Kalm Fusion, Betty’s Eddies, Tikun Olam and Lucid Mood brands gain loyal followings in each current market and as we expand our national distribution network to additional states.”
“Building upon our diverse platform, we are continuing to raise capital for new business and product development, strategic acquisitions and expansion of infrastructure that will enable us to take advantage of this critical time in the industry,” concluded Mr. Fireman.

As of Friday June 8th, Talons of Fire and Defiant have teamed up to form Hilsbury's newest guild, Divinus.
The transition has gone very smoothly. Myself and Myst are always talking and I personally foresee no real issues in making this the single most powerful guild on the server.
We have an awesome base of great players and this will expand over the next few days as those who couldn't be here at launch filter on in.
Only question is, who was the mom and who was the dad? I'd bet money ToF was hit'n defiant from the back. Hopefully defiant can loose that preggie weight and get back to her shape. Since ToF obviously ran off to mexico, avoiding child support, I guess that makes divinus a bastard and defiant a MILF.
Yes, I did just make that up off the top of my head. Yes, I did just post this just to add numbers to my post count too. Oh well...all hail divinus.
My flat mate is studying Latin at Uni and has not had a single grade below A yet, which in itself sickens me, but he clarified a few things for us.
Divinus is pronounced Dee-vee-Noose and it is the masculine form for godly, derived from Venus the female deity (Divina).
In old latin, the V would not be emphasized much, so the initial D is prominent, as is the hard U that sounds like in noose.

Michigan authorities say they’ve found improperly kept remains of fetuses and infants at a second Detroit funeral home, just one week after similar remains were found at the first.
Police and license inspectors found the remains of 63 fetuses or infants — some of whom died three years ago — at Perry Funeral Home on Friday, the Detroit Police Department said.
Inspectors raided the funeral home in response to a complaint, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said, without releasing details of the complaint.
Thirty-seven of the dead fetuses or infants were found in three unrefrigerated boxes, police and the regulatory department said. Twenty-six were in a freezer, police said.
Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said it has suspended the funeral home’s mortuary science license because of “multiple violations of Michigan’s public health and occupational codes and an imminent threat to the public health and safety.”
Police have not said any charges have been filed; Detroit Police Chief James Craig said his department is investigating.
“I am committed to get to the truth,” Craig said Friday, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. “… This is deeply disturbing.”
Michigan law says funeral directors generally must supervise a body’s final disposition within 60 days of receiving it. Those who don’t may be found guilty of at least a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in prison.
For bodies improperly kept beyond 180 days, a director could be charged with a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Some of the 63 sets of remains found at Perry Funeral Home on Friday were fetuses or infants that died in 2015, Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said.
Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said the funeral home also failed to certify and file death certificates “for the dead bodies of the fetuses and infants for whom they assumed custody with the appropriate governmental authority within 72 hours of death.”
Perry Funeral Home’s lawyer, Joshua I. Arnkoff, said in a statement that the funeral home has acted within the law.
Michigan authorities say they’ve found improperly kept remains of fetuses and infants at a second Detroit funeral home, just one week after similar remains were found at the first. Police and license inspectors found the remains of 63 fetuses or infants — some of whom died three years ago — at Perry Funeral Home on Friday, the Detroit Police Department said.
“Perry Funeral Home has been serving the Detroit community for decades and has been a reputable, reliable and caring member of the community. The allegations being made through the press are inaccurate,” Arnkoff said.
The allegations involve “unclaimed infant remains” from local hospitals, Arnkoff said, which occurs when families do not respond to hospital requests. He said he did not believe any of these remains involved families that had paid for funeral services.
“In the case of unclaimed remains, a funeral home cannot bury remains without proper authorization, and the law in Michigan sets forth a hierarchy for authority,” Arnkoff said. “Perry relied upon and operated within that hierarchy, but Perry never received the legal authority necessary to conduct a final disposition of the remains.”
Friday’s discovery came a week after Licensing and Regulatory Affairs workers discovered the remains of 10 fetuses and one infant in a drop-down ceiling of a separate, former funeral home in Detroit.
The site of that former business — the Cantrell Funeral Home — was raided October 12 in response to an anonymous letter, authorities said.
Cantrell Funeral Home was shut down in April by Licensing and Regulatory Affairs for multiple violations, including improper storage of embalmed bodies, with two in an advanced stage of decomposition, according to a press release.
In August, an anonymous phone call led Licensing and Regulatory Affairs investigators back to the building, where one fetus and some cremated remains were found, Craig said.
After the remains of 10 fetuses and one infant were found on October 12, a cadaver-trained police dog searched the building and no additional bodies were located, Detroit Police Lt. Brian Bowser said.
“Detroit Police Department has opened a criminal investigation on allegations of a felony,” Craig said a press conference Monday. The investigation into that felony charge — failure to supervise the final disposition of a dead body within 180 days — will involve an interview with Raymond Cantrell II, who owned the former funeral home, Craig said.
Details about why the remains were being stored at Perry Funeral Home and the former Cantrell Funeral Home, or whether the cases are in any way related, weren’t immediately available.
Charges have not yet been filed in the Cantrell Funeral Home case, but Craig said he has been in touch with both the Michigan Attorney General’s Office and the Wayne County prosecutor about what the next steps might be.
The Wayne County Medical Examiner’s office said it is working to identify the Cantrell Funeral Home remains and notify any families.

Remember, some people may have very slow Internet connections, so it is wise to place the ‘subscribe’ button somewhere near the top of the screen so that it loads early on.
While you are undoubtedly aware of the most-used social networks, you should familiarize yourself with the smaller, more specialized networks that are used by a smaller audience. Do market research to determine your target demographics and search out social networks that they might use. This is especially important if your target demographic is aged 14-30.
TIP! Take a poll if you have no idea what information to post. Allow your followers to choose the topics they want to see you write about.
Use the Twitter API to keep people interested in your feed interesting. You can use your Twitter page to automatically tweet when there are blog posts from those you follow and trust. Find blogs that are trustworthy and updated frequently to share with your followers. This will keep your page fresh and your followers satiated in their search for good content to check out.
Take advantage of Twitter and Facebook to offer customers exclusive, limited time deals. Make sure to give them enough advanced warning to be able to take advantage of the offer! If a customer realizes that they missed a great bargain, they are going to be far more mindful of future updates. Take advantage of this fact to increase your follower count.
TIP! Toy around with a variety of techniques to learn the ones most successful for you before you do an official launch. Start small at first, and pretest each move before incorporating the technique into your primary business platform.
Keep in mind things you and your colleagues previously. Use your past failures and incorporate profit-increasing methods. This will help you construct the most effective social media campaign for your marketing successfully.
You no longer have to settle for uninteresting articles or boring banner ads for your marketing plan. You can reach a large audience through using entertaining media. You still have the obligation to provide terrific services or products, but by using the ideas above, it is possible to offer the complete package.
Make sure you create an interesting heading for your YouTube videos. The title of a video is important on YouTube. Use words your target audience is likely to look up on YouTube. Also remember to include helpful keywords in the title that will grab the niche consumers’ attention.
TIP! If you are unable to format, think about creating marketing lists. This will allow you to easily and effectively present your information.

"Lucca is a city in Tuscany, northern central Italy, situated on the river Serchio in a fertile plain near (but not on) the Ligurian Sea. It is the capital city of the Province of Lucca. Among other reasons, it is famous for its intact Renaissance-era city walls (although the city has expanded beyond the wall's boundaries).
Lucca was founded by the Etruscans (there are traces of a pre-existing Ligurian settlement) and became a Roman colony in 180 BC. The rectangular grid of its historical center preserves the Roman street plan, and the Piazza San Michele occupies the site of the ancient forum. Traces of the amphitheatre can still be seen in the Piazza dell'Anfiteatro."
In my recent review of the Stokke Sleepi I mentioned I wanted to post about the textiles in a separate post so here we are today. I felt that the textiles needed a bit of their own love and attention because the collection is just so stunning. Obviously with making the choice of going with a Sleepi also means that you only have the Sleepi Textiles to choose from which may be a bit of a downer for some people, I think it’s nice that they have come up with such a simple yet chic collection both boy and girls. There are five colour combinations to choose from two that are pretty bold blue or pink and then three that are white, beige or a soft rose pink. We opted for the white because I just love how fresh and bright it looks against the white Sleepi crib. With the bedding being quite limited Stokke have given many options to have matching everything, from sheets to sleeping bags and even towels so despite there not being a huge amount of colour options they have still thought of everything and everyone.
The bedding itself is super soft and each piece has a tiny orange Stokke label on it which is understated elegance at its best. The quilted design looks super chic and is replicated across all bedding items, we have the bed linen, sheets, canopy, bumper for mini and Sleepi and the cover, the cover is super soft and snuggly it works on Stokke and normal cots and we even like to have it in our living room for snuggle time, it’s just gorgeous. The Stokke bumper is great, the bow design is such a lovely touch and it will even fit on standard cots I really think the bumper really makes the cot stand out and look so plush. Lastly I have to mention the canopy, I didn’t think I’d like a canopy so much for a boy but it just looks so nice and is a super light material, it flows beautifully and it doesn’t bother Vinny at all in fact he loves it!We adore the Stokke Sleepi textiles and if this was something you were worried about then don’t be, the range is fantastic and the quality is amazing as with all Stokke products.

1. Can you explain why so many human rights organisations are aiding the illegal war on Libya : HRW, Amnesty Physicians for Human Rights etc and are aiding and abetting the genocide of black libyans and black africans in Libya by local insurgents aided by NATO air support?
2. Are you aware that various HR organisations made false claims about events in Libya in february, as to the Libyan army killing civilians ('heavy human casualities'), that these made their way into RES1973?
'Expressing grave concern at the deteriorating situation, the escalation of violence, and the heavy civilian casualties,'
Heavy human casualties were initiated by the Benghazi insurgents when, owing to their entrenched racism, they began to slaughter black libyans and black africans..calling them 'african mercenaries'. There were no african mercenaeries till NATO sourced them from egyptan tunisia.
Nor were there heavy human casualties due to airtrikes, a lie that was exposed by russian military satellites by march 1:
This claim served as the basis for the nofly zone, which NATO needed to provide a quasi legal justification to launch air strikes inside libya.
3. SO given that many of the claims made in the UNSC RES1973 preamble are not true as they have no supporting evidence, and that the HR organisations that made the claims also provide no evidence, what is the basis for 1973? How did it manage to even get put up for consideration? Why did the UN violate its own charter (on national sovereignty being inviolatye) with the nofly zone? Whats the legal basis for the noflyzone, as UN has no such authority to sestablish such? Why is there no Resolution on the very real attacks by saudi troops on the very real peaceful protestors of Bahrain?
This is the International Year of People of African Descent. Yet we have a US president of african descent waging an illegal an undeclared war on africans in africa, and lending air support to those brutal insurgents genociding black africans…And the bulk of well known HR organisations and main stream media are contributing to creating this human rights catastrophe.
According to US Code Section 2339A & 2339B, the leaders of NATO, along with the US, UK, and French governments, are clearly guilty of providing a listed terrorist organization with material support in the most egregious, overt case since the code was written. The staggering scale of training, arming, and providing air support for Libyan Islamic Fighting Group militants, listed by the US State Department itself as a terrorist organization, all done criminally under the guise of “international law” rubber stamped by the contrived UN and bolstered with support from the equally contrived International Criminal Court, may be partially why more people are unable to understand the scope of criminality involved in NATO’s intervention in Libya.

A listing of live jazz events, mostly in North Berkshire and South Bucks, PLUS CD reviews from Geoff
With our regular piano player Nigel Fox still on his holidays it will be a delight to have back with us (as last week!) Ken McCarthy as his replacement. We are fortunate indeed to have 2 such fine piano players who are keen to come and play for us at Hedsor Jazz.
I don’t always get a lot of advance notice for some of our star guests, but I do have it for one, who is coming on a very significant day in May.
In my electoral area one of the candidates is Teresa May MP, who came and gave out the raffle prizes at one of our Cancer Research fundraising concerts a few years ago!!
The third is May, who has also been with us in the past is Tina May, and it is she whom our guest for election night wrote scores for.
The CD for which Frank wrote the arrangements is Tina May’s “My Kinda Love” (HEP CD2101) and on the cover of said CD is another link to Hedsor Social Club!! The CD features some of the music of Duncan Lamont!! So if ever supporters should go and buy a CD it is this one. All three musicians have played Hedsor Jazz at some time in the not too distant past! AND it is well worth buying too. One of the songs featured on this album is Lamont’s “Manhattan in the Rain”! I can strongly recommend the album.
So, when you have voted for the candidate of your choice, come and vote for the music of all our choices, Modern Jazz, with Frank Griffith and The Clive Burton Quintet. Put it in your diary NOW.
Another CD recently added to my collection has people on it who have (sadly) never been to the Hedsor Social Club!! “Humphrey Lyttelton in Canada” on the Sackville label (3033) has some 1980’s Humph in fine form, with saxophonist Jim Galloway, guitarist Ed Bickert, Neil Swainson on bass and Terry Clarke on drums. Most of the tunes will be familour to Humph fans, all having been featured at some time on earlier recordings by the H.L Band! It’s a terrific addition to the catalogue!!
It’s wonderful to be able to have vibrant jazz to play at home, but it is better to listen to vibrant LIVE jazz! So do come and join us at the Hedsor Social Club. You know it makes sense!!
But Thursday Night is ALWAYS reserved for Jazz at The Hedsor Social Club, (otherwise known as Hedsor Jazz!!)
This week it is the regular Clive Burton Quintet, yes, all our regulars are in the same place tomorrow night!!
Then of course you have our world renowned raffle!! He do we do it? And all included in the price too!!
Looking further ahead don't forget to reserve September 26th as a jazz day!! That's the day Hedsor Jazz goes to school!! Much more later, but it WILL be a very special day, with all of your Hedsor favorites coming to a school near me!!
The Good News is that you haven’t missed anything. The Clive Burton Quintet WILL be appearing at The Hedsor Social Club, as usual, tomorrow evening. The music starts at 8.30 pm, and we will still let you in for just £6. Those of you who have been before will realize that there is a small (voluntary) sum to be contributed before we let you out!!
I haven’t written anything about Jazz on CD for a longish time, so lets catch up on a wonderful box set released in 2001!!
The yore is of times further ago than 2001 too. Proper Box 24 is a 4 CD set of Louis Armstrong recordings from the 1940’s. It is a gem. The booklet on the early life of Louis is almost worth the cost of the box itself, it is so informative and well done with lots of photos, but the deep joy must be reserved for the music itself. It is all presented in date order, ending up with the 2 concerts that went on to launch The Louis Armstrong’s All-stars, the only medium he used for touring and his music ever after. The Louis Armstrong All-Stars became the USA’s musical ambassadors to the world.
One or two things to highlight. Most of the material is Louis with an orchestra, generally showing his ability as a soloist, the orchestra largely not having in it anyone who could outshine Louis!
In 1946 he recorded some small group tunes again, some even under the heading of Louis Armstrong and his Hot Seven! It is very interesting to hear the “prequel” to the All-Stars this early. On some tracks the trombone is played by Vic Dickenson, whilst on others it is actually Kid Ory!!
He remained the leader of a big band, and it is interesting to note that buried in some 1946 recordings is tenor sax player Lucky Thomson, a wonderful star of early bop, who sadly did not live up to his nickname.
Come 1947 and the famous New York Town Hall concert is represented (I think all that is available is here). Louis was still touring with his orchestra at the time, and the ensemble (Jack Teagarden, Peanuts Hucko, Dick Cary, Bob Haggart and Sid Catlet) were brought together by Bobby Hackett and rehearsed by him for the big man to be able to just fly in and play the night!! He can clearly be heard, but sadly, the sleeve notes give him no credit!!
The recordings are generally very listenable to and it is a purchase well worth making. It is still listed on Amazon at £13.73!!
Whatever else you do (think of the scope!!) don't let Live Jazz die. It, and the musicians who play it, need an audience, that's YOU!!
Anyone who has been to Hedsor on any of our jazz nights will have heard most of the musicians before as they are all regular favourites of ours at Hedsor Jazz. The cast list is as follows:-
Musically my lasting impression of this collaboration is of rich harmonies. Whether it be the Septet or the Quartet the music is conveyed with a really rich sound. I was particularly impressed by the sound of the Quartet. With fewer people it is harder to convey that rich musical sensation, but here they do so really well. The Septet has an advantage in having more people to make up that richness and sounds, surprisingly, much more lie a big band.
It was also interesting to note that there is an 8-month gap between recording the 2 different groups, the Quartet being recorded earlier in 2014 than the Septet tracks.
For those of you who wont know the capabilities of “our” regular musicians be assured that in their individual ways they are all superb. Usually we are aware that Nigel Fox is a Bill Evans devotee, but here the tune that Martin has dedicated to Bill Evans has Ken McCarthy on piano! Stuart Henderson has long been a favourite trumpeter at Hedsor, and on this CD he again shines through. However, Martin has a homegrown trumpet player (who has appeared once or twice at Hedsor) in the shape and sound of his son Miles. Listen out for his muted solo on “The Last Goodbye”
All the musician, so well know to us at Hedsor, are well represented with solo space on these recordings. The recording itself is of good sound quality. I know some of you who read this will have some of the recordings I’ve made during live Hedsor Gigs but this is definitely a recording of real studio quality. So, even though you will not know the tunes before purchase, you will be able to have a recording of the kind of music we have offered to us each week at Hedsor in fine sound quality for the first time in a some of years (The Norden Farm Recording of the quartet under another name – Century Jazz, were made in 2003!).
One last comment. The final tune is entitled “Zane at The Hedsor Palisades”, which has puzzled me no end. I think it must signify a retreat, as according to Wikipedia “A palisade—sometimes called a stakewall or a paling—is typically a fence or wall made from wooden stakes or tree trunks and used as a defensive structure or enclosure”. So a retreat from a defensive wall. Why? Because, just as the full ensemble are getting going (with Mike Wills on clarinet), the band are faded out, and quickly too! I think that is a shame!
But you can have this CD, no doubt signed by some of the guys on it, especially if you come to it’s launch at the Hedsor Social club on Thursday this week, March 5th.

Life takes on meaning when you become motivated, set goals and charge after them in an unstoppable manner - Les Brown, Motivational Speaker
I’ve received many inquiries regarding the installation of new traffic lights on Pembina Highway, just south of Killarney/Kirkbridge.
The request to install this controlled intersection between the two shopping malls on Pembina was made in June, 2014 by the applicant, MMM Group Limited.
The Winnipeg Public Service states that these new traffic lights will be timed to coordinate with the lights at Killarney/Kirkbridge so as not to impede the flow of traffic.
See Item G below re the PEDESTRIAN CORRIDOR, which is located further south of the new controlled intersection:
“That the Winnipeg Public Service review the operations for possible adjustment or removal of the pedestrian corridor due to redundancy (located south of 2870 Pembina Highway)”.
No decision has been made on whether to leave or remove this corridor. The Winnipeg Public Service will assess this issue over the next 6 months.
YOUR FEEDBACK is welcome and will be considered when determining if the controlled pedestrian corridor stays or is removed. Please contact me if you wish to provide input on this issue.
These traffic signals are being installed subsequent to the Standing Policy Committee on Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works (SPCIRPW) approving the access for the commercial development located on 2848-2870 Pembina Highway on June 3, 2014 (Report 4).
The Public Service recommended to SPCIRPW that the approach on Pembina Highway should be approved, but it should not be signalized. However, SPCIRPW directed the Public Service to do the following:
“The Standing Policy Committee on Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works concurred in the recommendation of the Winnipeg Public Service, as amended:
1. That the Private Access By-law No. 49/2008 be varied, to authorize the construction of a 15.6 metre wide private approach on the west side of Baylor Avenue, opposite the north leg of Magdalene Bay, as shown on Drawing No. A-14025-1.
2. That the Private Access By-law No. 49/2008 be varied, to authorize the construction of a signalized 19.7 metre wide private approach on the east side of Pembina Highway, 174.6 metres south of Killarney Avenue as shown on Drawing No. A-14025-2, subject to the following conditions:
A. That the applicant shall, at no expense to the City, construct a 52.4 metre southbound left turn storage lane extension, as illustrated on Drawing No. A-14025-2.
B. That the applicant shall, at no expense to the City, modify the existing northbound left turn storage lane within the median of Pembina Highway, as illustrated on Drawing No. A-14025-2.
C. The applicant shall, at no expense to the City, remove the existing median opening within Pembina Highway, and restore with sod and barrier curb, as illustrated on Drawing No. A-14025-2.
D. The applicant shall, at no expense to the City, and no expense to the property owner of 2855 Pembina Highway, construct the proposed private approach and interior roadway modifications to the property located at 2855 Pembina Highway, as illustrated on Drawing No. A-14025-2.

Eye tracking is about where we look, what we look at, how much time we spend looking at it, how our pupils react to different kinds of visual stimulation and when we blink, according to IMOTIONS.
Put most simply, eye tracking refers to the measurement of eye activity. More specifically, eye tracking implies the recording of eye position (point of gaze) and movement on a 2D screen or in 3D environments based on the optical tracking of corneal reflections to assess visual attention. While the idea of eye tracking is quite straightforward, the technology behind it might strike you as rather complex and inscrutable.
No need to hit the panic button. The following pages are packed with all the need-to-knows and useful tools to help you get a solid grasp of eye tracking technology and best practices.
“The next time you are at a restaurant, at a ballgame or even on vacation, your social media posts may be being watched by a number of Fortune 500 companies.” Jessica Golden, CNBC
“The once-ubiquitous social media ‘war rooms’ that sprung up around big events like the Super Bowl are becoming a thing of the past. Instead, brands are now battling to make sense of real-time data on a daily basis ‘ not just the big occasions.” Grace Caffyn, Digiday
Simon Hudson, in Marriott Takes Social Media Listening to a New Level tells us that “50 to 60% of customers look(ing) to social media recommendations for products like travel.” So it makes sense that companies like Marriott International are watching our posts and setting up “war rooms”. The Research Insighter spoke to Cathy Hartman, the Vice President of Consumer Insights and Advisory Services at Marriott International to ask what sort of insights Marriott is acquiring, and how they’re putting them to use for their customers.
“Personalization is the new ‘normal’ imperative in marketing these days and is something that everyone seems to be struggling with. This notion about being able to leverage data for personalization at every touchpoint is something that you certainly have been pursuing. How are you going about this? What is most important to you?”
“Our guiding framework is to identify the right person with the right message at the right time. Much easier said than done.
The first step is identifying that right person. We’ve learned to use our data to identify travelers with the greatest potential value to our portfolio. Now, Marriott values every guest that comes to our site or enters our properties, but from a marketing perspective we need to be really smart to be efficient with our marketing efforts. So, we’ve developed ways to actively identify these individuals who are high-potential value, seek them out and engage them given their potential profitability to our portfolio.
A behavioral segmentation initiative enabled us to accomplish that first step and it also helped us to begin to tackle that second objective, as well…that ‘serving up the right message’. Using our data smartly, we can learn so much about our customers and what is relevant to them, not just what we want to say to them.
So, from travel purpose to brand propensities we can learn so much from just taking a look at the data that we have or can acquire through third parties. That ends up really being a win for the customers, as well as us. Our customers are receiving increasingly relevant, meaningful offers and we, then, earn a higher return on investment.
We have also been tackling that third piece ‘ that right time ‘ by studying the customer journey. So, how the customers engage with us or our competitors at every step of the travel journey, what behaviors are important for us to shift at each stage in this journey and how can we leverage data to help drive those shifts. The answers to those questions have helped us to weave it altogether to really deliver that right message to the right person and at the right time.”
“What is innovative that is interesting to you? Is there anything shiny and new out there that has your interest or attention?”
“There are some things that are shiny and new. A couple come to mind that we have been increasingly leveraging.
First is just new ways to be listening to the consumer in real-time. Marriott has recently launched multiple war rooms, if you will, for social listening. Our studios are called: ‘M Live’ and we are able to ‘ in real-time and in the presence of not just our insight representatives, but also marketing strategists and agency partners ‘ monitor conversations that are happening in real-time that we can then leverage for real-time marketing activations. It has turned into a really powerful technique that we are able to utilize to just be in the center of conversations.”
“The power of M Live, we’ve found, is to be able to really engage in the real-time dialogue with what people are saying. So, instead of forcing a conversation, instead of just deciding: ‘We want to say this message to people at this time’, we listen to what is going on with consumers and what they are talking about and then we can infuse ourselves into that conversation. Again, this makes what we’re saying more relevant and it enables us to get that permission to talk with them in a way that they might not otherwise be receptive to.
For example, when Pok??mon Go recently came out and took the world literally by storm, we looked for ways to get engaged in this conversation, as well. Once we identified this quickly rising trend, the team developed in activation and once we identified this trend, we identified ways that we could become part of that conversation.
Specifically, the gentleman who was the first to find all of the Pok??mons within North America, we identified a way to send him to remaining continents in order to find the missing Pok??mon and round out his set. It’s a fun example, but it’s an example of becoming part of the conversation where we don’t even need to put money behind these messages because people then pick up the story and do the sharing for us. It’s a fun and interesting way to become a part of these real-time conversations.”
“What are some of the key challenges you’ve run into specifically around personalization? How are you using research to address them?”
“That’s a great question. As strange as this may sound, a key challenge is actually having too much data. It’s almost overwhelming. Where do you start? The deeper you go into data-driven personalization, the more changes an organization needs to make to its marketing strategy.
So, if you personalized a segment or a person within that segment or to a specific touchpoint that the person within that segment is interacting with, each of these levels requires personalized content to make it real. That’s literally a tsunami of strategic content and needs. All of this needs to be planned and produced by someone.
What we’ve learned to do is use research to identify our North Star or those metrics our marketing efforts need to move in order to claim success. That is what is going to help us ensure we stay focused and on track with all of our efforts.”

Title: age: race/ethnicity: i think that in relation harmony is the most important october 26 - - i think that in relation harmony is the most important.
It most likely would have been. The word "Mandate" would simply have been removed from Mandate-Palestine.
There would not have been any Armistice Green lines in 1949 for Egypt and Jordan to fall back to in order to protect the remaining land for the Palestinians. That would have meant that Palestine would have been unbroken. That would have meant that the Jews would have remained a minority and would have continued to live as they had lived for 1000's of years amongst the Arabs. That would have meant that the bitterness of the Arabs being the majority ruled by the minority would never have existed.
The foreigners that came from Europe under the banner of Zionism would probably have been bitter that their dream didn't come true. That would have meant that the Haganah would not have been able to establish itself officially, which meant that radicals like Irgun and Lehi wouldn't have strengthened and wouldn't have festered in the land.
Egypt would not have lost their monarchy because the pretext of the military coup in 1952 was that the King was incapable of protecting his neighboring Arabs. That would have meant that the nationalization of the country by a zealous Army General would never have transpired, and Egypt would never have gone into the severe poverty it faces now under military rule.
That would have meant that Egypt would have remained a thriving country with open trade, and would have still had its alliance with Britain instead of the Soviet Union. That would have meant that Britain would have had a conflict of interest between the Balfour Declaration and one of its wealthy commonwealth nations, Egypt, which probably meant that complete and full support of the Zionist movement would never have come from Britain because of its support for Egypt as well.That probably would have meant that Britain would still be the superpower today since the 1956 nationalization of the Suez Canal would never have undermined Britain's world authority with U.S. intervention.
That would have meant that Palestine would have probably followed Egypt's political structure and framework as a thriving country with open trade, most likely under its own established monarchy. Such a young country would probably have required the protection of Egypt, which most likely would have meant that although it would no longer be a British Mandate, it would have strong influences from the commonwealth.
More importantly the question of land would never have been an issue because the majority ruling over minority is a common situation around the entire world.
Jews would have been able to trade freely, as they were in Egypt. They would have been able to establish their own religious laws within sub-communities for minorities, as it existed in Egypt. Egypt's Jewish population had entries at the royal court and were able to contribute to the nation's public transport, cotton industry, sugar refinery, banking, department stores, real-estate developments, agriculture, as well as having jobs as accountants, shopkeepers, teachers, and merchants. Palestine would have had a similar framework for the minority. Jews in Egypt were equal under the laws of property, contract and obligation, and were given rights to maintain their own religious rites and freedoms. Palestine would have had a similar framework for the minority.
If only the Jews simply asked to live amongst the Arabs as they did in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, rather than threaten to take the land instead.
In hindsight, the Jews are still at a loss even today, but not because of the Arabs... because of Zionism.
This is a common question asked in the Western world, however this seems to stem from a fundamental misunderstanding on what antisemitism actually means.
There is no antisemitism in Arab countries since Arabs are Semites. If you don't believe me look up the definition of the word Semite, and you might be surprised.
I am a Semite because I am of Arab decent. It would be ignorant of me to call a Jewish person "antisemitic" if he or she disagreed with Arab culture or the belief systems that most Arabs adhere to, or even to condemn a group of Arabs who have been involved in a criminal act.
The reason as to why the word Semite has been hijacked by Zionism in order to be associated solely to the Jewish people, is to constantly remind the world of the despicable treatment towards Jews inflicted in Europe in the early 1900's.
It is another fear campaign to scare people into avoiding being labelled with the same negative connotation attributed to the European movements against the Jewish people during that time.
Today, it is an invented concept that is not relevant in Arab countries because their reasons to stand against Zionism are very different to the European movement against Jews. The truth is the word gets thrown around too easily and almost gets used in the same context as "racist" or "bigot", however most of the cases involve people being labelled "antisemitic" simply because they condemn the Israeli government for war-crimes, or the illegal settlement activities built on another person's home or farm.
That argument is almost like saying "condemning Nazism is like being anti-Aryan", and that simply doesn't make sense.
"Antisemitism" in the context of this question suggests a hatred for Jews at a discriminatory baseless level, yet the reason for condemnations against Zionism is quite evident and clear, and has nothing to do with being anti-Jewish.
As an example, if I lived in a small home with my whole family, and made a friendship with my neighbors, and then some little orphan girl comes into my home protected by big bodyguards, then she takes my whole house and pushes all my family into one small room, that gives me cause to try to take back my home regardless of how strong those body guards are, and regardless of how innocent that little orphan girl seems to the rest of the world.
It would be ignorant for someone to think that my neighbors and I hate all little orphan girls, without understanding the real reason as to why I am opposing her actions.
It is an interesting question to pose as some may question Syria's moral stance with accepting the current status of these refugees on their land for the last 70 years. But the problem itself lies not with the temporary status of refugees and where they currently live, but rather why they were refugees in the first place.
It would be the same as asking why the 1000's of Syrian Refugees today that have fled to Turkey because of the Syrian regime's brutality against civilians were not given Turkish citizenship.
The problem isn't to solve the refugee status by accepting a brutal regime's existence and have the open-handed neighboring nations take on the population into their own society.
The real problem is to root out these regimes that created the refugees in the first place, not to encourage them to remain in power so long as someone else takes care of their issues.
Similarly, the Palestinian refugee problem isn't something that needs to be solved by those who were willing to give them refuge from oppression, but those oppressive regimes that created the refugee problem in the first place.
In this case, it is Israel that needs to deal with putting those who they displaced back where they belong. If Israel thinks that it cannot support such a massive influx of people into their nation, then they should have thought of that before creating a state at their expense in the first place.
The land belongs to two peoples. If Zionism only really cares to cater for only one, then they are unfit to rule the land that is shared by both.
The Council was informed of the decision of Israel to continue deportations of Palestinians in the occupied territories, the Council reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention referring to the protection of civilians in times of war.

The resolution deplored the action and reiterated that Israel should refrain from deporting any more Palestinians and ensure the safe and immediate return of those deported.
The Council strongly condemned the deportation of 12 Palestinians by Israel in the occupied territories on December 17, 1992. They were in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention referring to the protection of civilians in times of war.
The Council strongly condemned the deportation of 413 Palestinians by Israel in the occupied territories on December 17, 1992. They were in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention referring to the protection of civilians in times of war.
Prior to Israel as we see it today, the region of Jerusalem and its surrounding territory (which adopted many names in its history) has had only one moment where the Hebrews actually ruled the land.
For many centuries, they were either a minority scattered throughout the world or otherwise ruled by another entity in the land in question.
Even since the beginning of their lineage with the father of the Hebrews, Jacob, along with his children they didn't settle there. They migrated to live in Egypt and many generations passed with the Hebrews living in Ancient Egypt before their emigration under Moses.
Their most notable period was approximately 1000 BC, when David defeated Goliath and ruled as king of his newly conquered land. His successor and son, king Solomon claimed the throne thereafter, and then after his death civil war struck and split the kingdom into Judea and Samaria.
The divided kingdom became weak and fell prey to the Empire's around them (namely the Assyrian Empire), until Nebuchadnezzar conquered the land and the Hebrews were exiled to Babylon.
That was all they had, three or four generations to add to the 70 years of their colonization today.
They weren't the first people there either. People lived there before them when it was called the land of Canaan.
The most important fact to take from this is that Jews don't have "more right" on the land simply because they ruled for three or four generations. The concept that people lived before them, and people lived after them means their rule was just a passing moment in history. In fact the Arabs under the Caliphate ruled for almost 1000 years, so the concept of "more right" on the land has very little context.
Jews through Zionism have conquered the land today with the help of Britain, but for how long, especially considering they are constantly under international pressure.
Conquering lands and colonizing people doesn't really work the same way it did centuries ago, and the Zionist movement has found it extremely difficult to maintain so far.
The initial proposal of the Partition Plan drafted by the UN in the form of Resolution 181 in 1947 was the first notion of a two-state solution, following the mass migration of Jews that caused severe clashes between those seeking refuge from the antisemitic movement in Europe and the native Arabs that were being displaced by the thousands because of this migration.
This proposal was only a realization to separate the two people based on their ethnicity because there was no end in sight for the conflict between Arabs and Jews. Neither side seemed to be able to live together for years following the mass influx of European Jews, though ironically native Arabs and native Jews were living together in harmony prior to this for 1000's of years.
The difference was the Zionist movement behind the migration which incidentally was founded well before antisemitism grew in Europe. Arabs considered Zionism a threat to the demographics of the region, especially following Jabotinsky's shockingly honest account of the colonial plan in his 1923 essay "The Iron Wall": The Iron Wall 191207_49117.pdf
Jabotinsky accurately explained the expected reaction of a native population towards the prospect of being colonized, which lead to the blunt realization that it would be impossible to expect a "voluntary agreement" with the Arabs. He realized the only way to achieve a state where the Jews were the masters of the land rather than a people absorbed within the population as a minority, was to use force.
Jabotinsky questioned it himself, why would the Arabs want to concede an area they inhabit for a colonial entity that wants to enforce a majority of its own? Why would any native want that? It would mean a "transfer" of Arabs in order to make the migrants the majority. Even under British Occupation and before that under the Ottoman Empire, Arabs were ruled by the respective authority's security forces, but the demographics were never threatened.
As the decades went by the Arabs were not able to hold their position and maintain their lands and territories, only to concede more and more of it to the Zionist movement. While some Arabs refuse to acknowledge the defeats they faced and continue to talk about a one-state solution, those who do, feel they can only approach the conflict with one compromise: the two-state solution, based on the last known legitimate truce regarding borders - the Armistice "green line" Agreement of 1949, or popularly known as the pre-67 borders.
For Israel however, the one-state solution obviously doesn't work since the Arabs outnumber the Jews, which would mean that a pure democratic process where all people who have a claim on the land (displaced or otherwise) have equal rights to vote and that would result in an Arab leadership. That means that Israel would face the same fate as the South African democracy which ended white minority rule. It is ironic that Israel claim it is the "only democracy" in the Middle East, yet a pure democratic process inclusive of all its people would deny Israel's entire existence. Democracy and Zionism therefore are mutually exclusive.
Fortunately for the Zionist movement, the Arabs are not strong enough to force a hand at making such a bold claim for the one-state solution, and therefore have no other option but to approach the negotiation table with the two-state concept.
However, just as the Palestinian Papers have shown, neither the issues surrounding the right of return, nor the ever-changing "land swaps" seems acceptable to Israel, regardless of the extreme concessions made by the Palestinian Authority even on key issues surrounding Jerusalem.
That's because the two-state solution doesn't really work for Israel either, even if the PA agree to all of Israel's preconditions. Zionism, as Jabotinsky puts it, is the colonization of the region, and any final agreement for a two-state solution would put an abrupt halt on the ongoing growth of the "Jewishness" of the land.
The real answer for Zionism is to maintain the status-quo. As long as they are in a state of conflict and the Palestinians don't have an official state, the Israeli government believe that the occupied territory can be annexed by Jewish-only settlements since there is no "official claim" to the land, regardless of what could potentially be part of a future Palestinian state.
The key question that arise from this dilemma is how Israel can get away with building settlements that encroach on a potential future state of Palestine. Even Israel's only ally the US has admitted that the core issue preventing peace talks from resuming is the ongoing settlement activities that have been deemed illegal by international law as per the 4th Geneva Convention.
"Might is right" some may say, and in this case, unfortunately it is quite accurate. While the United Nations was established never to allow such atrocities as were witnessed during WWII, it is ironically the very mechanism Israel is using to maintain this current state of conflict.
That is because the US have in fact been guilty of being Israel's "lawyer", rather than their "honest broker".
The rest of the world has overwhelmingly voted for a state of Palestine, while the US with Israel have been able to prevent it. The security council voted for an immediate halt of the illegal settlement activities, but the US with Israel have been able to prevent it.
If we cannot implement it on the international stage, then it is a farce that is used by the 5 permanent member nations to control the world's decision-making by playing their political games for strategic advantages. Incidentally, they are only permanent because they were the victors of WWII - clearly a sign that the very foundation of the UN is already outdated.
The best way to rectify such deadlocked conflicts as the Israel-Palestinian issue, is to have a "majority" vote in the UN rather than a concept of a veto, where the definition of "majority" could be determined based on the weighting of a nation's contribution to the UN security council, or even based on an overwhelming vote of 95% or higher to any resolution.
The solution to the Middle East has never been one that needed bombing.The real problem lies with foreign funding.
Too many times in the history of the Middle East have we seen attempts to fight fire with fire only to see the flames increase. Terrorist groups like ISIS are looking for a fight. Don't give them one. They are isolated on the international stage and even the majority of Sunnis don't recognize them with any form of legitimacy.
There are too many political games being played via the UN where Russia and its bloc prevent the West from getting too involved and vice versa. The area is too critical for anyone to allow the other to have full control. When Assad was protected with a veto to protect his regime against the people's uprising, that's when the Syrian Spring went from civil disobedience, to protests, to violence, to radicalization.
Recent history has also shown that attempts to overcome political stalemate was by engaging in a proxy war i.e funding radicals to counter the radicals.
We saw it with Afghanistan where the Soviets funded one group and the Americans funded the other, creating a civil war which ultimately created the Taliban.
Israel's attempts to create discourse amongst the Palestinians by creating and funding Hamas to defy the PLO backfired on them.
Egypt's military regime receives the second largest foreign aid from the U.S. which makes it virtually impossible to have a democracy, even when the people tried, then failed.
Israel receives the largest foreign aid from the U.S. and we've seen what decades of war have done to the region with that funding.
The best solution is to stop pretending the West knows how to "solve the Middle East problem" and let them deal with it on their own.
The renaissance age that grew during the Fatimid era when the Arab world grew naturally, provided the world with science and philosophy, while Europe was busy burying "witches".
If we leave them to fight their own battles without puppet dictators or funded terrorists running the show, they might engage on a level playing field and eventually stability will come from the power of the people. It might not come overnight, but it needs to start sometime.
ISIS is only a result of a chain reaction that came from the Arab Spring where Assad was unchallenged. His regime was part of the alliance that formed with Nasser and called themselves the Arab League. That league was formed to break from the yolk of the monarchies that ruled the Middle East. Those monarchies were a product of WWI's dismantlement of the Ottoman Empire where the victors Britain and France played with the "spoils of war" by dissecting Arabia into the countries we see today and planting the seeds of subservient monarchs.
Terrorist groups like ISIS have never been the real problem, because when they are defeated another group like them will arise from the ashes unless the root cause is dealt with.
Since the erection of the "separation wall" or more commonly known as the apartheid wall, 35,000 meters of irrigation network were ceased, 11,400 Dunams of agricultural land were confiscated, 100,000 ancient olive trees were destroyed. This impacted life, agriculture, freedom of movement, water usage, and income. It has also aloud for Jewish-only settlement expansions in the more fertile areas of the West Bank.
After the occupation of the West Bank, Israel took control of all water resources and prohibited Palestinians from water development and drilling the required infrastructure. To date not a single permit issued for agriculture or domestic use in Palestinian areas has been granted.
More than 31 natural water wells producing 3.8 million cubic meters that serve 1000's of Palestinians for agriculture and domestic use has been confiscated.
While the annual rainfall accumulation in the region is 47.8% in Palestinian Territories, 29.7% in Israel, 22.5% in Jordan, Israel's domestic water use per capita reaches more than 52%, leaving 30% for Jordan and 18% for the Palestinian Territories.
There are a number of issues concerning Israel's commitment to adhere to international law. The jurisdiction of these concerns fall beyond Israel's own foreign policy and what it interprets as justified. Since the surrounding Palestinian Territories are not actually part of Israel's sovereignty, the international community has the authority to determine whether or not Israel is defying international law, regardless of what Israel defines for its own rules of engagement.
There are a number of concerns that the international community have raised, which Israel has ignored or refuses to take part in, which is why many deem Israel a "rogue" state.
Currently, Israel undergoes what is considered illegal settlement expansion in the territories it has occupied since 1967. These areas are found in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Occupation itself is not illegal, however the means in which Israel conducts its occupation of these territories has been deemed illegal based on the Fourth Geneva Convention.
There are currently about 500,000 Jewish colonists living in approximately 200 colonies in the West Bank. During the seven years of the Oslo peace process, the number of Israeli colonizers in the Occupied Territories increased by more than 50 percent. (AL Sep. 8. 2003. MDE 15/085/2003)
‘. . The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population in the territory it occupies.’
The UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 1998 reiterated its view that "Israeli settlement in the Occupied Palestinian Territories are not only illegal under contemporary international law but are an obstacle to peace and to the enjoyment of human rights by the whole population in the region."
According to Amnesty International. "the Israeli Army has destroyed some 4,000 Palestinian homes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as vast area of cultivated land, hundreds of factories and other commercial properties. roads and public buildings.” (MDE 15/091/2003)
‘Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons... is prohibited.
Employees and mobile units of the PRCS and ICRC are regularly detained and harassed. Noteworthy violations include: A PRCS ambulance used as an assault shield by the IDF (Jan. 8, 2004): A tank assault on a PRCS ambulance, shattering the front windshield and injuring the driver (Jan. 28, 2004): During the destruction of the Jenin Refugee Camp in April, 2002. the ICRC was prevented from offering services to the injured and dying for six days.
'Medical personnel exclusively engaged in the search for, or the collection, transport or treatment of the wounded or sick... shall be respected and protected in all circumstances…'
More notably, Israel is one of only four states in the world who refuse to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The reason Israel refuse to be part in this treaty is because it has an undeclared arsenal of an estimated 80 nuclear weapons. The fact that the US Congress and Netanyahu refuses to address this issue while trying to punish Iran who is part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and is developing legitimate civilian nuclear energy under this signed treaty is hugely hypocritical.
Recently revealed documents prove not only that Israel has nuclear weapons, but actually tried to sell some to Apartheid South Africa. Who else Israel approached to sell nuclear weapons remains an unasked question.
The South African Apartheid was arguably just as internationally covered. Ironically the National Party of South Africa gained power in the same year that the Zionist nationalist movement created their own state, and that year was 1948.
Both imposed laws based on an ethnic disposition, which in turn received world-wide condemnation from the international community. The establishment of these ruling parties came only three years after another ethnically-motivated nationalist movement was dismantled in Europe, which is probably why both these movements were put on the international radar.
The stark negative reactions against these movements were displayed with similar UN resolutions against both groups:
UN GA Resolution 1761 was passed in 1962 in response to the racist policies of apartheid established by the South African Government. The resolution deemed apartheid and the policies enforcing it to be a violation of South Africa's obligations under the UN Charter and a threat to international peace and security.
UN GA Resolution 3379 in 1975 "determined that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination". This was due to the concept of a state based on a specific ethnicity rather than the demographics of the region.
Trade embargoes against South Africa were gaining traction, as well as the famous UN arms embargo which became mandatory with the passing of Resolution 418. Boycotting of sports games by international teams had a profound effect on the white population, perhaps more so than the trade embargoes did.
Similarly, the BDS movement against the Zionist regime has been in full force world wide, as well as a mirroring on the sporting stage where the Israeli football team was boycotted by most of the Asian Football Confederation in the 1970s and so Israel had no choice but to join the European Federation (UEFA).
There is also a frightening similarity in the respective propaganda and the "state of emergency" laws that were implemented in both regions.
Serious political violence in South Africa was a prominent feature from 1985 to 1989, as black townships became the focus of the struggle between anti-apartheid organisations and the government. Numerous township councils were overthrown or collapsed, to be replaced by unofficial popular organisations, often led by militant youth. The government also raised concerns about South Africa's isolation amongst surrounding "hostile Black-ruling" nations that unified under the same cause.
Zionism had to face numerous intifadas and resistance against its settlement activities and occupation, particularly in Gaza, which was also replaced by an unofficial popular militant organisation. Israel also raised concerns about its international isolation especially amongst its neighboring "hostile Arab nations".
The world was not fooled however because these propaganda techniques were seen before by the Nazi regime who tried to use the "victimization card" in order to gain support internationally for their cause, usually using false-flag operations.
Significant international awareness campaigns against these racially motivated groups had always been growing. These reactions were most likely due to the remnant memories of what had become of Europe because of the Nazi party and its regime.
Since both the South African Apartheid and Nazism have been dismantled, the Zionist regime is all that remains from an era of racial nationalistic radicalism, and so naturally international coverage over the last few decades have concentrated on the Israeli Apartheid more so than many other conflict... until of course one day it too becomes dismantled and justice is returned to the inhabitants of the region.
The main person pushing this idea is Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli political leaders have been warning for more than 20 years that Iran is at a "breakout capability" for developing nuclear weapons.
In 2012 Netanyahu stood before the UN General Assembly and promised that Iran were "within months" of developing a nuclear weapon.
In the most recent speech to US congress he said that negotiations with Iran were "paving the way for an Iranian nuclear weapon in a matter of weeks".
Netanyahu mentioned in his last speech to congress to ignore intelligence agencies, and to "just Google it". The reason why he doesn't want to rely on intelligence estimates is because according to both the US intelligence estimates and Israeli intelligence estimates Iran is not on a path to enrich uranium for the development of nuclear weapons, and in fact they've concluded that Iran have not even pursued research in that regard since 2003.
So what we keep seeing from Netanyahu in his speeches to the US Congress and the UN General Assembly is the same old rhetoric and fear mongering.
The fact that Iran has allowed the UN Nuclear inspectors to visit their uranium mines shows the level of ongoing cooperation Iran is willing to conduct, and that in itself shows these theories to be extremely weak.
Netanyahu's insistence that Iran have no nuclear capability whatsoever including those that are illicit for it to have and to develop under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty points to the hypocrisy of his stance, since there are four nuclear rogue states who refuse to sign the treaty, one of those ironically is Israel.
The reason Israel refuse to be part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is because it has its own undeclared arsenal of an estimated 80 nuclear weapons. The fact that US Congress and Netanyahu refuses to to address this issue while trying to punish Iran who is part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and is developing legitimate civilian nuclear energy under this signed treaty is hugely hypocritical.
Whats even more hypocritical is the stance the US has taken when it was the only nation in the entire history of mankind to actually use nuclear bombs on an entire population of civilians, twice, and has not been held accountable for the atrocities it inflicted in arguably the worst terrorist attack humanity has ever seen.
There are essentially two core components of this apparent unilateral support as shown in the graphical:
There is a divine Right of Return to the Land of Israel (including Judea and Samaria as known by the Zionist movement), as the first step to bring about redemption of the world.
The first is straight forward to address. Apartheid is in-congruent and incompatible with the concept of democracy.
For the second, let us put forward an argument that shows this Right of Return to be principally flawed.
The Jews (like several other tribes) originated in that area. Origins have nothing to do with title to land. That logic is absurd and nonsensical. Indian Muslims originated from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan - they cannot claim land in those countries. Parts of Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand have Hindu origins - Indians cannot claim land in those countries. Large parts of Scotland have Nordic origins - Denmark and Sweden have not claimed any land there. The north of Pakistan is Bactrian Greek in origin - the Greeks have claimed no land there.
Jews have indeed been living continuously in the Holy Land, but between AD 70 and the end of the 19th century in very small numbers. Even as late as 1872, the Jews probably less than 4 percent of the population of the land. There has always been a Sephardic community in Palestine, but until recently it was numerically insignificant – in 1257 Nahman Gerondi found only two Jewish families in Jerusalem – and it is hard to see how its existence can be used to assert that ‘the only continuous claim [to Palestine] that exists’ is the Jewish. What the Arabs do claim, however, is that the land has been inhabited for ‘millennia’ by the ancestors of the Palestinian refugees. The modern Palestinians are a people of various ethnic origins, descended from the conquerors of Palestine since early Biblical times. Their ancestors are the Canaanites and Philistines who, unlike the Jews, were never deported. They remained in Palestine (which took its name from the Philistines) and their descendants formed, and still form, the core of the indigenous population. In the seventh century, the Muhammadan Arabs brought with them their government, their language and their religion, and a majority of the inhabitants accepted all three. Palestine and its people became "Arabised". Yet they remained the same people.
"If it is proper to “reconstitute” a Jewish state which has not existed for two thousand years,, why not go back another thousand years and reconstitute the Canaanite state? The Canaanites, unlike the Jews, are still there."
"The basis for Zionist land claims are absurd. The same basis can be used to create a Hutsul state in Ukraine, a Cossack state in Russia, a Macedonian state in Greece, a Kashubian state in Poland, an Alsatian state in France, a Gurkha state in Nepal, a Rajput state in India, etc. Political Zionism is ethnic madness, and is based on a racist view of demographic history."
Jewish settlers in Occupied Palestinian Territories are quite different to those who live in Israel Proper, or even the Jewish diaspora.
Those who live in Tel Aviv are known to be more involved in their own personal civil challenges on a day to day basis. They love their shopping and are more concerned about the increase in housing prices than the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Regarding the conflict, there are common differences which mainly depend on whether they are secular Jews or religious Jews.
American Jews have a definitive split in opinions between leftists and conservative right-wingers that generally revolve around either supporting the BDS movement (leftists) or have the impression that Israel is a tiny state surrounded by hostile Arab countries who want to push Jews to the sea (right-wingers).
Jewish settlers are a very different kind of people. They are known to be the "pioneers" of the future Eretz Israel, and the "front line" of the land expansions. They require little incentives from the Israeli government and, more astonishingly, sometimes break Israeli law when erecting their own makeshift homes which are unapproved by Israeli building authorities.
Many are radical in nature, banding together as thugs who's primary goal is to make Palestinians feel unwelcome in the hopes they leave the land for them. Settlers are equipped with M-16 assault rifles and are allowed to use them at their own discretion.

It’s Wednesday and all over the internet you will find photos with no words of explanation. Why? Because pictures say a thousand words.
I think 4 or 5. She’s beautiful. i was never a dog lover until I had a weak moment and told my family we could adopt a dog. Now Lucy is totally my dog and I joke that she’s my favorite kid because she never talks back or whines at me 🙂
She is so beautiful. J.P’s black lab passed away a few weeks ago. She looks just like Kobe! I bet she is about 10!!! 🙂
So sweet! I was thinking that in the last photo the look on her face reminds me of my black lab Kobe (who is turning 10 this year).
Hey Stephanie! Did you see the comment from Marsha? Her dog’s name is Kobe too! Pretty cool doggy name. Mico is 12!
Hi Lynn, puppies are the best! Our friends just got an adorable little puppy. Mico, my dog, is 12! Not a lot of puppy energy in her. She likes to sleep!
Hi Stefanie, Mico is 12! What kind of dog is Lucy? Is she big or small? Dogs are the best at giving unconditional love.
Oh my, what a sweet pup! I just love labs…we have 2. Mico looks so young and sprite! Our chocolate is 8 and getting very grey. The same week my youngest left for college, the Guiding Eyes For the Blind called and said they had a 1 yr-old released dog (most don’t make it through the whole training) for us…how could I say no? So Rio (chocolate) has a brother, Darwin (black). They are inseparable. I highly recommend the Guiding Eyes if anyone is looking to adopt a wonderful puppy or dog: http://www.guidingeyes.org/learning-center/dog-adoption/
Mico is very grey around her chin and eyes. It didn’t show up in the photo. She is 12! What great names-Rio and Darwin. Labs are just so sweet. Thank you so much for the Guiding Eyes link. I hope they don’t call because I know I couldn’t resist!
What a sweet girl! We plan to get a rescue Greyhound next year when my youngest turns 5. It took a while after our first dog died, but I think we are finally ready.
She is so sweet Brenna. I know that Greyhounds are in need of good homes. What a great gift you’ll be giving the dog. Sounds like your kids are at good ages for adding a dog to the family!
“Rus-Bank OJSC has been a business partner of Gorod Federal System since 2005. In due time the Bank has determined the fee-based business strategy focused on off-site technical platform for payment business management accompanied by support service and continuous development of available payment services for payers being the Bank’s clients.
We decided to choose Gorod Federal System as the Bank’s key partner due to its scalability, safety, technical peculiarities and comfort to operate in it from the point of view of Bank’s operators who always value easy handling, functionality and fast support. Our choice of Gorod Federal System has met our expectations – during our cooperation we have implemented several large-scale projects related to payment business development and implementation of the system in all 270 Bank’s offices and we also have cooperated with the System as being a Settlement Center in a number of Russia’s regions. It is the System that helped us to reduce the time for servicing payers in a bank and automate all stages of payment processing from paying cash in a bank to performing clearing payments with companies being providers of services. So, we have made a correct choice and confirmed it”.
“Connection to Gorod Federal System shortens service time and diversifies payments accepted by regional and federal service providers that enables us to increase profitability of transactions related to acceptance and processing of utility charges”.
“We have deliberately chosen Gorod System as a system for acceptance payments to be our partner. As the Russian Post, Federal Postal Service, is a great network of post offices, we have defined the following requirements: federal level, security, experience in various market segments (education costs, utility charges, on-line payments).
This was a right choice. Today together with GFS we have implemented on-line projects, organized billing for the largest counterparties of the Federal Postal Service for the Tomsk Region. Our cooperation resulted in additional profit gained by Tomsk department and reduced our costs related to the paper-and-pencil technology. GFS is a flexible technology adapting to definite tasks and it helps us to easily and quickly perform the required analysis. The internal control was also improved and simplified.”

It has been more than two years since Edmond Paul Price and Victoria Elizabeth Edelman set their trap for the Duke. Without mercy they ambushed the Duke beating and stabbing him within an inch of death and stealing many thousands of dollars. More than two years after these event the case was set to go to a jury trial on July 30 2012. The trail was again continued at the request of the Defendant. This time the continuance was based on the fact that Price's accomplice Edelman plans on entering a guilty plea in a deal that she reached with the prosecutor and Price is complaining that he does not know the terms of the deal. The Trial is now set for January 2013.
I understand better than most the complexities of the criminal justice system and the importance of insuring the right of defendants. But victims have rights too. Every time a case is set for trial a victim has the stress and anxiety of the up coming event. This can be very taxing when there are repeated delays in a trial. The victim just want to move on with their lives while the criminal continues to inflict injury by endless delays.
This defendant is a very good jail house lawyer. He has sued the State of California in Federal Court for alleged violations of his prisoners rights. He has taken his convictions there up on appeal. He has filed appeals and motions in this case and had his indictment over turned on technical grounds. Price's victory only required that he be indicted again. All this has but one real point. Price is in prison and probably will be for a very long time. All of this is distraction and entertainment in defense of the experience of being in prison. Instead of the day after day monotony a prison life, Price get to poke back at the system and stay occupied and out of prison in county jail.
I have no doubt that Price will continue his campaign against society for many years into the future. There will be a day of accounting for Price. But for now that will not be before January 13, 2013

I am on a journey of discovery. When I was 16 I hitch hiked all over the United States. Just me and a backpack. I hope to repeat the journey, but this time a little slower and in an RV. My RV is a relic from the past. Much of the adventure from this trip involves whether my RV will break down. I hope to post pages about the places I visit and the people I meet along the way. I hope to use my access to the web as a method of paying for the trip. This part has gotten off to a slow start. I also intend to share what I learn about Web income along the way.

You’re probably familiar with some of the ways smoking impacts our health, particularly lung cancer.
However, that’s not where the damage ends. Smoking can harm every part of the body, including our oral health. And the problems don’t end with stained teeth and bad breath.
Gum disease begins as an inflammation of the gums, which, if left untreated, can lead to serious damage to the gum tissue, tooth loss, and even bone loss in the jaw. It can also give bacteria access to the bloodstream, risking life-threatening infections. Smoking doubles the risk of developing gum disease by introducing hundreds of toxins into the mouth, and it also makes gum disease harder to treat.
One particularly strange effect smoking can have on oral health is that it can produce white patches on the roof of the mouth. These are stomatitis nicotina, or smoker’s keratosis. The condition is not well understood, but the white patches could be the result of inflammation of the mucous glands in the mouth. It usually isn’t painful, but it can be pre-cancerous.
Four out of every five people diagnosed with oral cancer smoke or chew tobacco. Oral cancer is cancer that affects any of the tissues in the mouth and throat. Early symptoms include unusual white patches, persistent sores or pain, difficulty chewing or swallowing, swelling, numbness, and the sensation of having something lodged in the throat. The dentist is the first line of defense against oral cancer, as many of these symptoms can be caught early during a regular dental exam.
Even people who don’t smoke can still be negatively affected by secondhand smoke. Studies suggest a link between cavities (in both baby teeth and adult teeth) and regular exposure to secondhand smoke. The dangers of secondhand smoke are particularly serious for infants and young children. They include asthma attacks, infections, and even SIDS.
Luckily, smoking is a very preventable cause of all these different dental problems. All we have to do is quit smoking or never pick up the habit in the first place. Even those with a long history of smoking can significantly improve their chances of avoiding health complications by quitting, so don’t think there’s nothing you can gain from it!
There are many resources available for smokers who need help quitting. Some of the best ones are supportive friends, family, and counselors. You can also find a lot of great information on the CDC’s website. We, as your dental health specialists, care deeply about your overall health. If you are a smoker, be sure to schedule regular dental exams, sometimes more than two a year, so that your mouth can stay healthy!
We host several crafting weekends through out each year now, as opposed to one big event each year. Each weekend is focused on only one project or craft. The scheduled weekend and project is dependent upon who is attending and what they are interested in.
In 2018-2019 we are looking forward to making Valenki, which are wet felted wool boots, and working on learning leather tooling and carving. We are also planing some museum trips to learn some new stuff.
If you are interested in joining us for an in depth crafting weekend, please contact us to work out the details.

After an excellent fish supper laid on by the Brixham yacht club and the spectacular and noisy Brixfest fireworks on Saturday, more than 30 heritage boats sailed (Corinthian Rules) around the 5 mile triangular course off Brixham on the Sunday, including the sailing trawlers Vigilance and Pilgrim, luggers, gaff rigs, Bermudan (Marconi) rigs older than 30 years and the two junk rigs, James and Sally Thomas’ and Clive Warren’s Ivory Gull and Ted and Fiona Stone’s Fly. Hui Mar, Dennis and Dawn Shepherd’s Atlanta 28 Junk and Belladean, Mike and Hazel Bartell’s Atlanta 28 Pointy who had also entered but were held back in Axmouth harbour by fog and onshore wind unfortunately arrived too late to start.
The wind was about 3 to 4 at the start but during the second lap it died away and the event was shortened from three to two laps. Fly had finished and was back near her mooring when a “Mayday” VHF call was heard from Ivory Gull who was still sailing out in the Bay. The bowsprit of the small gaff rigger Moya had crashed through Ivory Gull’s wooden toe rail, and through the upper cabin side, very seriously injuring the leg of James Thomas who had been standing on the deck. Luckily Clive Warren is a trained First Aider and was able to give vital first aid. Both of Torbay’s RNLI boats attended and after further treatment from paramedics ashore James was airlifted by the Devon Air Ambulance to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth.
Pictures and results of the regatta will be published on http://www.brixhamheritagesailing.org.uk/ in due course
I'm so sorry to hear about the accident, Ted. It must have really taken the shine off the event. I hope both man and boat will soon be as good as new.
It was a shame about the fog, too, but I hope that all the junks got together and had a sail in company after the event. Well done, you, for getting so many boats to attend. Can I hope that we'll all get a chance to read about it in the next magazine? And do you think you'll make it into an annual junket?
" ...there is nothing - absolutely nothing - half so much worth doing as simply messing about in junk-rigged boats"

Yemenjá’s enormous palapa, a Mexican thatched roof-pavilion designed by Manolo Mestre, announces the Mustique villa’s prominence with steadfast confidence – even defiant confidence. Climbing up the palm-fringed driveway, winding past the tennis court (whose sweeping ocean views claim frequent double faults) and the stone guest cottage, Bahia, with its own sleek, infinity lap pool, is truly breathtaking, in that you must remind yourself to exhale. Equal parts aw-inspiring and intimidating, the sprawling hilltop property was constructed to house the owner’s large extended family, including over twenty grandchildren. To call Yemanjá a compound would denigrate its elegant pedigree while labeling it a villa seems an awkward underestimation. Rather, Yemanjá’s sophisticated décor, exemplary craftsmanship, and customized details recall those of a refined superyacht. With three separate buildings, multiple pools, including a shallow wading pool for toddlers, and at least five dining areas in the main house, Yemanjá is perhaps the most exquisitely designed multi-generational villa in the Caribbean. Of course, the sharp eye and elegant style of the owner, a former proprietor of a Brazilian fine linen and children’s clothing line, are largely accountable. Immaculately conceived, every corner of every room, particularly the guest rooms, demonstrates a distinct and thoughtful design aesthetic. Unlike properties in which rooms are disproportionally decorated according to size, or worse, their view, at Yemanjá every single tabletop, upholstered furnshing and window treatment showcases interior design prowess. Whether it’s the exotic, handcrafted furnishings imported from the far reaches of South America and Africa, or the delicate embroidered bed linens from the owner’s native Brazil, or even the shell strung shower curtains, Yemanjá’s superlative décor is impressively consistent.
Befitting its glamorous proportions, the entrance to Yemanjá’s main building begins with a regal, curved staircase leading up the driveway. The stonewalled foyer, however, is graciously modest with a subtle, pebbled floor design, an antique wood table, and a back wall open to frame the initial view of Yemanjá’s lush interior gardens. Hanging above the table is a gold-toned painting of the ethereal Yemanjá, the Brazilian goddess of the sea, who is said to protect all those who enter. A cutstone path leads out from the entryway into the grass yard and then breaks off into tentacles toward the various wings and outdoor spaces of the main house. At the path’s heart is a custom-made pebble mosaic featuring a ring of five waves meant to represent the owner’s five daughters. The design is in the property’s insignia and can be found monogrammed on the towels, robes, and toiletries throughout the house, making the comparison to a yacht even more appropriate. Given Yemanjá’s high-quality interior design, the property risks being overwhelmingly perfect. Fortunately, the Latin-style architecture and flowing indoor-outdoor layout counter that impression with soothing curved edges, whimsical stone paths through the water, and several lounge spots, such as the mesmerizing tree sofa in the palapa, which is to soak in the expansive views. Decorated with the honed patience of a true designer, the one-of-a-kind furnishings at Yemanjá will delight any collector and include the canoe-shaped dining table behind the palapa made from railroad ties from South Africa and the mahogany coffee table found in France. Fellow enthusiasts will note showpieces from designers such Baker Furniture (platers chairs in the palapa), Oggetti in Miami (tub chairs in palapa), and accessories from Palacek and The Phillips Collection. However, it’s the handcrafted coconut and bamboo cabinets in the media room done by Industrias Exporenso in Bogotá and coconut shell trim on the floor-length curtains that showcase the considerable attention paid to every detail.
What makes Yemanjá even more spectacular is its ability to be both a casual, family retreat during the day and a sophisticated backdrop for cocktail hour and lavish dinner parties as the light fades. Guests can go from draping themselves across the Hermés-blanketed daybed under the palapa, to claiming one of the barstools, swirling a crystal-encased rum concoction from Pairson, whose eleven years of Brazilian and Italian guests have given him a generous hand. Despite the relaxation and seclusion afforded on property, I would still recommend packing your better outfits – not only is it Mustique, but Yemanjá’s fine fabrics (Lee Jofa, China Seas, Brunschwig and Fils, Quadrille and trimmings from M and J) will certainly expose lesser-made frock.
Truly, no desire or request is out of reach or over-the-top when you’re a guest at Yemanjá, though, admirably, the atmosphere does little to suggest prima-donna-type behavior. If anything, the laid-back nature of the staff and the absence of today’s super-luxe amenities (private screening room, private gym) keep the property rooted in its purpose of indulging its guests with space, views and sophisticated interiors. With a staff of sixteen, including three gardeners, Yemanjá is constantly being polished and nurtured, and thus, so are the guests. Meals are served with printed menus at dinner (the owner’s decree) are there is a binder for guests to view past menus to use as guides when designing their own. The fluffy cheese soufflé at lunch with home-brewed iced tea followed by a lobster salad was perhaps the most delicious lunch I had in the Caribbean. One of the daily pastimes at Yemanjá is deciding where to dine. With five separate eating alcoves, the decision can feel almost weighty. I recommend switching it up every day to try all the spots until, that is, you’ve decided your favorite for each time of day. I do, also, highly suggest hosting a dinner party while in residence at Yemanjá. The oval dining room table, seating twenty-two and located on a level below the pool, offers a fabulous opportunity to showcase Yemanjá’s impressive collection of china and tableware while simultaneously allowing for a lively evening tucked into the hill. The chef’s tangy curries with fresh coconut shavings are the ideal complement to the festivities, or for something more casual, take advantage of the barbecue and pizza oven and request a variety of fresh flatbreads. Surrounded by such refined luxury, it would be a downright shame to waste it with faux prudence. Instead, host an elegant dinner party and relish being the temporary hostess of one of the most cultivated properties in the Caribbean.
Split into three separate structures, the guests rooms at Yemanjá are designed to afford privacy, appease children, and envelop guests in sophisticated, comfortable décor. Boasting eight bedrooms in total, not including the children’s cottages (one for girls, the other for boys), Yemanjá has plenty of space for the multi-generational family reunion or a shared family vacation. The main house features five bedrooms. My favorite, aside from the elegant, whitewashed master bedroom, is Acarajé. The pale blue design on the coverlet on the four-poster mahogany bed had me at first glance. The thick raffia rug, bamboo desk from Minas Gerais in Brazil, and antique trunk imported from a shop in Connecticut all fall into place, belying the tremendous effort and sourcing that brought them together. The master bedroom is towards the back of the main house and done all in pale creams, beiges, and whites, with exotic prints of African dancers inspired by Carybé. The four-poster bamboo bed with palm fringe copper tops is particularly alluring with rows of plump-pressed pillows and a tufted headboard. I imagine mornings spent lounging with coffee and a book breaking only to gaze out the French doors to the glistening sea. The children’s bunk-houses, located alongside the main house, are a Neverland-fantasy realized with murals on the walls and play areas between each bunkroom. There’s even a trampoline in the adjacent yard and extra space for nannies. Bahia, the guest cottage, has three bedrooms and is ideal for those needing a bit of distance from the main house and its neighboring children’s quarters. Self-sufficient, the cottage has its own mini palapa, (palapita), lap pool, living room, and kitchen. The upstairs bedroom, Jangada (all the rooms are named after Brazilian fruits and delicacies), is my favorite, with its four-poster bamboo bed made by Paul Briger in San Miguel de Allende, shell-trimmed bed curtains and cheerful butter-yellow palette. All the guest rooms of Yemanjá feature delicate embroidered bed linens, ironed to perfection, that add a level of refinement rarely found in the Caribbean. The cottage’s back bedroom has twin beds, making it ideal for single guests or kids who’ve outgrown the bunk beds of the children’s cottages. The bottom bedroom, or suite as they all appear to be, opens out to the long grassy lawn and inviting infinity pool. Its blue-and-white fabrics with polka-dot patterns make it an instant crowd-pleaser while the spacious window seat mitigates rainy days with coziness.
Whichever guest room you claim, you can rest assured the linens will be exquisite, the furnishings distinctly paired, and the experience wonderfully privileged.

Does anyone know how much is an executive box is in the the Steve Bull? Is there a waiting list for them? How many people are aloud in your box on a match day? Me and ten mates want to get a box and were thinking it might cost us a grand each.
it depends on the match mate, usually its �800 a game for the big games and they hold 8 think the boxes toward the middle are bigger so they might hold more
Personally speaking there is nothing better than a load of mates going to the game and sitting in the stands. Not all of you might be able to sit in the same row but near as makes no difference.
definitly not a grand each mate, way cheaper than that, go to the matchday hospitality section on the official site and look there, if you are not fussy about which game in particular you see as well there are always offers for the less popular games at discounted prices
I wouldn't bother mate. You have to follow the dress code, can't wear a replica shirt and if you want a beer during the game you have to close the blinds and not look at the pitch!
You may aswell all take a trip to the Ticket Office and ask for a group of the standard seats together.

This is tag line. So Saddam carried those weapons to other countries undetected by U.S. satellites and all intelligence agents? Did he transport them by air, land, sea or through an underground tunnel? (Kudos to Saddam—the Arab born James Bond.)
If this story is true, then world is not safe yet. Because unnamed countries—multiple axis of evil—would use weapons to precipitate ‘Armageddon’ just when we think that danger has been averted. Or if they have good intentions, or if they do not know how to operate Iraqi missiles, they might just return these weapons to next democratic government in Iraq. And then circus continues.
Now away from fiction. Let truth be told. Did Iraq have any weapons of mass destruction prior to invasion? No, UN inspectors said so. And former U.S. weapon chief, David Kay, also supports it. Then was Bush right in going to war? Though he tried to invent reasons to justify war in interview, it must be said that there was no justification for it.
In my controversial book, CHASING SHADOWS!: A Dream; I wrote that we are fighting terror with wrong weapons. What causes terrorism? Such senseless wars and other injustices are root cause of this evil. So we are not solving problem, but fueling it.

Mrs. Weiss, Mrs. Clegg, Miss. Pat Werrell, as well as Miss. Elizabeth Seely did their best to make an even distribution of food available. Allen Clegg, a very small boy, who maintained a remarkable composure, did a wonderful job in helping ladies in their difficult task of feeding hungry crowd. He was almost always around with a tray asking “Have you been served?” When I asked him for another very small helping, he sharply retorted “No second helpings, Sir.”
But highest credit goes to Marines in general and to their chief Ernesto (Gutierrez) in particular. I have never seen such a self-sacrificing young man in my life. He was on duty almost 24 hours a day. He never ran into a temper. He always gave us best possible advice and kept us informed of tragedy that was going on outside station. He was so efficient that we soon felt and acted like disciplined soldiers under his command. I would like to call him a shepherd and us his flock.
As to tragedy itself, apart from intensive bombing and shooting that went on around and over us, I was not much scared, because Marines continually advised us on exactly what was going on.
On Sunday night Mr. Weiss gathered us in corridor and told us that he had received instructions to evacuate only Americans and third country nationals. When we asked him what would happen to us, locally hired monitors and others, who had borne brunt of past week as far as monitoring was concerned, he was so moved that he could hardly say, “I wish I could take you all with me. I will try to take you all with me.” But no sooner did he utter these words than he choked up. That very moment alone proved how sincere he was. Our confidence in him was reinforced.
At Mare Monte, where evacuation took place by helicopters, Mr. Weiss was last to board helicopter, because he was struggling over an impossible telephone to obtain approval for us. When we met on board British aircraft carrier off-shore, we all wept for joy. We were all out of danger and Mr. Weiss was proudest man on earth because he had saved lives by defying rules and regulations.
On board British aircraft carrier Hermes and U.S. warship Trenton we were excellently treated. No treatment could be more humane. I am over 60 and should know by now how important praying is. But I will never abandon kind of intense and devoted praying I have learned from Mr. Weiss.
I thank God, I thank Mr. Weiss, and I thank Marines. I thank warships and I thank FBIS as a whole from very depth of my heart.

The main facade is a simple decoration, with a clear and symmetrical. The central body ends in a wide cornice adorned with Mutula profiles and straight, all topped by a triangular pediment. The bodies are crowned by side twin towers, more baroque than the rest of the building.
"Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love."— Rainer Maria Rilke

From 1 July 2013, the TIO can handle complaints where the consumer became aware of the complaint event up to 6 years before coming to the TIO.
This includes existing issues we previously turned away because of our current time limit of two years.
Any complaint where the consumer became aware of the complaint event less than two years ago is in jurisdiction and will be handled according to standard procedure.
Any complaint where the consumer became aware of the complaint event more than six years ago is out of jurisdiction. We will not handle the complaint and will register an enquiry.
Any complaint where the consumer became aware of the complaint event two to six years ago will follow a new process:
The TIO will refer the complaint to you (similar to a Level 1 referral), but only register an Enquiry; this means there will be no direct charge.
If a consumer returns after 20 working days with an unresolved complaint, we will not deal with the complaint immediately. Instead we will:
ask the consumer for specific information about why it took so long for them to bring the complaint to the TIO
The TIO is likely to continue handling the complaint where it can be shown that strict compliance with the two-year time limit would cause injustice to the consumer, taking into account:
The TIO will then decide whether to handle the complaint further (as a conciliation at Level 2), or alternatively that the complaint will not be handled further. In the short term, this decision will be made by the Ombudsman, Deputy Ombudsman, Principal Investigator or Policy Manager.
We will let you know the outcome of the decision in writing – separate from any correspondence commencing a conciliation if we decide to handle the complaint further.
The review process is the same as the review you can ask for when we have turned down a reclassification request.

“John has significantly improved the quality of the documentation for our applications. Both the content and the presentation are leagues beyond where we started. He’s a good team member and works well with others. He also understands how to correct, pivot, and move to new understanding quickly. I always felt my time was well spent working with him.”
“I have seen John address our corporate body, which consists of more than 2,000 employees and executives. He conducts himself extremely professionally. He does his homework before going into a meeting and his organizational skills are spot on.”
“Mr. Clements demonstrates robust content knowledge in his subject area and is particularly passionate about language usage. He also effectively uses web-based teaching materials with his students and has been a welcomed resource for his colleagues.”
“John has displayed many professional attributes during projects that required a lot of changes. He showed excellent organizational and communication skills, as well as tenacity and attention to detail. What has also impressed me has been John’s creative ability to design solutions, as well as analyze and make recommendations for a “win-win” situation.”
“John was integral in establishing numerous communications processes, both internally and externally, for our worldwide efforts. He developed the reporting techniques and processes for internal communications and electronic media to a high quality. This was one of the key elements to Wings of Hope being nominated several times for the Nobel Peace Prize. He has been a valued member of this worldwide organization.”
“If John Clements doesn’t know the answer, he’ll find it on his dime not yours. He’s capable of being a full-service web provider yet flexible enough to empower you with the knowledge you need to run your own day-to-day web operations.”

Hey gang! How are you? I’ve just had an excellent week helping out at the Melbourne Writers Festival. How cool is my t-shirt and lanyard? Any fellow Melburnians, did you manage to get along? Are festivals your thing? I’ve been to the MWF the last few years and have heard some wonderfully entertaining and informative chats. When I saw the call for volunteers this year, I thought “why not?”
I had four shifts over the week. Two were full days with kids workshops in the morning and afternoon, one school group workshop, and the other was a session at my local library where Hannah Kent discussed her new book, The Good People. Gosh, she has a lovely speaking voice! It was interesting hearing her speak about her writing process – she writes from 7.30am to 2pm everyday, with defined breaks. She said she started this practice after she read that this was Sarah Waters’s writing routine. She figured that since Sarah was a writer of historical fiction maybe it would work for her too!
The workshops with the kids were great too. One of the nice things about these was that because they were small and pretty informal, we (me and my volunteer buddy for the day) had the chance to have a chat to the authors whilst we were wandering around and helping the kids with the activity.
My first session was with Asphyxia, author and illustrator of The Grimstones, a junior fiction series. She ran a creative art journalling workshop. She brought along some of her journals and, oh my, they were DIVINE! So inspiring! You can get a little taste of them here. The kids were totally focussed on creating their own journals. It was lovely seeing them working away so freely, without anyone judging their work and just embracing their creativity.
Ben McKenzie ran a games workshop based on Dungeons and Dragons. One session was for younger kids where they worked at creating their own story by themselves, or with their parents, and the second session was with older kids who worked in a group creating their game of rescuing their best friend from the monster they had created. Some of their ideas were very inventive. They had to create an obstacle that needed to be overcome before they could save their friend. One boy’s obstacle was a ‘meme wall’ because encountering the memes would be so distracting it would be impassable! I heard the same boy, with a big grin on his face, saying to his pal, “Do you think everyone here is a super geek?”!
One of my favourite authors is Maxine Beneba Clarke and I was lucky enough to score a place helping out at her workshop focussed around her new children’s book, The Patchwork Bike. She talked to the kids about how she came up with the idea for the book, how she thought about choosing her words, and how she chose the illustrator of the book, Van T Rudd. Van then helped the kids collage their own patchwork bike using cardboard, scraps of paper and textas. He chatted to the kids about how mistakes can be used to create different ideas and not to be scared of them.
Helping out with with these warmed the cockles of my heart! It was lovely to see the kids exploring their creativity with pens, paper, paints, pencils and words. And they were all super engaged without a piece of technology in sight!
Alice Pung’s school workshop was at the Immigration Museum and centred around identity. Are you shaped by where you come from? It skewed a little more to the assumptions others make about you because of the way you look, or your ethnicity or religion. She shared stories with the kids about how she has received comments that indicate she is assumed to be a mail order bride when she’s been out with her Caucasian hubby (“How much did she cost?”), and how as a kid she didn’t understand what some boys meant when she was told to ‘go home’ because ‘home’ was the Melbourne suburb of Braybrook, and her house was only thirty metres away! The kids who were attending were from a variety of schools – Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Catholic – and they shared some of their stories too. Lots of gasps and laughs as they told their stories.
I think one of my favourite moments was at the free Hannah Kent library session. A lady barrelled in, breathless, “I’ve just flown in from Sydney and my friend told me this session was on. I don’t have a booking but she said I should try and see if there was a space free.” We assured her there was and that she didn’t need to pay any money and her voice raised excitedly in pitch, “It’s free! Oh my goodness! And there’s tea inside!”. She was a joy!
Everyone was so lovely at the festival – the staff, the volunteers and the patrons (well, there was one grumpy one but think we managed to assuage her!). And the 10% off at the Readings pop up book shop was an added bonus – added The Choke and Ache to my reading pile! I’ll definitely be putting my hand up again next year!

Of course the up in canvas size meant I couldn't reuse any of those painstakingly-drawn shots of Sinciput without them being really small now, but I was already dedicated to not only not do that, but to even try out different angles. Look at panel 3! I had people just telling me to vary it up and dangit, they were right. It's varied.
There's consistency here with Riven not being offended by invasive medical examinations. Science is her friend. Also, her questioning the odd nature of how usual science applies to hybrids makes me think of any time in scifi when some creature's supposed to be hit by an evolution ray or something, and it's a hybrid. How's that gonna work?
We should all be very proud of Riven for actually escaping from something that's already deadly to normal shit AND hits her big weakness. I have noticed that machinery automatically shorting out when it gets wet seems to be a dead trope, but I assert that it should be replaced by just "if you remove the protective covering, THEN it can" sequences.
"I was 'advised' not to post this... Screw em," Owen wrote on Twitter shortly after 3PM ET Wednesday afternoon (Aug. 21), including the gruesome photo. He had the top part of his finger amputated on Monday morning (Aug. 19) before playing his No. 1 block party celebration on Music Row in Nashville.
NASCAR racer Clint Bowyer saw the picture and responded quickly, saying, "You're still a racing sum beeeech!!!!" Bowyer and Kevin Harvick were with Owen when he was involved in a go-kart accident in early July, which ultimately led to losing the tip of his right ring finger.
Originally, it was just bandaged -- the 'Days of Gold' singer had since returned to playing guitar. But soon, it became infected, and doctors recommended they take it off from the knuckle up.

While the debate about whether or not routine screening mammograms can save lives continues in some circles, the clinical research evidence supporting mammograms as a lifesaving cancer screening exam continues to accumulate. Now, a newly published public health study, which appears in The Lancet Oncology, examines the survival benefit associated with routine screening mammograms in women who have a family history of breast cancer.
In this large multicenter prospective clinical research study, which was performed in the UK, 6,710 women between the ages of 40 and 42 were enrolled in this study, and were followed for an average of about 4 years. These women, who had at least some family history of breast cancer, underwent annual screening mammograms as part of this clinical research study. This study used two important control groups to assess the impact of regular annual screening mammograms on the risk of mortality in these young women. The first control group consisted of women who were at average risk for breast cancer (these women, themselves, served as the control group for the enormous UK Age Trial, which included more than 106,000 patient volunteers, and which recently reported a 10-year follow-up of its results). The second control group, against which these 6,710 women with an intermediate familial risk of breast cancer were compared, included young women from another large public health study that was performed in the Netherlands.
Among the 136 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer during the relatively brief course of this ongoing study, 77 percent were diagnosed by screening mammography, while 21 percent were diagnosed when they presented with a new breast lump (or with other clinical signs or symptoms of breast cancer). (Another 2 percent of patients failed to attend their scheduled screening mammograms, and subsequently developed clinical signs or symptoms of breast cancer.)
In this study (and as other studies have shown, even among women who are at average risk of developing breast cancer), breast cancers that were detected by annual screening mammograms were significantly smaller in size, and significantly less likely to be associated with the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes. In addition to these very important breast cancer prognostic factors, women who were diagnosed with breast cancer as a result of annual screening mammograms had much less aggressive appearing tumors under the microscope when compared to women who were diagnosed with breast cancer only after a lump, or other signs of breast cancer, appeared.
Based upon the findings of this newly published study, young women with even an intermediate risk of breast cancer, based upon having one or more relatives with breast cancer, were 20 percent less likely to die within 10 years when compared with a poorly screened, or unscreened, average-risk population of young women. Moreover, this survival advantage appeared to be directly related to annual screening mammograms, once all other breast cancer risk factors among these three populations of women had been considered.
For a complete discussion of the compelling scientific evidence linking routine screening mammograms with a decreased risk of death due to breast cancer, please see the extended clinical section on breast cancer in my new book, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-associated death in the United States (and in many other countries around the world). Diet, obesity, and other lifestyle factors are known to play a significant role in colorectal cancer risk, as I discuss in detail in my new book, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, have been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, the majority of non-aspirin NSAIDs have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, and so these drugs are seldom used, today, for colorectal cancer prevention. (In most cases, their use for this purpose has become largely restricted to patients with inherited gene mutations that place them at extremely high risk for developing colorectal cancer.)
While high daily doses of aspirin have been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, this form of cancer prevention therapy also has significant risks, including serious GI tract bleeding and kidney damage. Until very recently, there has been very little high quality research data available regarding the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin therapy on colorectal cancer risk. Now, a newly published study in the prestigious journal, The Lancet, indicates that low-dose aspirin therapy can, indeed, significantly reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.
This report actually combines the long-term results from four large prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical research studies (the Swedish Aspirin Low Dose Trial, UK-TIA Aspirin Trial, the Thrombosis Prevention Trial, and the British Doctors Aspirin Trial). Altogether, a whopping 14,033 patient volunteers were studied in these research trials, and the average duration of patient follow-up was a very impressive 18.3 years.
Overall, the use of 75 milligrams (mg) of aspirin per day, for 5 years or longer, dramatically reduced the risk of cancer in the upper colon, by about 70 percent. While the incidence of lower colon cancer was not significantly reduced by low-dose aspirin therapy, the risk of rectal cancer was reduced by a very significant 42 percent. Moreover, increased daily doses of aspirin (above 75 mg) did not result in any further decrease in the risk of colon cancer or rectal cancer.
The findings of this very large clinical research study represent a very significant breakthrough in our understanding of the role of aspirin in colorectal cancer prevention and, especially, in the optimization of daily aspirin dosing to maximize this drug’s cancer prevention benefit while simultaneously reducing the known (and sometimes serious) adverse side effects of chronic aspirin therapy.
As always, I must remind readers that they should first consult with their doctor prior to beginning aspirin therapy, as some health conditions may be associated with an increased risk of severe side effects when taking aspirin.

Coffee and tea are widely enjoyed around the world, and both have been the subject of numerous health claims (most of them unproven). Tea, and green tea in particular, has been the focus of extensive research, with many prior studies suggesting that tea may improve cardiovascular health and, to a much lesser extent, may decrease the risk of some cancers. Much of the published research regarding coffee has, on the other hand, been focused on trying to disprove purported links between coffee consumption and a potential increase in the risk of some cancers. (Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of such research has not identified a strong link between moderate coffee consumption and an increased risk of cancer.)
The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study is a huge ongoing prospective multinational public health study, and several of this enormous study’s preliminary results have already been published. The EPIC study is focused on potential links between diet, nutritional status, lifestyle, and environmental factors and the incidence of cancer (among other chronic diseases). (EPIC is one of the largest studies of diet and health ever undertaken, and has already recruited 520,000 research volunteers in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.) Now, a new update from this historic public health study suggests that increased coffee and tea consumption may be associated with a decreased incidence of malignant brain tumors. This new update from the EPIC study appears in the current issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
Following an average duration of follow-up of nearly 9 years, 588 new cases of brain tumors were diagnosed among the EPIC research volunteers. Gliomas, the most common and most aggressive type of brain tumors that occur in adults, were found to be 34 percent less common among people who drank at least 100 milliliters (3.4 ounces) of coffee or tea per day. (Although not statistically significant, this association was also noted to be stronger in men, with a 41 percent lower risk of gliomas in men, as compared to a 26 percent reduction in glioma incidence in women.)
Although it is not clear what causes gliomas of the brain, prior public health studies have at least suggested a link between glioma brain tumors and chronic occupational exposure to high-intensity electrical and magnetic fields, and to rubber and plastics manufacturing. (As I discuss in “A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race, there is also some data linking prolonged cell phone use with an increased incidence of gliomas and other brain tumors.)
Other smaller public health studies have also identified an apparent link between increased caffeine intake and a decreased incidence of gliomas, and there is laboratory evidence available suggesting that caffeine may reduce the growth of malignant glioma cells growing in culture dishes. Thus, these new findings from the giant EPIC study further suggest the possibility that coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages might be able to reduce the risk of gliomas of the brain.

In the United States, approximately 106,000 people will be newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer in 2010, and nearly 50,000 people will die of this disease. Colorectal cancer remains the third most common cancer (excluding skin cancer) in both men and women, and the third most common cause of cancer death in men and women. Unlike many other types of cancer, an effective method of screening for colorectal cancer is available, in the form of colonoscopy. Fortunately, the incidence of this cancer has been gradually declining over the past 20 years, due in great part to the early detection, and removal, of precancerous polyps from the colon and rectum at the time of colonoscopy.
The links between specific lifestyle choices and the risk of developing certain types of cancer forms much of the basis of my new book, “A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race.” The risk of developing colorectal cancer, in particular, has been strongly linked to multiple dietary and other lifestyle factors. Now, a newly published public health research study from Denmark puts a number on the effectiveness of commonly recommended cancer prevention lifestyle strategies in preventing colorectal cancer.
In this study, which appears in the current issue of the British Medical Journal, 55,487 men and women between the ages of 50 and 64 were prospectively followed for an average of 10 years. Each of these Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort Study volunteers completed validated surveys regarding their social status, health status, reproductive history, and daily lifestyle habits. They also completed a food frequency questionnaire that included, among its 193 items, foods known to be associated with colorectal cancer risk (including alcohol). All study participants also underwent physical examinations that included measurements of their height, weight, and waist circumference. During the course of this large prospective public health study, 678 participants were newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer.
All study volunteers were assessed in terms of 5 modifiable lifestyle and dietary factors that have repeatedly been linked to a reduction in colorectal cancer risk: Increased levels of regular physical activity, avoidance of obesity, abstention from tobacco use, minimal intake of alcohol, and the observance of healthy diet habits (including increased fiber intake, decreased dietary fat content, decreased red meat and processed meat consumption, and increased fresh fruit and vegetable intake). Based upon only these 5 simple colorectal cancer risk factors, the adoption of any one of these 5 colorectal cancer prevention factors was associated with a 13 percent decrease in the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Among participants who generally observed all 5 lifestyle and dietary prevention factors, the risk of developing colorectal cancer was reduced by 23 percent. (Of note, while this observed reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer was noted for both colon cancer and rectal cancer, this finding was only statistically significant for cancer of the colon, specifically.)
The results of this large prospectively conducted public health study reaffirm the findings of previous studies, in that the risk of colorectal cancer can be significantly reduced by: Engaging in regular moderate exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, avoiding tobacco use, minimizing alcohol consumption, and by reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats and fat, while simultaneously increasing the consumption of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and whole grain foods.

So I’ve decided to try and build Q (QEMU) on my Intel Mac - so I need subversion, using these instructions on how to build subversion on a mac.
How do you like that the build instructions actually work! The svn site for Transmission rejected my requests, so I downloaded the current sources from the Transmission homepage.
It might be fun to tweak some optimization flags for building Q, but I should probably go to sleep instead! The 0.9.0 build of Q does feel zippier though. :-)

Does anybody know who this Dodger is? Bob Lemke shares a bunch of vintage photos featuring ballplayers in Native-American garb; including one pic of a 1950's Dodger prospect named 'Bing' Martin - Bob can't find any information on him. Check it out here.
I firmly believe all the 'rumors' about Russell Martin coming to the Dodgers to be a bunch of bunk. You should not believe a word of it. His agent is using the Dodger name to drive up the price. From what I understand, he is seeking a 5-year deal worth $75Mil to $80Mil. That alone would take us out of the running. A cost/benefit analysis tells me that signing him would not be worth it.
Via Boston Globe reporter Nick Cafardo on twitter, we have added a couple more folks to the scouting staff:
red sox have lost pro scout Galen Carr and director of player personnel David Finley to the Dodgers.
Via Gabe Kapler on his personal website Kaplifestyle, "Working Smart: Speed and Power." Gabe suggest that endurance training makes no sense for Baseball players.
While my mentor was correct that strengthening the heart muscle is good for us as human beings, he was off with his assessment that the training makes sense for baseball players. The longest distance we will ever run on a baseball field is 360 feet, perhaps a few more if we factor in angles on the rare inside the park home run. As an outfielder, if I’m manning center field and run from gap to gap, north or south or a combo of the two, my distance will never be longer than 100 feet in any direction. If I was a cross country runner training for a 5 mile race, would I train by sprinting 35 yard blasts? Of course not. So, as baseball players, why do we seek out training that’s actually breaking us down?
Endurance training has also been shown to decrease muscle fiber size, muscle strength, and muscle power, all of which are detrimental to a baseball athlete (4).
I don't know why I found this hilarious. Matt F. at Heartbreaking Cards of Staggering Genius, "Free's The Finest: Mike Piazza Edition."
Via Jon Heyman at CBS Sports, "Crawford, Ethier most logical to go as Dodgers try to pare crowed OF."
Now, a word about No. 1. It came down to two people—Babe Ruth and Jackie Robinson—who ascended above everyone else for reasons about which you soon will read. But choosing between them for the top spot was an excruciating decision, extending beyond baseball to the United States at large. In fact, it was only after recognizing the breadth of the argument that we finally chose Ruth.

Little Bulgaria is so easily dismissed by its neighbours and by the European Union, who reluctantly admitted the country some five years ago.
Oh yes: corruption and maffia are present in 21st century Bulgaria. But is that the SOUL of the Bulgarian people?
No: the soul of Bulgaria as I have learnt to understand it, is the Renaissance of its language, its art and its economy at the end of the nineteenth century. Against the Osmanic oppression, with help of the army of the Russian Czar and under severe scrutiny of the European great powers of the moment. Austrians, English, Germans and French.
Like everywhere in the Balkans, borders are vague and undefined. Many bulgar-speaking people lived and live in northern Greece, Macedonia, Western Turkey, southern Romania and Serbia. Territory, language, nation - they do not coincide.
First of all. Everybody, except the Russians themselves, wants to block the Russians from having an open exit to the Mediterranian. A russophile Bulgaria is to be kept as far as possible from the Aegean Sea. Turks, Romanians, Serbs and Greeks enjoy temporary or systematical support from world powers, while Bulgarians are missing all too often the right alliance.
But the Bulgarian awakening has been strong enough, to forge a nation, an economy and arts. The image above shows one of those founding fathers of the Bulgarian nation: Petr Beron. At first sight, not an easy-going lad.
Those freemasons were at the roots of an efficient school system, developed an agro-industrial economy and fought each other relentlessly.
Somehow, in the first third of the twentieth century, the country got so well launched, that it did not suffer from the world crisis. The "Bulgarian Miracle" was born.
After 50 years of Soviet-style government, twenty years have not been sufficient for a new leap forward. After a massive emigration to the West, an empty countryside exists alongside ailing cities plus the Sofia megacity.
Nevertheless, many advantages are waiting to be exploited. Agriculture, commercial crossroads, a rich historical heritage and summer plus winter tourism, agro-industry: you name it.
The European Union should more actively help developing those advantages. That is the best way to help eliminate robber capitalism and crime. Policing is OK, but not enough.

Based on the international blockbuster film by executive producer Steven Spielberg and the first of his films to be adapted for television, Minority Report follows the unlikely partnership between a man haunted by the future and a cop haunted by her past, as they race to stop the worst crimes of the year 2065 before they happen.
Set in Washington, D.C., it is 10 years after the demise of Precrime, a law enforcement agency tasked with identifying and eliminating criminals…before their crimes were committed. To carry out this brand of justice, the agency used three precogs – "precognitives" Dash, Arthur and Agatha – who were able to see the future. Now, in 2065, crime-solving is different, and justice leans more on sophisticated and trusted technology than on the instincts of the precogs.
10 years after the end of Precrime in Washington DC one of the three PreCogs attempts to lead on a normal life while still suffering from visions of the future. Will they be able to hold it together or mentally breakdown and give up?

Traditional surgery requires all of the above and there is an increased risk of infections as a patient is under general anesthetic for several hours. This procedure also leaves behind, scars on your body which will stay with you for lifetime. Non-invasive procedures like body sculpting does not entail these risks. Plus, you can select which part of the body you like to tone down to that perfect shape.
Now here are a couple more facts: We all have many billions of fat cells. In fact, the number of fat cells that we have, and the distribution of those cells are both pretty much fixed from very early in life (around one year in age). The reason that different people have different shapes is that their fat cells are distributed differently. The woman with disproportionately wide outer thighs has more fat cells in that area, and therefore she perceives it as a stubborn disproportion. One man may have a relative ‘hill’ of fat cells under his chin; another in his love handles, and so on.
CoolSculpting, launched in the US in 2010, is a technology-based system which basically freezes fat cells away. As discussed above, when we gain and lose weight, our fat cells basically grow and shrink, but our proportions pretty much stay the same. CoolSculpting is revolutionary in that it lets you target your stubborn fat with “spot treatment.” That means the fat comes off where you want it too. And for the first time, safe and effective spot reduction of fatty bulges can be performed noninvasively, and with no downtime.

During opening week, Friend #1 was our pioneer in testing out the gym. On his much anticipated return, his report was not entirely satisfactory. "It's quite good, but it does have the feel of a correctional facility." Not a great account, but I remained hopeful. Perhaps this merely revealed more about Friend #1's chequered past rather than the quality of Pure Gym.

"People who lose 100 pounds or more feel healthier, they know they are healthier, they can do things they could not do before.

SHITBOX Rally 2016 will be taking a new route through the valleys, mountains and open plains to discover for the first time ever in the rally’s history, Bass Strait and Tasmania.
Four hundred and fifty participants will take in the rugged and challenging landscapes of Australia, all to raise awareness and funds for cancer research.
The rally route, first organised by Adelaide’s James Freeman in 2010 after losing both his parents to cancer, changes every year. Last year participants tackled the Birdsville Track on its way to North Queensland, while this year teams will kick off their adventure from Australia’s sugar capital, tropical Mackay in mid-north Queensland, touring south through the Australian outback, several states and small country towns to eventually arrive in Hobart, southern Tasmania a week later.
Alongside quintessential Australian sights, the rally in 2016 will also include two new milestones for the event – a ‘Shipbox Rally’ leg, that is, for the first time ever in the rally’s history teams will be crossing the tumultuous seas of Bass Strait by ferry; and for the first time, Tasmania and its unique wilderness will provide a backdrop of lush fields and alpine forests in contrast to the dirty and dusty outback roads Shitbox Rally often passes through. For James Freeman, founder of the rallies, the Tasmanian wilderness with its untamed beauty has long been calling.
“This is the 7th year of Shitbox Rally with another route that crosses the country. I have seen more of Australia than most and I know I have only scratched the surface. Even with six years behind us, this year will still be unique with all new stopovers plus travelling through the Victorian high country, the crossing of Bass Straight and the drive through Tasmania. It is promising to be another spectacular year and I can’t wait to get back to my second home – the remote outback roads of this sunburnt country,” James Freeman said.
Starting in Mackay on May 7, the 200 shitboxes will travel 3500km down the length of Australia to Blackall QLD (proud-owner of the historic Blackall Woolscour the only fully intact steam-powered wool washing plant left in Australia),Thargomindah QLD (on the edge of far western Queensland’s desert areas and home to Australia’s first hydro-electricity scheme), Tilpa NSW (on the banks of the Darling River, famous for its true outback Tilpa Pub and infamous for its bushranger heritage), Cootamundra NSW (birthplace of cricket’s greatest batsman, Sir Donald Bradman), Dargo VIC (one of Victoria’s most remote towns, in the high country of the Alpine National Park), the modern, sunny bayside suburb of Port Melbourne VIC, and overnight to Devonport TAS, Tasmania’s busy coastal city and the gateway to some of the state’s best natural treasures including Cradle Mountain, before crossing the finish line in the state’s capital, Hobart.
Shitbox Rally is not a race but rather a challenge to achieve the unthinkable: to drive cars worth $1000 or less across Australia via some of its most arduous roads — all to raise money for cancer research. The rally was founded in 2009 by James Freeman after both of his parents died from cancer within 12 months of each other as a way of raising money and awareness in the fight against cancer – a disease that now affects so many people. Over the past four years, Shitbox Rally has raised over $6.1 million for cancer research, making the rally the largest independent fundraiser for the Cancer Council.
The rally is a reward for all the fundraising the dedicated participants do to help find a cure for cancer and it’s a chance to meet like-minded people and see our vast and beautiful country in a totally unique way. To qualify to be in Shitbox Rally, supporters must have raised a minimum of $4000.
This year marks the 17th Shitbox Rally. Previous rally routes include 2015 Canberra to Townsville via the Birdsville Track, 2014 Perth to Darwin via the Gibb River Road, 2013 Adelaide to Fremantle via Uluru, 2012 Melbourne to Cairns via Innamincka, 2011 Brisbane to Darwin via the Savannah Way and 2010 Sydney to Alice Springs via the Oodnadatta Track.For more details please visit www.shitboxrally.com.au.
Shitbox Rally is expanding globally with the first international destination confirmed as New Zealand, in February 2016. To register for 2016 Shitbox Rally New Zealand, or to find out more information, visit www.shitboxrally.co.nz.
An additional $798,000 has also been raised for Cancer Council Australia over the past three years of Mystery Box Rally, a similar concept also created by James Freeman. Known as Shitbox Rally’s mad baby brother, Mystery Box is more of a boutique rally with fewer teams, a shorter distance and less days travelling. Unlike Shitbox Rally, this rally takes care of finding the cars and each location is a mystery, adding to the excitement and adventure of the drive. For more information please visit www.mystery-box.com.au.
This week was crazy and busy. I prepared all week for a girls retreat for Pitcairn Assembly of God's youth group. On my day off I got to see Lorie and Holli. I needed that. Anyway, the hard work paid off. Kori and I went to Pitcairn on Friday night. We met a great bunch of girls. It was awesome to be a part of what hopefully will be something that will be life changing for these girls. I loved watching Kori let God use her. She is going to great things for God. I am so proud of her!

Hopefully the link works… this is my newest throwing video, the one that I will be using for my #JailhouseArtDemo 🙂 in the video I am “throwing” a cup on the potters wheel. Of course I’m using porcelain 🙂 I’ve decided the best way to do the art demonstration in a jail setting is to show multiple videos of me working in my studio, rather than trying to get all of my sharp pointy tools approved by the sheriff. So here goes! If the link doesn’t work I’ll delete and try again.
I am a potter-- I love to draw, play guitar, cook yummy food... and just have fun in general. I love to make a difference with my work, even something as small as inspiring a fellow artist :)

With Christmas and Holiday time approaching, and CIA bossmen Spinback & Quiff as per usual, but especially now, overflowing with joy and goodwill to all men, women and sentient beings, it seemed a pertinent time for the next release in their ‘Select Files’ series, this time seeing Volume 3 peeking its head above the parapet.
As with the previous outings in this series, the compilation is made up of choice cuts from the CIA and Deepkut catalogue, but Volume 3 also sees the addition of a brand new exclusive cut from the Total Science men themselves.
It stands proudly next to killer classic cuts from a whole range of drum and bass household names such as Calibre, Lenzman, Break, Marcus Intalex, Bad Company, Digital, Spirit, Zero T & Alix Perez, Random Movement, Nymfo, Q Project, S.P.Y and Total Science themselves, to name them all.
That’s quite a collection of some pretty bloody good tracks really, so do yourself and your local elf sorting office a favour and go put it in someone’s stockings or your own hold-ups, whatever takes your fancy!

In 2015, the Federal Trade Commission released their new rules for Disclosure Compliance. These rules are set in place to ensure that readers or viewers of web media (blogs, Youtube videos, etc.) know if the blogger/presenter is sponsored, endorsed, or partnered with a different company. In blog terms, the readers need to know if the blogger is making money by sharing a link or product.
In compliance with the FTC guidelines, please assume the following about links and posts on this site: Any/all of the links Kirby’s Korner Blog are affiliate links of which I receive a small compensation from sales of certain items.
Purchases are made on external affiliate company websites: When a reader clicks on an affiliate link located on .com to purchase an item, the reader buys the item from the seller directly (not from Kirby’s Korner Blog​). Amazon and/or other companies pay Kirby’s Korner Blog a small commission or other compensation for promoting their website or products through their affiliate program.
Prices are exactly the same for you if your purchase is through an affiliate link or a non-affiliate link. You will not pay more by clicking through to the link.
Kirby’s Korner Blog is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon properties including, but not limited to, amazon.com. Amazon offers a small commission on products sold through their affiliate links. Each of your purchases via our Amazon affiliation links supports our cause at no additional cost to you.
If a blogger links to an Amazon product (with a special code for affiliates embedded in the link), and a reader places an item in their “shopping cart” through that link within 24 hours of clicking the link, the blogger gets a small percentage of the sale. Amazon links are not “pay per click.” If you click on the product link and stay around Amazon and purchase something else, however, I will get commission on that sale.
Anytime you see a link that looks like astore.com/… or amazon.com… it can be assumed that it is an Amazon affiliate link.
These affiliate links work the same way: if you click the link and buy the product, then the blogger gets a percentage of the sale or some other type of compensation. Things like e-book bundles, e-courses, and online packages are usually affiliate links, as well. Again, prices are not different if you use these affiliate links. You will not pay more by clicking through to the link. These links are not “pay per click”, unless otherwise denoted.
I do not normally write sponsored posts. I want to bring you real, unbiased information. However, if a post is sponsored by a company and it is a paid sponsorship, I will disclose this clearly in the beginning of the post.
I am hoping that in time I will offer be able to offer some of our own products. You can also check under the ebooks tab for products that we currently have available.
I finally finished putting together our next unit study. The kids had a lot of requests but I think I managed to cover them all! Check it out here: https://kirbyskorner.site/2018/11/06/little-house-on-the-prairie-adventure-weekly-guide-links/ #homeschool #littlehouseontheprairie #unitstudy #blogger #blogger #mom #specialneeds
First and foremost, I am a daughter of the King. I am also a proud (square dancing) Momma of 9 precious kiddos! I thank God for each and everyday He has given me and for the days ahead. I know we are not promised tomorrow and we need to cherish every minute of everyday we have here. We need to hold our loved ones close and make sure they know how much we love them and care for them. I have been through a lot in my time here on earth and I know God is preparing me for a bigger plan. I do not know what His plan is for me and sometimes I don't understand. I know that I must keep my eyes on Him and keep my faith in His promises. I am not perfect and I do not pretend to be. I am sinner saved by grace and I just want to bring honor and glory to His name. I pray that my blog will help to inspire others and that they may find hope and encouragement in knowing they are not alone in their battles. Let us each strive to be a light to others in their darkness. That our light may lead others to Him and cause others to come to know Him. I pray that everyone who reads this may be touched by His loving hand and receive Him so that they may also be heirs to His glorious kingdom.
I’ve been asked this question countless times whether at my job or in everyday life. Time and time again I’ve had to say “No, I don’t have any yet” with such a feeling of sadness.
After we got licensed as foster parents I kept imagining where I would be and what I’d be doing when I got the call for a child to be placed with us. Would it be on Thanksgiving? At the Christmas tree farm? Would I be working? Or at home? I also kept imagining what his or her little face would look like.
Never did I imagine we’d get an almost one year old little boy! And from another foster family at that! The love he was given from that family has given him the start he deserved in his first month of life, but sadly didn’t get.
Even so, I wouldn’t want it any other way. The past week has been a huge adjustment both for us and little man. We’re tired. I caught a cold. Tay and I always talk in whispers while he’s sleeping. We have already seen him get more steady at standing on his own and even take his first 2 baby steps. I love every bit of this. It’s all worth it to give him the love and security he desperately needs– he’s been through so much in his short life so far.
We know this isn’t permanent. We may not end up having the opportunity to adopt him. We keep saying, “We will love him for however long we have him.” If he leaves us, a little piece of me will go with him. That’s the hard part about all of this. No matter what, though, we will trust in God for his plan to unfold for us and this little guy.
For the past two years we’ve wanted a family of our own. Someone who we could share our love with and never think twice about it. The first night when he was brought to our home, Taylor’s family was here. While in the kitchen making dinner, Tay’s brother was holding little man while Tay’s mom was playing peek-a-boo behind his back. All I heard was little man’s laughter and giggles filling up the room. I instantly started to well up with tears and had to hold them back. So much information and emotions were processed that evening and it all hit me in that moment. I thought to myself: This is what I’ve been longing for.
Yesterday I was at Kroger buying a birthday cake for him as he just turned one on Thursday. I was talking with a woman who was telling me about a Christmas event at our town’s community center. She asked me that same old question: Do you have kids? My reply with confidence: Yes, yes I do.
He may not look like us and he may only be with us for a season, but I have a son with my husband who we love. I am a mother. He is my baby. God is faithful.

The main thing that comes to mind when you think of Rug Doctor is likely their big bulky machine. It’s the machine you can usually rent from supermarkets and generally has a much more professional feel to it. But what Rug Doctor have done is condense that professional machine into something much more portable and far more convenient to use.
This machine isn’t exactly ideal if you have a very large area to clean, but for the odd stain dotted around the carpet, or even your rugs, it really is ideal.
I understand that the Rug Doctor Portable Spot Cleaner isn’t something that is going to have a massive appeal to a large number of people. Retailing at £150 this just isn’t going to be for everyone. If you’re serious about your cleaning then I would highly recommend it.
All in all, this is a fantastic machine to use if you really want to give your rugs or carpet a very deep clean. It’s pretty foolproof in how easy it is to use and you only have to look at the water by the end of it to see how effective it really is.
If you want to watch a full video review of the Rug Doctor Portable Spot Cleaner, then you can do so via our YouTube channel here:
If you don’t want to splash out and give your carpets a really good deep clean, then Rug Doctor have plenty of other products on the market that also do a rather good job.
Altogether we’ve been using the High Foot Traffic Cleaner, the Oxy Power Stain Remover and the Spot and Stain Wipes.
Now that we’re entering the autumn period muddy foot prints are going to get a lot more regular. Especially if people don’t like taking their shoes off when they come in your house. So having something like the high foot traffic cleaner is going to come in handy.
We conveniently allowed our toddler to play out in the mud before letting her to walk right across the rug. I then got to work using get the high foot traffic cleaner and it worked rather well.
I will admit that it does say that this is a pre-treatment to the Rug Doctor machine, but I used it without the aid of the machine to get these results. Suffice to say, it works just fine without using the spot cleaner.
This is something you might want to use if you’ve had a bit of a rough night and split a good amount of wine and curry. It’s very easy to use and is actually a rather lazy product if you fancy skipping on doing a lot of the elbow grease. You just shake and spray and leave it to sink into the stain for a few minutes. Come back and then start rubbing the stain out with a damp cloth.
These are basically baby wipes on steroids. If you’re anything like me then the vast majority of spills get cleaned up with baby wipes. When you become a parent baby wipes just become your go-to for almost everything. You tend to have enough lying around that you may as well use them. But these are a lot more effective at tackling stains than baby wipes are. I will admit that I prefer the oxy power stain remover as the bottle does most of the work for you. But these aren’t a bad alternative.
You can check out all that Rug Doctor has on offer via their online store. Alternatively, their cleaning range can be picked up in most major supermarkets and other online retailers.

If you are planning a trip, maybe you need to find affordable passport pictures near Cambridge MA. That might seem challenging, but with the right passport photo service, it does not have to be. Just make sure you use a service you can trust. Plenty of places will do passport photographs, after all, but you want to save money and still get photographs that you could really use. After all, there’s hardly any point in saving money if you end up with pictures that nobody will accept on a passport. Luckily, however, there’s now a passport photos option available on the market that is taken by a large number of states all over the world, and which is also extremely affordable.
MyPassportPhotos is altering the manner that adventurers around the world take their passport photos, by offering a service that is both widely accepted by countries around the world and highly affordable. This combination of affordability and convenience makes it an attractive choice for folks of all kinds who are serious about locating the greatest potential passport photograph without spending exorbitant amounts of cash or running into time-wasting hassles at a traditional passport photographs service.
The idea of getting your passport photographs online is catching on nowadays. In fact, it’s a really efficient way to ensure that you just don’t run into any of the long lines or other issues that folks routinely encounter when attempting to get a passport photograph through more conventional means. Online purchasing allows you to take your passport pictures right in the comfort and convenience of your home, before picking them up from any amount of readily reachable and expedient places near you. Using new technology in this manner makes getting your passport photograph a smooth and painless experience. That’s not the only advantage to getting your passport through an online service for example MyPassportPhotos, either. In reality, there are loads of other reasons why using MyPassportPhotos is probably your best option the next time you desire a great passport photograph.
MyPassportPhotos isn’t just a time saver. It’s also significantly more affordable than other passport photo services, which can help you to save money too. Most physical passport photograph services are usually pricier than online photo options, which means that they cost you money you could be using on your own excursion. Why on Earth would you need to use cash that could be going towards exotic meals or souvenirs for a picture in your home country which you could take for far less? The most significant thing about a passport photo should be that it meets required standards, but affordability should be a close second on that list. Luckily, MyPassportPhotos is a amazing means for you to meet all of that standards—a tremendously functional passport photograph at a record-breaking price.
Not every passport photo that you buy will serve you around the world. The truth is, unless the person taking your photograph has particular knowledge of the requirements different countries have for passports, the picture they shoot for you could be seriously restricted regarding its global use. MyPassportPhotos, nevertheless, is guaranteed to work in a variety of nations all over the world, making it considerably more serviceable than passport photographs offered by competing local services. Many local passport photograph services will probably be unfamiliar with the photo requirements for different countries, and will just have the ability to provide photos that meet the standards of the state in which they are based. This can be a real issue for you if you happen to be traveling in a foreign land and your passport expires, since it may be hard to find anyone who understands the demands of your country of origin.
Luckily, MyPassportPhotos makes sure to give you pictures that meet the standards for many nations all over the world. The following nations are all guaranteed to accept photos from MyPassportPhoto: Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Schengen, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom and Vietnam.
With all these countries guaranteed to take pictures from MyPassportPhotos, you’ll have trouble locating a more practical method to have your passport photographs shot. This fact alone should make MyPassportPhotos a clear choice for quality passport photographs, whether you are in Canada or Cambodia.
Since MyPassportPhotos is so powerful and well-priced, you are likely wondering how you can acquire it in your area. That’s the beauty of doing it online, though. All you need is a place to pick up your photos. Since many popular shops all work with MyPassportPhotos, though, getting your photographs is a wind.
These shops are all places in Cambridge MA where you can readily get your photos from MyPassportPhotos printed: CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart. All you have to do is pick the shuts shop near you in the Program. Here are other places in Cambridge MA that offer passport photographs also: Duane Reade, Kinos, the UPS Store, Meijer, Costco, Sam’s Club, Photo Booths, US Post Office (USPS), AAA and FedEx.
MyPassportPhotos offers tourists, business travelers and explorers a convenient and highly affordable way to get passport photographs that are guaranteed to be taken in a significant variety of dominant countries around the world. That makes it a more suitable, more cost effective and much more successful method of taking passport photographs than most alternatives available out there nowadays. If you are seriously interested in planning your next trip, do not take risks with your passport photo. Find a spot near you where you are able to print photos from MyPassportPhotos, and make sure you’re revealing your best face to the world by ordering your next passport pictures at your convenience through MyPassportPhotos.

“I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.”
“When you find your path, you must not be afraid. You need to have sufficient courage to make mistakes. Disappointment, defeat, and despair are the tools God uses to show us the way.”
“If people refuse to look at you in a new light and they can only see you for what you were, only see you for the mistakes you've made, if they don't realize that you are not your mistakes, then they have to go.”
“Well, we all make mistakes, dear, so just put it behind you. We should regret our mistakes and learn from them, but never carry them forward into the future with us.”
“It was one thing to make a mistake; it was another thing to keep making it. I knew what happened when you let yourself get close to someone, when you started to believe they loved you: you'd be disappointed. Depend on someone, and you might as well admit you're going to be crushed, because when you really needed them, they wouldn't be there. Either that, or you'd confide in them and you added to their problems. All you ever really had was yourself, and that sort of sucked if you were less than reliable.”
“It is unwise to be too sure of one's own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.”
“Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.”
“Some mistakes... Just have greater consequences than others. But you don't have to let the result of one mistake be the thing that defines you. You, Clark, have the choice not to let that happen.”
“We all make mistakes, have struggles, and even regret things in our past. But you are not your mistakes, you are not your struggles, and you are here NOW with the power to shape your day and your future.”
“We are all mistaken sometimes; sometimes we do wrong things, things that have bad consequences. But it does not mean we are evil, or that we cannot be trusted ever afterward.”
“Smart people learn from their mistakes. But the real sharp ones learn from the mistakes of others.”
“I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being--forgive me--rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.”
“It is important that we forgive ourselves for making mistakes. We need to learn from our errors and move on.”
“I have learned all kinds of things from my many mistakes. The one thing I never learn is to stop making them.”
When you start living the life of your dreams, there will always be obstacles, doubters, mistakes and setbacks along the way. But with hard work, perseverance and self-belief there is no limit to what you can achieve.”
“All men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride.”
“Don't confuse poor decision-making with destiny. Own your mistakes. It’s ok; we all make them. Learn from them so they can empower you!”

Someone had their camera out at the right time this Wednesday, and captured the moment that a man yelling obscenities was arrested at Miami International Airport.
Miami-Dade Aviation Department spokesman Greg Chin said the man in the video was making threats against the airport at the Concourse D check-in area.
According to witnesses, the man tried to attack a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent and also tried to enter an employees-only baggage area.
At least six Miami-Dade police officers had to hold the suspect down as he screamed and cursed at them.
The suspect's hands and feet were bound as he was detained. He was screaming hysterical remarks at the time.

The Kenora Borealis Multisport was formed a good 10+ years ago, when a group of like-minded friends began training together for running, swimming and cycling events.
Zombies being so hot right now, there’s a whole group of us in the neighborhood who get together and watch “Walking Dead”. It mostly consists of us just shouting at the tv, hoping the child character Carl gets eaten. So this is one zombie party…
An image also emerged early on, kind of a lampoon-ish surfer movie with the undead partying at a pool, bits of limbs and fluids getting everywhere, a nasty hilarious mess… so this was another zombie party.
Somewhere, somehow along the way, these images prompted me into writing over a pretty basic surf beat, and the rest unfolded in a bizarre fashion.
The song itself is a frankenstein of a composition, with half of the A section melody in one key, half perhaps in another, with two beats lopped off in between phrases. The bridge in between goes from an expected start to a long term ramble across some surprising harmony.
The song begins with a shambling mass of zombies approaching. Then the melody, and I became clever with the horn lines, adding lots of contrary motion within the harmony lines. Two brief horn assaults follow, Greg, then Peter, then Robby gets the bridge while the horns sweep back and forth in harmony. Jacob follows with a sputtering statement, like some ghoul coughing out it life jelly. Two sections of guitar solo, and then the track takes you out with the bridge melody, one final A section, and a moment for Marlon to destroy the drums.

I cannot put in words how nervous & excited I am to be writing my first book review. Round and Round The Crochet Hook by Emily Littlefair is the newest edition to my small but growing craft library. In the short duration that I have had my hands on this book, it has become a favourite.
Emily has done such a superb job of creating this collection of beautiful crochet patterns that are intricate yet so easy to make, thanks to the detailed instructions and charts. She has gone to such great length in writing all the patterns. You will find pattern notes, special stitches listed out for each of the 18 amazing patterns in this book.
I had such a tough time deciding what pattern to make first. I also spent an awful lot of time thinking, is this the right yarn for this mandala? Is this the right colour for this pattern? But guess what? Any colour, any yarn I picked up worked perfectly with the designs that are there in this book.
The first pattern I settled on (after much deliberation), was the Dancing Around in Circles Mandala. It is such a beautiful design. It is simple yet so elegant. I was planning on gifting this to a colleague at work for Christmas but I think I’m going to hold on to it!! It’s just too pretty to part with!! And it gives me a reason to make another one!!! Oo but what colours do I chose this time? May be grey…or off white with a mint green border!! Sorry, what was I saying? I started day-dreaming dream-crocheting for a bit there!!! The struggle is real people!!! 🙂
The second pattern that I made was much easier to choose. I knew I had to make it the minute I saw it. It’s the fabulous Flower Patch Cushion. It is such a great pattern with so much texture that I just couldn’t stop touching those tiny bobbles the whole time I was making it and then a for quite a bit afterwards as well. But there was a small hiccup. I didn’t have a cushion insert!!! So I turned this cute little pattern into another mandala. This is going to be a little gift for the Mother-ship when I visit her next year in April! 🙂
I have also spent an obscene amount of time just flicking through the various mandala, blanket, coaster, cushion, wall hanging patterns that are in this book. Emily and Tuva publishing have done such a fab job photographing this book. It is so aesthetically pleasing that you just have to stop and admire the beautiful pictures and super detailed charts. Even the most intricate and elaborate design Winnie’s Wonderland Blanket is charted to the last little detail.
So if you looking for a gift idea for a crochet lover or if you are that crochet lover, I would highly recommend getting this book. It’s a very good book to have in your repertoire when the need arises to make something that is beautiful, elegant, modern and will be cherished for a long time to come.
This poor little thing has been hanging in my dining room for the last several months (could very well be a year...but who’s counting 🤷🏽‍♀️) without having the ends tucked in!! Please tell me there are others out there who hate weaving in ends as much as I do!!! 🤗🤣✨

When a blast from the railroad hurled a large rock through the roof of his ramshackle house in Spokane, Franz Klepsch was having dinner. The rock landed on him, and he died from his injuries two weeks later.
Franz was my great-great-grandfather, a man from Františkov nad Ploučnicí, Bohemia, who went to America with his wife, Theresa, in 1866, settling first in Wisconsin, then in Sioux City, Iowa, where he built the Iowa House hotel.
Fortune was fickle with Franz: The Sioux City Journal called him an “unlucky rattler” after his hotel burned down in 1884, while fervent Protestant prohibitionist newspapers (see 17 Feb. 1887 Milwaukee Sentinel) dismissed him as a member of the “rebellious German saloon element.” So the Roman Catholic Franz and Theresa headed west, hoping for better times that were not to come.
In Spokane in 1891, Franz was working as a plasterer. His accident was the direct consequence of Daniel Chase Corbin’s decision to build a new railroad near the Klepsch’s home, without placing trees and other heavy materials on top of the blast area to save time and money, safety measures be damned.
Corbin could well have jumped out of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. Rand’s titans of American industry sprang entirely from her imagination as superior beings who created most of society’s value with their business skills. Flouting conventional social mores, they sometimes broke marital vows to couple with other titans, for such social conventions, like government regulations, were more appropriate for the little people. Almost single-handedly they moved the economy forward, building new railroad lines with new types of steel. The novel describes how America’s Lilliputians, government bureaucrats and crowds of ordinary slackers, tried to ensnare Taggart Transcontinental railroad and other businesses in a regulatory morass or mooch off of their owners’ hard work.
As one Corbin biographer notes, his company “built the Spokane Falls & Idaho Railroad and the Coeur d'Alene Railway & Navigation Company,” connected them to nearby Idaho’s lead and silver mining districts and established Spokane as a railroad center in the Inland Northwest. After selling that line to the Northern Pacific in 1888, his company built new railroads and in 1899 created the Spokane Valley Land and Water Company, the Spokane Valley’s first irrigation project. The Spokane Chamber of Commerce elected him its first honorary member in 1915. (See Laura Arksey’s Essay On Corbin.)
Like many of Rand’s titans, Daniel Chase Corbin found conventional social mores constraining. His wife decamped from Spokane in her late 30s to live with their children in Europe for almost twenty years. After she died, Corbin married his much younger Swedish house maid.
Of course, Corbin actually walked the earth. Census counters found him, registered his vital statistics, enumerated his children and listed him among the citizens of the United States, each one equal before the law. Unlike Rand’s self-made, independent business titans, the flesh and blood Corbin basked in his children’s ability to climb the social ladder, with his daughters marrying British nobility and his son attending Harvard Law School.
”Be polite to your equals, kind to your inferiors, and always honest and true,” he inscribed in his daughter’s commonplace book, a collection of notes and jottings.
Franz and Theresa, my great-great grandparents, were clearly Corbin’s inferiors. What had they, after all, achieved? What did they do to create Washington’s Inland Empire?
As far as Corbin was concerned, kindness to his inferiors didn’t include compensating Theresa for the loss of her husband and sole family breadwinner: handouts, after all, only undermine the desire of little people to work for their living. The Social Security system didn’t exist yet, either, so Theresa couldn’t claim any survivor’s benefits. In January 1891, widowed with three minor children in her care, she filed suit in the Spokane court for compensation for her husband’s death.
Being sued by a nobody upset Spokane’s wealthiest citizen, and he had his lawyers doggedly fought the case. First, they claimed that Corbin’s company hadn’t caused Franz’s death, for it had outsourced the work to private contractors. The court rejected that argument, noting that it would be too easy for companies to avoid financial responsibility by using contractors for their most dangerous work. Second, Corbin’s lawyers argued that Franz was living on railroad land illegally as a squatter. After considerable testimony, this, too, was rejected, and in July 1891 the jury sided with Theresa.
Corbin’s lawyers appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, claiming no negligence was shown, and that court ordered the lower court to address negligence. The lower court advised the jury that the fact that the rocks were thrown such a great distance was prima facie evidence of negligence, but they should nonetheless consider any evidence to the contrary. In July 1893 the jury once again decided for Franz, and awarded Theresa $6,500.
After that decision, Corbin, who was busy building Spokane’s most luxurious house, began legal maneuvers to avoid paying Theresa. Only after being threatened with jail and after losing yet another appeal to Washington’s Supreme Court did he finally compensate my great-great grandmother for the death of her husband.
The entire legal saga lasted about seven years; how Theresa survived and cared for her children during that period remains a mystery.
What’s clear is that Daniel Chase Corbin miscalculated: Theresa, a destitute “inferior,”” was his equal before the law.

Letting your bunny play on the grass in your yard can be a great way to expose them to some fresh air and ensure that they get some exercise, but you do need to take some precautions if you want to be sure that your pet bunny is safe outside. While you always need to supervise your bunny when they're outside, you'll want to look into additional things that you can do to make your yard as safe as possible. With the list of the following changes to make, you can hire a professional and ensure that your yard is safe for your bunny to play outside in.
When your bunny is hopping around your yard, you need to take special care to ensure that there are no plants they might nibble on that could harm them. Poisonous plants can be difficult for you to spot, making it a good idea to invite a landscape professional to check out your yard and take care of any plants that should be removed. Having a nice grass lawn free of poisonous plants and weeds alike can ensure that your yard is much safer for your bunny.
Along with being free of these plants, you can also rely on natural pesticides that won't be harmful for your bunny and keep weeds away in the future.
Since you likely don't want to supervise your bunny as they hop around the entire yard, it's a good idea for you to look into getting additional fencing put in. With shorter fencing that your bunny can't hop out of and taking up some space in your yard, you can feel good knowing that your bunny has some free roam of the yard and it will be easy for you to keep them out of trouble.
While you want your bunny to have exposure to some sunlight in order to feel warm and comfortable outside, you also want to make sure they don't get too hot. Your bunny can easily overheat when they're exposed to direct sunlight for prolonged period, leading to potential health issues. Getting some trees planted in your yard can provide some shade so that your bunny can be much more comfortable and that you won't need to worry about the heat being too much.
As you look into making changes to your yard for your pet bunny, consider getting the help of a landscaper such as Colourscape Inc so they can make your ideas a reality.
His eyes reflect his posturing, that ugly affect meant to intimidate those who would oppose him. Looking deeply into those eyes, though, one sees the abject terror within, the fright that bubbles up from the core. His only weapon—the hatred that rips even his friends to shreds—is fear turned on itself, despair turned inside-out, a sharp, fiery claw cleaving his enemies into pieces even as they reach out to him in empathy. He can’t tell friend from foe.
You are here: Home / Legal News / S Durga to be screened at IFFK 2017 only if court gives a nod, says Kerala govt
Thiruvananthapuram: Controversial Malayalam film S Durga will be screened at the forthcoming International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) only if it gets due clearance, State Minister for Culture and Cinema AK Balan said on Wednesday (6 December).
S Durga was not screened at the the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in Goa despite the best efforts of the movie’s director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan.
Sasidharan had moved the Kerala High Court, which directed IFFI to screen the film at the festival after a censored version was screened for the jury. But fresh title-related issues raised by the Central Board for Film Certification (CBFC) on the gala’s last day had sealed the fate of the movie at the fest.
The state-run Kerala Chalachitra Academy, the organiser of IFFK, had said recently that the festival would have a special screening of S Durga as a mark of protest against the Centre’s decision to drop the movie from IFFI even after it was selected by an expert jury.
The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) had cancelled the certification of the film on 28 November.
Balan told the media in Thiruvananthapuram, “What we hear is that director Sanal Kumar Sasidharan is going to approach the court again since the censorship certificate has been withdrawn. We will certainly screen the film here if he gets a clearance from the court. If not, it may not happen.”
Balan said that at this edition of the IFFK, 190 films from 65 countries would be screened, of which 40 of them will have their premiere here.
“Following the cyclone Ockhi disaster, we have decided to cancel the cultural extravaganza that is generally associated with the IFFK. Even the inauguration has been cancelled and there will be only screening of these films. With regard to the closing ceremony, no decision has been taken,” said Balan.
He said that as per the present directive, the national anthem will be played at the start and end of screenings.
The jury of the IFFK includes ace director Marco Muller, who will be the chairman. Others on the jury include Malayalam director TV Chandran, Columbian actor Marlon Moreno, film editor Mary Stephen and film curator Aboubacker Sanago.
In all 12,000 passes have been issued for the fest which commences on 8 December and continues till 15 December.

Some feedback regarding April. We have for the first time out performed last year when it came to listings in the City of Peterborough. April 2017, there were 193 Listings compared to 182 in 2016. New listings were down 4% from last year. Currently the City of Peterborough has 19 days of inventory, an increase of 7 days from last month.
List to sale ratio came in at 111% for the month of April, with the average time on market of 13 days. This number is higher only due to the fact of the amount of holding offers. As we have seen in the past 2 weeks, there is an increase of conditional sales once again. Also the amount of holding offers and generating sales from this is also on a decrease.
After 4 months of sales, we see our average sale price sitting at $364,421. This represents an overall increase of 29% compared to $282,684 in 2016.
Rural properties trends were similar to city with new listings in April of 112 compared to 101 last year. YTD there has been 284 listings versus 324 for last year. Sales come in at 207 for 2017 compared to 222 last year, a decrease of 7%. The Average sale price rural for the month of April was $467,966, compared to $303,381. An increase of 54%.

Eric Blanc has been kidnapped, but after two weeks he is offered the chance to escape. Guide him in finding out what has become of White Heaven, the hotel that tore apart his family, in which he is confined. You've never been alone.
White Heaven is set in the same Universe of "Anna", set in a fictional version of the beautiful Ayas Valley, on the peaks of the Western Italian Alps.
We worked on White Heaven pushing as much as we could into narrative gameplay. This means that the vast majority of the interface and the interaction is there to deliver you emotions.
The whole interface in inside the game world, and will not clutter your screen. As the goal of the game is not to have you pixel-hunt your way around, you'll very easily know what you can interact.
Solve environmental puzzles to reach objects, places and to create obstacles for whoever might want you dead
The game has a full Time Of Day system: you cannot go around forever. Eric will get tired and his performance (health, speed, quality of sight) will degradate badly. You'll have to sleep.
As you get deeper and deeper into the hotel, you'll find more and more about its inhabitants and what happened there: this will lead you to take choises that will drive you to 2 distinct endings.
A creature hunts you: it has an obsession over you and wants you dead. It is weaker during the night, but extremely dangerous during the day. Any time you come out of a safe place, consider what time is is.
White Heaven feels like a survival horror: you'll not have any weapon to fight the creature that hunts you. Also regular humans could be a danger, and they could be even more vicious than the creature.
Here in Dreampainters we have dedicated a massive amount of time writing the characters of White Heaven: they will drag you into the twisted world in which they live.
White Heaven is developed with the most powerful engine out there, Unreal Engine 4. Dreampainters have been using UE4 since 2012 and it's between the most experienced teams in the world with that engine.
We believe that a great game must deliver a good part of its atmosphere through audio, so we've spent some time in Abbey Road studios, were we recorded White Heaven's soundtrack using real instruments only.
With the supervision of Marc Canham and the direction of Jonathan Williams, Alessandro Monopoli has delivered a truly touching soundtrack.

Spring is in the air, meaning that it’s almost time to break out the hose and start revitalizing your garden.
An alkaloid is a naturally occurring plant-derived organic compound. Alkaloids are composed of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen. Many alkaloids are used as medicine and others are considered toxic. The most common alkaloid that is seen in everyday life is caffeine. Some other alkaloids are the drugs atropine, quinine, and the deadly nightshade plant.
The name ‘alkaloids’ was introduced by the German chemist Carl F.W. Meissner in 1819. It is derived from the Latin root: alkali which means “ashes of plants”. The first uses of alkaloids were seen in Homer’s The Odyssey. Homer refers to a gift given to Helen by the Egyptian queen, a drug bringing oblivion. The alkaloids were probably opium which is derived from the opium poppy. Actual studies of alkaloids did not begin until the 19th century. German chemist Friedrich Serturner isolated the first alkaloid from opium. He named this isolated alkaloid morphium for the Greek God Morpheus (the god of dreams), which is better known as morphine by those of us today.
Alkaloids are produced by a large number of organisms. The organisms which produce alkaloids include bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. At least 10,000 alkaloids are known. Alkaloids are found in 20-30% of all plant species. Alkaloids are common in plant families such as Solanaceae (Tomato and Potato Family) and Apocynaceae (Dogbane and Milkweed family) which makes up 60-70% of alkaloids. Alkaloids have a complex chemical structure. Alkaloids always contain a nitrogen molecule. Alkaloids can also contain molecules of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen.
The effects of alkaloids are varied. Though, all alkaloids cause a physiological effect on the human body. For instance, ergot alkaloid is toxic and even deadly. Cocaine and caffeine are two of the most common plant-based alkaloids that are also considered toxic to the human body although they are seen most often in human consumption.
Poisonous alkaloids are known as tropane alkaloids. They are famous throughout history for their use in making poisons. Poisonous alkaloids are typically derived from the nightshade plant.
Some of the medicinal alkaloids are atropine, scopolamine and quinine. Atropine was initially used as a poison but now is sometimes used for the stimulation of the central nervous system and is used to dilate the pupils of the eyes. Scopolamine, which is an alkaloid similar to atropine, is most commonly used to treat motion sickness. Quinine, is an alkaloid compound, found in the plant cinchona succirubra is the medicinal choice for the treatment of malaria.
There are alkaloids that have narcotic effects also. The alkaloid most often used for its narcotic properties is morphine. The morphine alkaloids are derived from the opium poppy. Morphine alkaloids are some of the oldest drugs in the history of the world. The first use of these morphine alkaloids was around 3500 B.C. Morphine alkaloids just like caffeine and cocaine, are still used today. Morphine alkaloids are used as an analgesic, or pain reliever.
Another medicinal alkaloid is vincristine. Vincristine is now used to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemia in children. Vinblastine, which is an alkaloid derived from the same plant as vincristine is believed to be an effective treatment for Hodgkin’s disease.
There are thousands of alkaloids all over the planet. Some are used for medicinal purposes; some are used for toxic purposes. Alkaloids make the base of most pharmaceutical drugs you take today. Whether you knew it or not alkaloids have been a part of your survival since the day you were born.

As Upward Stars enters our third year partnering with Junior Volleyball Association, it has become evident that the organization's expertise is crucial in reaching young athletes across the country. They continue to show a strong commitment to working with Upward Stars club directors nationwide and truly trust the vision of each club director to help benefit and grow the sport at the local level.
On Saturday, Sept. 27 the Upward Star Center opened its doors to the local community. The multi-sport, indoor-outdoor complex sits on 60 acres in Spartanburg, SC. On the outside lie two state-of-the-art turf fields, four natural grass fields, and four lighted sand volleyball courts.
The 120,000 square foot indoor facility houses six full-sized basketball courts (that can be transformed into 12 short courts), 12 regulation indoor volleyball courts, six meeting rooms, four pro-style batting cages, a running track, rock wall, cafÃ©, strength and conditioning area with trainers, a retail shop as well as a full-sized orthopedic and rehabilitation center.
In today's sports culture, a lot of organizations sacrifice the long-term benefit of athletes in exchange for short-term gain. The result of such neglect is 70% of young athletes quitting sports by the age of 13. We want to stop this trend and help reclaim the landscape of youth sports for the benefit of our young athletes.
Train New and Existing Leaders - Invest and develop mission-aligned leaders and coaches with and athlete-focused philosophy.
Use as a "Living Laboratory" - Develop and improve new sports offerings that focus on an athlete's long-term development.
Support Upward Sports' Exclusive 360 Progression Program - Offer recreation, developmental, and performance programs as well as tournaments with the primary goal of developing the total athlete.
The Upward Star Center is one of the premier sports destinations in the southeast. As proud as this fact makes us, the real mission and excitement is being able to help build total athletes. The term "total athletes" is used to describe our exclusive 360 Progression program which is the blueprint to help young athletes grow in four key areas - Mentally, Athletically, Spiritually, and Socially.
Upward Stars has dedicated coaches, staff, and community members who share in the mission to guide players through the stages of game discovery, skill development, and peak performance while fostering the growth of personal character through the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Now, one of the critical issues that arose recently is that players are leaving leagues, a lot of times even quitting sports entirely by the age of 13 which decreases the time they can be impacted through the 360 Progression. There is clear evidence that if young athletes aren't around qualified coaches and in a competitive atmosphere, parents are willing to move their child out of athletic programs.
While the Upward Star Center is a new and crucial piece in reaching these athletes, Upward Sports also has an existing Volleyball Center ten miles away which houses seven additional volleyball courts and has an expansion in the works. As it stands, the 19 courts these two facilities have combined make them one of the largest volleyball complexes in the country! The ability to have access to such venues ensures athletes and their families have a place that can provide the competitive environment they wish to be a part of.
Following the vision of creating a higher-level sports environment, volleyball was instituted as an Upward Stars program. Upward Stars differentiates itself by allowing players to be a part of a "club" atmosphere. It is here that they are led by certified coaches, receive individual instruction, and play against high-level competition to ensure they are reaching their full potential.
Upward Stars already has terrific clubs and young athletes within its programs who are seeing results. Under the guidance of Corey Helle, the Upward Stars Volleyball Club Upstate was recently ranked the #1 club in the state of South Carolina. Helle, who spent 17 years as a college coach including the last 11 as the head coach at Wofford College, retired from the college ranks to be the full-time club director in 2012. This year the club anticipates having 40 travel teams and another 200 players go through their developmental academies.
There are many experienced and passionate coaches within the Upward Stars programs like Helle. The knowledge gained from working or playing at the top levels lends them to be excellent teachers of their sport and help their young athletes perform at a high level.
Since introducing volleyball in 2012, participation numbers have continued to rise, and the ability to impact young athletes' lives has grown along with them:
In 2013 - 600 club athletes participated in Upward Stars programs along with six additional tournaments that when combined, totaled 1,705 players for the year.
In 2014 - 750 club athletes participated in Upward Stars programs along with ten tournaments that when combined, totaled 3,442 players reached for the year.
o Hosting 8 SAVL tournaments, local high school and middle school tournaments, 13 indoor and outdoor events including sand, grass, and developmental tournaments, a national recruiting showcase for aspiring college players, and numerous coaching clinics.o The Upward Star Center being the site of a division 1 Men's volleyball match where North Greenville faces off against perennial division 1 power Pepperdine and their leader, former national USA volleyball coach, Marv Dunphy on January 3, 2015. o Co-hosting 1 AAU Winter Bump tournament in January, 1 AAU Super Regional and 1 JVA Challenge Tournament in March, and 1 SAVL Club Championship in April.
"We are excited for the 2015 volleyball club season for many reasons, one of the main ones being able to have our teams play in one of the premier sports facilities in the country," said Helle, who also coaches the 181 team.
Also, beyond the Upward Star Center only being used for sporting events, there are plans to utilize it as a place for conventions, concerts, community events, and parties to expand on the ways we can minister to our community.
As we enter our third year partnering with JVA, it has become evident that their expertise is crucial in reaching young athletes across the country.

If the family needs to file a claim, email members@jvavolleyball.org to request a copy of the JVA Medical Claim Form. Lisa will insure that the JVA Incident Report has been filed. The family should follow the instructions for submission included on the form.
UNITE By joining together, junior club directors can develop an organized group of small business leaders to lobby for improvement and better representation at the regional and national level. This type of effort will allow all clubs, both large and small, to be working partners with their regional and national leadership. The JVA feels strongly that since the junior community is the overwhelming source of funding for both the regional and national organizations, it should have a fair voice in the governance of those organizations. As partners, the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) recognizes and supports the effort to bring all of the key organizations in the sport together. By forming a unified front the junior community can help lead the way in the development, promotion and marketing of our sport.
DEVELOP The JVA is committed to expanding the grassroots movement for volleyball to bring more players to the sport at the younger levels. While Volleyball might be popular at the High School level it has been far outpaced by sports such as soccer and softball at the Junior High and Grade School level. To reverse this trend we will be working with the AVCA and USA Volleyball to develop a training and competition model that will encourage widespread participation at the youth level (ages 8-12). This is a key area to address if the sport of Volleyball hopes to see significant growth in the years to come.
IMPROVE The JVA is committed to addressing 2 areas that we strongly feel have a negative impact on our sport:
(1) The sky rocketing costs of participation in junior volleyball. While club dues have steadily risen over the past two decades we feel those costs are manageable, but the cost of travel has exploded. It is now common place for travel costs to make up the vast majority of a player's membership fees during a club season. The JVA feels that a solution can be reached that can begin to curtail the escalating expense of junior volleyball and make the sport more inclusive. If this can be done then the sport will be much more appealing to a large section of the youth market that currently cannot afford to be involved.
(2) The current length of the junior season. In the past two decades the junior season has been extended approximately three weeks and now goes into the second week of July. The agreement is almost universal that the season is too long and the length of the season is contributing to several issues that have a negative impact on the sport. Those issues are less participation at the youth level, more injuries at all levels and an overuse factor for those players that must go directly from their club teams to the USA High Performance programs or their collegiate program. Many of the elite level collegiate coaches have been saying for years that many incoming freshman are entering college with overuse and chronic injuries that will plague them for most or all of their collegiate careers.
JVA has partnered with AAU for our mid-year championship and the AAU National Championships. The events will require membership with AAU. In return, the JVA mid-year championship will be insured by AAU, the top two teams in each division will be given free entry into the AAU National Championships and AAU will host a mid-year meeting for JVA in Orlando.
The JVA was formed when a concerned group of club directors met in Chicago to discuss the long term direction of junior volleyball. The directors, junior club athletes, and their families faced a governing body that offered their primary financial supporters a disproportionate voice in decision making, rapidly inflating costs, (especially for top teams to qualify to compete in the Open Division of the USAV Junior National Championships), and a season that offered athletes few off-season days. The group decided to form the JVDA (Junior Volleyball Directors Assoc.) as a lobby group to work for better conditions for juniors in USAV.
Out of that meeting, the Junior Volleyball Directors Association was formed. The mission of the new association was to represent, communicate and lobby for the development, growth and marketing of all levels of youth and junior volleyball.
It very soon became apparent that there was a need for an independent junior volleyball club association that would be responsive to all clubs, of all affiliations. The American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) approached JVDA. The missions of the two organizations are very similar and a partnership was formed. JVDA had no staff, only a volunteer board. AVCA became the managing partner, responsible to administer the operations of the new association. Members were granted a dual membership, adding value to the association.
In the summer of 2009, JVDA leaders met for their first strategic planning session. The new association was growing rapidly. We needed more clarity of our mission and a full time Executive Director. Our new and current mission is to promote the growth of youth and junior volleyball through program and resource development, education and events.
Our Guiding Principals: Best Practices Affordability and Financial Responsibility Player Welfare Transparency Member Driven To reflect our growing membership of all adults involved in junior volleyball clubs, we officially changed our name to "Junior Volleyball Association" and created a new more youthful logo to reflect the change.
In 2015, to be more efficient and provide better service for our members, we took all our operations in house from AVCA. Both organizations value the dual memberships and we retained that partnership through today.
The simple answer is so that your club directors will become better business owners by joining the network of those who share their interests, passion for the game, and challenges. Other reasons:
To share the "best practices" of your region with others and to learn "best practices" from other regions.
To have an avenue for sharing the concerns of club directors with the Junior Elite Representative on the new USA Volleyball Board of Directors
To be part of the AVCA community which encompasses college, high school, grassroots and international level coaches
The JVA Board of Directors is elected from their membership with a one club, one vote format. The JVA Board will determine the overall strategy for the association, manage the financial resources and programming needs specific to juniors and advise the AVCA staff and board of directors on how to best serve the constituency and increase the membership.
JVA is a partner association of the AVCA (American Volleyball Coaches Association). The advantage of this relationship is that JVA membership includes AVCA membership for all full members and gives full access to AVCA educational services and programs.
Volleyball products and supplies discounts available through developed partnerships with AVCA Corporate Partners, Preferred Providers and event sponsors.
The only volleyball technical journal, Coaching Volleyball, and drills bulletin, Volleyball Ace Power Tips, available in the United States.
Networking opportunities with collegiate coaches and extensive information on college recruiting rules, program rankings, scholarship opportunities for players and job vacancies for coaches.
An opportunity for collective lobbying with governing organizations (NCAA, USAV, NFHS) on issues important to the development of the sport.
The JVA is an association of Junior Club Directors and Coaches who are dedicated to all facets of junior volleyball and have a desire to offer the best programming possible to their members. JVA is a trade association established to serve those who dedicate themselves to a part or full time commitment to junior volleyball. To that end, JVA provides:
Information on best practices in club ownership, facility management, and methods to enhance your business acumen and effectiveness.
A lobbying group to influence USA Volleyball and other organizations that manage, regulate and influence the junior volleyball community
An avenue to access club directors for companies interested in investing in the junior volleyball marketplace.
An association that will build relationships and community within junior volleyball by linking club directors across regions, philosophy and club size.
I am looking for the best insurance for my facility (lowest rate for best coverage). What options are out there?
The facility owner needs to identify insurance carriers, or an agent, familiar with the risks we face running a sports facility and volleyball club. There are several insurance companies that specialize in providing the coverage we need; such as participant and spectator liability, abuse and molestation, coaches professional, and accident medical to name a few. Once those companies are identified, applications should be submitted to no less than three of these companies to obtain the most competitive price. I can identify those companies, and they would vary depending on the state the facility is located in. Contact me directly for more information. Glenn Pike, Club Director, MAVAOwner, Pike Insurance Group gpike@pikeinsurancegroup.com
For younger teams what it the standard for most clubs on playing time? Are there benefits of equal play versus best players get the majority of playing time? What are the pros and cons of positional training for younger teams?
Great question Mary. Most clubs in our area try to make playing time as even as possible. We believe it is better to limit the playing time of players that we don't like, or players that have difficult parents. In fact, if I have a player that is not getting playing time, parents know they can get their daughter in the match if they bring me a grande soy latte in the morning, or a nice cold can of squirt in the afternoon. I hope that helps!
Please give me some suggestions on how to fairly and effectively accommodate players on my team that play another sport besides volleyball during the club season?
The first thing I would recommend is for the coach and the athlete (and family) to acknowledge that if some training time is missed for the other sport, that athlete will likely not progress as fast as her teammates that don't miss any practice. Also, there is a cost physically to the player with the amount of jumping and other activity she is doing while playing two sports and measures should be taken to make sure that she is not at risk of overuse injuries. A third area to discuss is the playing time issues when a player is missing some training time to play the other sport. Her VB teammates may not think it is fair for a player that misses half of the practices to play just as much as the players that make it to 100% of the practices. All three of these areas need to be discussed and understood by the parties. After that is established and understood by all, we believe it is important to identify how each type of conflict will be resolved. For example, if there is a volleyball practice and a practice of the other sport, how will that be resolved? What about a volleyball practice and the other sport's competition? What about a volleyball competition and the other sport's practice, and finally, what happens when both sports have competitions at the same time? As long as both sports' coaches, the player, and the parents all have a clear understanding of all of the above, it should prevent too many problems.
When training younger players what sort of nutritional advice should you give them to help them keep growing and maintain their energy level during practices and competition?
The best route for younger players to choose in maximizing performance gains is to get their fruit/vegetable intake up from the normal North American 1-3 servings per day. The benefits of adding more servings of fruit/vegetables (7 or more servings per day) will supply the players that much needed nutrient boost to last those long hard fought weekends of juniors volleyball. Here are a couple helpful websites with more information: http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/for-young-athletes-good-reasons-to-break-the-fast-food-habit/ http://life.familyeducation.com/teen/nutrition/36552.html Robert Brown, Club Director, DFW Performance Volleyball Primary Master Instructor for the USA Volleyball Conditioning Accreditation Program 5th year strength & conditioning coach for Texas Wesleyan University Volleyball program Certifications: USAV - CAP III USAV - VCAP Master Instructor NASM - Performance Enhancement Specialist IYCA - Olympic Weightlifting Instructor
If we have a player that cannot afford to pay our full cost, what ideas are out there to provide financial assistance to that player in order for her to be able to play?
The occurrence of this situation is definitely on the rise with the struggling economy and the rising costs of club. We (Triangle Volleyball Club) employ several options. First, we attempt to extend our typical payment plan [absolutely all fees must be paid in full in order for the athlete to try out for the following season] and provide used/donated uniforms. Secondly, we have a scrip-based fundraiser program that anyone receiving financial aid is required to participate in. Thirdly, we provide scholarship that is need-based. We fund scholarships through club savings via the Scrip program, member donations, and a specified percent of overall club budget. A tip when awarding scholarships- we apply the scholarship as a match against their own payments. For example, let???s say costs are $4000 and scholarship is $2000. For every dollar they pay they are awarded a dollar in scholarship throughout the course of the season. It keeps their obligation in perspective. We also require regular payments, regardless of amounts. Otherwise, folks do tend to fall so far behind they cannot catch up. Sherry Fadool Club Director, Triangle Volleyball Club
I am having difficulty managing a parent who thinks his daughter should be getting more playing time. It's starting to impair our team and families positive dynamic. What advice would you give to me, a new coach, to be respectful but rectify the situation?
First, I would want to make sure that the parent understands the club's position on playing time. Is it equal, is it not guaranteed but earned? Assuming that it is not equal but earned, make sure that the player clearly understands what the player must do to earn more playing time. If the player is confused, then that is a problem. If the player is aware by the coach of the plan for more playing time the coach has done their job. Protocol with the issue of an upset parent also comes into play. I suggest the following steps Player-Coach Player-Parent-Coach Player-Parent-Coach-Club Director Always make sure that the player is present in these meetings. Bill Milborn, Club Director, Club Fusion, Chicago, IL JVA Board of Directors, President
Is there any little things a club can institute to create a culture of inclusiveness within the club? What makes your players feel they are part of a club besides being on the team?
Obviously establishing and maintaining a strong club culture must start at the top and trickle down. That means administrators and coaches must first value and implement a structure that seeks to find commonality and make connections within the community between staff, athletes, and parents. We talk about Club ALL the time. Having a common training place definitely helps but we do many ???little things??? that make connections: 1.Signing Night Celebration to kick off season. 2.Practice tees-they all match every practice 3.Big Sis/Lil Sis-connect teams at start of season. We match teams with like travel schedules so they support each other on the road. 4.Ride buses together to tournaments 5. Banquet dinners at hotel the night of arrival for multi-daytournaments 6. Retreat day???focus is on community and character. This is alsoour picture day. 7. Ball Control camp starts every season. No teams just playerspacking the gym for large group clinics 8. Team practice groupings???how we share courts???strength andconditioning format 9. How we start practice-circled up sharing exciting news [collegecommitments, player awards, etc.] 10. Uniform order at tournaments. Day 1-White for all; Day 2-Blue for all; Day 3-Black for all 11. Supporting each other at competition. 12. Consistent training program. Learning the same thing in the sameway connects athletes. 13. We travel as a club???parents do not control any of the schedule; it is all team and club directed and supervised. 14. There is so much MORE???. Sherry Fadool, Club Director, Triangle Volleyball Club
We (Houston Juniors) use the Accuspike system in our building. During our training cycles involving position work we have 2 machines set up so that we can maximize the reps available to our hitters. We also use the machines during some of our camps when we need to maximize the reps on limited space. We usually explain to the athletes how to use the equipment then station a coach next to each machine to give feedback to the athletes. Jeff Ham Head Training Coach Houston Juniors
Are there any clubs that have a practice time more than 3 hours a session? Are there clubs that practice 4 or 5 days a week?
Yes, there are times that a practice might run more than 3 hours and also times when a club team will practice up to 4-5 days in a week. The first part of the question regarding the length of the individual practice will depend on what the goal of the training session is. For a session to last 4 hours it would need to encompass the following: (1) a low level of intensity for much of the practice (2) a great deal of teaching & downtime where the players were receiving many verbal cues and the rest to work ratio was very high (3) a low compression emphasis where the athletes are not doing a great deal of jumping, but rather focused on 1st and 2nd contact skills along with serving where a large number of ball repetitions does not equate to fatigue or joint stress. The golden rule for training usually comes down to the higher the volume of work that you are doing (time or reps) then the lower the level of intensity should be. We have many training session every year that last up to 4 hours, but at least 60% + of the time spent in those training sessions is on serving, serve receive, crosscourt setting and basic ball control training. We would never spend more than 60-90 minutes of the 240 minute total on what I would call "high intensity-high compressive training". In regards to the number of days of practice each week it's important to take the following into account. 1. How much is the team competing and what type of surface is the team playing on? 2. What is being done within the practice setting in terms of the "volume vs. Intensity" question that should determine how every training session is structured? 3. How old and how physically developed are the athletes on the team and can they handle consecutive training days? I would suggest that all coaches attempt to coordinate their training and competitive schedules together to take into account how much recovery time their team is going to have throughout the season. Rest is one of the keys to recovery and a coach must know when rest is needed over training. On the other hand if a coach is smart and plans accordingly a team can practice 4-5x per week as long as each practice has a different emphasis and a well-varied level of intensity. Good Luck, Rick Butler, Club Director GLV Inc. & Sports Performance Volleyball Club
Parents play an important role in player development. Are there clubs that offer clinics and/or resources for families?
JVA offers their member clubs a Free parent workshop from PCA, Positive Coaching Alliance. The workshop focuses on helping the athlete respect the game, performance versus outcome and the relationship between athlete, parent, and coach. Many clubs do provide other resources for families in this area and the area of recruiting. It is a good practice to inquire about those services prior to signing up for a club. It is also good to know if there are any additional fees for those services.
On the quick attack where should the middle leave in relation to the setter and net (for the women's game)? One argument is behind the setter because there will be drift and they will contact the ball inline with the setter. The other argument I have heard is that the middle quick attack approach should be more like a beach approach, legs loaded and ready for a straight up take off with little drift or broad jump.
Our quick attack zone floats with the setter. I have my middles mark their starting point for all approaches just off the setters shoulder. This gives the defending middle blocker the same look all the time. The approach for the quick attack would be straight up.
How are teams seeded for tournaments at this time of the year? It is soley based on last years ranking?
I will use our power league as an example of how we handle the challenge of seeding teams into the first tournaments of the year. Our power league is the first large tournament in terms of levels of participation for our area. The outcome of the power league provides the best linear ranking of teams that participate in it from year to year and is used extensively to seed teams into non-power league events throughout the season. Obviously since the season is just getting started, we don???t have actual results to go by in order to seed or rank the teams until the power league gets going. What we do to seed the initial power league is to rely on a small group of volunteers for each division. The teams first submit a questionnaire that indicates some things about their past performance, changes to their team rosters (plus or minus) and their anticipation of where their team will finish in the power league. Of course most coaches think their team will finish high, so that information is not that useful, but we do receive it. What we have found to be the most useful information is the prior year???s power league results. We found that clubs will tend to finish in approximately the same place they finished the prior year for each of the age groups. Therefore our best method to complete the initial seeding is to use last year???s actual results for the same aged team the prior year (a specific club???s 16-1 team last year to seed the same club???s 16-1 team this year), balanced by the younger team???s actual results the prior year (their 15-1 team last year to seed their 16-1 team this year). Obviously without actual results from the teams this year the seeding at the beginning of the season is more challenging than it will be later in the season. We have found that clubs tend to be pretty consistent rankings from year to year in the same ages, and the biggest challenge is in trying to place teams that we didn???t see in last year???s power league. I hope that is of some help. Good luck! Dave Weitl, Club Director, Washington Volleyball Academy, AVCA Board of Directors, JVA Board of Directors
???Open??? has been widely used to distinguish the highest level of competition within a single event. ???Club??? has been typically used to describe a level or levels below the Open level. It???s important to note that Open can mean something different at a large scale national event when compared to a smaller more local based event. You do not have to declare yourself an Open or a Club level team with your national governing organization at the start of the season [or frankly at any point in the season] but you do have to select your competitive level when entering events [certainly most larger events]. What level a club/team selects depends on a variety of factors and requires some self-awareness. Questions to ask are: 1. What types of events are you currently playing in and what competitive level do they represent?2. What level of success have you achieved in club level events?3. Do you have a team that prefers to win at a slightly lower competitive level or a team that will risk losing to face better competition.4. Do you have the coaching staff, athletes, training program to prepare your team for competition at the next level? As we developed competitiveness in our club we began by trying one or two open level events at the older ages. Within a couple years we were able to have all our ???1??? teams from 14-18???s competing exclusively at the Open level. If that level is an ultimate goal at some point you have to simply ???give it a try???. Sherry Fadool, Club Director, Triangle Volleyball Club
Brian, we want to give you a helpful answer but first can you clarify what the reason is that you are wanting to teach parents to keep score/take stats? Are you planning to use parents as official scorekeepers during your referee duties? Or are you for some reason wanting parents to keep score in the stands during competition? Are you looking for parents to keep stats for the team and coaches or have the parents keeping stats just for their own (the parents???) use?
Most tournaments will divide an age group into more than one division once the number of teams reaches a certain level. Other tournaments will provide specific competitive divisions in order to provide a qualifying opportunity for the teams in that division to play in another tournament that requires 'qualifying'.One goal of creating different divisions within the same age group is to ensure the best competitive experience possible. It may not be enjoyable or appropriate for a team seeded #1 to play a match against a team that is seeded #200. In most cases, neither team benefits from that type of a mis-match and in some cases someone might even get hurt! It is usually preferred to match up teams as close in ability as possible to ensure a competitive match that is beneficial for both teams and more enjoyable for the players and fans!Another benefit of creating different divisions within the same age group is to ensure that the process of selecting a champion in that division has integrity. Tournaments are always limited to a certain number of days or rounds of competition and the larger the field grows, the more challenging it becomes to provide a process to pare the field down to the finalists competing for the championship and you want to ensure every team feels they had a fair shot at getting into that top group.The JVA World Challenge in Louisville, KY will be offering two divisions, Open Division for the highest level of competition, and Club Division. For more information about this tournament, you can visit the tournament website at:http://jva.avca.org/Tournaments/2013JVAWorldChallenge.aspx Most tournaments will use Open to designate their top division, and thereafter it may vary from tournament to tournament. The AAU National Championships in Orlando have expanded to offer three divisions within the larger age groups. The Open Division is the highest, Club Division is the middle, and Classic Division is the lowest level in that tournament. It is important that you understand the ranking and size of each division before entering a tournament to ensure you have selected the most appropriate level for your teams. The selection of the right competitive level will many times determine the quality of the experience for your teams.For more information about the AAU Girls Junior National Championships, you can read their tournament information here:http://image.aausports.org/dnn/volleyball/2013/GJNVConline.pdf Good luck to your teams!
There are specific guidelines for the size of the #s or jerseys per USA. I???m not sure if AAU has guidelines. Since we play in both tournaments we go by USA guidelines. The regulation minimum is 4??? on the front of the jersey and 6??? on the back of the jersey. We (Houston Juniors) do 6??? on the front and 8??? on the back, 2 digit #???s only. As far as numbering jerseys we only do 1 ??" 25. I think that is a club preference. I would not do more than 2 digits because of how it looks on certain sizes (x-small- small). Answered by: Stephanie Rhodes, Club Director, Houston Juniors
For the World tournament in Louisville what time will the afternoon session start on Friday for 17 Open.
I would first look to the current local clubs in your area and see if anyone has one or is interested in starting one. If that does not work you might look into the local park district to see if you can rent a court to get one started or a local club who has a facility and see if they would be open to you beginning one. From there I would contact the current clubs in the country who have Vtots to ask for help and ideas on teaching tools, what type of equipment you would need to purchase, training models, drills, physical aspects, philosophies, etc...
The JVA does have a support system in place with a video series available for youth development (available on the JVA website under Educational/Resources/DVDs) and then I would suggest doing research from other countries. I have used soccer academies as my main source of education and then Japan, Brazil, Italy, Canada and some other countries have great YouTube videos with drills for the younger athlete. I have hours and hours of video so I would be happy to share that with you.
We just opened up our GLC Youth Academy this past fall and we have as young as 4 year olds in the program. It has grown very quickly and we are just short of 1200 kids involved in our K-7th grade programs since the fall of 2013 to current. This does not include our Youth Academy boys program which has over 150 currently.
We run 8-10 week sessions with 1.5 hour sessions, one day per week for the K-2nd graders. The 3rd and 4th graders go 8-10 weeks, 2 days per week for 1.5 hours and then hour 5th and 6th graders go 2 days per week for 12-16 weeks for 2 hours each practice.
We have in house play for our K-4th graders and then our 5th and 6th graders play in JVA tournaments. Our K-2nd grade play 2 on 2 with a very low net, our 3rd and 4th graders play 4 on 4 with a 20 x 20 court and 6'6 net and then our 5th and 6th graders play full court, 6 on 6 with a 7' net.
How do I learn about starting a small area club with a few teams (12,13,14) ? Advice is greatly accepted
JVA has many resources for starting a volleyball club, as most new clubs begin with only a few teams. One resource is a blog on Starting a Volleyball Club where a first time club director talks about his experience during his first year. http://junior-volleyball.blogspot.com/
Other resources include webinars http://jva.avca.org/EducationalResources/Webinars.aspx, articles, handouts, DVDs, and tools to help new club directors with insurance, budgeting, finding tournaments, training coaches, etc. If you are not yet a JVA member you can view more information here http://jva.avca.org/Membership/MemberBenefits.aspx.
Let us know where you are located and we can put you in touch with other club directors in your area so you can coordinate tournaments. Our members are a great resource for each other as we all want each other's clubs to succeed.
I have an in-coming freshmen high school camp coming up and would like to start the girls on a few good core strengthening exercises. What would you recommend?
Now because this is a camp and you’re introducing these exercises, there’s no reason to try to progress towards the more advanced options.
I am looking for help in setting up a residential camp for next summer, and have just never done it and trying to understand what would be good formatting. Any help is great.
By residential do you mean a satellite camp at a local high school or middle school? Or a camp for commuters?
Are their any JVA requirements for score keeping and referee certification? If so, where would I find this information? If not, are clubs asked to certify their own teams through an honor system?
JVA does not "require" referee and scorekeeper certification. However, under our Club Management Best Practices we do urge all clubs to train their coaches and athletes in the areas of scorekeeper and libero tracker, R2 duties, and line judging. This is an area that we have not addressed in our Club Management Resources but will look to include prior to the beginning of the season. http://jva.avca.org/EducationalResources.aspx
It looks as though many clubs use an excel document in google docs and share the document with their staff so everyone can see the court schedule. One JVA member club, Virginia Elite, highly recommends a program they use called Sign Up Genius - more info here http://www.signupgenius.com/If there are any other recommendations out there, please share!
I am looking for some sort of software that I can plan practices with diagrams and text to explain the drills to our coaches. Similar to 123Rotates software, where you can diagram serve receive patterns with arrows and such.
Great question. I have spent many hours searching for quality multimedia play and drill software. I also wanted the end product to be animation or video.
Apple had some dynamic, intuitive diagramming programs (some should be listed on the JVA resource page). However, at that time their operating system did not allow for animated screen capture. In those systems, the end user is required to download the APP in order to watch the coaching videos or animations. I am not sure if the new iOS has resolved that issue and made the tool more share-friendly.
I purchased Volleyball Playbook (http://www.jes-volleyball.com/) and put it on my Laptop. I used some free screen capture software and and went to work on building a library. As part of the "flipping the classroom" concept my players would be responsible for reviewing the plan and watching the videos or diagrams. Many educational experts believe that performing some independent learning before taking part in the practice prepares the learner for the learning.
The links initially took them to my private YouTube playlist, but now they go to one of VA Elite's YouTube Channels:
Can a player play both a club associated with JVA and a club associated with AAU and USAV at the same time providing tournaments don't interfere?
JVA does not prevent a player from player for more than one club. It it up to the clubs whether or not they would allow the player to play with both clubs. The parent should check with the club director to see if they would approve.
Here is some advice from JVA Executive Director Jenny Hahn who is co-founder of Milwaukee Sting Volleyball Club. "My best advice is to throw out a huge net. Tell everyone you know, have your parents and players and current coaches tell everyone they know. Do you have a free rec notes or posting in your local paper? If so, use that resource! Also post in the online local paper, CraigsList and Linked In. Contact the local colleges, DI, DII, DIII, NAIA, Technical schools, etc. Find out if they have club programs, the students are more available to coach. Find out if they have intramural volleyball leagues and hand out flyers on a league night or you might be able to get team captain contacts. Check your local adult volleyball leagues - same thing as above - hand out flyers, get team captain contacts."
Our club has found a warehouse that we can rent/lease from our city, who owns it. Are there any grants available to help fund or subsidize the project?
You may want to approach your county, city, school district, park and rec dept. ,etc. They very often are looking for opportunities to provide quality recreational programming in your community. In return for program development and management, they maybe willing to partner in your facility. In addition to volleyball camps, clinics, after school programs, etc., the community groups may also be interested in utilizing space for other fitness or recreational programs. Check out the hottest trends in fitness for adults (zumba, boot camps, circuit training, etc.). With the current spotlight on youth obesity, youth fitness, these programs could be adapted to youth programs and use vacant time slots and space in your facility.For more information on funding a facility, purchase JVA webinar "Can I Justify a Volleyball Facility" that discusses financing and budgeting for a volleyball facility.

My team is currently 8-1 on Saturdays this season and 3-6 on Sundays. Competition is about the same both days. Any suggestions on how to keep the focused day 2?
Since you mentioned that the competition is about the same on Saturday as it is on Sunday that would tell me that you feel your team is just performing better on Saturday's than they are on Sunday's. Without knowing any details about your team here are some random thoughts.
1. As a coach are you stressing to your team when they leave the gym on Saturday that Sunday needs to be better? It's always easier to play well on the first day of a tournament since everyone is pretty excited to get in the gym and compete on Day 1.
2. Possibly review Saturday's play and what you feel like they can improve on and set your goals for Sunday after play is finished on Saturday. Leave the team and each player with a clear and concise explanation of what you are going to expect on Sunday before they leave the gym on Saturday.
3. During the week do you practice two days in a row (exp. Mon-Tue, Tue-Wed, Wed-Thu.......) and are the practices such that your team needs to "GRIND" on back to back days so they get used to replicating the conditions that they will face in a multiple day tournament? Practices should always be far more challenging than your toughest opponent!
4. Are your players well conditioned so a 12-18 hour turnaround does not create a problem for them from finishing on Saturday afternoon or evening and then possibly having to be back in the gym on Sunday morning.
5. Have you thought about setting "benchmarks" for the team's level of play? These benchmarks mean the team has to play to a certain level regardless of what day it is and failure to reach those benchmarks results in consequences which are decided by you and the team leadership (stairs, sprints, extra passing-digging-attacking reps-etc......). By doing this you and the team have committed to a "contract" that if broken means extra work for all involved to get the team back to the level that you all feel that you can play at. These benchmarks should be "realistic" in nature and attainable if the team plays to it's potential. The reason I bring this up is that when every player on the team feels a sense of "urgency" to compete at the highest level, it's much easier to keep everyone motivated to play to their potential.
Can you steer me toward a good set of by-laws that I can use as a template to get Morton Storm set up as a 501c3 not-for-profit organization? We want to start a capital campaign for our own facility and we are told that this our next step.
In order to assist Club Directors with starting a club, making financial decisions, and following a business plan, we have templates and examples of legal documents and important forms, including a set of ByLaws shared from a 501c3 club. These resources are available in the JVA member resource library. Click here to view jva.avca.org/EducationalResources/ClubDirectorResources.aspx
What is the ideal floor plan for a 12 court facility with the other things you have going on; pro shop, concessions, offices, etc. I am looking for an ideal floor plan with all the extras besides courts.
There is no ideal layout. The layout that is ideal, is what works for your parcel of land and for any building code requirements such as exiting. You need to decide all of the items you want in the building besides the courts, then add another 30-50% more onto that area for things you didn’t think of and for future use. You would be best to sit down with an architect on a computer and start making some rough sketches of where things are. Should it be 12 courts in a row with everything behind the courts, like our 8 court building? That has some advantages but it requires a very long building and might not fit on your land. Should it be 2 sets of 6 courts separated by a center core with a mezzanine overlooking both sides? That has some advantages, but leaves you with less space in the center core for all the other thing you might want. It also gives you no outside windows for anything in the center core. Once again, the best thing to do is to sit down with an architect and do some preliminary sketches. Yes it will cost some money to do this, but if you are concerned about spending that money you shouldn’t be attempting to build a facility.
What is a typical salary range for club volleyball recruiting coordinators and what do the full responsibilities include?
I am not sure the answer can be cut and dry. It is as different as what a club to club pay salary is so different. I feel like if your only job is recruiting and you have two to three 18's teams and ALL your players are getting recruited then you should be paid as a master coach. If you coach and you only have a few kids recruited a year probably just an additional stipend.I know that I spend anywhere from 10-14 hours a week talking with either a college coach, a player or a parent. Our typical coach spends 6 hours a week on the floor coaching.
Educating parents,players and club coaches on recruiting procedures and follow through that this is done.
I have been presented with the opportunity to invest in a volleyball club that has grown to the point of considering its own facility. I would be investing as an individual, and would invest about 25% of the start up cost. What is a typical business relationship in terms of arrangements for protecting the investment of contributors and the return on investment options? Is a percent of profit the typical arrangement?
Without knowing all the details here are a couple of questions you might want to ask and then a couple of thoughts on your original question.
If you are a part-owner then you should share in the profit of the business and you will also share in the risk associated with owning that business so you need to go in with your eyes open to the fact that "profits" are an option as well as "losses."
2. Will the club & new facility be owned by the same entities or separate (one or two LLC's or Corporations)?"
Often real estate & buildings are owned by a separate LLC or Corporation from the entity that owns the club. As an investor will you have ownership in everything or just the club or just the facility?
The key is to have clear guidance at the beginning of the relationship on how your investment is going to be returned to you.
You can choose to be a "lender" and ask for a set rate of return on your loan over a specific period of time. Much like a bank acts when it loans money. Normally the riskier the loan the higher rate of return you should receive. If you choose to be a lender then you will need to be clear if your loan is "secured" or "unsecured" which means that there is some type of guarantee given to you or collateral put up so you are confident you will be repaid in full at some point.
You mention "sharing profits" but often in a new business all profits are invested back to grow the business so the management of the company might ask the investors to wave any returns for a period of 3-5 years so the new company can get on its feet, develop a solid cash flow and start making a profit.
My family that could not be in Houston for the JVA World Challenge Championship games enjoyed watching the live stream video. Are the Championship videos available to view again. If so, where may I find them? Thank you
I am a member of JVA and I was looking for ideas on recording the kids training with video and playback. What is the hot set up. We want to record, do some analysis watching slow motion action. Is the iPad the way to go? What apps or software is the best. Any ideas of how to video tape using software or apps to train would be great. Thanks for the assistance.
40-45 parking spots for every competition court is a solid number. We (Sports Performance) have 500 spots plus street parking for 12 courts and there are times that we get very crowded. So 120-140 spots if the facility plans on hosting events. Rick Butler Co-Director, Sports Performance Volleyball Chicago, IL
Does the JVA have a webinar or any kind of information that might be helpful to a club who is going to be audited by their State unemployment commission? They are examining to see whether our coaches should be considered employees vs. Independent contractors. We are scheduled to be audited on September 4th and any support/info I can get would be helpful.
Yes the JVA has a webinar on Club Philosophy and Business Structure that addresses this information. It is available in the JVA Webinar Library, free for members and only $9.99 for non-members. jva.avca.org/EducationalResources/Webinars.aspx
We also have an article in our Club Director Resources Library HR section on Classifying Your Coaches as Independent Contractors or Employees available here with a JVA member login jva.avca.org/Portals/0/Classifying%20Your%20Coaches.pdf
We are in the process of reviewing our coaches stipends, pay scales, contracts, etc. Has the JVA developed a summary of this aspect to club organization?
We have survey results from 2012 (we will have another survey this season) that show 29% of clubs pay $301-$500 to elite head coaches/mo, 25% of clubs pay $501-$700/mo. The survey includes a lot of financial data & is also in our Club Director resources jva.avca.org/EducationalResources/ClubDirectorResources/Admi
1) I want to start an in house, youth (K-8) volleyball club in California (Mainly clinics, camps, lessons, maybe some internal leagues). I want to use the JVA for membership/insurance. 2) For non-profit status I was thinking of getting the level 3 club membership through AAU. Any thoughts/problems with combining these two memberships? Thanks for your time.
There is absolutely no problem with using JVA for insuring your camps, clinics and in house leagues. As a JVA member club you can purchase low cost insurance. More information available here jva.avca.org/Insurance.aspx For more information on the Level 3 Club Membership with AAU, it is best to check with AAU, I believe you may actually need to have a club with members. Email debby@aauvolleyball.org
Many of our members are members of AAU and JVA and utilize both insurance options for their programs. Please let us know if you have any additional questions.
We have a question about the "Rover defense"? Would you know of colleges that run this defense or who we could contact about more information?
The first view on the page below is a rover defense. The Art of Coaching material is restrict to members but JVA has a partner premium for members to receive a discount. http://www.theartofcoachingvolleyball.com/category/coaching-volleyball/defensive-systems/
We are in the process of reviewing and updating our coaches pay. Do you have any recent figures for the hourly rates and tournament stipends?
Based on our 2012 Financial Survey where we surveyed a pool of 100 club directors from around the country, 29% of clubs pay $300-500/month, 25% pay $501-$700/month and 25% pay $701-$1,000/month to Elite Head Coaches. 51% pay per diem, 49% do not. 43% of clubs that do provide per diem pay $20-$25/day, 33% pay $30-$35/day and 24% pay $40 or more per day. Most clubs reimburse for gas mileage to and from a tournament. For more junior volleyball education visit www.jvaonline.org. JVA members have access to more junior volleyball industry data in the JVA member resources.
JVA membership is for Club Directors and Club Coaches. Players are considered members of JVA clubs and are under the JVA umbrella, however there is no direct cost for membership. More information about JVA membership can be found here www.jvaonline.org/Membership.aspx
How do I handle inappropriate cheering from parents/fans of a 3rd grade community VB team when the league simply will not make a firm stand on the issue to alleviate the situation. The parents will sit in the stands & chant "Who let the dogs out," & cup their hands over their mouths, lower their voices, and bark 3 times during the entire game. I am a coach of one team in which the parents would bark throughout the entire game. This barking made my girls cry, including my daughter.
In our club environment we actually cover ‘over exuberance’ in our mandatory parent meeting. The example I often give is a scene I observed once at a tournament.
Our team won an important match. It was not a final, there was no hardware involved but the match set the stage for the team to advance. The kids, fully cognizant that it was a big win, but knowing much work remained celebrated ‘appropriately’. I looked over at the parent section and they were going crazy…running up and down the aisles high fiving each other, hugging each other…it looked like we won a national championship. It was a perfect example of how all too often parents take more seriously the youth sports
coach can reach out to the opposing coach in advance of the game and state her concerns and the impact this has had on her young athletes in the past. She can ask the coach to get a commitment from their parents in advance to refrain from this type of cheering and over exuberance in general. If they will not agree she can respectfully
forfeit. If no one will play that team; they will have little to cheer for. It will become yet another example of how parent behavior can ‘ruin’ the youth sports experience for children.
In conclusion, there is a book I bring 100 copies of each year to my parent orientation meeting. “TheFulfilling Ride: A Parent’s Guide to Helping Athletes Have a Successful Sport Experience by Dr. Greg Dale. I have even had Dr. Dale present to our staff. Every
year parents tell me the book changed the way they approach their child’s athletics. In the end, we have accepted that in addition to educating the young people in our program
we need to partner effectively with parents who often times need our guidance and experience to be the best supporter possible of the experience while allowing the child to fully own it.
I am coaching a 5th grade girls volleyball team and one of my players is not able to confidently serve underhand. Her serves are very light and she doesn't seem to get enough velocity in her swing or step to get the ball over the net. Is there any recommendations or drills to help her get more power behind her serves.
Chris - we apologize that this question was not answered immediately! It fell under the cracks somehow.. Is you are still working with this player, can you send a short video of her trying to serve so we can give some feedback? There could be several variables (toss, armswing, footwork, body position, etc) that could be assessed to help her and you.
I am looking to open up an indoor volleyball facility along with other sports. Where do I go to gather information about the costs associated with this sport? For example, the court, ceiling height requirements, extra seating for families during tournaments. I am also looking to lease the space out to a club. Any advice in this matter would be greatly appreciated!

Why are net violation not calling in tournament play but are during the school season? Should there be consistency when teaching our players?
The various associations that sanction volleyball competition have their own rule sets. The high school rules are set by the NFHS, National Federation of State High School Associations. http://www.nfhs.org/activities-sports/volleyball/. The junior club volleyball rules are set by USA Volleyball, the National Governing Body for the sport of volleyball in the United States, https://volleyballreftraining.com/rules_interpretations_indoor.php. There are also different rules for college competition and international competition.
The NFHS has a video on their web site that explains how the rules and developed and changes are adopted, http://www.nfhs.org/sports-resource-content/rules-writing-process-video/. The rules that USAV use try to match up with the FIVB but are modified somewhat to get a bit closer to the High School and College rules.
Here is a chart that compares the differences between the organizations, https://volleyballreftraining.com/techniques_pages/pdfs/Rule_Comparison_(NCAA-NFHS-USAV)_13-FINAL.pdf
We are in the process of building a facility here and need to order the flooring now. We need approximately 8,000 square feet. 1. Does any one have recommendations on the best locking floor tile system? 2. Does anyone have supplier contacts? 3. Does anyone have the tiles for sale (new or used)
Taraflex is doing a promotion with a few chosen JVA clubs where they will offer their floor at or below the cost of sport court. Their product comes very highly recommended by Club Directors. Contact Joe Corbett of Taraflex at jcorbett@gerflorusa.com For used sport court tiles, I would suggest contacting the people who lease volleyball courts as they turn over their courts every few years. There is another product out there that JVA has been using via NetLynx that has more cushioning than Sport Court, it is called Snap Court.
I have heard of clubs where the players help cleaning the courts every week. Do you know if this is part of a volunteer program offered or it is part of the contract? I would like to know how to handle this in order to avoid issues with parents or even legal? What ages we could have helping out? Are there volunteer programs? And how they usually run? Any information will be much appreciated
Our 7th grade "full season" players and older clean all 12 of our courts each day. We lay down about 10 damp beach size towels and a player pushes a towel for 2 courts and then switches with another player who is waiting 2 courts down. A group of players goes down one side of the gym and then a separate group comes back down the other side so all 12 courts are cleaned when we are done with practice. The whole process takes about 2-3 minutes. Our players are also in charge of sweeping the floor prior to pushing the wet towels, making sure the nets are tightened, balls are out, towels for floor wiping are hanging on the nets and anything else that needs to be done to prepare the gym for practice. Every team has "work duties" prior to the start of practice or after practice, but all the players are involved in keeping the floor clean.
Guiding Principles: Member Driven, Player Welfare, Affordability and Financial Responsibility, Transparency, Best Practices
Last blog I touched on parental involvement in club volleyball and my perspectives on that issue. Since that article, I've had a couple parent meetings regarding some team issues. The meeting started with a few very passionate comments about the level intensity during practice along with player instruction and how that was manifested in the team's match performances. This particular team had been practicing with less than 100% effort and in their most recent tournament, played hard but came up short at the end of each match. The parents' main take was that the coach needed to push the players harder, the players were not being taught the game, and they were not improving. Sitting there at the meeting listening to the parents' impassioned reasoning, I immediately flashed back to my last blog and chuckled to myself--I'm sure many of the club director veterans who had read my blog (if any actually had ?!), also had a pretty good chuckle. I had painted a pretty rosy and probably naÃ¯ve, picture here at Lex United, and maybe I just didn't have enough experience to be taking the positive opinion I espoused in the last blog. Click here to read the last blog post "Coaching the Parents."
But then I snapped back into the current, and after listening to all the different takes on the state of the team, I realized that this wasn't a coach issue; it was a parent-player issue. I had walked by this team's practice many times to observe how the players and the coach. Most of the time I saw a fairly talented, athletic group of 16 year olds going through the paces at about 70% of their capability. I also wanted to watch and listen to the coach and determine if there was enough teaching, motivation, intensity and respect coming from the instructor. I heard the coach say really good things, saw some nice drill ideas and segments and heard a lot of instruction and intensity relative to this coach's personality. I walked away thinking, these kids have got to figure out why they're doing this.
Back to the parent meeting, I turned the conversation towards their own children and what they were personally doing to improve themselves, how hard they worked in practice, how much they were committed to volleyball and finally, what their long-term goals were for the sport. The parents began self-evaluating their own kids and what began to emerge was the parents perhaps caring about the outcomes more than their daughters did. Parents are always competitive because they have experienced life and know how hard the real world is, how competitive life is, and how hard you have to work to achieve success. These players were going through the motions, blaming the coach and not taking any accountability for what THEY were GIVING to the process. In my experience as a coach, if a player cares about getting better, they will. The players who repeat the same mistakes every day, nod their head but aren't listening and never seem to grasp concepts are really just there for some other reason and not truly because THEY want to be there.
After getting off to a heated start, the meeting turned into a very reasoned, thoughtful conversation about player motivation, a coach's responsibility to motivate and inspire, and parents coming to the realization that perhaps they want it more than their kids. The sudden reality of this aspect of youth sports is very difficult for parents who have watched their tall, athletic daughters dominate the 4 year old soccer team, the nine year old basketball team, the middle school 200 meter track race, and the 13 and under volleyball tournaments. As the parents sat there and began to process the fact that their daughters might be more interested in other activities and are growing away from volleyball, I brought them back with some positive reinforcement. 1). If they are struggling, talk to the coach directly about the problem and what the resolution can be. 2). Parents get off their backs. Don't hover at practice, scowling at their mistakes or effort; you are causing them to effectively shut down. Yes, getting to the older age groups, 16's, 17's and 18's brings more pressure, expectation and competition, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't still be fun. Not every girl wants to play in college, so if that's not the goal, let's not say that it is. There is a place for everyone in this great sport, and it's crucial not to force all of our players to choose the same path because it's what they are SUPPOSED to want. Doing so only makes for lethargic, stressed out teams who don't care.
There are different ways to motivate, but parents allowing their daughters to play for the reasons that THEY want to play for is critical for the healthy attitude and enthusiasm of a club player. Every kid is different and by the age of 16, parents have to begin to let their daughter forge her own path. Guide the player, encourage the player and make sure the player knows whatever she decides to pursue, her effort and how hard she competes will be tied directly to her success. As a post-script to the meeting, I've noticed fewer parents at the practice, more intensity from players, a lot more smiles, and better connection and communication between players and coaches. Being a parent is not easy and letting your kid grow up isn't easy either, but I'm proud of this parent group for having the discipline to let their daughters tackle this on their own, and in effect, help them take a positive step towards personal responsibility and accountability.

Perhaps all you bright people can answer something for me? Were smocks or chemises ever made out of silk? I see them made fairly often by various re-enactors and they do look lovely. And I have, from time to time, came across a mention if it in costume books- that they were made either by linen or by silk. I have never, however, seen a source for this statement. Have you? Are there any sources that say this? The only one I’ve seen says linen, the richer the person, the finer the fabric.
So, is this just something re-enactors do because it looks nice, or because they have a hard time finding very fine linen? Or is there any source out there that lists silk for underwear? And if you have, for what time-period?
I have no idea. My guess would be that silk would have been impractical for a chemise. When the main goal of the chemise is to wick moisture away from the skin and protect your stays and gowns. Just a thought.
All my research (largely focused on the early 19th century) indicates the use of cotton, linen, cambric for chemises. In very cold climates, flannel for winter chemises and petticoats. The only deviation I can find is during the Directoire and Consulate in France when chemise gowns were made of silk and nothing was worn beneath them. That was really only in France and only for the period between 1795 and approximately 1802. Stockings are consistently made of silk throughout the century.
My sources on this are "The Mode in Costume" by R. Turner Wilcox and "English Women's Costume in the 19th Century" by C. Willet Cunnington (which actually addresses French and American fashion to some degree).
I am not claiming to know, but common sense and a little research tells me that linen is probably the more likely for all classes, since the base layer, the shirts and chemises and smocks, were what got soiled, rather than the gowns, and what were washed regularly. Silk couldn't be washed of course, so if there were silk chemises and undergarments, maybe they were for the very very very rich? Also, could silk shirts have been work over linen smocks and bodies, which would have protected the shirt as well as all other layers on top of it? Paintings/portraits suggest silk for shirts, but very very fine linen, depending on the weave, could also have a sheen to it...right?
I remember reading somewhere that silk was not used for shifts/chemises etc due to the impracticality of the fabric. Linen was the fabric of choice due to it's great ability to be bleached and washed often and maintain it's strength, and it's abilities to help keep the wearer comfortable in different climates. It's just a shame that it's difficult to find the quality linen that would have been used for really fine underclothes today....I remember at the Royal Armouries in Stockholm they had some of the old bloody shirts from one of the kings (the one who died in battle and has the stuffed horse) and all of his shirts were beautiful beautiful linen, even if they were blood stained. :)
I think the silk undergarments thing is something that was conceptualized during the 20th and 21st century because it's hard to think that someone so wealthy as a king would wear linen as opposed to silk, even though silk would have not been the best fabric. It's an idealization of generations past. :)
I agree with you- silk isn't exactly practical, even if it's pretty. I wish it was easier to find good quality fine linnen.

First of all, know that it is wajib to replace any obligatory `ibaadah when missed EXCEPT for salaah during menses. The proof of qazas are found in the Qur-aan and sunnah:
‘’However, should any one of you be sick or on a journey, then he should fast a number of other days(in replacement).’’(2:184)
The term qaza is Arabic whereby it means to replace what is missed. Over here clearly Allah Ta`ala orders us to replace missed fasts. Hence those who are healthy or have hope to be healthy should replace their fasts later on. Those ladies and girls that missed their fasts during menses or post natal bleeding should absolutely replace their fasts later on. Hazrat Aisah r.a. says that we were ordered to replace our missed fasts due to menses, but not salaah.’’(Muslim) Although qaza of salaah do exist, but due to monthly menses, we were exempted from replacing salaah and we had only to replace fasts missed.
Know that fidyah is only applicable to such sick patient that have no hope to be fit enough to replace their fasts. The fidyah is best given in money form since it is more beneficial for poor people. So the Fidyah of one fast is the same value of Sadaqatul Fitr.
The fidyah should be given to such a poor muslim that is so poor that he can take Zakaat. Such a poor person should not have nisaab in his possession. The fidyah of a whole Ramadhaan is 30 Sadaqatul Fitr(30 * Sadaqatul Fitr). The fidyah of one month may be given wholly and also can be given to one person only. And it can be given to such sick poor persons that are not fasting.
In case that someone cannot fast and is so poor that he cannot pay Fidyah, then the person need only to do istighfaar only.(Astaghfirullah Astaghfirullah). In case that a person is leaving properties and has fidyah amount due, then important that he makes will that his fidyah be paid. The fidyah will would be limited to only one third of the wealth, not more than that.
Know that salaah is prescribed in its prescribed time. Leaving salaah after its proper time is a major sin and is punishable. One should do sincere tawbah in such a case. And remember that the completion of tawbah is to replace missed salaahs.
The proof of replacing missed salaahs is found in ahadiths. It is reported in Nassai that the beloved prophet Swalallahou `Alaihi Wasallam missed 4 salaahs and hence replaced them at night. This is the first proof that if salaahs are missed, then they should be replaced:
Hazrat Abdullah r.a. says: ‘’The mushriks preoccupied the beloved prophet SAW that he missed 4 salaahs on the day of khandaq. He ordered Bilaal(at night) to give azaan and iqaamah and he read Zohr, then iqaamah and he read Assr, and then iqaamah and read maghrib and then finally iqaamah and read Esha.’’(Nassai)
Furthermore the beloved prophet SAW replaced Fajr salaah when he missed it during a tiresome travelling(Bukhari):
In this hadith of Bukhari, it is mentioned clearly that the beloved prophet SAW waited that the sun becomes white and shiny before doing the qaza. This entails the prohibition to do any salaah before about 15 minutes from sunrise.
Furthermore, the beloved prophet SAW said that whenever one misses salaah, then he should replace it when he recalls it(Muslim):
These ahadiths brings the concept of qaza and Qaza Umri. That is, if one misses salaahs during his life, then he should do tawbah and replace all the missed salaahs. Only one detail for those who have less than six salaahs missed on their account: They should always replace their missed salaahs in order. If not done in order purposely, then it should be redone in order.
But those who have six salaahs or more missed on their account, then they may replace their salaahs as they wish even without order.
Since salaahs need intention, then separate intentions should be made for each salaah. Easiest is to formulate these intentions: ‘’I intend replace my last Fajr that I missed during my life, I intend replace my last Zohr,etc.’’ This intention formula does not necessitate a table. One may stop replacing when one`s heart feels that one has replaced all missed salaahs. Sunnahs needs only istighfaar and no qaza umri for sunnahs. Yes, witr should be replaced.
In case that a person could not replace all his salaah during his lifetime, then he should make a will to give on his side the amount of fidyah for his salaahs. One salaah`s fidyah is the amount of the actual saqatul fitr. Fuqaha have prescribed replacement of salaah during lifetime and no fidyah applied for salaah. But one may do a will to that effect if ever death comes, then give from my side. This will would be subject to a limit of a maximum of one third of the estate he left. If he left little, then it is up to the inheritors to apply the will or leave it to one third of the estate.
Finally know that Qaza salaah have a priority over nafils. Hence one should rather do qaza umri than performing over above nafils.
Note: One should do all sunnah muakkadahs. One is recommended to do nafils like tahajud, ishraaq, salaatut-tasbeeh, chaast, ghair muakkadahs and awabin. And know that it is important sunnah to read tahiyatul masjid at least once in a day according to ahnaf.(Shami)But besides these nafils, one should involve in qazas of farzs and witr. One may do qazas after assr until 20 minutes before sunset. And also do qazas between sehri and before sunrise. But makrooh to read at sunrise until 15 minutes after that.

The use of standardised classifications, or operational definitions, is essential if different researchers are to measure and compare similar entities. In the marine realm, algal 'turfs' are increasingly reported to be globally expanding at the expense of kelps and canopy-forming algae. However, ecological research about the underlying drivers of this shift is limited by a vague and inconsistent definition of what exactly a turf is. In order to stimulate more effective descriptions of 'turfs' and facilitate communication of research outcomes and comparisons across studies, we reviewed the use of the term turf in ecological studies of temperate coasts and coral reefs and (1) identified the main types and distribution of algal assemblages known as 'turfs', (2) examined the descriptions of turfs so that we may recognise some general characteristics, including those contingent on environmental conditions; and (3) offered character descriptions that could improve communication and comparisons. These descriptors centre on reporting information on the morphology, height, density of thalli, the amount of sediment trapped in turfs and a description of the area covered by turfs, including their patchiness and persistence. Our review recognised these as common attributes that could be usefully described across a wide range of circumstances and provide insights into the ecology of turfs and their interactions with other assemblages in a community. The use of common descriptors would provide the term 'turf' with greater scientific value. © Inter-Research 2014., Seaweeds
Understanding how environmental signals regulate production of domoic acid in blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. at a molecular level requires description of the biochemical pathway to this kainoid neurotoxin. Precursor feeding studies have suggested domoic acid arises from the condensation of the C 10 isoprenoid geranyl diphosphate with glutamate, but the specific reactions leading to domoic acid from these precursors remain undescribed. Here, we develop a method to derivatize domoic acid with propyl chloroformate that enables gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to measure incorporation of stable isotopes into domoic acid generated in cultures incubated with isotopically-labeled substrates. We apply this method to demonstrate that both 2H from [1- 2H 2]geraniol are incorporated into domoic acid, suggesting that the condensation of geranyl diphosphate with an amino group occurs by nucleophilic substitution of the diphosphate rather than by oxidation of geraniol to the aldehyde before reaction with an amino group to form an imine. Ultimately, these and similar studies will facilitate the identification of DA biosynthetic enzymes and genes which will enable the study of how environmental factors regulate DA biosynthesis at the molecular level. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd., Seaweeds, CODEN: TOXIA
Storm-water drainage systems have potential to collect and focus nutrient enriched runoff into coastal systems. Storm-drain effluent could support macroalgal production and result in altered communities. To test this hypothesis, we assessed species composition and percent cover of native and non-native benthic macroalgae at eight intertidal sites along 'Ewa Beach, Hawai'i. Three sites contain storm-drainage outlets (drain 16-52. acres) that deliver effluent into the intertidal zone whereas five sites were located ≥ 100. m away and served as comparisons to determine differences related to the presence of storm-water. Results revealed lush and diverse macroalgal assemblages, similar at all sites. Furthermore, the abundance of non-native species (Acanthophora spicifera, Hypnea musciformis) was not related to presence of storm-drains. The finding that macroalgal assemblages are not related to storm-waters is contrary to an earlier investigation in the same location and underscores the importance of sampling design and habitat variation when assessing impacts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd., Seaweeds, CODEN: MPNBA, ,
Clonal kelp taxa may reproduce both sexually and vegetatively resulting in a potential trade-off in the allocation of acquired carbon and nitrogen resources. Such trade-offs may dictate a different response of clonal kelps to varying environmental conditions relative to aclonal kelp taxa. Laboratory temperature and nutrient manipulation experiments demonstrated that investment in sexual and vegetative reproduction in Laminaria sinclairii (Harv. ex Hook. f. et Harv.) Farl., C. L. Anderson et D. C. Eaton was regulated by different abiotic factors. Sorus production (investment in sexual reproduction) and blade growth were significantly higher at 12°C compared to 17°C, regardless of nutrient concentration. Net carbon storage and depletion in rhizomes were observed in the low- and high-temperature treatments, respectively, suggesting that carbon stores were not responsible for increased growth. Rhizome elongation (investment in vegetative reproduction), on the other hand, was significantly higher in 12μM NO3- than in 2μM NO3-, irrespective of temperature. This increase in rhizome growth was concurrent with elevated rhizome percent tissue nitrogen levels also observed in treatments with higher nutrients, again indicating a growth response to treatment independent of previous nutrient stores. These results suggest that regulation of growth and investment in sexual reproduction in L. sinclairii is similar to that in aclonal kelps (i.e., warmer temperatures result in decreased reproductive output). Additionally, depletion of carbon and nitrogen from rhizomes in suboptimal conditions confirms the role of clonal kelp rhizomes in carbon and nutrient storage. © 2011 Phycological Society of America., Seaweeds, CODEN: JPYLA, ,
Nitrogen (N) enrichment of tropical reefs can result in the dominance of invasive algae. The invasive alga Acanthophora spicifera and the native alga Laurencia nidifica are part of a diverse reef assemblage in 'Ewa Beach, O'ahu. Their N contents and δ15N values were investigated to determine if N was enriched and to evaluate potential nitrogenous sources near and removed from storm-drain outlets. δ15N values of algae (3.8-17.7‰) were within and above the range for algae around the island (1.9-11.9‰). Elevated algae N isotope values (δ15N>+7‰, [N]>1.6%) and seawater nitrate+nitrite levels (0.59-7.93μM) indicated a mixed, high nutrient environment. The overlap in δ15N values with multiple nitrogenous sources precluded identification. However, spatial and temporal patterns did not support stormwater as the dominant, nitrogenous source. Patterns were congruent with algal incorporation of terrestrial derived N, subjected to a high degree of biogeochemical cycling. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd., Seaweeds, CODEN: MPNBA, ,

Living rhodolith beds in the Gulf of California and their implications for paleoenvironmental interpretation,
Subtidal surveys in the southwestern Gulf of California indicate that rhodolith beds are widely distributed, major sources of carbonate sediments, and habitats of high biodiversity. Beds with abundant branched rhodoliths ranging in size from 2 to 10 cm (longest dimension) have been found in two main types of environments: (1) gently sloping, subtidal soft bottoms with moderate wave action (wave beds; 2 to 12 m deep), and (2) relatively level bottoms in channels with tidal currents (current beds; below 12 m). Large individuals (to 11 cm) with up to 1 cm thick, densely packed branches are also found dispersed among sand and cobbles on more wave exposed shores. The relative abundance of fruticose forms and the sphericity and branch density of individual thalli are generally higher in wave beds than in current beds. Morphology within wave beds varies along gradients of water motion, with higher branch densities, more apical branching, and more branch fusions present as water motion increases. The extent to which these morphological differences represent different taxa is being evaluated. The abundance of rhodoliths in Pliocene and Pleistocene carbonate deposits and modern sediments indicates that this community has long been an important feature of nearshore environments in the Gulf. Our results suggest that measurements of a combination of morphological characters in populations of fossil rhodoliths, combined with detailed, small-scale stratigraphic analyses, may provide good estimates of paleoenvironmental conditions., Cited By (since 1996):6, Seaweeds, ,
Application of color infrared aerial photography to assess macroalgal distribution in an eutrophic estuary, upper Newport Bay, California,
Newport Bay is a large estuary in southern California that is subject to anthropogenic nutrient loading, eutrophication, and hypoxia. Ground-based methods of assessing algal extent for monitoring and management are limited in that they cannot provide a synoptic view of algal distribution over comparatively large areas. The goal of this study was to explore the application of color infrared aerial photography as an alternative for analyzing the changes in the abundance of exposed macroalgae. Three surveys combining remote sensing (color infrared aerial photography) and ground-based sampling to quantify macroalgal mat coverage were carried out in Upper Newport Bay (UNB) between July and October 2005. Airborne photographs (scale 1:6000) collected during daytime low tides, clear skies, and appropriate sun angle were digitized to 25-cm resolution, orthorectified, georegistered, and combined into three mosaic composite digital images: one for each survey. During each aerial photography survey, macroalgal percent cover was measured on the ground by the point-intercept method in a 6.25-m2 area at ca. 30 locations distributed along the water's edge throughout the intertidal mudflat area. There were three main types of cover: Ulva spp. (green algae), Ceramium spp. (red algae), and bare surface (mud and mussel beds). To analyze similarities between spectral signatures in the images and cover types, the pixels corresponding to the ground samples from each survey were grouped into clusters based on similarity of their spectral signatures. To establish relationships between spectral signatures in the images and cover as determined from ground data, pixels in each composite image corresponding to ground samples from the same day that were characterized by > 90% of one cover type were attributed to that cover type. Ground samples comprised of a mixture of cover types were used for accuracy assessment. Before classification, each digital image was transformed by the Minimum Noise Fraction Rotation method to remove noise and enhance contrast between the classes. For classification of each composite image, the Spectral Angle Mapper scheme was used: all pixels in each image were attributed to the identified classes and the areal extent of each class was estimated. According to these assessments, the macroalgal coverage in UNB increased from 37% in July to 57% in September to 80% in October, and during this time Ulva spp. replaced Ceramium spp. as the dominant alga. This analysis showed that color infrared aerial photography is an effective tool for assessing estuarine, intertidal macroalgal coverage. © 2007 Estuarine Research Federation., Cited By (since 1996):6, Seaweeds, ,
Vegetative growth and fertility of kelp gametophytes are thought to be antagonistic, such that most successful kelp recruitment is assumed to result from fertilization of single oogonia released from unicellular female gametophytes. We used laboratory culture experiments to study the effect of temperature and nutrient addition on the per capita production of oogonia and sporophytes from Macrocystis pyrifera female gametophytes. Our results indicate that individual multicellular female gametophytes can give rise to more than one oogonium and that per capita oogonia production significantly increases with the enhancement of culture conditions (i.e., decreased temperature and increased nutrient concentration). Furthermore, the production of multiple oogonia per female often led to the production of multiple sporophytes per female. We discuss the importance of these results relative to variability in M. pyrifera life histories (e.g., annual vs. perennial) and their likely ecological and evolutionary consequences., Cited By (since 1996):11, Seaweeds
The kelp highway hypothesis: Marine ecology, the coastal migration theory, and the peopling of the Americas
In this article, a collaborative effort between archaeologists and marine ecologists, we discuss the role kelp forest ecosystems may have played in facilitating the movement of maritime peoples from Asia to the Americas near the end of the Pleistocene. Growing in cool nearshore waters along rocky coastlines, kelp forests offer some of the most productive habitats on earth, with high primary productivity, magnified secondary productivity, and three-dimensional habitat supporting a diverse array of marine organisms. Today, extensive kelp forests are found around the North Pacific from Japan to Baja California. After a break in the tropicswhere nearshore mangrove forests and coral reefs are highly productivekelp forests are also found along the Andean Coast of South America. These Pacific Rim kelp forests support or shelter a wealth of shellfish, fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and seaweeds, resources heavily used historically by coastal peoples. By about 16,000 years ago, the North Pacific Coast offered a linear migration route, essentially unobstructed and entirely at sea level, from northeast Asia into the Americas. Recent reconstructions suggest that rising sea levels early in the postglacial created a highly convoluted and island-rich coast along Beringia's southern shore, conditions highly favorable to maritime hunter-gatherers. Along with the terrestrial resources available in adjacent landscapes, kelp forests and other nearshore habitats sheltered similar suites of food resources that required minimal adaptive adjustments for migrating coastal peoples. With reduced wave energy, holdfasts for boats, and productive fishing, these linear kelp forest ecosystems may have provided a kind of kelp highway for early maritime peoples colonizing the New World., Cited By (since 1996):22, Seaweeds
Giant kelp forests are marine communities dominated by the large brown alga Macrocystis pyrifera. Stands of this species occur along the outer coast of the E Pacific from near Santa Cruz in central California to the central coast of Baja California, Mexico. Plants are usually attached to rocky substrata at depths of 5-20m. These submarine forests are probably the most species-rich, structural complex and productive communities in temperate waters., Cited By (since 1996):51, Seaweeds, ,
Successful kelp recruitment is important for kelp population persistence and associated kelp forest communities. The proximity of settled kelp zoospores is a known requirement for successful kelp recruitment and proximity can be increased as zoospores aggregate. Substrate rugosity can also be an important factor affecting macroalgal settlement and recruitment in wave-swept areas, and may affect kelp recruitment by aggregating zoospores. In this study, kelp zoospores were cultured at different levels of small-scale aggregation and kelp recruitment was quantified. Sporophyte production significantly increased as zoospores became more aggregated indicating that processes that aggregate kelp zoospores have the potential to enhance kelp recruitment. A 13-month field experiment demonstrated differential kelp recruitment onto settlement plates that mimicked surface rugosities of two common rock types within Stillwater Cove, Carmel Bay in central California (Carmelo Formation sandstone and Santa Lucia granodiorite). Significantly more kelp recruited to molds mimicking granodiorite over the yearlong study (granodiorite = 2.7 recruits ± SE 0.50, sandstone = 1.2 recruits ± SE 0.51). There was a significant difference in recruitment between seasons and this variability was due to the fact that spring had the highest average number of kelp recruits per mold. However, the interaction between substrate and season was not significant. This study emphasizes the importance of kelp zoospore aggregation on kelp recruitment and demonstrates that small-scale rugosity affects kelp recruitment. © 2012 Phycological Society of America., Cited By (since 1996):1, Seaweeds, CODEN: JPYLA, ,
Cited By (since 1996):19 Seaweeds, CODEN: MESED, In March 1989, the 'Exxon Valdez' spilled over 10 million gallons (ca 38 million I) of crude oil into Prince William Sound, Alaska , USA. The spill was followed by massive clean-up using hot seawater at high pressure as well as other mechanical and chemical techniques. We studied initial damage and subsequent recovery in the upper margin of the Fucus gardneri assemblage on protected shores by comparing sites that were unoiled, oiled and cleaned with hot water at high pressure, and oiled but less intensely cleaned. F. gardneri cover averaged 80% on unoiled sites but< 1 % on all oiled and cleaned sites 18 mo after the spill. The abundances of barnacles, littorine snails and limpets varied among sites and species, and this variation was associated in part with differences in their life histories. F. gardneri cover was still extremely low on oiled and cleaned sites 2.5 yr after the spill. Holdfasts that persisted after cleaning did not resprout. F. gardneri recruitment was lowest at intensely cleaned sites, and most recruits occurred in cracks near adults. Recruits were less abundant under adult canopies but placing canopies over recruits did not decrease their survivorship over 5 mo. Natural weathering of tar was rapid, with most marked patches gone in less than 1 yr. We conclude that intense mechanical cleaning following this oil spill increased damage and slowed recovery. Such methods should be avoided if reduction of environmental damage is the primary objective of post-spill management decisions. The recovery of F. gardneri at its upper margin might be enhanced by devices that retain moisture and increase substratum rugosity., ,
Macrocystis (Lessoniaceae) displays an antitropical distribution, occurring in temperate subtidal regions along western North America in the northern hemisphere and throughout the southern hemisphere. We used the noncoding rDNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) to examine relatedness among (1) Macrocystis and several genera of Laminariales, (2) four species of Macrocystis (M. integrifolia Bory from the northern hemisphere, M. angustifolia Bory and M. laevis Hay from the southern hemisphere, and M. pyrifera [L.] C. Ag. from both hemispheres), and (3) multiple clones of several individuals. Of the taxa included in our phylogenetic analysis, the elk kelp, Pelagophycus porra (Lem.) Setch., was the sister taxon to Macrocystis spp. Macrocystis individuals from the southern hemisphere (representing three species) formed a strongly to moderately supported clade, respectively, when the ITS1 and ITS2 sequences were analyzed separately. No distinction was detected between the two species in the northern hemisphere. Thus, Macrocystis may be a monospecific genus (M. pyrifera). A northern-hemisphere-to-southern-hemisphere pattern of dispersal was inferred, because northern-hemisphere individuals were more diverse and displayed paraphyletic clades, whereas southern-hemisphere individuals were less diverse and formed a monophyletic clade. High intraindividual variation in ITS1 sequences was observed in one individual from Santa Catalina Island (CA), suggesting very recent and rapid mixing of genotypes from areas to the north and Baja California (Mexico) or introgressive hybridization with Pelagophycus., Cited By (since 1996):67, Seaweeds, CODEN: JPYLA
Field experiments at two sites assessed the effects of insolation and gastropod grazing on the distribution and abundance of Prasiola meridionalis Setchell et Gardner, a green alga that occurs in the upper splash zone (supralittoral) on guano-covered rocks. At site 1, a sun-exposed horizontal rock where the alga occurs seasonally and grazers were rare, blades appeared in the early spring and died back in early summer. Lack of gastropod grazers and persistence of blades in experimentally shaded plots showed that increased insolation or some associated factor (or factors) was responsible for temporal variation at this site. At site 2, the alga grew in a distinct, perennial band on a shaded vertical rock face with abundant gastropod grazers. These grazers were excluded from long vertical plots that extended from the lower portion of the P. meridionalis band down to a zone of the red alga Endocladia muricata (Postels et Ruprecht) J. Agardh more than 2 m below. The results showed that grazing set the proximate lower limit of P. meridionalis at site 2, and variation in the abundance of the alga within its zone at this site was associated with seasonal climate changes and feeding by mites. Thus, while insolation and grazing can both affect populations of P. meridionalis, their relative importance varied between sites., Cited By (since 1996):4, Seaweeds, CODEN: PYCOA, ,
We examined the effects of shade from multiple kelp canopy layers (surface Macrocystis pyrifera canopy, understory Pterygophora californica canopy), both individually and in combination, on an understory algal assemblage in a central Californian kelp forest. The removal of both kelp canopies resulted in a dense recruitment of the understory brown alga Desmarestia ligulata that formed a third canopy layer, which significantly decreased bottom light and the abundance of understory red algae. We subsequently created an additional canopy treatment by removing this third canopy layer. In general, the understory red algae fluctuated seasonally with winter swell intensity, changes in kelp canopy cover, and grazing; and although species richness increased significantly with increased bottom light, red algal bottom cover did not respond significantly to the canopy clearings until 2 yr after the canopies were initially cleared. Red algal cover within the Pterygophora canopy treatment was similar to that in the control treatment. In the absence of Pterygophora, the Macrocystis canopy treatment and 'no canopy' treatment were found to have greater red algal cover and species richness. Individual understory species were rare, which resulted in small effects sizes and thus low statistical power. However, when grouped post hoc, according to how they responded to the canopy clearings (i.e. response groups), we were able to detect canopy treatment effects as much as 1 yr earlier. This method identified that some understory red algae adapted to areas of canopy removal (light-adapted), and others adapted to a variety of light regimes (shade-tolerant). We were able to classify the light-adapted algae into 2 subgroups: the high-light species and the intermediate-light species. Although this method of grouping was done post hoc, our results indicate that it may provide the clearest assessment of how understory algae respond to shading from kelp canopies., Cited By (since 1996):40, Seaweeds, CODEN: MESED, ,
A cDNA-encoding glutamime synthetase (GS) was isolated from the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve by PCR amplification. Nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequences of the diatom GS were greater than 50% identical to GS from green algae and vascular plants, and phylogenetic analysis established the diatom GS as a member of the GSII gene family. The presence of an N-terminus signal sequence, identified on the basis of sequence similarity with other chloroplast-localized proteins from diatoms, suggests that the encoded GS isoenzyme is localized to the chloroplast. The GS mRNA was present in log-phase cells grown with either nitrate or ammonium as the sole added nitrogen source. Results from Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA suggested that the cDNA isolated in this study was either a member of a small, highly conserved gene family or that there was allelic variation within the region examined. Phylogenetic analyses further indicated that genes encoding GS from the diatom and two species of green algae diverged prior to the gene duplication, to the isoenzymes in vascular plants, supporting the hypothesis that GS isoenzymes in diatoms, green algae, and vascular plants arose through independent evolutionary events., Cited By (since 1996):16, Seaweeds, CODEN: JPYLA, ,
Recreational SCUBA diving has greatly increased in the past 20 years and has potential to cause significant disturbances to subtidal reefs. While diver disturbance on coral reefs has been assessed in a number of studies, disturbances in temperate kelp forests have not been previously examined. We estimated diver disturbance in southern Monterey Bay giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, forests by following 42 divers in summer 1997 and recording their activity. During a 0.5 hour dive, the average diver contacted the bottom 43 times, touched 4 animals, and detached 2 algal blades. An estimated 65,000 diver-days are spent in these kelp forests every year, resulting in a potential loss of 130,000 algal blades and considerable benthic disturbances. The effects of these impacts and mitigation for them should be considered in proposals to establish and manage marine protected areas., Cited By (since 1996):2, Ecology, Seaweeds, ,
Pleurophycus gardneri (Laminariales) is common in the low intertidal of the Northeast Pacific, but dominates many deep (30 to 40 m) rocky reefs in central California. Seasonal dynamics of productivity and resource allocation of a deep-water population of this deciduous, stipitate kelp were studied to understand how blade abscission affects the annual carbon budget. Patterns of growth, metabolism, and carbon storage and mobilization were measured monthly for 1 yr relative to in situ light and temperature, and used to model the annual carbon budget. The resulting carbon budget was used to determine if blade abscission effectively reduced respiratory demand during the winter period of low light availability. Metabolic properties (photosynthesis, photoacclimation, and respiration) were seasonally constant and showed evidence of photoacclimation to this deep, low-light environment. Blades grew between February and July, followed by senescence and sloughing from August to December. Concentrations of laminaran and mannitol increased in the blades from the onset of sloughing in August until just prior to blade abscission in mid-December, suggesting translocation of these carbohydrates may have occurred from the blade to the stipe and holdfast. Carbon budget estimates revealed that scalar irradiance measures overestimated the light available for photosynthesis of these paddle-shaped kelp blades by 50 to 75%. The calculations also revealed that blade retention allowed for the maintenance of positive carbon balance throughout the year. Thus, conservation of the internal carbon reserve for metabolic survival during the low-light period does not appear to be a viable explanation for the deciduous life history of P. gardneri. Abscission may reduce hydrodynamic drag, thus minimizing the probability of dislodgment of entire plants during winter storm events, or promote spore dispersal as abscised blades and sori drift away from the parent holdfast. © Inter-Research 2006., Cited By (since 1996):3, Seaweeds, CODEN: MESED, ,
Cover of geniculate coralline algae is significantly greater on subtidal platforms than on vertical walls in a central California kelp forest. To determine the cause(s) of this pattern, settlement and growth of Calliarthron were compared on horizontal and vertical substrata attached to platforms or walls. Recruitment on horizontal substrata attached to reef walls indicated that spores were abundant along the walls. Densities of recruits were significantly smaller on vertical substrata attached to walls than on horizontal substrata attached to platforms, indicating that Calliarthron settlement is reduced on vertical substrata. Growth of basal crusts and the densities of fronds were also significantly greater on horizontal substrata attached to platforms than on vertical substrata attached to walls. Irradiance reaching wall surfaces was less than irradiance reaching platform surfaces. We suggest that light reaching wall surface is low enough to affect Calliarthron growth. These results indicate that the low abundance of Calliarthron on subtidal walls is a result of poor recruitment and slow growth. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Experiments in a central California Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C.A. Agardh forest examined the effects of long-term (six year) kelp canopy exclusion on the abundance of the annual brown alga Desmarestia ligulata (Light F). Exclusion of both surface and subsurface kelp canopies from replicate clearings within stillwater Cove, CA, USA showed that D. ligulata sporophyte recruitment is opportunistic, with more sporophytes occurring in areas where canopies were excluded than under control canopies. Kelp canopy exclusion also increased spring and summer bottom irradiances, and resulted in a steady increase of perennial turf algae over the six-year study. This, in turn, led to a decrease in the availability of nongeniculate coralline algae (the primary substratum on which D. ligulata recruits). Subsequently, the annual maximum abundance of D. ligulata sporophytes decreased in the Canopy clearings, but did not change under control canopies. Removal of turf algae from experimental plots further increased bottom irradiances and significantly enhanced D. ligulata recruitment. When released from apparent competition for light and space, D. ligulata sporophytes exhibited an annual life history, with recruitment occurring during a two-week period (April 4- April 17) in the spring, and maximum bottom cover occurring in the summer (July). The onset of Desmarestia sporophyte recruitment was closely associated with seasonal increases in daylength and rapid decreases in ocean temperature. These results indicate that the Desmarestia sporophyte life history is both annual and opportunistic, with the onset of recruitment stimulated by predictable, seasonal changes in environmental conditions, and the magnitude of recruitment modified by stochastic processes that affect the availability of light and space. Comparison of these results with those from similar studies indicate that they are robust and suggest that they may be generalized over broad temporal and spatial scales., Cited By (since 1996):43, Seaweeds, CODEN: JEMBA, ,
The Maltese Government has put into action the scheme set out by the Ministry of Justice & Local Government, to restore various properties around the Maltese islands. Local Councils were asked to propose sites in need of restoration, of which they produced 25 different sites. Out of these 25 submissions, 6 of them have been approved for renovation. These sites are:
Chapel of St John in Siggiewi[/caption]The church was built in 1730 together with a residence for the priest in charge and a Capuchin hospital. The church was administered by the Capuchins during WWII. Nowadays it is used for Perpetual Adoration Monday to Saturday.
This Chapel is said to have been built in 1223 by banished inhabitants of Celano, Italy. It was previously Gharghur’s Parish Church. Bishop Balaguer closed it in 1659 but it was rebuilt in 1675 and re-opened for service.
Our Lady of Mount Carmel is the title given to the Blessed Virgin Mary in her role as patroness of the Carmelite Order. The first Carmelites were Christian hermits living on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land during the late 12th and early to mid-13th century.
The Tal-Matla wall is located just behind the reservoir of Mqabba, and served as a footpath into the village cemetery and for those farmers who had their fields in the area.
As are most houses in this village, this house is very old and they belonged to important Knights of St John. The Knights had various houses in different villages. Safi was no exception and such buildings are indeed common in all Maltese villages.
The Sanctuary known as San Pawl tal-Ħġejjeġ was built by Grand Master Alof de Wignacourt. The church was completely destroyed during an air-raid in 1943 and was rebuilt on the original designs in 1957. It has three paintings depicting scenes of St Paul’s shipwreck, attributed to Cassarino although others attribute them to Lionello Spada, both disciples of Caravaggio.
In the past 3 years this scheme has restored over 50 different properties and sites in 31 different localities, with intentions to keep that number growing.
Obviously softwoods will tend to be softer than hardwoods, but try to get a sense of how it compares to other known woods. Density and hardness are closely related, so if the wood is heavy, it will most likely be hard too. If the wood is a part of a finished item that you can’t adequately weigh, you might be able to test the hardness by gouging it in an inconspicuous area. Also, if it is used in a piece of furniture, such as a tabletop, a general idea of its hardness can be assessed by the number and depth of the gouges/dings in the piece given its age and use. A tabletop made of pine will have much deeper dents than a tabletop made of Oak. Additionally, you can always try the “fingernail test” as a rough hardness indicator: find a crisp edge of the wood, and with your fingernail try to push in as hard as you can and see if you’re able to make a dent in the wood.
If there is even a chance that the color isn’t natural, the odds are increased that the entire effort of identifying the wood will be in vain. Many woods, when left outside in the elements, tend to turn a bland gray color. Also, even interior wood also takes on a patina as it ages: some woods get darker, or redder, and some even get lighter or lose their color; but for the most part, wood tends to darken with age. The most predictable baseline to use when identifying wood is in a freshly sanded state. This eliminates the chances of a stain or natural aging skewing the color diagnosis of the wood. Most softwoods will be almost perfectly smooth with no grain indentations, while many common hardwoods have an open pore structure, such as Oak or Mahogany; though there are some hardwoods that are also smooth to the touch, such as Maple. By observing the grain patterns, many times you can tell how the board was cut from the tree. Some wood species have dramatically different grain patterns from plainsawn to quartersawn surfaces. For instance, on their quartersawn surfaces, Lacewood has large lace patterns, Oak has flecks, and Maple has the characteristic “butcher block” appearance. Some species of wood have figure that is much more common than in other species: for example, curly figure is fairly common in Soft Maple, and the curls are usually well-pronounced and close together. Yet when Birch or Cherry has a curly grain, it is more often much less pronounced, and the curls are spaced farther apart.

In Listening to Mothers in California, black mothers reported not being heard by their health providers and said they experienced discrimination during childbirth. They also experienced higher rates of anxiety and depression during and after pregnancy than white women.
The findings add fuel to a growing sense of urgency on maternal health. On Wednesday, California Gov. Brown signed into law that will help pregnant and new mothers get help for maternal mood disorders.
The survey, which looked at 2,539 California women who had given birth to a single baby in a hospital in 2016, was conducted by the , and funded by the and the and released earlier this month.
“It’s so disheartening that we did find over and over so many areas where black women were suffering the most,” said , lead investigator on the report and director of Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families.
Black women in the U.S. are more likely to experience pregnancy-related death than white women. Black infants are before their first birthday than white infants. And, the that many black women experience can have detrimental health effects, the risk of premature birth.
While 82 percent of black women surveyed agreed that “childbirth should not be interfered with unless medically necessary,” the report showed that 42 percent of black women gave birth by cesarean section, compared to 29 percent of white women.
Black women were also more likely to have repeat C-sections: only 8 percent of black women had vaginal births after cesareans, compared to 16 percent of white women.
But black women did have a “deep interest in something else,” said Sakala. “When we asked about future interest in having midwifery care, in having a doula, having a birth center birth or a home birth, they most strongly expressed an interest in those more user-friendly forms of care.”
While the survey deliberately oversampled black mothers in order to better grasp the issues they face, one expert said it didn’t go far enough.
“It’s helpful, but for me, it’s not novel,” said , a nursing professor at the University of California, San Francisco who was not involved with the survey. “We know that there are health-related disparities in terms of pregnancy and birthing. We already knew that.”
McLemore said truly listening to mothers would go beyond “representing them numerically” through surveys.
“That’s going to require some other emancipatory or participatory method to be able to ensure that they are included at all levels of the project, including its design, its implementation, its analysis,” she said. “Because otherwise, we’ll keep generating reports that are describing disparities of information that we already know.”
McLemore also pointed to the fact that the main survey team was made up solely of white people. She said she would have asked different questions.
The survey “doesn’t answer the question ‘Has your mistreatment during your birth, all the disrespect and everything that you have had to deal with, is that influencing your future health care seeking behaviors?’” she said. “‘Is that influencing whether or not you will expand your family?’”
McLemore said the survey also doesn’t shed light on the question of whether black women are less likely to enter the health care workforce because of negative experiences with maternity care.
The survey did find that black mothers had more postpartum visits than their non-black peers, which Sakala said may mean that they had more postpartum challenges for which they sought help.
Over the past decade, California has emerged as a national leader in maternity care. The works with state agencies to , and . and publishes cesarean rates by hospital. Covered California, the state’s health insurance marketplace, has given hospitals an ultimatum to reduce their unnecessary cesarean rates or . And, according to a new report from that skewers the U.S. for its terrible treatment of mothers, California is one of just a handful of states that actually reviews maternal deaths and tries to learn from them.
One of the authors of the Listening to Mothers survey praised California for its transparency in reporting hospital maternity care statistics, such as cesarean rates.
“In a lot of states, it’s almost impossible to find out a hospital’s cesarean rate,” said Eugene R. Declercq in a recent webinar. Declercq is a professor of community health sciences at Boston University School of Public Health who also led earlier national Listening to Mothers surveys. “But in many states now that’s public information, and public information that consumers can and should be using.”
That doesn’t mean California has solved all its maternity care problems. For journalists covering the beat, it’s worth examining disparities in care among women with private insurance versus Medi-Cal, the state health insurance program for low-income residents. The survey found that women on Medi-Cal were twice as likely as those with private insurance to report not having a choice in who they saw for care.
Another realm ripe for reporting is maternal mood disorders. Thirty percent of black women reported anxiety during pregnancy, compared to 20 percent of white women, according to the California survey. Fourteen percent of black women reported feeling anxiety following the births of their babies, compared to 12 percent of white women.
Reporting on maternal mental health is especially timely right now. In addition to the new laws in California, nationally, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently updated its recommendation that doctors screen pregnant and new moms to identify those most at risk of becoming depressed.
The National Partnership for Women & Families published a report earlier this summer in the U.S. Previously, the organization from 2002 through 2013. They’re looking for funding to do another national one, Sakala said.
“Our survey uncovers the strong disconnect between what [mothers] would like and what they’re getting,” Sakala said. “In our system, childbearing women are likely to get the model of care that the providers and the facility or setting is prepared to provide. It’s not customized on the range of needs that appear … so that’s a problem.”
