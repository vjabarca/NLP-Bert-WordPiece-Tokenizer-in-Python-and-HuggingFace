She reveals that once the immigrants first arrive, their wisdom of English, their abilities and contacts, their self-respect, and their confident evaluate of yank race relatives facilitate their integration into the yank financial constitution. through the years, even though, the realities of yankee race kinfolk start to swamp their optimistic cultural values. continual, blatant racial discrimination quickly undermines the openness to whites the immigrants have once they first arrive. Discrimination in housing channels them into neighborhoods with insufficient urban prone and excessive crime premiums. Inferior public faculties undermine their hopes for his or her kid's destiny. Low wages and bad operating stipulations aren't any longer appealing for his or her young children, who use American and never Caribbean criteria to degree luck. finally, the values that won those first-generation immigrants preliminary success-a willingness to work flat out, a scarcity of recognition to racism, a hope for schooling, an incentive to save-are undermined by way of the realities of existence within the usa. in lots of households, the hard-won relative good fortune of the oldsters is by way of the downward slide in their little ones. opposite to long-held ideals, Waters unearths, those that withstand Americanization are probably to prevail economically, particularly within the moment iteration.

With more than 240K Twitter followers and a national TV audience tuning in to watch Dr. V. host the latest season ofMarriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars on WE TV, Venus Nicolino, has spread her non-nonsense approach to self-help far and wide. Now in her first-ever book, Bad Advice: How to Survive and Thrive in an Age of Bullshit (HarperOne; Hardcover; November 6, 2018), the on-air doc who melds the brains and insight of a nerdy Ph.D. with the heart of a doting Italian Mother and the artful profanity of a Philly trucker, is hoping to end the practice of dispensing of bad advice once and for all.
Dr. V is launching her book with an appearance at the Barnes & Noble at the Grove on November 8 at 7 pm.
In an effort to keep our family blog, The Parker Pack, from being overrun by pregnancy photos and updates, I’ve started this blog, A Belly in Bloom, to record my voyage through these next 9 months. Check back often for belly pics, sonograms, and just general posts about Mom’s thoughts throughout this journey. Keep watching our original blog, The Parker Pack, to see videos, photos, and more from our day-to-day lives.
On Tuesday, I woke up feeling horribly down and emotional (see my blog post) and out of sorts. Little did I know that all of those emotions were probably due to my body getting ready for labor!
Tuesday night, after a long day, I climbed into the tub to relax. I started having contractions in the bath, and noticed that they seemed really close together. I figured they'd probably quit, since I had been having contractions for weeks now, and just stayed in the tub. When I got out, I began timing them--and they were 2 minutes apart, lasting only 30 seconds, and not very strong. I figured it was just my uterus acting weird again and decided to watch TV with Brad.
My contractions started spacing out and getting longer and stronger, but since they had started out closer together and weak, I figured they were still just Braxton Hicks. After several hours, about 10:30 PM, the contractions stabilized at every 5 minutes and began getting pretty intense, so I called my doctor for some advice--I knew it was going to take family members at least an hour to get to our house to care for Aiden, so I didn't want to wait too late, but I didn't want to rouse the troops and be sent home from the hospital for a false alarm, either. The doc called me back at midnight and told me that I was probably in early labor, but that I could labor at home until I felt them getting really intense--he encouraged me to trust my body, that I would know when to come in.
The contractions were too strong to really let me sleep, so I cat-napped on the couch between contractions, which were now about 4 minutes apart. At around 4 AM I put out the call, knowing I'd want to go to the hospital soon. Brad and I got to Medical Center of Plano around 6:30 AM and I was hooked up to the monitors. I was contracting every 4-5 minutes and had dilated to 3 cm, so they admitted me and monitored me for a while, then I got up and began walking the halls, hoping to speed things up.
Several hours later, after many walks and a couple of catnaps, they checked me again and found I was still at 3 cms, despite hours of regular contractions. The nurse put a call in to my doc, who suggested that I consider either Pitocin or having my water broken. He was at the office and had meetings to attend, so I had a couple of hours to decide what I wanted to do and to see if things would speed up on their own.
I think I must have walked about 100 miles that day! We tried natural induction methods, like nipple stimulation and walking, but when the doc arrived at 2:00 PM, I was still at 3 cm, so I agreed to have my water broken--we figured this might be enough to get things moving along, but I would be able to avoid the really intense and close-together Pitocin-induced contractions. Doc broke my water, then I was up and walking the halls again.
Within a couple of hours, the contractions got much stronger and more intense. I walked for a while, sat on the birth ball, kept moving around, and then got into the shower with the birth ball when things really got tough. I stayed in the shower for probably an hour, and despite a small flood of the bathroom floor when I blocked the drain with the ball (oops!), the water felt great and kept me relaxed between contractions. I was in a lot of pain during the contractions, but I was able to rest and relax in between, so I kept laboring naturally. Pretty soon, it was time for me to be monitored, so I had to climb out of the shower and back in to bed. This was absolute torture--at this point, my contractions were 3 minutes apart and lasting about a minute, and I was in a ton of pain. They checked my cervix and informed me I was only dilated to a 5, maybe a 6, so at this point, I threw in the towel and asked for an epidural. Had I been dilated to an 8, I could have gutted it out, but I still had 4-5 cms to go, which had taken me 22 hours to accomplish so far, with no sleep, so I knew I was just too exhausted to continue.
The nurse hooked me up to an IV and began running fluids in so I could get the epidural, and about an hour later, my best friend (a.k.a. the guy with the drugs) came in and gave me the epidural. He gave me what I really wanted--a light "walking" epidural that would take the edge off, but I could still move my legs around and change positions in the bed, and I could still feel my contractions.
A few minutes after getting the epidural, my blood pressure dropped and I got the shakes. Aubrey's heart rate dropped with it, and so they put me on oxygen and began moving me around to find a good position that would make her happy. The charge nurse came in and began working with my nurse, and she asked how I was feeling. I told her I was feeling a lot of pressure and described where, and she suggested that my nurse check me. It had been 15 minutes since my epidural, and I had just dilated from 6 cm to 8! They now knew why my blood pressure had dropped and Aubrey was having the decelerations in her heart rate--the quick descent and change had stressed her (and me) out. She rebounded within a minute or two and started doing well again, so they began prepping the room and getting things set-up, figuring I didn't have much longer to go. But even the nurses didn't expect me to go as fast as I did--in 15 minutes, I was complaining of a ton of pressure in my butt and groin and feeling like I needed to push, so they checked me again: I was completely dilated and Aubrey's head was practically ready to be delivered!
The nurses began scrambling and calling my doc to hurry up, while I panted and tried to not push. The nursery team and all of the delivery team were in place, I was in position, when my doc came in and quickly suited up. I pushed through 3 contractions and Aubrey was delivered--an hour after having received my epidural! 24 hours of labor, 23 of them natural and dragging along, then 1 very fast hour and she was delivered!
The delivery itself was great. With Aiden, I had had so many complications, from spiking a fever and getting a uterine infection, to having to be on medication for pre-eclampsia, to multiple decelerations in Aiden's heart rate that resulted in him having to be vacuum-extracted. When he was born, he was instantly whisked away to the NICU and I didn't get to hold him but for about a minute. But with Aubrey, I got to watch her delivery in the mirror (which I know would freak some people out, but to me, it was amazing to see), and then she was placed on my tummy for me to touch and hold as soon as she was delivered. They kept her in the room to be quickly cleaned up, then brought her to me and I was able to hold her and nurse her for a couple of hours before they came and took her to the nursery to be bathed and assessed. My doc was so relaxed and encouraging, my nurses were fantastic, everyone was laughing and joking and happy--it was such a great experience all around. It was a joyous time that matched the excitement of the moment of bringing my daughter into this world.
I've gotten plenty of advice on things to try to get labor started--most of them I've already been doing, some of them are just plain silly, and a couple border on dangerous or sound amazingly uncomfortable, so I'll just skip those! By the way, I don't think I've ever had so many people encourage me to have sex in my life!
I promise, everyone, when we go to the hospital, I'll post on the blog before we leave and will send an email to everyone I have an email for. After that, I'm sure you'll get phone calls from each other as to when Aubrey arrives--the family/friend phone tree has a surprising way of working on its own. And some time after the birth, I'll post pictures and the birth story on the blog.
Until then, I'm waiting.... I think I'm going to go crazy or broke trying to come up with things to distract me and keep me busy until she gets here!
We're getting close! The bags are packed, care is lined up for Aiden, I'm officially on maternity leave, we've found people to cover our class of 5th and 6th graders at church, and we are SO anxious for her to get here! Now, if Aubrey will just get with the program and decide to join us on the outside, we'd be all set!
At my weekly sonogram, she looked great--measuring 7 lbs. 12 ozs, her measurements actually putting her a little ahead of schedule. She is practicing her breathing so often that now, I'll see my belly rising and falling with her "breaths." Her movements are great, the fluid volume is still optimal, and her umbilical cord is still functioning very well, so there's no rush to get her out...but her daddy and I would be very happy if she'd decide to join us sooner rather than later!
I walk with a decided waddle these days--between my pubic bone having split entirely (no cure except delivery of the baby), my back having long ago moved out of alignment, and some major sciatic nerve pain, by the day's end, my walk looks pretty awful. But that's OK--I have the "cankles" and swollen feet to match the waddle, so it's all good! My weight gain has seemed to stall at 36 pounds, but I think my butt is getting wider by the moment. I'm swollen everywhere these days--my face, my hands, my entire legs, but since my blood pressure has stayed low, my doc isn't concerned. But my engagement ring has been abandoned to my jewelry box and most of my shoes (including all of my cute fall boots) are sitting quite dejectedly at the back of my closet until after baby arrives, since I can no longer stuff my feet into them.
I know she'll be here soon enough--but what is it about these last few weeks of pregnancy that make every women wonder whether she'll be the first woman to stay pregnant forever? Or that she'll deliver by "uterine explosion" instead of vaginally or by c-section? I know, ridiculous, but these thoughts have crossed my mind!
...if there is a place on a pregnant woman's body you can push/bang on in order to get the kid out? You know, how on a ketchup bottle, if you turn it to just the right angle and tap on the 57, the ketchup comes pouring out? I need to find that spot on my body, thank you, 'cause I'm sick of having this kid in me! Get her out, please! Maybe if I lean back at a 45 degree angle and someone taps my belly button....
By the way, before you leave me some dirty, perverted comment on where I can be "banged," just remember who you are talking to and how I got into this mess in the first place...you can bet Brad and I have already tried all of the "obvious" spots to no avail! :) All you perverts should be ashamed....
If Aubrey were to come today, she would be considered full-term, so I am officially hanging the "No Vacancy" sign in my uterus.
On Friday, I went to my OB for a check-up and my weekly NST. Aubrey is doing great--her heart rate is still in the normal range and shows good variability. My doc also checked my cervix to see if I'd made any progress, and he informed me that I'm not even quite dilated to 1 cm yet. What?! I'm still at the same dilation I was before, when I started having early labor contractions at 31 weeks! Even after all these weeks of Braxton Hicks, nothing, no progress.
My doc told me we'd schedule my induction for 40 weeks at my next appointment, but I quickly declined--I'm adamant about wanting as few interventions in this birth as possible, after having just about every intervention short of a C-section last time, so starting out with an induction seems like a horrible idea to me. I told him we can schedule an induction at 42 weeks, but not before--I may be miserable, but I'm not THAT miserable! He said he'd strip my membranes next week to see if that would help things along, and said I could spend the next few weeks doing "my part" and hopefully this kiddo will come out sometime between now and her due date (neither of us really wants me in labor on Thanksgiving, right after her due date, if we can help it along naturally). "So, basically I should spend the next few weeks walking around, keeping upright, vacuuming floors, and 'stealing my husbands prostaglandins'?" I asked. "I've never heard it put that way before," he chuckled, and sent me home to have sex with my husband. (A prescription Brad didn't mind in the least, after weeks of being "benched" while I was on bed rest.)
I've stocked up on red raspberry leaf tea and evening primrose oil supplements (2 herbal remedies that are supposed to help things along). I've been walking as much as my poor feet will allow me to, but the swelling has gotten horrible in the past few days. My poor feet look like giant loaves of bread, and my hands are looking pretty bad, too. I'm still having tons of Braxton Hicks contractions--I just hope they'll actually do something to move things along--I'm so tired of being pregnant, I could scream. My back is sore, I can't sleep at night, the heartburn is torture, my feet ache non-stop, and I feel as if I'm puffy and swollen everywhere. It is as if a cartoon character has come along and inhabited my body--I no longer recognize it as my own.
And to top it all off, none of my maternity clothes fit anymore. How this is possible, I don't know. Most of my maternity clothes are leftover from last pregnancy--in which I gained just shy of 60 pounds--and they fit fine through the end. I've only gained 34 pounds this pregnancy, yet my belly sticks out more--most of my shirts no longer cover my big ol' round tummy! (Did they shrink in storage??) So I'm stuck wearing the same 5 shirts and 2 pairs of pants every day until the end--I really don't want to invest in new maternity wear that I'd only wear for a max of 3 or 4 weeks! And now my shoes are all getting too tight--at this rate, I'll be living in PJ's and house shoes all day!
Only 35 days to go! Aubrey is doing great so far. Her weekly BPP's and non-stress tests (NST's) have all come back great so far, meaning she is doing very well in there. She has been practicing her breathing in the uterus for weeks now, so if she were to come early, the chances are good that she would not need any special help with breathing and would be able to come home with Mom and Dad from the hospital. Mom is doing well so far, too--my blood pressure is staying down and I'm not showing any preeclampsia signs, so all is well.
Cathy and Wayne, Brad's Aunt and Uncle, are in town to close on their new house they bought north of Dallas, so they joined Brad, Aiden and I for the ultrasound this week. Most of these appointments I end up going to alone (the BPP's only take about 5 minutes), but since they were doing both a BPP and a growth check, I brought along the whole gang. Cathy and Wayne enjoyed seeing Aubrey on ultrasound, and Aiden got a kick out of watching her shake her fist at him. The sonographer indulged us with a few extra minutes of "show time" and was great about pointing out Aubrey's many features.
At today's appointment, Ms. Aubrey measured at a whopping 6 lbs. 3 oz. Her thigh bone, arm bone and tummy circumference are all measuring several days ahead of schedule, but what really worries Mom is that her head is measuring 2 WEEKS ahead! Heaven help me if this kid keeps growing like this these next few weeks!
The late-term ultrasounds are so neat. With Aiden, we got one ultrasound at 20 weeks and that was it. At 20 weeks, you can tell the baby's sex and see their basic shape, but with the late ultrasounds, the baby has fat under their skin, so instead of seeing a skeleton, you really see the baby's face and features, even her hair. Speaking of which, I now know why I've been having all this heartburn--Aubrey has grown quite a thick head of hair and it is already pretty long! And it looks as if I'll be getting a chunky baby this time around--she already has little fat rolls along her back!
Now it is just a matter of waiting. As long as all of the NST's and BPP's come back with good results, she'll get to stay inside. If anything changes, they'll induce me that day. And now that I'm past 35 weeks and since Aubrey is showing "respiratory maturity," they won't stop my labor if I go back into labor again. Brad and I are hoping she'll keep "cooking" for another week or so, but then I'm ready to get this kiddo out--I am feeling pretty miserable these days! Constant heartburn, an aching back, swollen feet, a sore belly from all the contractions and little knees and elbows digging in, and sheer exhaustion from an inability to sleep has me ready to GET HER OUT SOON!
Since we didn't get to do it with Aiden, we decided to splurge and go for a 3D ultrasound this pregnancy. My mom, Marilyn, and my grandmother, Charlotte, joined Brad and Aiden and I to get a sneak peak at Aubrey Ryann.
She didn't want to cooperate at first--apparently, my daughter is using the placenta as a pillow and likes to keep her face buried against it--but after some walking around, a few yoga poses, and some maneuvers from side-to-side, we were able to get a clear view of her face. Brad was elated to see she has the signature "Parker chin" with the adorable dimple, and I was happy to see she has inherited the chubby "Brum cheeks" from my side of the family. Aiden got a kick out of seeing her yawn and smile, and he was pleased to see that she was "cool" and had fat feet like Aiden and I (we tell daddy that he isn't cool because he has skinny feet). And we can all rest assured that we won't have to return any pink clothing--Aubrey is definitely a girl, and gave us a good shot of her butt and girl parts to prove it!
It was such a neat experience, getting to see our little girl for the first time. We got a tiny glimpse at her personality, seeing her grab for her feet, smile, and rub her forehead with her fist. It makes me even more excited to meet her face-to-face!! I hope these next 8 or 9 weeks fly by so I can hold her already!
Here is a slideshow of the stills--you can click on the pics to be taken to a larger version of them. I've tried several times to upload the DVD, but my DVD ripper software isn't working, so I'll try to get it added as soon as I can.
This is the story of a crazy brood: Mom, a woman of many talents and who has held a zillion different jobs who now spends her time wiping noses and rear ends and trying to raise 2 children to be productive, God-loving members of society; Dad, an Army officer and super-hero that can chase away the monsters in the closet better than anyone else on Earth; Aiden, our 'spirited' oldest (2005) who has more personality in his little finger than 2 normal adults combined; and Aubrey, our baby (2008), who is full of smiles and silliness--as long as you don't piss her off (DRAMA!). Throw in a dog, Freckles, who is a little neurotic and chases her own shadow, and you have the makings for a very messy home and quite a few humorous anecdotes--hence, the purpose of these blogs. Hope you enjoy the glimpse into our chaotic existence!

The Walt Disney Company has been recognizing teachers since 1989. The focus of the DisneyHand Teacher Awards is to recognize the teaching profession, showcase creativity in the classroom, and honor those who can assist in developing creative teaching strategies in their school districts. Last year, each of the 39 honorees was awarded $10,000, with their respective schools each receiving $5,000 from The Walt Disney Company. See the Disney Hand Web page for more information
On July 25, 2004, in Anaheim, California, Jeffrey Thompson, a kindergarten teacher from Fort Lewis, Washington took home the top honors at the DisneyHand Teacher Awards. There were originally 150,000 nominees and Thompson was chosen by his peers as the DisneyHand Teacher of the Year. Besides the honor of the award, Thompson was awarded $40,000.
A new award was also presented that night. Called the Youth Service America Award, it was awarded to Hector Ibarra as a creative and inspiring teacher. Ibarra was a middle school teacher in Iowa.
The special guest for the evening was Clay Aiken who presented the two awards to the outstanding teachers. Clay, a former special education teacher, attended the awards dinner with two of his favorite teachers from his high school in Raleigh, North Carolina. They both took the stage with him as he honored the outstanding teachers of 2004.
The entertainment of the evening was highlighted by a performance of “Bridge Over Troubled Water” sung by Clay and a children’s choir.
All teachers involved in the 2004 DisneyHand Teacher Awards enjoyed a five-day extravaganza at The Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, Calif. July 22-26, which culminated in the Awards Gala on July 25th. Throughout the week, the teachers learned innovative approaches to teaching, learning and leadership at professional development programs; attended exclusive VIP events/parties; appeared at a ceremony at Disneyland Park where they were honored by Mickey Mouse; appeared in a parade down Main Street; and shone with glamorous new looks from “costume designer to the stars,” Ret Turner.

You have got to be kidding me!! I have NEVER seen this before, ever! What a nice way to wake up this morning! I thought I'd seen everything Clay has done but I totally miss it! What a great honor it was to be in front of all those teachers and the kids singing with him was amazing!!
I don't remember ever seeing this, either. It's so great when gems like this appear out of the blue! Thanks so much, Martha!!
I think I have seen every thing Clay has done, then magically an event I have never seen before! Thank you, CANN for this glorious surprise!
I have always believed in a life of service. But Tina, Dr. Mac, and the kids I worked with at Brentwood crystallized that desire. They helped me to see how vital it is for me to use my time on earth to make a difference in some way. -Clay Aiken

SHANNON Airport will remain open on Friday morning, after the High Court granted an injunction preventing SIPTU from going ahead with a planned four-hour work stoppage.
The work stoppage had been due to take place between 5am and 9am and SIPTU had organised it due to an ongoing dispute over a €780 million hole in the Irish Aviation Superannuation Scheme. It had been set to cause chaos, not just at the Clare airport, but also at Dublin and Cork.
Both the Dublin Airport Authority and Ryanair challenged SIPTU in the High Court and on Wednesday evening, the Court found in their favour. While Shannon was not a party to the case, there was an agreement that the Court’s decision would also stand for the Clare airport.
Aer Lingus was not involved in the High Court case either, but it is understood that its workers who were also due to carry out a similar work stoppage will not now be going ahead with it.
On Wednesday evening SIPTU Pensions Advisor Dermot O’Loughlin warned that the pensions dispute is far from over. “We will be complying fully with the orders of the High Court. However, this does not resolve the pensions dispute. Accordingly, we will be consulting with our legal advisors with a view to developing a strategy to enable us to exercise our right to withdraw labour and take industrial action in the absence of a fair resolution of the pensions issue within a reasonable time.”
A spokesman for the Shannon Airport Authority said it was pleased that the airport will not now be closing and called for all sides to engage to bring about a resolution to the issue. “Shannon Airport welcomes the decision of the High Court today in relation to the planned four-hour work stoppage by SIPTU on Friday. The airport would hope that all parties involved in the dispute will now engage with the expert panel established last week to seek a resolution to the pension issue.
“In the meantime, the airport asks that passengers contact their airlines with regard to flight schedules for this coming Friday morning, with some scheduling alterations having been made by airlines in advance of today’s decision.”
In a statement on Wednesday evening, the DAA said that it had sought the injunction due to the “unwarranted nature of SIPTU’s planned industrial action”.
It also called on the union to work towards seeking a solution. “DAA calls on SIPTU to fully focus on engaging with the Government sponsored Expert Panel, which was established last week to seek a fair and sustainable resolution to broader pension issue, and is due to report its findings within a matter of weeks.”
Robin Kiely of Ryanair welcomed Wednesday’s High Court decision, which he said; “ensures our customers will not have their travel plans disrupted by unwarranted union strike action.”
Ryanair services between Shannon and Liverpool and Stansted were rescheduled and Mr Kiely said the revised times will still apply, to avoid further confusion.
Transport Minister Leo Varadkar welcomed news that the strike was off and said that industrial action would be premature given that an expert panel has been appointed to seek a solution. ““I welcome the High Court ruling which should allow the State airports to operate normal services this Friday. I have said on a number of occasions that the strike should have been deferred given that the Expert Panel is currently engaging with all parties involved in the dispute.”

A TOTAL of 24 local charities are to benefit from the proceeds of the 2013 district court poor box, which added up to €31,450.
Twelve charities that did not benefit from the court poor box last year received donations this year.
Clare’s District Court Judge Patrick Durcan recently assigned the funds to the relevant charities and they receive their cheques in the coming days.
The charity to benefit most from this year’s poor box donations is Kilrush St Vincent De Paul, which has received €6,000, with St Vincent De Paul in Ennis benefiting receiving the second highest donation of €4,000.
Three charities benefited to the tune of €2,000 each; East Clare Outreach Programme, Clare Youth Service and Cahercalla Hospice.
Donations of €1,000 were made to Ciúnas Centre, Feakle; District Day Care Centre, Clarecastle; Enable Ireland, Ennis; Accord, Ennis; Tuamgraney Handball Club; Clare Crusaders; Poor Clares, Ennis; The Samaritans, Ennis; ClareCare; Clare Haven Refuge; Pieta House; Shannon Flyers (Special Olympics Club); and Tipperary Limerick Clare for Cystic Fibrosis (TLC4CF).
Seeking Vision received €450, and the following charities each received a donation of €400: Clare Intercultural Network; Doolin Search and Rescue; Kilkee Marine Rescue; Killaloe/Ballina Search and Rescue; and St Caimin’s Search and Rescue, Mountshannon.
Last year Clare’s court poor box yielded €30,500, which represented a dramatic increase on the €14,400 collected in 2011, and the €10,000 raised in 2010.
The practice of courts directing that money be paid into a court poor box in lieu of or in conjunction with another penalty is a practice, which predates the foundation of the State, according to a Courts Service spokesperson.
It is predominantly used by the District Courts who deal with criminal offences of a less serious nature than other jurisdictions. The individual amounts can vary substantially depending on ability to pay, other penalties imposed and the nature of the offences.
The option of paying into the court poor box arises usually where the offence is minor in nature and would not attract a custodial sentence. Public order offences are the most common offences for which the poor box option is given to defendants. It is sometimes used for road traffic offences, first time, minor drug offences and offences against property or animals.
In late 2005 the Law Reform Commission recommended that the operation of the Poor Box be put on a statutory footing and be updated in the context of a reformed Probation Act.

HAPPY FRIDAY, Y’ALL! Welcome back to F**k It Friday - the new weekly feature from MTV Breaks that’s all about saying a big f**k yeah to the most excellent people who’ve said “f**k it” (probably) and taken a leap of faith to make big things happen.
Cos it’s not about just having ideas – it’s about believing in yourself, and making them happen. AMIRIGHT?
So Miley may have been born into a famous family and grown up as a child star but that doesn’t mean she hasn’t taken some risks in her career. Miley’s risks have never been about making it though, but rather about making it as the most honest form of herself she can be.
Back in the Hannah Montana days, or even the ‘Party In The USA Days’ (banger), Miley was poised to become America’s sweetheart, her young audience and Disney innocence hailing her a role model to kids everywhere. But, as we now well know, this wasn’t who Miley really is.
Miley wanted to do things a little differently and with the eyes of the world on her, did she shy away from expressing herself? Did she f**k. Miley said ‘f**k it’ (probably) and embraced her wild, wonderful, often naked true self and took the world by storm.
From that infamous MTV VMA performance in 2013 onwards, Miley has held nothing back and as a result has gone on to great things. Her outspokenness, self-confidence and awesome charity work and LGBT activism with the Happy Hippy Foundation make her a stronger role model than she ever could have been as Hannah Montana.
Have you ever said “f**k it” and taken a chance? Would you like to? Or want to nominate someone for next week? Hit us up on @mtvbreaks with your stories.

24 Indeed, it is not as strong or developed a sense of national identity as seen in such other immigrants as those from the Dominican Republic, China, or Russia. This is not to say that West Indians do not feel a very strong sense of attachment to place. They often 24 H I S TO R I C A L L E G AC I E S strongly identify with their village or town or their island. Yet very often if you scratch the identity of a Trinidadian, you ~nd roots in Grenada or Jamaica. In the Caribbean only Haiti and the Dominican Republic achieved independence before the twentieth century.
44 Owners in the Caribbean were preoccupied with sugarcane and thus relied on imported foodstuffs to a great degree. When these supplies of food were interrupted due to weather or other events, slaves were malnourished or starved, thus making them highly susceptible to disease and leading to a particularly high infant mortality rate. Lowenthal also cites the higher incidence of West Indian slave revolts and the songs of West Indian slaves, which stressed rebellion rather than obedience, as further proof of the severity of Caribbean as opposed to North American slave conditions.
Even Jamaica, often thought by Americans to be a quintessentially British former colony, was controlled and colonized by Spain from its ~rst European discovery in 1494 until it was ceded to England in 1670. Jamaica gained independence from Britain in 1962. 5 million people at the beginning of the 1990s. Of those, 61% lived in Spanish-speaking societies—Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. 4 Those islands that remained Spanish property for a long period of time and developed into the Spanish Caribbean are different in some fundamental ways, most especially in the types of race relations and racial categories that developed.

2018 is the 72nd Independence Day of India and the Nation today is immersed in celebrating freedom and the unity in diversity that represents this ancient yet modernized country. However, there is still work needed to be done to ensure greater inclusion of all parts of the country in the development process, as well as to remind ourselves of all the people who have contribute to the freedom struggle of India.
To be more specific, development of India will not be complete without its benefits reaching places like the North-east region. And the celebration of India’s independence should not be complete without remembering Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.
In his speech today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did inform everyone that the North-east is now in news for all the right reasons, including achievements in sports, for connecting the last unconnected villages with electricity, and for becoming a hub of organic farming. There indeed is a big push for developing the NE region and hopefully we will soon see results.
For celebrating India’s 72nd Independence Day, we take you to the culturally rich township of Moirang which is a municipal council in Bishnupur district of Manipur and is located about 45 km away from the state capital Imphal. Moirang is famous for its ancient temples particularly of Lord Thangjing and is also the place of origin of the the graceful Khamba-Thoibi dance.
However, what often remains as the untold story of Moirang is its strategic significance in the Indian freedom struggle that led to India’s independence in 1947. Moirang was the first place that the Subhash Chandra Bose led Indian National Army (INA) had got freed from the British occupation.
The flag of Azad Hind was raised for the first time on Indian soil even before 15th August, 1947 at Moirang by the INA on 14th April, 1944.
The following text is among few of the eyewitness accounts of the episode of the INA charging against the British rule during that time. Click here to read the complete account maintained by Lalit Pukhrambam, Ph.D.
“While (the British forces at) Kohima was being attacked, Imphal valley was completely surrounded in all directions by the Japanese army at the hill tops with heavy artillery. However, at that time, the Japanese had directed their air-crafts towards south in the Arakan region where British forces were attacking. The propaganda from the British Government to the local people was that the Japanese were invading Manipur and India. Therefore, Subash Chadra Bose and his Indian National Army (INA) along with the Japanese army did not receive much help they had expected from the natives.
War veterans narrated that two Japanese soldiers disguised themselves as local workers (the British employed a large number of local inhabitants as labourers and housekeepers) and stole an aircraft from the Palel airstrip. Subash Chandra Bose used the airplane to drop leaflets narrating that the Japanese and the INA were in fact friends of India and that they were trying to free India from Britain. They had to show the picture of Netaji with Mahatama Gandhi. By that time Manipur already had a large number of followers of Gandhiji’s Indian National Congress and they knew about Subhash Bose’s earlier role in the Congress Party.
Finally, several locals joined INA, and underground movements started. The British army immediately collected all leaflets by offering large sums of money to those who were loyal and would bring it to them. Several members of the Manipur Mahasava and leaders from the hills and plains were rounded up at the Langthabal military camp. Thus, INA led by Netaji Subash Chandra Bose for the first time on 14 April 1944 hoisted the Indian tricolor flag at Moirang, 45 km south of Imphal at Tiddim road.
However, as is the legacy of the very man who led the INA, Moirang’s role in the Indian freedom struggle today lies forgotten and a part of untold history.
A Netaji Memorial Museum greets the lone and daring traveler who reaches this destination. The complex displays letters, photographs, badges of ranks and other memorabilia reminding the noble sacrifices made by the INA under the leadership of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.
Today, as the nation faces issues of skewed development, corruption and lack of good governance, there is an urgent need for good leaders from among the youth. An even more pressing need is that of inspiration from the true leaders who worked for a unified and more powerful India. We hope the spirit of the Independence Day will ignite the flames of freedom from corruption and bad governance, for an overall and sustainable development of the country at large! Happy Independence Day!

Black beans are among my favorite and there are so many ways to prepare them. Whenever possible, use fresh spices and ingredients. Use whole grain rice for increased nutritional value.

The movement toward fully inclusive education is gaining momentum. Part of the reason for this goes beyond parental and administrative requests: teachers and students are enjoying its benefits. If you know me, you know that I am loving my first year in the collaborative classroom. But my fulfillment is supported by research, too.
Zou, Kim and Kerekes (2011) explored the benefits of collaborative teaching at the college level specifically for pre-service teachers. Imagine, exposing pre-service teachers to collaborative practices as students before they become collaborative teachers themselves. This makes so much sense, and yet, it was neither my experience nor that of anyone else I know.
The article itself, Collaborative Teaching in an Integrated Methods Course, concluded that currently there is just not enough research to support greater benefits with this model of preparing pre-service teachers, but just like the growth of collaborative teaching in K-12 education, I’m sure further research may increase this practice, as well.
What I did takeaway from this article were the several benefits of collaborative teaching cited by its authors for both students and instructors.
The authors also cited Hinton & Downing (1998) when explaining “collaborative teaching is most beneficial when it promotes diversity by including teaching members from different disciplinary areas in addition to different ethnic and cultural backgrounds”. I could not agree with this more. Any time we can use our collaborative teaching practice to model treating each other with humanity, everyone wins. In my own practice, I believe that the simple juxtaposition of Mr. Beasley and I (male and female) in addition to being SPED and general education counter-parts, is valuable: We just bring different things to the table.
In future posts we can address challenges, but today’s focus highlighted benefits. Do you teach collaboratively? What do you consider the greatest benefits to your students and team?

Pruning is an essential part of garden maintenance; it is necessary to regulate and control growth and to encourage flowering and fruiting on trees and shrubs. It is also one of the most difficult parts of garden maintenance. To prune well, gardeners must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the attributes, growth, and flowering habits of the plants under their care and of the effects likely to be produced by making the cut. Landscapers, arborists, and home gardeners will find all this and more in Essential Pruning Techniques. Tony Kirkham shares decades of knowledge and expertise in this fully illustrated, comprehensive guide. Essential Pruning Techniques offers up-to-date pruning advice for 379 woody plants, step-by-step instruction on the latest techniques and practices, and specific advice for addressing climate challenges. Full color photographs by Andrea Jones illustrate techniques and show examples of correctly pruned trees and shrubs.

The TCPM international conference brings together researchers interested in artistic creativity and the study of processes of musical and sound creation, of the past and present. Researchers working on this cluster of problems from a wide variety of disciplines (history, music analysis, psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, sociology, ethnomusicology, anthropology, etc.) are invited to assess the different methodologies developed in the last thirty years in their respective areas from an interdisciplinary perspective. Each approach contributes in its own way to the advancement of our understanding of the procedures, techniques, knowledge and know-how employed by musicians involved in creative projects.
The abstract, of 400 to 500 words, should present the subject, the theories and models of the creative processes described in the talk, the goals, the data and sources, the methodology used and the results of the study;
NOTE: No name, affiliation or any other element that identify the author(s) should be included on this version.
Each conference contribution proposal should be headed by the author(s) name(s), institutional affiliation(s) (if any), email address(es) of the presenters;

The narrow ridge and its secondary forest set the scene for great wooded mountain biking experience.
This 3km long trail with emphasis on single track riding, tight technical downhill and ladder bridges riding started off as a project collaboration with
Dirtraction crew is involved in the initial design and build process of the trail, and subsequently trail audit, expansion and trail specific maintenance consultancy for the land managers.
The initial trail is built around the 3rd quarter of 2005 comprise of 1.8km of single tracks weaving through various existing walking paths, steps and a cycle path at the side of the road climb.
The trail brought fresh influx of riding, changes the mountain biking requirements in Singapore in a blink, simply by trail design and surfaces.
Unlike the other trails in Singapore before the existence of Kent Ridge Mountain Biking Trail, tight corners and singletrack riding test riders slow speed controls and ability, lowering the risk of speed related offroad accident found previously in the other trails.
more climbs and sections are introduce in 2006-2007, where longer switchback climbs and descent options allow for a smoother flow, correcting various touchy section created previously and allows for better hikers and riders separations.
in 2008, the trail get an extra 1.2km in length where the temporary trail along the road climb is now replace with a bi-directional singletrack that allows for a fun climb and yet provide the thrill needed in a Super D ride.
Between 2009 and 2011, efforts in Kent Ridge Park is purely concentrated around yearly maintenance and some minor reroutes. These efforts centered around the annual cross country and Super D races when the ‘Dirt Crew’ couldn’t commit further community time for Kent Ridge most of the months.
In Jan 2011, the existing Super D line is greatly enhanced with gravity based features, in turns helps conceptualize one of the premier mountain biking gravity event in the region.
In 2012, Dirtraction’s trail community efforts in Kent Ridge is greatly assisted by an anchoring group of bikers. Riders from ‘Ride Brothers’ and long time trail advocate like Jef Ng came forward to start the ball rolling for a trail adoption programme in Kent Ridge. Regular trail days help improve the trail conditions, with efforts turning towards a ride centric trails, rather than previously race centric approach.
The trails is re-design and construct to cater to a wider group of riders instead of simply just the ‘hardcores’. Improving the flow and sustainability in the process. ‘SGTAP -Kent Ridge’ managed to activate and gel various groups of mountain bikers, mostly anonymous, to place sweat equity into the trails they ride.
With National Parks Board backing on the trail network, the trails offers opportunity for expansion and longevity.
While Dirtraction’s work in Kent Ridge Park is mainly CSR based effort, we will remain committed to ensure the trail network grow in a sustainable manner.

Quality measures are a key element of value-based payment. Gaps in the measures used by accountable care programs to assess cancer care may ultimately lead to missed opportunities to improve quality and deliver appropriate care for patients. Discern Health and the National Pharmaceutical Council (NPC) published a white paper in April 2017, “Improving Oncology Quality Measurement in Accountable Care,” exploring gaps and new measurement opportunities for ten high-impact types of cancer.
The white paper builds on the recommendations of an NPC-sponsored multi-stakeholder roundtable discussion chaired by Drs. Mark McClellan of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy and Robert S. Miller of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The roundtable participants recommended moving beyond limited condition-specific process measures to more meaningful measures that cut across cancer diagnoses. These measures should assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs), clinical outcomes, safety, evaluation and management, and essential structures. The white paper proposes near-term action steps that providers, payers, patient advocates, and others can take to implement improvement strategies.
NPC hosted a webinar on Wednesday, April 26 to present the white paper findings. The webinar was moderated by Kimberly Westrich, VP, Health Services Research. Webinar presenters included Dr. Tom Valuck, Partner at Discern Heath, Dr. McClellan, Dr. Miller, and Dr. Alan Balch of the Patient Advocate Foundation.

There are pros and cons to nuclear energy, but the debate is often acrimonious and too often falls back to rhetoric instead of facts
The world’s traditional means of generating energy have been intensely polluting, expelling millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere with scant regard for the consequences. Ireland has been complicit in this: Moneypoint, the coal-powered station in Co Clare, releases 3.12 million tonnes of CO2 in the atmosphere annually.
But as Moneypoint comes to the end of its operational life cycle, it is time to have a serious discussion about Ireland’s energy future, and nuclear power needs to be part of that discussion.

OPINION: Fukushima frightens us all but mankind has never walked away from a technology, no matter how hard it is to master, write DAVID SOWBY and FRANK TURVEY
EVER SINCE a human being first lit a fire, humankind has striven to harness the forces of nature in ways that yielded benefits but which also carried risks. As civilisation progressed, the benefits of any particular advance became more substantial but, by and large, so also did the risks.
But from the boiler explosions of the 19th century, through hydroelectric dam collapses, mining and oil-rig disasters, train and air crashes, Bhopal and Chernobyl, the response of humanity has never been to abandon a technology, but to derive lessons from what has happened so as to make the benefits available more safely in the future.

A sneak preview of a letter we wrote to The Irish Times yesterday - but will a letter that draws attention to a failing public policy be published?
Dr David Connolly, CEO of the Irish Wind Energy Association, correctly calls for political leadership in tackling climate change (Opinion, 5th October www.irishtimes.com/opinion/we-need-political-leadership-on-climate-change-1.3652789
), but the IWEA’s ‘Baringa’ plan – 70% renewables by 2030 – would commit Ireland to an expensive failure in this regard. www.iwea.com/images/Article_files/Final_Baringa_70by30_Report_web.pdf
Baringa acknowledges that even with up to 90% of electricity coming from renewables, the required fossil fuel backup would limit the reduction in carbon emissions to 30% while full decarbonisation is the target. The unfortunate truth is that depending on renewables to such a large extent makes it impractical to supply backup from the low carbon alternatives needed to fully decarbonise.
This apparent paradox needs to be understood if we are tackle climate change effectively. The simple fact is that climate change is largely attributed to excessive carbon emissions, not to a lack of renewable energy. This is borne out in Ireland which already has world-leading levels of renewable electricity but emissions are still 12 times higher than our 2050 target.
Effectively tackling climate change will require steady focus on the salient target – emissions reduction – even if this means reduced focus on the onerous and counter-productive renewables target.
Baringa actually points the way forward when read along with ESB’s ‘Low Carbon Future’ paper from 2017. The solution entails developing the optimum reliable low-carbon technology - including nuclear, carbon-capture and biomass – supported by onshore wind, offshore wind and solar where they can be supplied at the Baringa estimates of €60 to €80 / MWh.
Such a system would result in a low carbon, affordable electricity system, would allow more ‘carbon headroom’ for our important agriculture sector, and would allow onshore wind turbines to be installed only where actively welcomed by local communities, unlike at present.
Given that nuclear, in particular, has now become more attractive to Ireland as design improvements have lowered cost and size while improving safety and waste management, the time has come to independently review how best to generate truly low carbon, reliable and affordable electricity. This review would provide a rationale our political leaders in their very difficult task of providing leadership as we, finally, begin to effectively tackle climate change.

Mike Shellenberger of Environmental Progress is organising a public event to draw attention to the need for nuclear power to save the climate — and to what he calls “Germany’s unethical effort to kill Europe’s most important source of clean energy”.
Along with Amardeo Sarma, a leader of the pro-science movement in Germany, he is hosting a strategy meeting for pro-nuclear activists in Amsterdam, September 1 to 2.
Please let me know by email or via the comment box below if you would be interested in attending this event, so we can coordinate an Irish response.
As Germany expands its war on nuclear power to all of Europe, Environmental Progress (EP) is stepping up our efforts to save it.
With Pollution On The Rise, Will Europe Resist Germany’s Dirty War On Nuclear Power? Germany is trying to close nuclear plants across Europe. Will Spain, France, and Belgium stand up for Enlightenment values and the climate or is Europe doomed to fall back into a new Dark Age of dirt…https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/06/26/with-pollution-on-the-rise-will-europe-finally-resist-germanys-dirty-war-on-nuclear-power/#3d784c896769
2. Over the last 2.5 years, Environmental Progress has helped prevent 14 nuclear reactors around the world from being replaced by fossil fuels
No other environmental organization has saved more clean energy than EP — and we have done so on an annual budget well under $1 million
3. During that time, we have learned what works — and what doesn’t — to save nuclear plants. EP is taking that same winning recipe to Europe.
Toward that end, we are inviting our European allies to help us organize a “day of action” in defense of nuclear power this fall.
4. We are looking for people willing to roll up their sleeves and help organize a public event that draws attention to the need for nuclear power to save the climate — and to Germany’s unethical effort to kill Europe’s most important source of clean energy.
5. Germany’s @amardeo Sarma, a leader of the pro-science movement in Germany, and I are co-hosting a strategy meeting for pro-nuclear activists in Amsterdam, September 1 to 2. We have scheduled the meeting so that volunteers from across Europe can attend.
6. Are you interested in participating? If so please email EP’s Paris Wines briefly stating how you heard about the meeting, who you are, and why you want to attend.
7. And, either way, I hope you will consider making a contribution to saving European nuclear plants.
We need to raise $50,000 to make things happen on the ground. I promise we will make that little bit of money go a very long way.

28-year-old Jalil Frazier was shot and paralyzed in January while protecting three kids from an armed robber in a Philadelphia barber shop.
After waking from a coma to find he was partially-paralyzed, Frazier returned home last month with his wife and two sons.
According to Philly.com, Frazier “doesn’t have a ramp to get in and out of the Olney home he was finally able to return to last month. Or a chair lift to get up the stairs and into his own bed without scooting and risking more injuries. There are five steps between their porch and the sidewalk in front of their narrow street, five steep steps between him and the independence he craves when he’s lying on that bed, stuck in his thoughts.”

Borussia Dortmund's season went from bad to worse as derby rivals Schalke stormed back from four goals down to win a point on Saturday. The home side looked to have wrapped up the match in the first 25 minutes thanks to strikes from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Mario Goetze, Raphael Guerreiro and an own-goal from Benjamin Stambouli. However, Guido Burgstaller began the comeback in the 61st minute with a stunning header and Aubameyang was sent off after Amine Harit had halved the deficit. Daniel Caligiuri's powerful volley brought the visitors within a goal which was provided by a powerful Naldo header deep into injury time to leave coach Peter Bosz's future at the club hanging by a thread.
“And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.”
Abraham Lincoln didn’t know that he was going to be president of the United States. He didn’t know he would free slaves from their bondage. He didn’t know his wisdom would have an effect for centuries to come. How could a farm boy from Kentucky do all of that without knowing what his life would entail? Because he lived with vision and got up did his best.
Sometimes, all you need is a clearly defined, achievable goal to work toward to feel fulfilled. You might complain sometimes, “I’m not accomplishing much”, but really you are always working toward something if you are a Believer. God has a purpose for every second of your life and He has a vision to prosper you and make you strong in the faith. Someday we must give an account for the time that God has given us. Perhaps what you end up doing, or are currently doing, won’t be anything like you dream up and imagine. Perhaps it might not be as “important” as you might want it to be. But God has something special for you to do and you have to work toward His vision.
Abraham Lincoln gave his best in all he set out to do. One day, he found that doing his very best and God’s vision for his life had gotten him all the way to the White House. Sometimes, all that is required is to just do the best you can do at whatever you are currently doing and trust God to open the doors. And sometimes, we need a little more courage to walk through them.
God has purposed His Believers to show His glory and power to the earth. Live for that purpose. Live for Him. Go and fight for something. Don’t just lay around, but go and fight for God’s vision.
One of the greatest Presidents I think the nation ever had was Lincoln. Not because that he come from Kentucky, but because he was a great man. He was deprived of an education, but yet was something in his heart, some purpose. I like a man of vision. I like people that's got something they're fighting for, just not just lay around, "Well, ever what comes along will be all right." Oh, be up and at it! And Lincoln never let his education stand in the way; he had something to do. I think every Christian ought to be that way, find your purpose and go do it. Every member of this chapter, just not, "Well, we have a breakfast once a month," that isn't it, "or once every Saturday." Have a purpose in life, something you're going to do. God has placed you here; do something about it, every member of every church.

But the flip side, we feel great relief when we are in great need of insurance. Since January 2010, there have been government-led initiatives to reduce your miles driven equals less risk it is the main driver of each policy very carefully. But, with a dangerous move to any state, there are things that you may be entitled to drive. A typical top end policy would not want to get good grades. For some bizarre reason many motorists just hand over your legal defense in the event that you invested in an accident. Registration: If you're going to go up. Take note of the suggestions made in the past does not mean that you can spot anywhere for them because it isn't far behind. Although we have enough protection.

Chances are you for lower rates if you drive a free credit scores have any motoring claims or convictions within the last five years.

It also helped me tremendously by pointing out areas where I have teologia arminiana mitos e realidades Arminianism. He admits that some who call themselves Arminians have strayed away from Arminius’ teachings, however, it cannot be denied that even Calvinist have done the same with John Calvin.
When you look at the writings of the major Arminian theologians throughout the century, it is clear that Arminianism is much misunderstood by many of its critics. And, yes, it confirmed my previous notion that I’m an Arminian in theology.
It is useful not just for Calvinists to understand where Arminians are coming from, but teologia arminiana mitos e realidades for Arminians to understand their own theology and how to explain Arminianism properly in ways that do not end up as semi-Pelagianism. There are, of course, some shortcomings. Your email address will not be published. He then cites many Arminian theologians to support his claims and to debunk the alleged myths.
This is a book you should buy if you are known to do theological research as it is not teologia arminiana mitos e realidades sit-down-and-read-from-front-to-back kind of book. The academic nature of this book did grate sometimes – I found myself skimming portions of the book where it addressed the views of a seemingly interminable number of Arminian theologians.
The author presented views by certain Calvinist theologians and scholars and then presented the opposing views of their Arminian peers even the ones that aren’t necessarily favorable to Arminianism.
Feb 17, Brandon Vaughan rated it it was amazing. It is also somewhat repetitive, yet sometimes repetition is helpful to really get an idea solidified into your knowledge base.
Olson situates the Arminianism squarely within its Reformation heritage. WHY Arminians believe what they believe is a different subject. Olson divides the book into ten chapters, dealing with an allegation by Calvinists, refuting the allegation, then referring to Miros such as Arminius, Wesley, Miley, Oden, et al, to show where and how Arminianism both resembles and differs from Calvinism.
Mainly, if human beings chose to act differently in the circumstances in which God has placed them, then God’s middle knowledge which is logically prior to the creative decree teologia arminiana mitos e realidades have been different. This is a book on Arminianism by Roger E. I empathize with his frustration at misrepresentations of his position, and some of the hurtful things that can be said in zealous attempts to show a position in error.
To ask other readers questions about Arminian Theologyplease sign up. Much of what he does is also refute other mistaken positions that have come from the later Remonstrant Arminians and others that have deviated from classical Arminianism but have helped the opposition to build a case. Myths and Realities”, is a welcome text to anyone interested in theology.
For those wanting to go further into why Molinism doesn’t entail determinism, see my article “Molinism and Divine Foreordination” — http: Olson is generally fair and honest in his comments on Calvinism and also the weaknesses of his own system. In each chapter Olson outlines the basic teologia arminiana mitos e realidades then gives his own response, followed by quotes from Arminius, the Remonstrants, Wesley, 19th century Arminians, and 20th century Arminians that counter the myth.
God foreordained the choosing of A, yet Bob’s freedom is in tact. Dec 22, Grant Robertson rated it it was amazing. A Process Manager operates in a similar manner. Indeed, if I had a penny every time some smart aleck purported to resolve teologia arminiana mitos e realidades great Calvinist – Arminian debate by declarin Roger Olson’s book is packed chock full of great facts about Arminianism, many teologia arminiana mitos e realidades which the average self-proclaimed Arminian is probably not aware of.
This book, to me, was fresh water in a dry and barren teologia arminiana mitos e realidades. I have historically wanted to demonize them, but that is primarily because they haven’t been properly portrayed. Now with QuickSize you simply enter your height, lower body measurements and shoe size upon installation and then you are good to go! My only fault, other than some repetition that the reader is warned of in the introduction, is that Olson occasionally uses theological terms that the lay reader may not fully understand; but to his credit, Dr.
And I don’t blame them. This single issue seems to provide all of the material he uses despite admitting in a footnote that Horton has since changed his position on Evangelical Arminianism. I think, that you are not right. Anyone who wants to know precisely what we Arminians believe should get this book and read it.
My only gripe is that he constantly refers to an issue of Modern Reformation magazine dating back to No teologia arminiana mitos e realidades this is what they believe, but the same sentiments are uttered by Mormons when accused of denying certain Christian doctrines. Some of this is because the myths Olson chooses to debunk are similar. All teologia arminiana mitos e realidades all, Olson does mitks pretty good job giving a defense of Arminianism from a historical perspective; how Olson goes to great lengths to defend Arminianism as a legitimate evangelical, orthodox Protestant position.
Window Ac Vent Deflectorlating hip roofs is a thing that each roofer one day will have to do. Due to their short ridge lines, properly ventilating most of these roofs in a very hip style fashion might be somewhat difficult.
Some problems that may arise when trying to ventilate a hip roof might be that their maybe not enough exhaust ventilation. A 1,200 sq. foot associated with an attic space needs 17' of Cobra Exhaust Vent system. You may need to compensate with extra exhaust. Install roof louvers with 12"-18" of ridge to provide exhaust ventilation for the roof system and attic space for proper ventilation needs.
Add five roof louvers on a typical 1,200 square foot attic to arrive at the needed ventilation to the particular area. Roof louvers will also be most commonly called and called mushroom vents, soldier vents, air hawks, cake pans, and box vents.
When installing the exhaust vents be sure to determine the roof has ridge boards you aren't. Leave a 6" of uncut sheathing in the gable ends. Leaving the 6" protects the structure from wind driven rains. Cut the sheathing simply for safety and structural integrity, set the proper blade depth. Cover the whole ridge with all the cobra exhaust vent for weather protection, best appearance, and prevent dead-air pockets, cover the whole ridge with ridge Window Ac Vent Deflector
When using ridge ventilation, do not cover the ridge vent slot/opening with leak barrier material or other underlayments. Caulk the lengths together. If larger lengths are expected, caulk the ends to seal them together. Install the ridge cap shingles in the cobra exhaust vent. Use the cobra smart nails provided with every package that you simply buying the cobra exhaust venting system.
Match the caps for the shingles. Install the ridge caps with equal or longer warranty than main shingles. Ado not over drives their nails when installing the exhaust vents. Leave a A�" relating to the ridge cap and the deck. Over driving can leave an uneven ridge profile. When installing over laminated shingles, caulk the end from the outer baffles for the shingles to completely seal them together. Important, do not install any ridge-type vent across the down slope hip rafters, or hip legs.
Many roofers prefer to make use of a special cobra nail gun to setup their nails. This ensures that you simply are getting the secure and safe fasten that you simply need for the exhaust vents to remain in place since inclement weather can quickly rip them off the roof.

I don't seem to get the time these days to read as much as I'd like, but I've been an avid book reader for as long as I can remember. I don't really know where I got the love of reading from as I don't recall being read to that much at home, but I devoured books as a youngster.
I mainly read books either through the public library or through items purchased through the school book club. I read as much as I could - all the classics you might expect, Jamie and the Giant Peach, Charlotte's Web, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ... but my absolute favourites were ... the Famous Five - I had all of them at one stage, eventually growing out of them and either myself or my mum giving them away. I loved those adventures and even the body blow dealt by the 'Comic Strip presents' couldn't dull my favourable memories:
For some reason I never got into The Secret Seven (maybe I saw them as arch-enemies') but I was reminded of all this childhood enthusiasm when finding these two books in one of my random assorted boxes:
Book 10 - The Secret Seven witnesses a house burn down, and after that a precious violin stolen. Are the two incidents related?
Book 9 - The Secret Seven find that a girl, called Elizabeth Mary Welhemina Sonning, has disappeared after she is blamed for stealing some money from her teacher's desk. Will the Secret Seven find her, and solve the mystery, or will the police do it first?
Despite the condition of the dust jacket, these two first publications from '57 and '58 are in good enough nick to hang onto and share with my little 'un when he gets to the right age, but I find myself wondering about their relevance - do children nowadays read Enid Blyton? It would almost seem a fantastical age to them - almost another 'fantasy' world. "Why do they not have mobile phones daddy?"
I'm interested to know - is Enid Blyton still widely read to or by children nowadays? Is she too politically incorrect or plain irrelevant?
It's like history is, in a way, a playwright who hands you only a few facts about the character you're playing, and you fill in the rest, all the gaps that history leaves, by reading up on a person and by trying to imagine what it's like.

Quite, quite beautiful. and superbly crafted. There are many small details in this, but the one that affects me most is the now obsolete form of ‘Jesu’ – that stops it having all those modern day evangelical connotations of ‘Jesus’, and instead harks back to those C16th poets and a profundity of faith that conquered worlds, interior and exterior.
Beautiful! What we have lost — our faith and our traditions one by one,. Thanks again, Leo – we owe you so much.
But even more important are the intimacy, the closely-held warmth in the midst of cold, the small details brought into intense focus, and the totally unexpected but striking “Jesu” at the finish.
The poem is delightfully atmospheric, evoking the charm of ordinary life at Christmastime in a beautiful old square in Warsaw. The appeal to the senses is masterfully reinforced by their actual enumeration in the repeated phrases “You hear,” “you can look,” “you can eat” (which covers taste and smell). Touch is covered by the “shoving” in verse 14. Even the imagination, to complete the experiential nature of the poem, is given a final position of importance as the opening to the world of larger meaning in the apparition of “Jesu among the doves.”
Leo Yankevich is one of the original poets of the Ars Poetica Nova, a movement which recognizes the importance of euphony and musicality, the audible aspect of traditional lyric verse. So, I really must insist that the very best way to enjoy “December Wish” is through the poet’s own recording of it in the audio he has been very kind to provide.

Honduras Agonistes: The best way of restoring democracy to the Honduran people is to do everything humanly possible to keep the Obama Administration on side with the left-wing governments of Central and South America. So long as Barack Obama and Hugo Chavez stand together, the Honduran Right's plans for establishing a dictatorship cannot succeed.
Not only because the cementing-in of US opposition to the Honduran elites’ attack on democracy is clearly the most effective means of restoring that country’s ousted President, Manuel "Mel" Zelaya, to power, but also because it would represent a massive advance towards the Holy Grail of left-wing Latin American diplomacy – a United States Government willing to stand behind the right of the region’s peoples to determine their own futures without the overt or covert interference of American capitalists.
Unfortunately, the first response of the New Zealand Left has been to more-or-less ignore Obama’s (and Hilary Clinton’s) condemnation of the Coup, and insist, instead, that the Honduran military are simply carrying out the wishes of their American advisers. It is inconceivable, they say, that such a controversial political intervention by the armed forces of a Latin American state (the first since 1993) could have been initiated without first receiving the green light from Washington.
Accordingly, a number of New Zealand leftists are planning to picket the US Consulate in Auckland. Their demands will include the closing of the notorious School of the Americas – training-ground for every military dictator and death-squad commander since the early 1950s, along with the withdrawal of all US intelligence agents from Central and South America.
Both strategically and tactically, I believe this is precisely the wrong course of action to follow.
Of course US intelligence officers and military personnel would have been aware that the Honduran Right was planning to head-off a Venezuelan-style revision of the country’s constitution, and many – perhaps most – of these individuals would have been strong supporters of such a plan. But the facts – as far as we know them to date – all point to the Obama Administration refusing to back the proposed coup.
To ignore this fact is to, objectively, play into the hands of the most right-wing elements within the US Government, Intelligence Community and Armed Forces. They don’t care if Obama is castigated by the International Left as an imperialist – in fact they’d rather welcome it. What terrifies them is the prospect of Obama and Clinton, by publicly repudiating the actions of the Honduran military, along with its right-wing civilian backers in the judiciary, congress and the news media, forcing the Americans on the ground in Tegucigalpa to break-off their relationships with the plotters and, by standing back, allow the popular resistance to gather strength.
Keeping the USA aligned with Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Nicaragua and El Salvador on this issue should, therefore, be the prime progressive objective world-wide. The New Zealand Left – along with their comrades across the world – should be heaping praise upon Obama and Clinton. Instead of angry demonstrations outside the US Consulate, we should be organising expressions of support for the Obama Administration’s stance.
Only if Washington abandons Honduran democracy - thereby signalling a return to business-as-usual in Latin America - should the anti-imperialist slogans be dusted off, and Old Glory resume its time-honoured relationship with paraffin and matches.
The Freedom of Speech: Norman Rockwell's famous illustration reminds us that it is the speech itself, and not the speaker, that we are obligated to contend with. Argument ad hominem (against the man) does not belong in the genuinely progressive person's rhetorical armoury.
NEVER has my conviction that engaging in personal debates on the Internet constitutes a truly fruitless enterprise been more painfully vindicated than in the posting I’m reluctantly responding to here.
Lew at Kiwipolitico disagrees with my stance on the Maori Party – fair enough. One of the truly great aspects of the Internet is that through websites and blogs such as these it really is possible to let a "thousand schools of thought contend". And if Lew had been willing to leave it at that I’d have had no problem with his posting.
Repeatedly, in his postings on Kiwipolitico, Lew has responded to articles and/or postings I have displayed here at Bowalley Road not by honestly confronting the arguments I have put forward, but with personal abuse and gross misrepresentation.
His latest posting, here, is the worst instance so far. In it he accuses me of "repeated denial and denigration of indigenous rights" and "denying that women should be free of sexual predation as of right".
Let me first state that I deny these charges absolutely, and defy any reasonable person, having read the postings on this blog, to draw such outrageous conclusions from them. Anyone who knows me, or has followed my writings over the years, will affirm that while I may have strong (and perfectly legitimate) disagreements with the followers of identity politics, I have never argued against the rights of women or indigenous peoples – nor denigrated any person for doing so.
It is ironic that Lew’s article should be headed up "Brogressives and Fauxgressives" because his own conduct casts serious doubt over whether he is now entitled to any sort of claim to the title of "progressive".
The essence of progressivism is its insistence on rationality – as the only tested method of fully comprehending reality; and its insistence on speaking the truth – as a counter to the lies and misrepresentations of those who seek to obscure reality for their own self-interested purposes.
But this is precisely what Lew is guilty of doing. Rather than attempt to test the truth of the statements I have made on this blog (statements made in good faith, I might add, and with the intention of helping both myself and my readers to more closely approach the truth) Lew has told lies about me. Moreover, he has told those lies with the aim of discrediting me – a fellow human-being – not the arguments I have put forward.
By resorting to these arguments ad hominem; and by conceiving and executing them in bad faith and with what appears to be malicious intent, Lew has effectively cast himself beyond the pale of the entire progressive community – perverting what is clearly a very fine intellect in the process.
I write this more in sorrow than in anger, fully acknowledging that I am as capable as anyone of becoming enraged, and of indulging in behaviour which, upon more sober reflection, was clearly insupportable. I must confess to responding in this way more than once to Lew’s postings. I guess the big difference between myself and Lew, though, is that on the one occasion when I foolishly gave vent to my anger, and posted the result on this blog, I quickly regretted my actions and deleted the offending material as grossly unfair to Lew – a person I had not met, and who certainly did not deserve the ad hominem attack I had leveled against him.
"They've got the guns, but we've got the numbers", or so sang 60s icon Jim Morrison of The Doors. But, for the first time since the progressive majority of the Baby Boom Generation became old enough to influence social and political trends, "the numbers" now lie with conservative social movements like the anti-anti-smackers, Family First .
FINALLY, the die-hards have got the numbers. For years now, on the issues that divide New Zealanders into progressives and conservatives, the progressives have been in the ascendant.
Whether it be issues as old as the death penalty and a woman’s right to choose, or as relatively recent as New Zealand’s nuclear-free status, genetic engineering, or the Iraq War, a solid majority of New Zealanders have held up their hands for compassion, justice, peace and rationality.
This progressive ascendancy has lasted a long time. From the late-1980s until about 2005 – nearly twenty years.
Historically, it coincided with the rise of the NewLabour, Green, and Alliance parties, and the election of the Helen Clark-led Labour Government – all of them elevated by the public’s deep mistrust of the New Right revolution of 1984-96.
Progressive dominance was also reinforced by the advent of proportional representation. Instead of a hide-bound club, comprised overwhelmingly of white, middle-aged men, MMP forced the House of Representatives to live up to its name. Nandor Tanczos’s dreadlocks, hemp suit and skateboard were only the most colourful proof that the times were a-changing.
Underlying all of this, however, was the relentless demographic pressure of the Baby-Boom Generation (1946-66).
The first of the Boomers were in their late-30s when Rob Muldoon’s conservative government finally fell in July 1984. Over the next 20 years, they and their younger brothers and sisters would steadily occupy all of the strategic decision-making points of New Zealand society – and progressively transform it.
From the moment they entered primary school in the 1950s, the Boomers had been absorbing New Zealand’s nominally progressive "official" ideology. And, as they entered high-school and university in the 1960s and 70s, these youngsters were naturally impatient to test its authenticity.
Apart from a handful of progressive enclaves in the universities, civil service, arts and trade unions, the New Zealand of the 1960s and 70s was a profoundly conservative society. There were overwhelming popular majorities in favour of restoring the death penalty, keeping abortion and homosexuality illegal, maintaining sporting contacts with South Africa, and preserving the ANZUS alliance with Australia and the United States.
When it came to challenging the "official" values of their parent’s generation, the Baby-Boomers (as in so many other aspects of their lives) were spoiled for choice.
New Zealand had signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – but was willing to play Rugby with representatives of Apartheid. We had endorsed the UN Charter – but backed the United States’ rape of Vietnam. We solemnly affirmed that in our democratic society all citizens were equal – but we paid women less for doing the same work as men, and refused to protect te reo Maori, their lands and other treasures.
The Boomers’ great mission became matching their nation’s deeds with its words. And, to a truly remarkable degree, they were successful.
Or, perhaps it’s more truthful to say that the Baby Boomers who genuinely believed in the progressive ideals they’d been encouraged to actualise were remarkably successful. Because not all of the generation born between 1946 and 1966 ended up falling under the progressive spell.
For conservative Baby Boomers, these past 20 years have been a torment. While New Zealand’s officially progressive ideals remained little more than window-dressing, behind which the majority’s die-hard conservatism continued to hold sway, all was well. But when the official credo found official backing, and theory became practice, things turned decidedly sour.
Railing against the "political correctness" of the Boomer generation’s progressive majority, its conservative minority could only wait for the same demographic forces which had unseated their parents’ regime to come to their rescue.
And come they did, in the form of Generations X and Y. Innocent of the old conservatism’s crimes, but only-too-aware of their Boomer parents’ glaring hypocrisies (who was it who took everything the Welfare State had to offer, and then decided it was all too expensive for their children to enjoy?) the New Zealanders born after 1967 proved easy prey for the "political correctness" calumnies of the conservative Boomers.
And so the period of progressive ascendancy has ended, and the conservative Baby Boomers – backed by their privileged generation’s alienated offspring – are eagerly anticipating an historic victory for the anti-anti-smacking referendum.
Which leaves the progressives exactly where they’ve always done their best work: carrying the flickering flames of our vulnerable virtues into the cankered heart of the conservative darkness.

My Enemy's Friends: Until the Maori Party ceases to support the neoliberal agenda of the National Party and its allies, it must remain the un-natural enemy of all progressive New Zealanders.
SOMETIMES important political questions just have to be answered – no matter how much we might prefer to avoid them.
A few weeks ago, I encountered a posting by "Lew" at the Kiwipolitico blog entitled "Memo to the Left: The Maori Party is not your enemy."
I was sorely tempted to respond: "Memo to Lew: Yes it is." But blogosphere debates with well-meaning but misguided political naïfs like Lew are never-ending, and I had better things to do with my time.
The question, however, refused to go away – resurfacing at a PPTA field officers’conference in Auckland.
As I was the guest speaker, I could hardly avoid answering, and I’m afraid my reply was rather brutal.
"Yes, the Maori Party did make a huge mistake by throwing in its lot with National. No, I do not think the Maori leadership had a very clear view of their long-term political interests. Yes, the National Party did trick them. And no, I do not believe – even after six months – they realise how very wickedly they’ve been deceived, nor how much damage their relationship with National is about to inflict on both Maori and Pakeha New Zealanders."
To properly understand the Maori Party/National Party relationship, it is first necessary to comprehend the scale of the betrayal represented by the Foreshore and Seabed Act.
For Maori, the Fifth Labour Government’s decision to nullify the Court of Appeal’s judgement on Maori customary rights was every bit as egregious – and just as devastating – as the Fourth Labour Government’s betrayal of the broader labour movement under Rogernomics.
The Maori Party was born out of the same sort of deep political anguish that saw an embittered working-class battler scrawl on the wall of the Christchurch Trades Hall: "You were supposed to help." The same sort of anger that led to the formation of the NewLabour Party in 1989, and the Alliance in 1991.
It took nearly ten years for the rage of the people who walked out of the Labour Party to subside sufficiently for Helen Clark to be invited to the 1998 Alliance Conference, and for the delegates to vote unanimously in favour of a coalition with her despised party. For most of that decade the emotional intensity of the Alliance’s attacks on Labour had always been much greater than its criticisms of National. How could it be otherwise? Pain inflicted by someone you love is always more hurtful than the blows of an enemy.
With feelings running so high, the old proverb, "my enemy’s enemy is my friend", takes on a grim logic.
But, of course, your enemy’s enemy can just as easily be your enemy too – and in the case of the foreshore and seabed debacle this was especially true. Labour’s erstwhile deputy-leader, Michael Cullen, was telling no more than the truth when he pointed out that his government had no room to manoeuvre over the Foreshore & Seabed Bill.
From the moment the Court of Appeal’s decision was announced, Labour’s pollsters began to register a rising level of anti-Maori feeling in the Pakeha population. Clearly, it would require a strong, bi-partisan effort to withstand such political pressure. Of course, National’s pollsters were picking up the same racist vibes as Labour, but, rather than stand against them, the strategists surrounding National’s new leader, Don Brash, opted to exploit them.
The Orewa Speech delivered by Brash in January 2004, and the extraordinary shift in political allegiance from Labour to National that it accomplished, destroyed any hope of a bi-partisan approach to resolving the issues raised by the Court of Appeal.
Labour was left with just two choices: It could either take a principled stand against National’s racism – and watch its electoral support evaporate; or, it could bend before the racist gale, pass the most generous legislation it could get away with, and wait for better weather.
Labour’s Maori MPs – with the obvious exception of Tariana Turia – knew enough about te riri pakeha (the white man’s anger) to grasp that, in the long term, their constituents would be better off under Labour’s reluctant racists, than they would be under a National Party eagerly exploiting anti-Maori feeling to stay ahead in the polls.
It’s the failure of the Maori Party leadership to make the same differentiation that is setting up their people for disaster.
Driven by its nationalist ideology, the Maori Party refuses to draw a distinction between the Pakeha Right and the Pakeha Left. Both the National Party and the Business Roundtable have exploited this ideological colour-blindness with consummate political skill. John Key has deployed his considerable personal charm to engage with and befriend the Maori Party MPs. (Something Labour, unaccountably, refused to do.) Meanwhile, the Business Roundtable, in an astonishing display of ideological legerdemain, somehow persuaded Turia and her co-leader, Pita Sharples, that tino rangatiratanga and laissez-faire capitalism amounted to the same thing.
On the strength of this (false) identification, both National and the Business Roundtable have been quietly transforming the Maori Party into a stalking-horse for a new round of neo-liberal "reforms". Maori Party MPs are already supporting the privatisation of prisons, and their endorsement of education vouchers and private-public-partnerships in healthcare delivery is widely anticipated.
Seduced by the Right’s uninhibited "love-bombing" (not to mention the "mana enhancement" of ministerial salaries and prestige) Turia and Sharples seem oblivious to National’s and Act’s continuing promotion of anti-Maori prejudice among their conservative base.
While "that nice Mr Key" has been playing volleyball at Ratana Pa, paying court to the "underclass" of McGeehan Close, and hongi-ing furiously with every Maori leader he can find, the National and Act parties have been indulging in "dog-whistle politics" like there is no tomorrow.
In place of the "Maori privilege" of Brash’s Orewa speech, the two right-wing parties have substituted the over-heated rhetoric of "law and order". Why? Because whenever terms like "child abuse", "violent crime" and "dysfunctional families" appear in the news headlines, the stereotype conjured up in the mind of the "right"-thinking Pakeha voter is black – not white.
Not content with becoming a stalking-horse for neo-liberalism, the Maori Party has also allowed itself to be cast in the role of the Judas-sheep: bleating dutifully about Maori "empowerment", even as it leads its trusting followers into the slaughter-houses of poverty, ill-health, educational failure and incarceration.
Although they dearly wish it were otherwise, until the Maori Party stops advancing the Right’s extremist agenda, it must remain the un-natural enemy of all progressive New Zealanders.
This is a slightly amended version of an essay originally published in The Independent of Thursday, 28 May 2009.
Chief Conductor of the "Years of Lightning": George Chapman (above) working closely with Rob Muldoon, fashioned the National Party into a formidable (and, for a while, unbeatable) political machine.
Well, for a start, it has taught us that the National Party of today isn’t a patch on the National Party of yesterday.
It is simply inconceivable that the "years of lightning" (1974-84) National Party, presided over by the redoubtable Sir George Chapman, could have overseen the political travesty that was Melissa Lee’s candidacy.
For a start, the Chapman-led National Party of the 1970s, boasted a nominal membership of 250,000 New Zealanders – a considerably larger pool of political talent than the 25,000-strong party of today.
Initially, they would have been looking for a local candidate – someone who’d spent the best part of their life in the electorate and was well-known to its citizens. A local GP, perhaps, or the headmaster of a local school, with a friendly, familiar face and reassuringly moderate views. A candidate broadly acceptable to Mt Albert’s tories, and even, properly presented, to some habitually Labour-voting liberals.
In the absence of this ideal candidate, however, they would probably have opted for a young up-and-comer from the regional party organisation. Someone like the ambitious young accountant chosen to fly National’s flag in Mt Albert during the General Election of 1954.
The then 33-year-old Robert David Muldoon had grown up in the electorate, attended Mt Albert Grammar School, and his maternal grandmother, Jerusha, had been a celebrated local socialist. He won a very creditable 35.7 percent of the votes cast.
With National riding as high in public esteem as it is at present, however, the old-school campaigners would have looked at the 43.8 percent of the vote won by F. Ryan, National’s candidate in the General Election of 1975 (when Labour was equally unpopular) and established that result as the benchmark for 2009.
An organisation as independent of its parliamentarians, and as internally vigorous as the National Party was in the mid- to late-70s, would have had little difficulty in locating a candidate ready, willing and able to take the fight to the beaten and demoralised socialists.
Active party organisations, especially those in which policies are still robustly debated on the conference floor, are constantly testing the strategic thinking, organisational skill and rhetorical ability of their most ambitious rank-and-filers. The leaders of such parties cannot help but notice those with the charisma to muster a following and, most importantly, the force of intellect and persuasive power to sway an audience.
The president of such a party would no more have dreamed of absenting herself from National’s campaign headquarters on election night, than she would of flying to the moon. Getting candidates elected is what political parties are for – it’s what they do!
The fact that National’s current president, Mrs Judith Kirk, allowed herself to be told, by Dr Jonathan Coleman (an MP!) that her presence in Mt Albert on the evening of the by-election would not be required, speaks volumes about the state of the party organisation.
Clearly, the National Party has become entirely subordinate to its Leader and his Parliamentary Caucus. John Key and his inner circle were permitted to pick Ms Lee and appoint her campaign manager. No matter that Mr Key and his cronies are relatively new to the complex demands of electoral politics. No matter that very few (if any) of them appear to understand that the only rational criterion for selecting an electorate candidate is political skill. Not a pretty face; not the ability to read an autocue; not even a proven talent for making pots of dosh; but the ability to practice politics.
But, from the moment she opened her mouth on TVNZ’s Q&A programme, it was painfully clear that Ms Lee was profoundly politically disabled. Shoulder-tapped by Mr Key, and given a winning Party List position at his insistence, she quickly became an example of the dangers and weaknesses of our MMP electoral system.
So long as she was required to do nothing more than adorn her party’s propaganda, National was safe from Ms Lee. The moment she was allowed anywhere near the hustings, she became a disaster on two legs.
It was her opponent, David Shearer, who practiced politics in Mt Albert. He was very lucky, however, to be up against the National Party of today.

Challenging the "official" version: Joe Karam, David Bain, and the Defence Team exposed the the State's failures - a sin not easily forgiven by bourgeois New Zealand.
An anonymous commentator responded to my "David Bain and the class divide" posting by dismissing it – along with my focus on class issues generally – as both nonsensical and overly simplistic. This is my response.
You claim that the national division of opinion over Bain’s innocence/guilt breaks along intelligence rather than class lines. Well, forgive me, but it is difficult to conceive of a more forthright assertion of class prejudice.
The association of intelligence with class advantage is well established historically. This is because the modern middle-class, until relatively recently, was limited in the degree to which it could transfer the social advantages it enjoyed to its offspring. High progressive taxation and death duties militated against the straightforward transfer of physical capital from one generation to the next, and so most middle-class effort was directed at securing, and passing on, its cultural capital.
Obviously, the key to securing cultural capital, along with all the advantages it brings in terms of access to the professions, and hence higher social status and income, lay in gaining control of the education system. Educational institutions, along with familial example, are the prime conveyor-belts of cultural capital. Making sure that their children had access to the best teachers, the most lavish educational infrastructure, and the most appropriate (i.e. professionally oriented) curriculum has been, and remains, one of the most important "jobs" of the middle-class as a distinct social formation.
Equating the ability to negotiate this complex pedagogical system successfully with "intelligence" has always been crucial to the middle-class’s claim that society operates on "meritocratic" principles. If people "fail", it is vitally important that they are seen to do so simply because they fall on the wrong side of life’s great bell curve. It certainly has nothing to do with a system quite consciously designed to advantage one class over another.
If you’re really interested in this stuff, I strongly recommend the writings of Barbara Ehrenreich and Prof. James Flynn.
The case has always been problematic for the middle-class because of the extremely confused and conflicting signals it has transmitted over the past 15 years.
The default position of the middle-class on practically every issue – economic, social, political and legal – is to remain safely within the boundaries of the "official view". In the Bain case that meant trusting the police evidence, the original trial judge’s exclusion of critical evidence, and accepting the first jury’s verdict. The "safety" of this position was further reinforced by the Court of Appeal’s upholding of the original verdict.
Karam’s refusal to accept the "official" verdict against Bain marked him out as a threat to all "right-thinking" and "intelligent" citizens. The growing body of evidence that Bain had been the victim of a serious miscarriage of justice – much of it from professionals like themselves – could, therefore, be swept under their mental carpet and ignored. The emotional energy required to repress the logical consequences of Karam’s new evidence was, however, bound to multiply the irrational elements in the bourgeois mindset.
The mentally dislocating effect of the Privy Council’s rejection of the "official" result must, therefore, have been devastating. Karam’s new evidence was deemed to be compelling, and that meant that there was now a new, much more "pro-Bain" official position on the case. However, because this new official position came from outside the ambit of the New Zealand bourgeoisie, it could be dismissed as in some way illegitimate. In a very important sense, the Law Lords – by challenging the competence of the local ruling class – had "let the side down".
Which is why it was so important to secure a second conviction of Bain. Only by persuading the new jury to reaffirm his guilt could the legitimacy of the original official judgment (and hence the competence of the ruling-class and its middle-class backers) be reinstated.
The dissonant effect of seeing so many expert witnesses confront and contradict the Crown’s (i.e. the Police’s) evidence must have grown increasingly pronounced in middle-class minds as the trial progressed. The official narrative of the Bain family murders was unraveling before their eyes, and that part of their being not bound up with the "politics" of the trial, would, almost certainly, have been warning them that the Crown’s case could not possibly pass the test of "beyond reasonable doubt".
The middle-class’s subsequent and quite astonishingly vicious response to Bain’s acquittal has nothing whatsoever to do with "intelligence" and everything to do with its profound resentment toward, first and foremost, the Jury, and secondly, towards Bain, Karam and the Defence team, for overturning the original official view in such a public and final fashion.
He has not, however, moved beyond their ability to cause him grief and harm. The bourgeoisie’s control of the news media allows it to harass Bain with impunity, and prevent him from leading the quiet and unmolested existence he now has the right to expect.
And, it is here that the irrational and atavistic impulses which lie so very close to the surface in the bourgeoisie make their most frightening appearances.
In their fury at being gainsaid, middle-class opinion-formers are openly calling for the abolition of trial by jury, and promoting Europe’s inquisitorial justice system. Also under attack is the right of accused persons to remain silent, along with their entitlement to proper protection against the admission of evidence highly prejudicial to receiving a fair trial.
That the New Zealand middle-class is willing to sacrifice the protections of the common law for the inquisitorial methods of the absolutist state, testifies to the highly tenuous nature of its commitment to the democratic state.
"If juries cannot be relied upon to deliver the right verdict, then we should do away with them altogether, and leave the adjudication of guilt and innocence to middle-class professionals – like ourselves. After all, people like us don’t have the time to sit on juries, and – clearly – justice can no longer be left to the sort of dummies who do."
Because, in the middle-class mind Bain represents much more than a convicted murderer. As the sole survivor of the Bain family, he has always been expected to carry the guilt – and bear the punishment – for its terrible failure to uphold core bourgeois values.
The dilapidated, squalid, stinking family dwelling: a fine (and valuable) old house allowed to go to wrack and ruin. The parent’s failed marriage: followed by their mental and moral disintegration. The waywardness of the children: with one of the daughters regularly prostituting herself. The dark hints of rape and incest. The whole, tragic picture of an attractive and talented middle-class family descending into a pit of self-neglect and social demotion. It is this, the truly terrifying spectacle of family failure and downward social mobility, that gnaws away at the middle-class psyche whenever the Bain case is contemplated.
That is the real, unspoken crime for which the entire Bain family stands condemned in the court of bourgeois opinion. For acting out the middle-class’s most fearful nightmares, it was psychologically vital that nobody emerged from 65 Every Street – "not guilty".
Helpless Victims? Twenty years ago the feminist slogan was "Girls can do anything!" Today's feminists seem to be arguing precisely the opposite. That, far from being men's equals, like these Israeli women conscripts, they are really nothing more than helpless victims, utterly incapable of looking after themselves. The women in the photograph (and their M16s) would probably disagree.
"VICTIM" is a slippery word. Our hearts go out to the "victims" of natural disasters and random attacks – people who have suffered harm through no fault of their own. We are more sparing with our sympathy, however, if the "victims" are perceived to have, even in the slightest degree, participated in, or contributed to, their own misfortune.
The women involved in the political downfall of Dr Richard Worth provide a topical example. Across the airways and throughout the blogosphere debate has raged over the degree of culpability (if any) attributable to the former Cabinet Minister’s "victims".
The Left – especially the Feminist Left – has come down firmly on the side of the women, painting them has the helpless prey of a powerful and predatory male. The Right, while expressing scant sympathy for Dr Worth, has been equally reluctant to acknowledge the women’s "victimhood" unequivocally.
To the rising fury of the Left, right-wing commentators have homed in on the details of the women’s allegations – asking pertinent questions and raising reasonable doubts.
I must confess to harbouring one-or-two questions and doubts of my own in relation to this "sex scandal", but what worries me most is the Left’s apparent inability to assess critically the variety of allegations currently being levelled against Dr Worth.
In the ever-diminishing sorority of radical feminist ideologues, all that is required to convict a man of sexual misconduct is a woman’s accusation. To demand proof from the accuser, or an inquiry into the context of the accused’s alleged "crime", is tantamount to colluding in the woman’s ongoing victimisation by our repressive patriarchal society – to which, ultimately, all women fall victim.
But, to create an alternative society, one in which a man can be convicted of a serious offence purely on the accusation of a woman, is to create a society even more oppressive than the patriarchy it is intended to replace. To abandon the presumption of innocence; do away with a person’s right to confront their accuser; fatally compromise the fundamental rules of evidence; and renounce trial by jury and "reasonable doubt", is to undermine our justice system in its entirety.
Yet this is the road that many feminists (motivated, no doubt, by the very best of intentions) would have us go down.
Feminist sociologist, and Whanganui Family Violence Case Management Coodinator, Dr Angela Jury, for example, argues for "an ideological shift away from burdening abuse victims with the responsibility of choosing to end the abuse".
According to Dr Jury’s research: "the use of language around choice and freedom in advice to abused women – ‘you don’t have to live like this’, ‘you can leave’, ‘there is help available’. All of these – while probably selected as terms offering empowerment to victims – can also operate to engender a sense of weakness on the part of the victims … thus creating a sense of shame and self-blame."
But, if we’re not allowed to encourage the woman to end the abuse herself, by leaving the abuser and/or alerting the authorities, how are we supposed to keep her safe from harm? By encouraging others to alert the authorities on her behalf? But wouldn’t that mean dobbing in our neighbours, our workmates, even our friends – if we believed them guilty of abusing their wives, partners or children? And, what if the abuse victims were too overwhelmed by "shame and self-blame" to testify against their abusers – what then? Should they be convicted without hard evidence? Purely on the basis of our accusation?
But this is exactly the tangled ethical thicket into which an uncritical focus on victimhood leads us.
If we are to build a just and equitable society, it can only be constructed upon the assumption of a free and equal citizenry. And I use the word "assumption" quite deliberately here, because "freedom" and "equality" – like "justice" and "truth" – are abstract nouns which may, or may not, refer to real and concrete entities like you and me.
And yet, without assuming the abstract concepts of democratic citizenship refer to something real, we are lost. Because, if we are not free and equal citizens, then what are we? Nothing but problematic bundles of neuroses and psychoses? Bent and battered human vessels, chockfull of defective genetic material? Suitable cases for "expert" treatment?

HAVE YOU NOTICED that most of those who’ve come out against David Bain’s acquittal are middle class?
Quite why there should be such a glaring class divide over the verdict is puzzling. Is it simply a case of those with something to lose naturally reposing more faith in the institutional guardians of private property – the police and the courts?
Or perhaps the middle class is reacting to a rare New Zealand example of épater les bourgeoisie – skewering the middle class. Taking umbrage at the one-fingered proletarian salute from all those on the receiving end of bourgeois "justice", as they witnessed the spectacle of this strange, gangly jailbird finally making it over the cuckoo’s nest.
On the other hand, the explanation could come down to something as banal as journalistic jealousy. Unlike Arthur Allan Thomas and David Doughety, David Bain wasn’t freed by the professional skills of a tenacious and courageous journalist, but by the dogged determination of the surly ex-All-Black businessman, Joe Karam.
Openly scornful of what he regarded as the news media’s inexcusable failure to recognise a blatant miscarriage of justice, Bain’s swarthy champion made few friends on the press bench. It is in the nature of journalists to simplify and dramatise. If Karam was in David’s corner – they would be in the Crown’s.
But to blame in on the journalists doesn’t get rid of the class issue, it merely pushes it back a few steps. Journalism is very much a bourgeois trade – especially in its upper reaches. Only someone with the gift for translating the subtle, and not-so-subtle, nuances of class interaction can write a truly great tabloid headline.
Never forgetting, of course, the New Zealand journalist’s infatuation with authority and "official sources". When the Court of Appeal rejected Bain’s bid for a re-trial, few – if any – of this country’s editors were willing to second-guess the judges. Karam’s persistence in the face of the Court’s rejection was interpreted as the behaviour of a crank; someone who didn’t know when to quit.
We can only imagine their consternation when the Privy Council ordered a re-trial of the Bain case. Implicity, the British Law Lords were criticising the entire New Zealand Establishment; telling them in no uncertain terms that they were a bunch of provincial buffoons who couldn’t recognise the most rank injustice (and police incompetence) even when a layman like Karam had made sure it was staring them in the face.
No wonder they wanted Bain to be found guilty a second time. An acquittal could only be seen as vindication of every accusation Karam had ever levelled at the New Zealand Police and the New Zealand legal system – as well as a serious indictment of its news media.
So, when, last Friday, that Christchurch jury found David Bain "Not Guilty" of murdering all five members of his family, it turned out to be much more than a victory for the Defendant, Karam and their supporters. It was also a victory for the potent democratic impulse our Anglo-Saxon ancestors enshrined in the practice of judging an accused person by a jury of his or her peers. Not by the Police; not by lawyers and judges; and certainly not by editors and journalists: but by twelve ordinary men and women.
The almost obscene delight the news media has taken in revealing the highly prejudicial "secret evidence" which had been, quite rightly, suppressed by the courts prior to Bain’s trial, speaks volumes about the vigilante temperament of so many of our editors and journalists. And, it only gets worse. Because, not content with helping to defame Bain, these same middle-class journalists are now calling into question the whole institution of trial by jury.
The vindictiveness and fury of the middle-class, when robbed of its prey, is truly terrifying to behold.
So, God bless that Christchurch jury! Because, in freeing David Bain, they were, in effect, freeing us all. Not, as far too many of my journalistic colleagues seem to think, from the responsibility we all have to uphold the law, but from the oppressive power of a wayward State which, having failed in its duty to administer the law without fear or favour, persisted in that failure regardless of contradictory evidence, and heedless of the fact that it had imprisoned an innocent man for 13 years.
Ruling classes do not enjoy being told they got it wrong. But just as the Tree of Liberty must occasionally be watered by the blood of patriots, so must the keenness of Justice’s blade every now-and-again be tested on the bone-hard prejudices of the bourgeoisie.
Night of the Living Dead: This 1968 horror classic features creatures that refuse to die. Is the National Government battling a neo-liberal establishment which similarly refuses to accept its own mortality?
IS THIS GOVERNMENT really the free-market horror film its left-wing critics make it out to be? Or, are John Key’s and Bill English’s most daunting political challengers now coming at them from the Right?
According to Labour and its left-wing allies, John Key is a hard-line free-marketeer who had to be "sold" to the New Zealand electorate (principally by the Australian political consultancy, Crosby-Textor) as a benign centrist. Had Key not adopted this persona, the Left insists, he would never have been elected. Which means National’s election-winning formula: Labour-lite + tax-cuts; cannot be abandoned before 2011 without putting its re-election at risk. Consequently, Key must wait until he wins a second term before unleashing his "secret" agenda: radical welfare reform + wholesale deregulation and privatisation.
But what if we are actually watching a very different movie? What if, far from being a sort of antipodean werewolf, impatiently waiting for the next electoral full moon so he can tear to shreds what remains of the egalitarian New Zealand dream, Key really is a moderate? What if the horror-movie we’re watching isn’t The Howling, but a political version of Night of the Living Dead, in which Key and his Finance Minister desperately battle the reanimated corpses of economic and social policies everyone believed dead and buried in the 1990s?
So, has the Budget really got the zombies pounding on the Beehive door? Well, National’s far-Right allies were certainly vocally unimpressed by Bill English’s "Road to Recovery". Act Leader, Rodney Hide, (as befits his ministerial status) has remained silent, but the keeper of the party’s ideological flame, Sir Roger Douglas, has unleashed volley after volley of verbal scorn upon English’s economic programme.
"This is the budget of deficits", thundered the former Finance Minister on Budget Day. "A deficit of spending, a deficit of the current account, a deficit of courage, but most importantly, a deficit of imagination."
But what would a budget which passed Sir Roger’s imagination test look like? What do the unreconstructed disciples of Milton Friedman and Friedrich von Hayek actually want from John Key and Bill English? And could Key’s government possibly deliver it?
Fortunately, former Act MP, and proprietor of the NZ Centre for Political Research website, Muriel Newman, also wanted answers to these questions, and asked the Executive Director of the NZ Business Roundtable, Roger Kerr, to supply them.
In his guest commentary to the NZCPR Weekly newsletter, Kerr is careful not to be too specific in his recommendations, but the overall direction of his proposed programme of "reform" is reasonably clear.
He applauds what he claims is Bill English’s emphasis on "structural adjustment" – meaning a "shift of resources from the domestic economy to internationally competing industries". This "basic change in economic direction", says Kerr, is one of the (all-too-few?) "positive features" of the Budget.
What that ominous term "structural adjustment" means in plain English, is that Kerr very badly wants this Government to slash public spending on the goods and services New Zealanders consume, and redirect the state’s resources towards private businesses producing goods and services that foreigners consume.
In reality, there’s very little in this Budget that redirects resources in the way Kerr suggests. Indeed, English has been criticised by many commentators for maintaining the level of state spending in health, education and social welfare at the expense of the export sector. He did, after all, cut back on state support for research and development and skills training – both of which are crucial to lifting productivity.
To be blunt, I think Kerr is confusing what English has actually done, with what the Business Roundtable would like him to do. It’s a frequent mistake among left-wing ideologues, especially those dealing with conservative social-democratic governments – so it’s comforting to discover that right-wing ideologues suffer from the same wishful thinking.
"If we are to [catch up with Australian income levels by 2025] the government (and the community at large) have to recognise the need for policy settings much more like those of more successful countries. We can’t continue avoiding ‘third rail’ issues such as the superannuation eligibility age, privatisation of commercial businesses, a freer labour market and welfare reform."
In unpacking that heavily loaded sentence, we catch a glimpse of the sort of New Zealand the Business Roundtable is hoping to create.
It will be a New Zealand without unions. What else can "freer" mean when, already, barely seven percent of the private sector workforce is unionised? To further "free" the labour market, the public sector unions covering teachers, nurses and civil servants would have to be targeted. But, eliminating these powerful democratic institutions will not be achieved without massive political upheaval.
The same, of course, might be said about imposing "welfare reform" – a code-word for radically restricting citizens’ access to transfer payments, usually by limiting the period of eligibility to 3 months, or less.
Limiting elderly New Zealanders’ access to superannuation, by lifting the age of entitlement to 67, or more, and privatising what remains of the publicly-owned airways, railways and electricity generators rounds out Kerr’s vision of the future. Clearly, the Business Roundtable’s "ideal" New Zealand is going be a much less generous – and a much more politically contentious – country in which to live.
Or will it? Given that Kerr holds up both Hong Kong and Singapore as models of "small, high income countries" (‘with authoritarian governments’, he should have, but unaccountably failed, to add) political dissent may not be all that welcome in the Business Roundtable’s brave new world.
Writing about the current global economic crisis in The London Review of Books, recently, the veteran British labour historian, Ross McKibbin observed:
"The present crisis has established beyond doubt that neoliberalism, even the British form, and democracy are incompatible. To try to make them compatible, governments have adopted ever more risky policies, which brought down the last Conservative government and will probably bring down Brown’s."
"Risky" is a most inadequate word to describe the prescription which Kerr is offering Key and English. Filling it would be political suicide.
Perhaps, the Left should reconsider its rather gruesome characterisation of National’s leaders. Compared to the undead ideological creatures pounding on their door, who do Key and English more resemble: villains – or heroes?
FOR sheer Pollyanna puffery, Simon Wilson’s "Why We Love Super City", in the latest issue of Metro, takes some beating. The image of a perky cheerleader dominates Wilson’s text, and that is wholly appropriate. When your sub-heading is "Why Rodney Hide has got it right. Really." – cheerleading is pretty obviously the name of the game.
It’s a pity really, because Wilson is usually a thoughtful writer, and not given to lending his support to the sort of PR glad-games currently being rolled out to justify one of the most audacious power-grabs in New Zealand’s political history.
The article begins with the picture of a region suffering from "economic underperformance, blighted urban planning and social dysfunction" – all of it, Wilson implies, the dystopic residue of incompetent "local fiefdoms". He has to do this, of course, because if it could be proved that Auckland’s multiple afflictions (if they exist at all) are in no way the fault of its local authorities, then the whole rationale for Hide’s "Super-City" disappears.
But, this is precisely what Auckland’s history does; it completely explodes both Hide’s and the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance’s arguments for collapsing local democracy into regional "governance". The city’s woes, going back to, and beyond, 1865, have almost always arisen out of Auckland businessmen’s determination to turn politics into profit.
Whether it be Thomas Russell, fomenting war with the Maori king to expedite his company’s land-grabbing; or the powerful "development" business nexus, which spawned the sprawling, car-dependent culture of post-war Auckland; or the mirror-glass speculators, who tore down what remained of the city’s graceful Victorian architecture in the deregulated 80s; it has always been that fateful combination of greed and ambition (both local and national) which made Greater Auckland so much less than it could have – should have – been.
Were the cities and boroughs of Auckland responsible for the motorway system which demolished so many thriving communities in the 1950s and 60s – or was that the work a handful of Auckland roading contractors and property developers, operating hand-in-glove with their National Party cronies in the Capital?
Was it Auckland’s local politicians who shut down the great manufacturing plants of south and west Auckland in the 1980s – or was the resulting "economic underperformance" and "social dysfunction" the legacy of the MPs for Mangere, Manurewa, Te Atatu and Auckland Central?
Was it the avarice of mayors and city councillors which saw the wealth of middle-class Aucklanders wiped out in the crash of ’87 – or was it the greed of the wide boys who drank at the Rogues Bar and worked for Equiticorp?
Was it the Auckland Regional Council which stalled the electrification of Auckland’s rail services for the past four years – or was that Michael Cullen and his Treasury advisers?
The key premise behind the Super City proposal is that Auckland’s local problems are the fault of Auckland’s local politicians – and it just ain’t true.
Wilson, as an editor of New Zealand history, and one of Metro’s senior writers, should know all this. So why is his article a history-free zone? Perhaps because it’s so much easier to declare, bluntly, and without the slightest supporting evidence, that: "The status-quo is not an option."
But even if we accept that some sort of change is desirable, the more important question: "Why Rodney Hide’s version of change?", is one that Wilson does not even begin to answer.
It’s all very well to play-up the Royal Commission’s emphasis on social, economic, environmental and cultural "well-being", but the brute fact of the matter is that all of its "namby-pamby, feel-good sloganising" has been rejected by both the National and Act Parties. They have a very different set of priorities.
And before citing Singapore, Seattle, Glasgow and Barcelona as examples of "vibrant" urban economies, why didn’t Wilson do a little research into the nature of their governmental structures.
Rightly celebrated throughout the European Union as one of its most progressively governed cities, Glasgow, with a population of 580,690 citizens, is roughly comparable in size to the present City of Auckland. The similarities end there, however, because instead of Auckland’s 19, Glaswegians get to elect 79 city councillors – one councillor for every 7,350 citizens. Compare that "vibrant" and very democratic ratio with Rodney Hide’s one Super City councillor for every 65,000 citizens. Even Barcelona’s 1.6 million citizens, living under a municipal constitution drafted in 1960 by General Franco’s fascist regime, are entitled to 41 councillors (1:39,000).
What Wilson has either failed to understand, or refuses to acknowledge, is that the Auckland Super City has been designed by neo-liberals, for neo-liberals. From its very beginnings, as the brainchild of senior Auckland business leaders, it’s purpose has never been to generate the "social well-being" which the members of the Royal Commission so naively attempted to interpose in their report, but its opposite. What Rodney Hide and his backers want to see in their shining Super City on a hill, is that universal hallmark of neo-liberal success: growing income inequalities.
That’s why Hide is promoting the democratic obscenity of 20 councillors for 1.3 million citizens. (With eight of the 20 elected "at large", an electoral option rejected by New Zealanders more than 20 years ago.) It’s why he’s promoting 20-30 powerless "community councils", rather than the four, more influential, "city councils" recommended by the Royal Commission. It also explains his vehement opposition to special Maori representation, and why the straightforward, democratic, expedient of taking the 75 councillors currently representing the four major cities of the Auckland region, and putting them under the roof of a single chamber, simply wouldn’t occur to him. Why not? Because, fundamentally, neo-liberalism and democracy are incompatible.
In his final paragraph, Wilson quotes the Royal Commission’s vision statement, noting approvingly its preference for "an integrated sustainable approach" and its wish that the city’s business be "actively and effectively managed … in a responsible way". But this is the bloodless language of corporate bureaucracy – not popular democracy. Nowhere in his article, and in spite of all his condescending concern for the "common folk", does Wilson acknowledge that it is their right to self-government – not good governance – that is at stake for Auckland’s 1.3 million citizens.
"Who doesn’t want that? Who doesn’t think we need it? And who seriously thinks we’ve got it already?"
WHAT IS IT with left-wing women? Why does it take a Cactus Kate to spell out the bleeding-bloody-obvious about Phil Goff’s damsel-in-distress? And, where’s the advantage, when it comes to living a fulfilling, exciting and, yes, occasionally risky life, of behaving like a permanently helpless victim?
So Dr Richard Worth hits on women. So what? It’s a thing men do. Some with genuine style and panache, others with all the finesse of a slobbering dog. Women worthy of the name take the stylish ones to bed, and tell the slobberers to take themselves somewhere else.
And, if the silly sods refuse to take the hint? Well, that’s what, workmates/bosses/girlfriends/boyfriends/husbands and, if worse comes to worst, police officers are for.
By the sounds of things, Dr Worth is a slobberer. A slobberer, moreover, who seems to have real difficulties taking the hint. Presumably, that’s why he’s become the subject of a serious allegation of wrong-doing, and why his political career lies in ruins.
If you behave like a slobbering prat, entirely unmindful of your responsibilities as a husband, a father, a minister of the Crown, a member of Parliament, a member of the National Party caucus (not to mention a member of the human race) then you deserve nothing better.
The curse of Karma has caught up with the erring member of the erring Member. So what is all the simpering and mewling and tut-tutting and isn’t-it-awfulling about?
Sex is a thing that grown-ups do. Learning to negotiate one’s way through the reefs of lust and longing is, therefore, an important and inescapable part of becoming a mature human-being. In a culture (one of the very few cultures, in fact) which proclaims and enforces the principle of sexual equality, it looks really bad when left-wing "feminists" start behaving like a bunch of Victorian maidens confronted with a naked table-leg.
If "girls can do anything", then surely they can tell some randy old bugger to fuck-off and leave them alone?
IT was one of those throwaway lines that sets an alarm-bell ringing in the back of your mind. A sneering, belittling tone which makes you wonder. "What was that all about?" Or ask: "Who rattled his cage?"
The line in question appeared in an article by William Langley, a conservative political correspondent for the right-wing British newspaper, The Sunday Telegraph. He was writing about President Obama’s nominee for the US Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, and how she exemplifies the human quality the new American President prizes most: Empathy.
"The word – ", wrote Mr Langley, "a longstanding pop-psychology and self-help manual standby – has been heavily in play since Obama last week proposed Sonia Sotomayor, a New York appeals court judge, as his first Supreme Court pick."
"Whoa there, Billy Boy!" I thought to myself, as I read those words. Since when has "empathy" connoted something as frothy and ultimately superfluous as "pop psychology"? And who, exactly, has decided that the moral impulse which lies at the root of all the world’s great religions; the defining quality of the most exalted human behaviour, should be downgraded to the status of a "self-help manual standby"?
I didn’t have to read much further to discover the answer. According to the man who scripted most of the George Bush Jnr presidency, Karl Rove: "Empathy is the latest code word for liberal activism, for treating the constitution as malleable clay to be kneaded and moulded in whatever form justices want."
Aha! So that’s the caper. President Obama, in the tradition of America’s greatest presidents, is attempting to infuse his countrymen’s’ political discourse with a moral language more nuanced and sophisticated that the Bush Administration’s crude division of the world into a Manichean "Us" (the good guys) versus "Them" (the evil-doers).
"We need somebody whose got the heart, the empathy, to recognise what it’s like to be a young teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it’s like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old. And that’s the criteria by which I’m going to be selecting my judges."
Good Lord! No wonder the Right is all a-twitter. For the past thirty years they have enjoyed a virtual monopoly over the use of religious rhetoric. Never mind that it was Old Testament rhetoric – full of "thou shalt nots", and trailing the fire and brimstone of the Pentateuch God. So long as the Left refused to plough this most fertile of all political fields, the Right couldn’t lose.
But President Obama is only too happy to toil in the fields of the Lord, and to confront the Republican Party’s Old Testament rhetoric, with the emancipatory and, yes, empathic language of the New.
It’s there in his Inaugural Address, when he talks about the contribution of the men and women "obscure in their labour, who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom".
Who can hear those words and not be reminded of Christ’s: "straight is the gate and narrow is the way, that leadeth unto life, and few there be who find it"?
Consider, too, President Obama’s Georgetown University speech, in which he draws explicitly from the Sermon on the Mount:
The President’s New Testament rhetoric strikes at the heart of the Right’s political project in a way that is peculiarly American – and peculiarly effective.
In a nation whose visceral fear and hatred of "Godless Communism" is legendary, Christ’s liberating theology of love and justice has long supplied the American Left with a potent alternative to the class-ridden rhetoric of Marx and Lenin. When that great American revolutionary, Dr Martin Luther King, made out the case for racial emancipation and social solidarity, he did so using the language of the Bible – not Das Kapital.
Empathy – the ability to put yourself in another person’s shoes – is fundamental to President Obama’s redemptive project. By recruiting Jesus to the Democratic cause, and setting him against the Republican’s Jehovah, The President has forced the Right into a theological and political battle it cannot win.
Unless, of course, it first persuades us that empathy – the attribute without which we cannot truly be called human – is nothing but "pop psychology" and a "self-help manual standby".

WHAT SHALL WE DO about poor little Tigger? If he never eats nothing he’ll never get bigger. So sings Winnie the Pooh as he attempts to rustle-up some breakfast for his new playmate. The Left is asking the same question about those Tiggers of New Zealand politics – the Greens. For if Jeanette Fitzsimons is not given a clear run at the Coromandel seat in the forthcoming election, the Greens chances of ever growing big enough to climb over the five percent MMP threshold look very slim indeed.
The key to unlocking Coromandel for the Greens is in Labour’s hands. At the last election Ms Fitzsimons received 9,561 votes, just 2,450 less than National’s Murray McLean. If the 4,255 people who voted for Labour in 1996 could be persuaded to come in behind the Greens in 1999, then there is every chance of Ms Fitzsimons winning the seat. A Green victory is even more likely when one considers the likely voting behaviour of the 7,932 people who, in 1996, supported NZ First.
According to the rules of MMP, a party which wins an electorate seat is automatically entitled to the number of seats represented by its overall share of the valid Party Vote – even if that share amounts to less than five percent. In the Taranaki-King Country by-election the Greens won approximately 2.5 percent of the vote, and most commentators believe they will achieve at least that level of support simply by having their name on the ballot paper. With 2-3 percent of the Party Vote - plus Coromandel – the Greens could expect to see at least two - and possibly as many as four - MPs in the House of Representatives. And seats in the House are what Tiggers like best!
The question for Labour to answer, as the election draws near, is this: "What reasons can they sensibly offer for NOT throwing their support behind the Greens in Coromandel?" As the undisputed leader of the Left – at least in electoral terms – shouldn’t Labour be committed to seating the broadest and most accurate representation of progressive New Zealand which is possible? And, if it is acceptable for the Labour Party to align itself formally with the Socialist Left, in the form of the Alliance, why not Ecological Left with the Greens?
Broadening the base of a future Left Coalition also makes excellent electoral sense. Historically, the Green Party has drawn its support not only from red-green radicals, but also from blue-green conservatives. A brief glance at the electorates in which the Greens won strong support in 1990 (the last time they stood in their own right) shows that a Green Party with momentum is as likely to take votes from National as Labour. In other words, by backing the Greens Labour can actually grow the total Centre Left vote. That has to be a better prospect than simply redistributing the same amount of support between themselves and the Alliance.
To achieve that momentum, however, Labour needs to signal its support for Ms Fitzsimons sooner rather than later. If the voters can be persuaded that, come what may, the Greens are certain to be represented in Parliament, then they can tick their box on the ballot paper with a clear conscience. Without Labour’s (and then almost certainly the Alliance’s) agreement to stand aside in Coromandel, people considering casting a Party Vote for the Greens may reluctantly come to the conclusion that they would be throwing it away.
And that would be a pity. The Greens, like A.A. Milne’s Tigger, may be bouncy and prone to mischief (especially with genetically engineered potato crops!), but they also represent our last, best hope for a sustainable future.
Labour Day, Dunedin, 1894: As the unions mass in what is now Dunedin's Queen's Gardens, a mother leans forward to tell her children about the meaning of Labour Day. What would a mother tell her children about "the cause of labour" in 2013? That it died in 1991? Or, that it will be reborn in 2014?
WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE were they, this mother and her children? The photograph is dated Labour Day, 1894. The little family stands in a dog cart, watching, while across the dusty roadway several hundred unionists, their bright banners billowing against the regular lines of the city’s commercial hub, muster for their grand procession. The strict Victorian civility of the scene cannot mask the underlying political context: Labour versus Capital. How did that mother convey Labour Day’s meaning to her children on that overcast morning in October, 109 years ago?
Perhaps her husband, the children’s father, was among the union throng. He may have helped to build one of the many floats about to make their way up the city’s main street. Most of the trades were represented: carpenters, butchers, bakers; their carts festooned with the all the paraphernalia of their occupation. The bakers have loaded up great barrels of flour. On the cart’s sideboards a painted banner proclaims: “Peace and Plenty”.
The connections were clearer then. When work lay at the very heart of the human experience, and when the correspondence between the condition of labour and the condition of the community was obvious and indisputable. Without the carpenters, stonemasons and glaziers there would be no city to live in. Without the butchers and the bakers, no meat and no bread.
In the minds of the nineteenth century working-classes, mere ownership did not constitute the be-all and end-all of social significance. A factory without workers was an empty and expensive shell. The butchery or bakery, without butchers or bakers, had nothing to sell. Capital without Labour was a ledger entry – nothing more.
And perhaps that brute fact was easier to see in the colonies than in the Old Country. The churches and the town halls of nineteenth century New Zealand and Australia (and the rapidly growing states of the American West) may have looked as though they had stood above their Squares and Octagons for centuries, but the colonists knew better. The men and women who had built Christchurch, Dunedin, Melbourne, Adelaide and Chicago, all understood that the great settler cities which had exploded out of the raw landscapes of imperial ambition were overwhelmingly and unquestionably collective enterprises. Capital and Labour had arrived together: neither lived but by the efforts of the other.
It’s what the carpenter, Sam Parnell, had grasped the moment his feet touched the Petone foreshore in 1840. That this was a new land, with new rules, where the expectations of the masters back in England would be subject to radical revision. Here, the worker would labour for eight of the day’s 24 hours. Eight more would be for his rest. And the remaining eight would be for himself and his family. If the masters wanted or needed more than eight hours, then they would be obliged to pay their employees a handsome premium for the “over-time”.
Perhaps this was the grand old tale that the mother in the photograph told her children as they watched the Labour Day procession form up on that October morning long ago.
Newer stories, too, she’d have to tell. About how the Reverend Rutherford Waddell had preached against “The Sin of Cheapness”, exposing the sweated labour of the seamstresses, and how, from the resulting public outrage, the Tailoresses’ Union had been born. Of the Great Maritime Strike of 1890, she would have spoken. Of how the seafarers, the watersiders and the coal miners came together on 28 October 1889 to form the Maritime Council (New Zealand’s first effective union combination). She would have told her children how, though the nationwide strike was broken, the cause of labour did not falter: for in that same year the Liberals were swept to power on the votes of working men. And re-elected, she would have added, her eyes shining with pride, on the votes of working women. And of how the Liberal Government, earlier that very year, had passed the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act – which would, on New Year’s Day, make the workers of New Zealand the envy of workers all the world around.
That woman’s children would, of course, live to see the great wave of social progress in which their parents participated rolled back upon the rocky reefs of war and economic catastrophe. The millennial dreams of their mother’s and father’s generation would not be realised, but the unrelenting push of the unions would achieve many of their most cherished objectives. The Welfare State and the 40-hour week would both become law when Labour finally took up the reins of government in its own name in 1935.
So what, if anything, should mothers tell their children about the meaning of Labour Day in 2013? That dreams, like photographs, can fade? Or that history, like spring, reminds us what hope is for?

Grass Roots Fervour: The American political class is only now becoming aware of how dangerous the monster created by billionaire far-right activists like the Koch brothers truly is. The recent stand-off between the Tea Party faction of the Republican Party and the Obama Administration - far from being interpreted as a defeat by the radical right - has only made it hungrier for more and larger confrontations with "Big Government". The New Zealand left could learn some valuable lessons from the American right's revolutionary intransigence.
SO, YOU THINK the Tea Party has just taken a “shellacking” from President Obama? Well, think again. Forget about the sneers and jeers of those inside the Washington Beltway: the people Tea Partiers dismiss contemptuously as “the political class”; because out there in “Redland” (the Republican heartland) the true believers are celebrating.
As they see it, victory was very nearly theirs. For 16 days, the whole, corrupt edifice of “big government” (as they would characterise the monuments, museums and national parks their representatives shut down) had ceased to function. Even more thrilling, from their perspective, was how very close they came to causing the United States to default on its debts.
And they’re right. The Tea Party came within an inch of plunging the whole world into a new financial crisis. Are they ashamed of themselves? Hell no! Are they downhearted? No way! Indeed, they can hardly wait until January and February 2014 when their “suicide bombers” in the House of Representatives will do it all again. Because next time – or the time after that – they absolutely will succeed.
Like the Bostonians who tipped chestfuls of British tea into Boston Harbour in 1773, the eponymous Tea Partiers of 2013 are looking to bring down an entire politico-economic system. In the twenty-first century, the Tea Party (and grass-roots citizens’ movements like it) is what revolution looks like.
Not like the Occupy Movement? Surely the youngsters who attacked Wall Street’s “one percenters” are more deserving of the title “revolutionaries” than these middle-aged (and older) mid-westerners who cannot distinguish President Obama’s minimal, privately-led and Republican Party-inspired health insurance scheme from fully-fledged “socialism”?
No, not the Occupy Movement. Because the Occupy Movement failed to do what every good revolutionary must learn to do: speak to people in language they can understand.
In 1917,when Lenin alighted at the Finland Station in Petrograd and was promptly hoisted onto an armoured car to address the workers and peasant soldiers who had come to greet him, he didn’t launch into a complicated explanation of the various hand-signals to be employed in reaching a consensus on what the soviets (workers’ councils) should do next. He shouted: “Peace! Bread! Land!” The three things his audience most wanted to hear. Adding for good measure the truly revolutionary slogan: “All power to the soviets!”
The Tea Partiers are only right-wing because they haven’t yet had an opportunity to realise how mistaken they have been in their choice of targets. The moment their social security payments are disrupted, or a Wall Street collapse wipes out their pension fund, their naïve prairie anger will very swiftly identify new, more traditional, scapegoats.
In the meantime, the left-wing of the New Zealand Labour Party could learn a thing or two from the Republican Right about how to keep their elected representatives under control.
The threat the Tea Party deploys with such astonishing effect against those who refuse to toe its political line is the threat of being “primaried”. In New Zealand terms: having someone run against you for your party’s endorsement. Nothing curbs a politician’s independent streak faster than a credible threat of de-selection.
Naturally, creating a credible threat first requires professional rabble-rousers to whip-up a firestorm of ideological fervour among the party faithful. The incumbents are then presented with a list of radical demands which they either adopt as their own, or find themselves replaced by somebody whose ideological purity is beyond question.
Thanks to Labour’s right-wing MPs’ all-too-evident disdain for their party’s left-wing policy preferences, conditions akin to those which allowed the Republican Party’s conservative base to be mobilised against Washington’s RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) are now fast maturing in both the Labour Party and the trade unions.
The political class should be very, very afraid. Because the rise of both the Tea Party in the USA and the Labour Left in New Zealand are but harbingers of the radical and unstoppable populist revolt that will soon bring financial capitalism to its knees.

Driving The Transition: The large iwi-based corporations - epitomised by Ngai Tahu's impressive corporate structure, headed by Mark Solomon (above) are driving the transition from tribal traditionalism to the rational bureaucratic norms of secular society. The journey was difficult and uncomfortable for the Pakeha's ancestors, it will be no less so for Maori.
IF WINSTON PETERS did not exist, Pakeha New Zealand would have to invent him. Very few politicians are willing to risk the opprobrium which inevitably accompanies serious criticism of things Maori. But as a Maori himself, Mr Peters enjoys a sort of immunity from “sickly white liberal” prosecution. It’s as well that he does. Otherwise, holding Maori individuals and institutions to account for the expenditure of public funds would be even more difficult than it is.
And Mr Peters willingness to point the finger at his own people’s shortcomings would appear to be catching. Over the past month we have witnessed two important examples of Maori journalists exposing what they claim to be serious problems with the management of significant amounts of public money by Maori trusts.
The first of these exposés involved accusations of mismanagement against senior figures within the Kohanga Reo movement. It was Maori Television’s Annabelle-Lee Harris and Mihingarangi Forbes who broke the story. In an item entitled “Feathering the Nest”, the Native Affairs programme drew attention to unusual patterns of credit card expenditure and a number of large unreceipted donations.
Considerable effort was devoted to thwarting the Native Affairs investigation – not least an unsuccessful attempt to secure a court injunction against the programme’s broadcast.
As a result of Native Affairs courageous journalism, the Ministers of Education and Maori Affairs have jointly demanded a full investigation of the alleged irregularities.
The second example involved what might be called a “whistle-blowing” broadcast alleging serious instances of mismanagement at Tokoroa’s Maori radio station Raukawa FM. In an extraordinary sequence of events, the station manager, Rosina Hauiti, last month took to the airwaves with a long list of allegations against the station’s trustees. When the latter attempted to evict her from the building, Ms Hauiti barricaded herself against all-comers.
Though charges and counter-charges continue to fly, Ms Hauiti’s broadcast, like Ms Forbes, has produced the desired outcome – an official intervention. Te Mangai Paho, the station’s principal funder (to the tune of $384,100 per annum) has asked the accounting firm, Deloitte, to investigate Ms Hauiti’s allegations as part of their scheduled review of the trust board’s activities.
Speaking at the NZ First Party’s annual conference in Christchurch on Saturday, 19 October, the NZ First leader recalled the late 1980s and early 90s when many businesses engaged in “the greatest deceit” until dragged into line by improved systems of accountability.
Mr Peters said Maoridom had called for transparency in the past, but now fended off legitimate investigation with accusations of “Maori bashing”.
He claimed that: “Certain ones have gone back to that behaviour, where to challenge them was to challenge their mana, their breeding, any concocted excuse to get out of their responsibility to their own people and the taxpayer. It means that honest Maori, who are the great bulk of Maori, are imaged in the worst possible light, and it cheats them of a certain future.”
This newfound willingness to hold itself to account signals that a profound sociological shift is underway in Maoridom. Max Weber, the nineteenth century “father” of modern sociology, would have immediately recognised the processes at work.
As Maori capitalism develops (most obviously in the form of the large iwi-based corporation) it is producing scores of tertiary-educated, highly-skilled young graduates. Increasingly, these young Maori professionals are unwilling to tolerate either the business inefficiencies generated by traditional practices, or the injustices so often associated with charismatic leadership. They are past making excuses for, or (even worse) covering up the behaviour of those who will not budge from the old ways.
Weber, himself, described the process as a progression from the pre-modern to the modern: “The fate of our times is characterised by rationalisation and intellectualisation and, above all, by the ‘disenchantment of the world’.”
The Maori Party’s co-leader, Tariana Turia, is emblematic of Maori who still dwell in the “enchanted” realms of Maoridom. Early on in her political career she spoke openly about having a constant invisible companion: a spirit guardian who protected her from harm and guided her through important decisions.
Suffice to say this is not the sort of leadership-style, or decision-making process, the big iwi corporates’ young professionals are being taught at the Auckland Business School. Nor are they encouraged to regard the keeping of accurate records and being able to account for all items of expenditure as responsibilities fit only for lesser breeds. When dealing with shareholders – or taxpayers – neither inherited rank nor charismatic power is entitled to a free pass.
The transition from tribal traditionalism to the rational bureaucratic norms of secular society has largely been accomplished in the nations from which Pakeha New Zealand's forebears originated. It was not an easy or a comfortable journey. Nor will it be for Maori – as the recent examples cited above attest.
The Implacable Face Of An Implacable Regime: Victor Hugo's unforgettable bloodhound, Inspector Javert (played here by Russell Crowe) pursued the redeemed hero, Jean Valjean, with a zeal bordering on fanaticism. The so-called "low trust clients" of WINZ who, like Valjean, may have broken the law simply in order to survive, must now feel as though they are living in the pages of Les Miserables.
EARLIER THIS WEEK the Associate Minister for Social Development, Chester Borrows, announced a new category of beneficiary. From Monday, 14 October 2013, he said, Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ) would be applying the new “low trust client” rules.
According to the Minister, “low trust clients” are people already convicted of welfare fraud, or who have “had overpayments established following a fraud investigation”.
“Give a dog a bad name and you may hang him by it” runs the proverb. And it is certainly very difficult to think of a reason why politicians and bureaucrats would want to pin the “low trust client” tag on beneficiaries other than their wanting to “hang” them by it.
Of course the State doesn’t hang people anymore – at least, not literally. (Although I’m sure there are more than a few New Zealanders who would gladly string up all these “welfare cheats”!) But those who have made it their business to make sense of MSD policy (Sue Bradford, for example) are in no doubt that the true objective of these highly provocative new rules is to make “low trust clients” feel so utterly wretched and worthless that they exit the welfare system altogether.
From the point of view of the MSD and WINZ, purging the welfare rolls of low trust clients is a “win/win” solution. Not only is the state spared the expense of paying out legitimate entitlements, but the MSD’s new policy practically guarantees a sharp decline in all claims – fraudulent and legitimate.
Few New Zealanders would have any idea of how fraught the entire experience of signing-on for, receiving and retaining a social welfare benefit can be. The whole process is anything but straightforward and to a great many people seems calculated to belittle, stress and all-too-frequently humiliate the applicant/recipient.
The most vivid memory most people take away from their first visit to WINZ is how long they were made to wait. Even those who followed the rules assiduously: made appointments and arrived ahead of time; will regale their family and friends with horror stories of being made to wait for hours at a time.
Many people who live at some distance from their nearest WINZ office and are reliant on public transport simply cannot wait, and so miss their appointments. Predictably, missing an appointment with one’s WINZ case-worker is regarded as a serious misdemeanour: do it too often and one’s benefit may be docked – or even stopped.
Only rarely will these citizens encounter a WINZ staffer who clearly and comprehensively spells out exactly what they are entitled by law to receive from the state. The consensus view among those receiving WINZ “assistance” is that the MSD operates on the rule-of-thumb that if applicants don’t ask, then WINZ staff are not obliged to tell.
At the average WINZ office what you don’t know (and are not told) can prove extremely costly – both to you and to those who depend on you.
WINZ’s over-riding priority is to get people off welfare and into work. Unfortunately, it does not distinguish part-time and/or casual work from full-time employment. At WINZ, a job’s a job, and the moment you get one you’re no longer entitled to a Jobseeker’s Allowance. And if your job only lasts a month? Well, that’s too bad, because now there’s a “stand down” period lasting several weeks for you to get through before once again becoming eligible for state assistance.
In the meantime there’s rent, food and power bills to be paid. What WINZ calls fraud is often no more than the actions of desperate people doing whatever they have to do to keep themselves and their families fed and clothed and a roof over their head.
It’s what makes the note of smug self-righteousness in Mr Borrows’ latest announcement so very hard to take.
Like Jean Valjean in Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables, New Zealand’s beneficiaries find themselves pursued by a state as remorseless and relentless as the implacable Inspector Javert.
The great French novelist coined phrases like “social asphyxia” do describe the constricting effects of poverty and injustice, but even the mighty Hugo would have tipped his hat to a phrase so utterly suffocating in its unkindness as “low trust client”.

Hackers To The Rescue? Professor J. Alex Halderman (second from right) and his merry band of hackers showed just how vulnerable online voting is to outside interference. According to Halderman, "it’s going to be decades, if ever, before we’re able to vote online securely".
THE JUNIOR WOODCHUCKS GUIDEBOOK was one of the comic-book artist’s, Carl Barks’, most prescient gags. Whenever the hapless Donald Duck’s adventures with his three nephews and his squillionaire Uncle Scrooge went awry, it was to this extraordinarily handy little book that Huey, Dewey and Louie – Woodchucks all – invariably turned. You’ve fallen from a plane without a parachute? Need a quick course in basic Lizard? Want to know how to lull a dragon to sleep? Then - quick! Consult The Junior Woodchuck Guidebook!
For those of you wondering what a Junior Woodchuck might be: they are Carl Barks’ gentle send-up of the American scouting movement. What makes the master comic-book storyteller’s creation of The Junior Woodchucks Guidebook so prescient, however, is that in 2013, nearly 60 years after its first appearance in 1954, practically everyone carries the equivalent of the Woodchucks’ Guidebook in their pocket.
Our smartphones, with their connection to the Internet and its vast, inexhaustible search-engines, can now transform us, just about instantly, into experts on just about everything. Who needs The Junior Woodchucks Guidebook when they’ve got “Google”?
This increasing reliance on the Internet and its wonders is worrying. Carl Barks may have relied upon The Junior Woodchucks Guidebook to get himself and his cartoon creations out of innumerable tight spots, but we would be extremely unwise to do the same.
Writers, dramatists and comic-book storytellers are allowed to bring in a deus ex machina to keep the narrative moving along, but politicians and administrators have no such licence. Though we might be forgiven for thinking otherwise, the conduct of democratic elections is not the stuff of comic-books or classical Greek tragedies.
And yet we are subjected to constant claims from politicians, challenged to “do something” about the declining participation-rate in national and local government elections, that the solution lies “online”.
This is what the Mayor of New Zealand’s largest city, Len Brown, told reporters on Saturday after being re-elected by barley a third of Auckland’s eligible voters:
“We will do online voting next time, there is no doubt about that. I think that maybe postal voting has had its day. People really don’t do much in the way of sending mail anymore.”
Not a good idea, Len, as a moment’s consultation of your electronic Junior Woodchucks Guide would have told you.
According to the Professor of Computer Science specialising in cyber-security at the University of Michigan, J. Alex Halderman, putting the electoral process online would be extremely risky:
“In order to vote online safely, we’re going to have to solve some of the hardest problems in computer security. How do you secure servers against remote attackers? How do you secure people’s home computers against spyware? How do you prevent people from being tricked into visiting the wrong website and giving away their passwords? All of these things are subjects of active research, but it’s probably going to be many, many years until we solve them. That’s why I think it’s going to be decades, if ever, before we’re able to vote online securely.”
And Professor Halderman knows what he’s talking about, because three years ago he and three of his top computer science graduates successfully (and perfectly legally) hacked into an online election pilot set up by the District of Columbia’s Board of Education.
The Board, supremely confident that their online voting system was secure, cockily challenged anyone who thought they could hack into their software to go ahead and give it a try. Professor Halderman’s team more than rose to the challenge. Not only did they successfully hack the Board’s system, but they also made sure that the test election was “won” by “writing in” the fictional robot anti-hero, Bender, from Fox-TV’s animated sci-fi series Futurama. (The runners-up were HAL from 2001 – A Space Odyssey and the Master Control Programme from Tron.)
Those wishing to learn more about Professor Halderman’s slam-dunk demonstration of the dangers of online voting should watch the YouTube video – just search “Hacking the Washington DC Internet voting system”. I would heartily recommend that Mayor Len Brown treat himself to repeated viewings.
And before all the computer geeks out there respond with the example of Estonia: permit me to point out that the Estonian on-line voting system relies upon the fact that every Estonian citizen is required to carry an identity card bearing a unique identity number. Personally, I’m not so sure that New Zealanders are ready for mandatory identification cards. Not after all that passionate debate over the GCSB surveillance legislation. But, I could be wrong.
The other problem with Estonia is this: if the Estonian government decided to elect its own “Bender” – who would know?
Online voting, warns Professor Halderman, is no different from any other system reliant upon computer software. (Novopay? WINZ? ACC?) “Small mistakes” can lead to “huge problems.”

But Will Labour Make It? With David Cunliffe announcing the return of "Red Labour" following a rank-and-file instigated "revolution from below", the Party's 30-year adherence to the Neoliberal "free trade" ideology may be coming to an end.
LABOUR’S 30-YEAR COMMITMENT to “free trade” may be coming to an end. The test will be three weeks from now when the party gathers in Christchurch for its annual conference.
At last year’s conference, delegates were willing to offer only the most qualified support to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations – and it required repeated interventions from former Trade Minister, Phil Goff, to secure even that limited endorsement. This time Mr Goff may not be so successful at fending off the TPP’s opponents.
Labour’s “Free-Traders” face some very substantial obstacles. The greatest of these is that the party’s commitment to trade liberalisation, like its commitment to the Reserve Bank Act, is emblematic of Labour’s 1980s embrace of Neoliberalism.
Throughout the 15-year reign of Helen Clark serious public criticism of these neoliberal shibboleths was verboten. Goff struggled (with limited success) to keep the ideological disputation in-house. David Shearer could not manage to do even that.
Had the news media paid a little more attention to the revolution that was taking place on the floor of last year’s annual conference at Ellerslie, and devoted a little less effort to chasing non-existent leadership challengers, they may have noticed the explicit repudiation of “Rogernomics” included in the 2012 Draft Policy Platform.
It is a measure of the intensity of the behind-the-scenes ideological battles that have been raging in the Labour Party since Ellerslie, that last year’s passionate condemnation of Rogernomics has been dropped from this year’s Draft Policy Platform.
How much of the document’s watering-down is attributable to the intervention of Grant Robertson, the preternaturally cautious chair of Labour’s policy council, is far from clear. But even in its new – and ultimately binding – iteration, the document registers an unmistakably leftward shift:
“Labour holds that government must play an essential role in managing and developing the economy. We reject the notion that free markets on their own will deliver either long-term prosperity or just distributional outcomes.”
When spoken by the new party leader, David Cunliffe, this is the sort of anti-neoliberal rhetoric that brings Labour’s newly empowered rank-and-file and affiliates to their feet a-whooping and a-hollering.
“Labour will support international trade and investment agreements that promote New Zealand’s economic wellbeing and support fairness, transparency, sovereignty, and sustainability.”
But even in this rather colourless sentence there’s more than enough to cause political problems for those caucus members determined to preserve the bipartisan consensus on free trade by backing the TPP.
Mr Cunliffe sent shockwaves through the trade liberalisation lobby even before he clinched the party leadership on 15 September; by warning that the TPP posed a “quite difficult and complex issue for New Zealand”.
His concern over such “fish hooks” as the future of Pharmac and the sovereignty-threatening potential of “investor/state disputes”, coupled with his doubts about the genuineness of the promised agricultural opportunities, must have made TPP boosters worry that Mr Cunliffe had just come from a briefing with Professor Jane Kelsey!
Small wonder then that business columnist, Fran O’Sullivan, whistling loudly in the dark, wrote glowingly of Mr Goff’s undimmed enthusiasm for a TPP agreement.
“Labour’s Phil Goff is back in business, adding his strong and rational voice to New Zealand's advocacy for the completion of the Trans Pacific Partnership.”
Like so many of her journalistic colleagues, Ms O’Sullivan has yet to grasp how fundamentally the rules of the political game have changed.
Mr Cunliffe and Labour’s rank-and-file are now locked in a radical embrace. If Labour’s new leader decides to consummate their “red wedding” by promoting “fair”, rather than “free” trade (which would ease Labour’s relationship with the Greens considerably) then there’s nothing Mr Goff, or the other fading Rogernomes of the broken ABC faction, can do about it.
Mr Cunliffe’s keynote speech to the Christchurch conference will undoubtedly make Labour’s new political trajectory much clearer. Expect to hear something on free trade. Just don’t expect it to be business as usual.

Policy Target: The Reserve Bank Act (1989) It was one of the Neoliberal Counter-Revolution's primary objectives: to keep the interfering hands of politicians as far away from the controlling mechanisms of monetary policy as possible. Otherwise known as strangling the economy in order to save it.
SOME ARE CALLING IT irresponsible meddling, others talk about the need to regain control of our destiny. Whatever it’s called, it’s attracting a lot of attention. And not a little concern.
For nearly thirty years both of New Zealand’s largest political parties have faithfully adhered to the doctrine that a country’s monetary policy is best determined by an independent central bank. Furthermore, that the prime focus of monetary policy must be keeping inflationary pressures under the strictest control. In practice, that’s meant keeping the interfering hands of politicians as far away from the steering-wheel as possible.
New Zealand embraced this monetarist view the central bank’s role with special fervour. Our current Reserve Bank Act, passed by the Fourth Labour Government in 1989, places enormous economic power in the hands of a single person, the Reserve Bank Governor. He alone is responsible for carrying out the Act’s primary function: ensuring “stability in the general level of prices”.
The only democratic check upon the Governor’s power comes in the form of the Policy Target Agreement (PTA) negotiated periodically with the Minister of Finance. It isn’t much of a check though, because the only real debate is over the permissible range of inflationary fluctuations. If the inflation rate goes above, or stays below, the agreed levels for too long, the Governor intervenes.
The mechanism he uses to do this is the Official Cash Rate (OCR). By raising or lowering the price at which the privately-owned banks can access liquid funds on a short-term basis the Reserve Bank is able to expand or contract short-term demand in the New Zealand economy and hence (at least theoretically) keep prices under control.
The use of this single, blunt economic instrument has fuelled repeated property booms, blown out New Zealand’s balance-of-payments, and undermined our manufacturing exporters.
So, why did our politicians give so much economic power to one, unelected government official? Why is something so critical to the health of our economy as setting core interest rates not the responsibility – as it once was – of the people’s elected representatives?
Answering that question takes us to the heart of the “Quiet Revolution” in economic management, in which the Reserve Bank Act (1989) played so important a part. Essentially, the decision to remove the management of monetary policy from the politicians’ hands was inspired by the growing fear among political and economic elites that the democratisation of economic policy formation had gotten out of hand.
The deadly confluence of the economic, political and social crises that characterised the 1930s, and which led to the human disaster of World War II, had largely discredited the laissez-faire economic doctrines which spawned them. Rather than go on entrusting the elites with the conduct of economic policy, the citizens of the victorious democratic powers made sure that those responsible for the big economic decisions were politicians accountable to themselves.
The result was a 30-year period of unprecedented economic expansion, during which, in the USA, the share of national income going to the top 1 percent of income earners plummeted to less than 10 percent (from a pre-war high of close to 20 percent). Between 1945 and 1975, thanks to successive post-war governments’ commitment to policies aimed at full-employment and wealth redistribution, and to preserving the bargaining strength of trade unions, the standard of living of ordinary working people rose steadily.
With their economic and political power fast eroding, the Western elites seized upon the inflationary pressures unleashed by the Vietnam War and the Arab Oil Embargo to discredit the democratic conduct of economic affairs.
Politicians, they argued, were unfit to determine economic policy precisely because they were prey to electoral pressures. Only when populist politicians, like New Zealand’s Sir Robert Muldoon, were legally precluded from interfering with the free play of “market forces” could the scourge of double-digit inflation be defeated. And that free play could only occur after the “market distorting” influence of high taxes and excessive government borrowing, inefficient state-owned enterprises, and the power of the “over-mighty” trade unions had been dismantled – comprehensively.
The imposition of what came to be called “neoliberalism” thus represented not a “revolution” in economic management but a “counter-revolution”. And absolutely crucial to its success has been the 30-year bipartisan consensus that no other economic doctrine is to be given a serious hearing anywhere. Not in the news media; not in the schools and universities; and certainly not in the two main political parties: National and Labour.
Hardly surprising, then, that serious disquiet is growing among those whose job it is to defend the neoliberal counter-revolution at all costs. Not only is the Reserve Bank under attack from the Greens (whose modest levels of electoral support make them more irritant than threat) but also, and most alarmingly, from Labour.

Like A Beckett Play: An overwhelming sense of fragility; of life in suspension; of history sucking up every available atom of breathable air. When will New Zealanders stop looking up to a monarch and start looking around - to themselves?
An old woman sits primly in an armchair, warmed by an electric fire. The fussily furnished room is festooned with family photographs and ceramic knick-knacks. The atmosphere of the scene is stuffy and oppressive. There’s an overwhelming sense of fragility; of life in suspension; of history sucking up every available atom of breathable air.
Seated opposite the old woman is a middle-aged man with an over-eager smile. He is dressed like a prosperous provincial accountant, and it is clear that just being in the room with the old woman represents the fulfilment of a boyhood dream.
They are talking to one another – although it is difficult to say what about. The old woman’s conversation is polite but inconsequential. She speaks as if she’s reading the lines of a play once popular, but now only ever performed to modest and ageing audiences.
Undaunted, the middle-aged man listens intently: his attention not at all diminished by the old woman’s sing-song delivery. Clearly, some weird alchemical miracle is taking place. In the middle-aged man’s brain the old woman’s leaden commonplaces are being transmuted into the purest rhetorical gold.
Beyond this and all the other rooms in the castle, the world goes on its merry way. Fallen empires refuse to rise. Children are blown to pieces by suicide bombers. Billions are wagered on stock markets and trillions consigned to tropical tax havens. Ice melts in the arctic. Deserts advance. Lovers embrace.
But in this stuffy drawing room nothing changes. The old woman sits and talks inconsequentially to “galloping colonial clots” who hang upon her every word, believing, in spite of everything that they have seen and done and made of themselves, that the bizarre tableau of which they are a part is more than it seems.
Another notable scene occurs in Ettore Scola’s 1982 movie That Night In Varennes. The plot revolves around a group of travellers who get caught up in King Louis XVI’s abortive attempt to escape the revolution in Paris.
As the revolutionary government’s officials dither, a debate ensues concerning the nature of monarchy among those now stranded at the local inn. Some of the travellers, in true Enlightenment fashion, dismiss monarchy as irrational. Others remain convinced of its quasi-religious power. Its magic.
As if to prove both sides correct, the King’s servants roll into the room a tailor’s dummy adorned with the royal regalia of France.
In a wonderful cinematic moment, the waiting peasants bare their heads and fall to their knees. Even the sceptical intellectuals find it difficult to resist the urge to doff their hats and bow low.
Monarchy weilds only as much power as people are willing to give it. Our ancestors long ago stripped the British monarchy of all but a recondite residue of its former political authority. What is it, then, about Queen Elizabeth and her peculiar family that continues to enthral a clear majority not only of her British subjects, but of New Zealanders as well? What is it that could possibly make our ruthless, currency-trader Prime Minister sit like an excited schoolboy on the edge of his seat in a stuffy Balmoral drawing-room?
The Frankfurt School’s, Erich Fromm (1900-1980) would tell us that New Zealanders’ on-going love affair with the British Royal Family, and the monarchical institutions they inhabit, stems from our abiding fear of, and desire to “escape from freedom”.
To be truly human, Fromm argued, men and women must free themselves from all that obscures the realities of existence. Our unique capacity to reason and to love makes each human life a challenging and painful experience; it can also make life glorious and transcendent.
For too many of us, however, the dangers and uncertainties of freedom keep us in a child-like state of fear and neediness. Thinking for ourselves is difficult and risky; better by far to adhere to the collective wisdom. Ruling ourselves is also difficult and risky; better by far to be guided by the myths and traditions of the past.
Living in a republic there is nothing and no one to look “up” to: we can only look “around” – to ourselves.

Enjoy It While You Can: The Tukituki River sparkles in the Hawkes Bay sun, but if the Ruataniwha Dam is built and intensive dairying is made possible further upstream, this iconic river will swiftly be transformed into what Green Party co-leader, Russel Norman, predicts will be "an industrial drain". Water is fast becoming New Zealand's most valuable natural resource and Federated Farmers - aided and abetted by the National Government - is determined to place that resource in private hands.
THERE’S ALWAYS A MOMENT when we realise that power has shifted. Trusted people and institutions suddenly turn against us. Those whose job it is to assess and avert public risk disappear. We hear rumours about wholesale sackings and forced resignations. Obvious and serious conflicts of interest are studiously ignored. And those in charge, while not guilty of telling outright lies, have unquestionably stopped telling us the whole truth.
Such extreme power shifts are generally confined to the corporate sector. And while they are never pleasant, and often very costly in personal terms, most of us nevertheless accept the process. The business world is not a democratic world: its unfairness and rapacity is largely beyond our control. Businesses fail, are sold, merged, asset-stripped, re-branded and downsized – and there’s not a lot any of us can do about it.
Beyond the business world, however, we do not expect to be left out of the equation. Employees may be required to subordinate their judgement to the entity paying their wages but, constitutionally-speaking, citizens are sovereign: their democratic judgements not subject to private-sector countermand.
But this is precisely what is happening. All over the country: from the Canterbury Plains to the Tukituki River in Hawke’s Bay; private interests are muscling in on public resources; compromising the integrity of public institutions; and trampling with ill-disguised contempt upon the rights of New Zealand citizens.
I SHOULDN’T BE SURPRISED. On 19 November 2008, just eleven days after the election of the current government, myself and the right-wing political commentator, Matthew Hooton, were invited to address the National Executive of Federated Farmers.
The first was how much the Federated Farmers CEO, Conor English, looked and sounded like his brother, Bill, the newly elected government’s Finance Minister.
The second was the presence of Dr William Rolleston. Until that moment, I had only known Dr Rolleston in his role as one of New Zealand’s most outspoken advocates of genetically engineered agricultural production. That he was so closely associated with Federated Farmers was something I probably should have known, but was still rather disturbed to find out.
The third, and by far the most important, thing I took away from that meeting was Conor English giving me a quiet “heads-up” that the most important issue facing Federated Farmers, and New Zealand, over the next few decades would be the issue of who controlled access to what was fast becoming the nation’s most valuable natural resource – water.
MOST NEW ZEALANDERS don’t think too much about water. Most of us live in cities and towns which, for the better part of a hundred years, have enjoyed a plentiful, safe and remarkably cheap water supply. In the odd drought year we townies may be asked to refrain from watering our gardens, but most of us, for most of the time, don’t give water a second thought.
Over the course of the past twenty years the New Zealand landscape has been transformed by the extraordinary growth of the dairy industry. Where once the cargo vessels leaving our ports were loaded down with carcasses of frozen lamb and bales of wool – as well as butter and cheese – our agricultural exports are today dominated the thousands of tons of top-quality milk powder produced by New Zealand’s world-beating dairy farmers.
That milk powder earns this country billions of dollars every year, but dairying’s “white gold” comes at a heavy cost. The successful dairy farm not only requires millions of litres of water by way of an input, but its hundreds of cows also discharge equally vast quantities of effluent by way of an output. That effluent inevitably makes its way into the nation’s waterways – polluting them to the extent that the lower reaches of more than half of New Zealand’s largest and most magnificent rivers are no longer safe to fish or swim in. And neither are their tributaries.
THE SHUTTING DOWN of democracy in the Canterbury Regional Council, and the more recent suppression of a Department of Conservation draft report on the sustainability of the Ruataniwha Dam, represent the working out in political terms of Conor English’s heads-up warning of five years ago.
New Zealand’s dairy farmers, and the enormous economic interests they represent, have decided to privatise the nation’s water resources – and the government is helping them do it.
Dr William Rolleston has even enlisted the reality of Global Warming to advance Federated Farmers’ cause: While New Zealand has plenty of water, he says, it's not always in the right place at the right time.
My book Bowie Knife Fights, Fighters, and Fighting Techniques is available from Paladin Press. This blog contains additional information about the bowie knife, as well as the fighting knives of other nations.
From The Gulf States Historical Magazine, Volume 2 (July 1903), comes this description of the production of bowie knives for Texas troops:
Enlistment in Texas commenced in earnest in June 1861. Arms and all necessary military equipments were exceedingly scarce. No attempt in Texas, was made to arm men who enlisted for service east of the Mississippi river. Outside of the arms and munitions that had been secured from the Federal troops in the state, which had been turned over to the Confederate states by the Convention, there were no arms, except double-barreled shot guns, hunting rifles, and pistols, that belonged to private individuals. The state had made some appropriations to buy arms, and ammunition had been procured, but not a tithe needful to meet the demand. The most of the companies raised for service west of the river equipped themselves as best they could, with such arms as each man had, and such clothing as he had or could procure. . . . At this time, the Texas soldier seemed to be impressed with the idea that hand-to-hand and man to man fights would frequently occur, and that in such case a bowie knife, or some other big knife, was an indispensable part of his fighting outfit, and as the knife never failed to fire, the Texas soldier was strongly impressed in favor of the knife. To supply this demand for knives the merchant's stocks in the country were soon depleted, and then came a demand for all of the new and old files that could be found large enough to make a bowie knife; and so it was that the demand for . . . knives kept the blacksmiths busy day and night. They did not carry the big knives long, for they soon found them useless and burdensome. Another curious idea occurred in the early part of the war. Colonel Carter raised a regiment of cavalry, and proposed to arm them with iron spears, into which wooden handles, about twelve or fourteen feet long were fitted. The writer saw a number of these weapons. They were certainly a strange anomaly in modern warfare. Whether the Colonel really armed his men with these lances, the writer does not know. These weapons of a bygone age only emphasized the scarcity of arms and the straits of the Confederacy to arm and equip her soldiers. A brigade of those poorly armed Texas cavalry, who were dismounted and made into infantry by order of General Holmes in 1862, was marched into Arkansas and camped between the Arkansas and White rivers, not very far from Duvall's Bluff. Many of these soldiers had no arms at all, some had nothing better than shot guns and squirrel rifles, with very little ammunition, and what they had were of poor quality, and ill suited to their guns. While so camped, the brigade was ordered post haste to meet a rumored detachment of the enemy, marching up White river. These Texas soldiers manifested the utmost eagerness to meet the enemy. The rumor proved to be false. No enemy appeared, and this was fortunate, for equipped as the Texans were it would have been murder for them to have met a well armed and disciplined foe.
The Sacraments of the Church are God’s Word in action. The Dominical Sacraments of Baptism and Holy Communion are ordained by our Lord Jesus Christ for all Christians.
The written Word and the holy Sacraments are joined together and rightly proclaimed in the classic editions of The Book of Common Prayer. (Editions 1662, 1928 – US, 1929 – Scottish, and 1962 – Canadian.)
The fundamental dogmatic principles and tenets of Orthodox Anglicanism are promulgated in the Book of Common Prayer and the Ordinal of the Church of England, AD 1662, and the Articles of Religion set forth in AD 1562 by the same Church.
Which Faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled: without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.
And the Catholick Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; Neither confounding the Persons: nor dividing the Substance. For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one: the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.
Such as the Father is, such is the Son: and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate: and the Holy Ghost uncreate. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible: and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible.The Father eternal, the Son eternal: and the Holy Ghost eternal.
As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated: but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible. So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty: and the Holy Ghost Almighty.
And yet they are not three Almighties: but one Almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God: and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.
So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord: and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords: but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity: to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; so are we forbidden by the Catholick Religion: to say there be three Gods, or three Lords.
The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son: neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons: one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other: none is greater, or less than another; but the whole three Persons are co-eternal together: and co-equal. So that in all things, as is aforesaid: the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.
He therefore that will be saved: must thus think of the Trinity. Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation: that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For the right Faith is that we believe and confess: that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God, of the Substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds: and Man, of the Substance of his Mother, born in the world; Perfect God, and Perfect Man: of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting; Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead: and inferior to the Father, as touching his Manhood.
Who although he be God and Man: yet he is not two, but one Christ; One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh: but by taking of the Manhood into God; One altogether, not by confusion of Substance: but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man: so God and Man is one Christ.
He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty: from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies: and shall give account for their own works.
And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the Holy Ghost; As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.
THERE is but one living and true God, ever- lasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
THE Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father, took Man’s nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.
CHRIST did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man’s nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he return to judge all Men at the last day.
THE Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God.
HOLY Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the holy Scripture we do understand those Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.
And the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine; such are these following:
All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and account them Canonical.
THE Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.
THE Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius’s Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles’ Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of holy Scripture.
ORIGINAL Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every man, that naturally is ingendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God’s wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek, “Phronema Sarkos”, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.
THE condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon God: Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us, when we have that good will.
WE are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings: Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only is a most wholesome Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification.
ALBEIT that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God’s Judgement; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; insomuch that by them a lively Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit.
WORKS done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of sin.
VOLUNTARY Works besides, over, and above, God’s Commandments, which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.
CHRIST in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself once made, should take away the sins of the world, and sin, as Saint John saith, was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized, and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
NOT every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.
PREDESTINATION to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God be called according to God’s purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at length, by God’s mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.
As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God’s Predestination, is a most dangerous downfal, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either into desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.
Furthermore, we must receive God’s promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of God.
THEY also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature. For holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.
THE visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ’s ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.
As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.
THE Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God’s Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation.
GENERAL Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and will of Princes. And when they be gathered together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word of God,) they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.
THE Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping, and Adoration, as well of Images as of Reliques, and also invocation of Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.
IT is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of publick preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be lawfully called, and sent to execute the same.
And those we ought to judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men who have publick authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call and send Ministers into the Lord’s vineyard.
IT is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the Primitive Church, to have publick Prayer in the Church, or to minister the Sacraments in a tongue not understanded of the people.
SACRAMENTS ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men’s profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and God’s good will towards us, by the which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our Faith in him.
There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.
Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord’s Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.
The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect or operation: but they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.
ALTHOUGH in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in Christ’s, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving of the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ’s ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God’s gifts diminished from such as by faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ’s institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.
Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences; and finally being found guilty, by just judgement be deposed.
BAPTISM is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened, but it is also a sign of Regeneration or new Birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.
THE Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather is a Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ’s death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ.
Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.
The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.
The Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper was not by Christ’s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.
THE Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and drink the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.
THE Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the parts of the Lord’s Sacrament, by Christ’s ordinance and commandment, ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.
THE Offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.
BISHOPS, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God’s Law, either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.
THAT person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be openly reconciled by penance, and received into the Church by a Judge that hath authority thereunto.
IT is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, and utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be changed according to the diversities of countries, times, and men’s manners, so that nothing be ordained against God’s Word. Whosoever through his private judgement, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the traditions and ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak brethren.
Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and abolish, ceremonies or rites of the Church ordained only by man’s authority, so that all things be done to edifying.
THE second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they may be understanded of the people.
THE Book of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering of Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth, and confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, doth contain all things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering: neither hath it any thing, that of itself is superstitious and ungodly. And therefore whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that Book, since the second year of the forenamed King Edward unto this time, or hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same Rites; we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered.
THE King’s Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England, and other his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign Jurisdiction.
Where we attribute to the King’s Majesty the chief government, by which Titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended; we give not to our Princes the ministering either of God’s Word, or of the Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Queen do most plainly testify; but that only prerogative, which we see to have been given always to all godly
Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.
It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.
THE Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right, title, and possession of the same, as certain Anabaptists do falsely boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth, liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.
AS we confess that vain and rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle, so we judge, that Christian Religion doth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the Prophet’s teaching, in justice, judgement, and truth.
THIS Book of Articles before rehearsed, is again approved, and allowed to be holden and executed within the Realm, by the assent and consent of our Sovereign Lady ELIZABETH, by the grace of God, of England, France, and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, &c. Which Articles were deliberately read, and confirmed again by the subscription of the hands of the Archbishop and Bishops of the Upper-house, and by the subscription of the whole Clergy of the Nether-house in their Convocation, in the Year of our Lord 1571.
We, Bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in Council assembled as Bishops in the Church of God, do hereby solemnly declare to all whom it may concern, and especially to our fellow-Christians of the different Communions in this land, who, in their several spheres, have contended for the religion of Christ:
1. Our earnest desire that the Savior’s prayer, “That we all may be one,” may, in its deepest and truest sense, be speedily fulfilled;
2. That we believe that all who have been duly baptized with water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, are members of the Holy Catholic Church.
3. That in all things of human ordering or human choice, relating to modes of worship and discipline, or to traditional customs, this Church is ready in the spirit of love and humility to forego all preferences of her own;
4. That this Church does not seek to absorb other Communions, but rather, co-operating with them on the basis of a common Faith and Order, to discountenance schism, to heal the wounds of the Body of Christ, and to promote the charity which is the chief of Christian graces and the visibile manifestation of Christ to the world.
But furthermore, we do hereby affirm that the Christian unity…can be restored only by the return of all Christian communions to the principles of unity exemplified by the undivided Catholic Church during the first ages of its existence; which principles we believe to be the substantial deposit of Christian Faith and Order committed by Christ and his Apostles to the Church unto the end of the world, and therefore incapable of compromise or surrender by those who have been ordained to be its stewards and trustees for the common and equal benefit of all men.
As inherent parts of this sacred deposit, and therefore as essential to the restoration of unity among the divided branches of Christendom, we account the following, to wit:
3. The two Sacraments,–Baptism and the Supper of the Lord,–ministered with unfailing use of Christ’s words of institution and of the elements ordained by Him.
4. The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the unity of His Church.
Furthermore, Deeply grieved by the sad divisions which affect the Christian Church in oun own land, we hereby declare our desire and readiness, so soon as there shall be any authorized response to this Declaration, to enter into brotherly conference with all or any Christian Bodies seeking the restoration of the organic unity of the Church, with a view to the earnest study of the conditions under which so priceless a blessing might happily be brought to pass.
Note: While the above form of the Quadrilateral was adopted by the House of Bishops, it was not enacted by the House of Deputies, but rather incorporated in a general plan referred for study and action to a newly created Joint Commission on Christian Reunion.
That, in the opinion of this Conference, the following Articles supply a basis on which approach may be by God’s blessing made towards Home Reunion:
(a) The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, as “containing all things necessary to salvation,” and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.
(b) The Apostles’ Creed, as the Baptismal Symbol; and the Nicene Creed, as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith.
(c) The two Sacraments ordained by Christ Himself–Baptism and the Supper of the Lord–ministered with unfailing use of Christ’s words of Institution, and of the elements ordained by Him.
(d) The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of His Church.

They are Borg.. Really.. They have a hive mentality. They are very much different than we are ( less so these days of course).
And there are other people who have dealt extensively with Japanese who will say you are wrong. From my own experience, I would agree with them.
Saving face is central to their ethos and is extreme. I have stories about how crazy they over this.
They have an exaggerated and extreme group mentality. They have little use for Western individualism. Your membership and enthusiastic participation is central to you life.
Their hierarchical structure has a totally different patten. .Many jobs expect you to stay at work until very late and then go get a drink..not optional. There is a problem in Japan with people dropping from exhaustion.
I had a good friend who worked in Japan for 10 years. He was very bitter about his experience. He said they will always be polite to you but they will never ever ever ever accept you.
My Buddhist teacher was an American and a professional translator of ancient Japanese Buddhists documents. Also bitter about his dealings with them. I was invited to go there several times by my group, all expenses paid ..which is very nice. But my American teacher told me they wanted to just "walk the dog"..They wanted to show off their American follower which helps to salve their feelings of inferiority to us.
oh and when you talk about WW2 with them you may discover that all they care about is Hiroshima. They make it sound like we started the War by dropping the bomb. Their consciousness begins and ends with them getting nuked.
So, the Japanese have a different culture and different sensibilities. Not every culture can be as cool and accepting and warm and wonderful as "western" culture . This does not make them "Borg" (since they don't, apparently according to your friend, accept or assimilate others), it does not make them inhuman, and it is no reason to criticize, much less demonize them in any way, shape, or form.
Try to imagine how Americans might feel about WW2 if *we* had been nuked....twice. I guess we might be a little sensitive about it.
What seems clear to me from what you write is that you don't really understand Japanese culture at any deep level. Not that there's any need or reason for you to if you don't want to.
I, too, have a friend who spent many years in Japan, first to learn the language, and then ended up working there for quite a long time. Her experience, once she made the effort to learn about Japanese culture, etc, was totally different, in a very positive way, from what you and your friend describe. Which goes to show how careful we must be about making generalizations about whole cultures and peoples.
They take no responsibility for WW2. All many of them are conscious of is Hiroshima, which was well justified IMHO.
If replying to your posts in multiple threads or fora equals "stalking" you, or if you think I've violated any of the rules of this board, I invite you to report me to the mods and justify your accusation. Yes, I do attempt to stand up for what is right. Sorry that's a problem for you.
'The Cause of Japan' by Togo Shigenori is a book I have long wanted but never got aroound to reading.
"Togo was Foreign Minister at the time of Pearl Harbor and, after a period of political eclipse, resumed this post to speed Japan's peace negotiations; he is therefor more familiar than anyone else with the underlying policies of his country at two critical points. Shortly before his death in an American military hospital (he was then serving a twenty year sentence on charges of ""conspiracy to wage aggressive war"") Togo put into his family's safekeeping elaborate notes on his youth (not included here) and his service in the Konoe and Suzuki cabinets. The notes, pedantic and impersonal, not only exonerate Togo himself of any militant designs but place an embarrassing amount of responsibility at the door of the United States. The embargo on petroleum products all but forced Japan into the war: Roosevelt, according to Togo, was fully aware of this fact and, from sources of secret information, knew thoroughly the plans and thinking of the Japanese leaders: the duplicity and delaying tactics in Washington were caused entirely by America. His justification, coupled with the light the book sheds on the power alignments within Japan and the broad diplomatic policies that were followed, is worthy of special interest in terms of history and of importance to the student or expert in Far Eastern affairs; it is newsworthy as a presentation of the japanese grounds for their actions."
OR they could have stopped trying to colonize East Asia and murdering people all over the place. I realize at this point the Western colonial powers had a bit of a double standard... but still.
Mencius said, “Instruction makes use of many techniques. When I do not deign to instruct someone, that too is a form of instruction.”
Furthermore, I think you will find that Togo Shigenori was not part of Japan's militaristic faction.
Mao Tse Tung saw the danger of Japan becoming a fascist satellite colony of the United States even before the US entered the war.
On a somewhat related note, Japan's kamikaze pilot technique against US ships was extremely affective
If by "affective" you mean "emotional" I guess you're right, but that's a bit vague. But of course you mean effective in which case...
Well it's pretty important information to get a handle on before declaring whether the tactic was effective.
No. That's only if you assume that losses to the Japanese counted the same as they do to you. That's what you need to get a handle on; you're looking at this from a 'body count POV' which is the same error Americans did in Vietnam
There I agree with you. History has shown that Japan can be a mighty economic power WITHOUT an overseas empire
No. That's only if you assume that losses to the Japanese counted the same as they do to you. That's what you need to get a handle on; you're looking at this from a 'body count POV'
I'm not actually. You were the one that said, "they sank more ships, therefore more effective." And again, the question is, was the kamikaze tactic effective? Clearly it was not. It did not accomplish their short-term goals, it did not accomplish their long-term goals.
Well, the two are hardly comparable. No American capital ship was lost at Okinawa; the vast majority were landing craft, PT boats, and other small craft. And there were a lot of them to shoot at: the Japanese damaged 482 American vessels of all kinds! By contrast, there were only a hundred vessels of all sorts, including a floating drydock, pontoons and lighters, and a Coast Guard cutter. The engagement at Okinawa, it should also be noted, lasted over a month and a half. The only significant naval engagement saw of force of ten ships (including the Yamato squashed by a fleet that included eleven carriers, never mind the rest of the force.
By inflicting heavy losses they had hoped to weaken America's resolve. This same tactic worked in Vietnam
And besides, the Japanese had plenty of time to figure out that it was a failing strategy. They inflicted huge casualties at Tarawa (which was arguably not worth taking anyway), and we kept coming. The did it again at Peleliu, and at Tinian, and so forth, and we kept coming. Repeating something that is manifestly failing is the epitome of stupidity.
That's right. They sank more ships. They were effective. Their goal was not "Hey, let's hang on to our pilots", but "Hey, lets destroy as much of the enemy as we can." You quibble about how many pilots they lost. I pointed out that pilot loss was not their concern. You point out again pilot loss. Again I note it wasn't their concern.
I also noted why their long-term goals didn't work; and it was nothing to do with this action. It involved two factors; the bomb and, the Soviet Union entering the war. Both of which were not anticipated by the Japanese. But I also note that destroying large amounts of the enemy, regardless of the cost to one's own forces worked in Vietnam.
The goal of war needs to be to establish the desired political outcome. Destroying the enemy is but one possible means to that end.
The goal of the war, for Japan, was to establish control over a region of east Asia and the Pacific. The USA was a potential threat due to our presence in the Philippines and the likelihood that we might defend our interests there and elsewhere in the region. Attacking Pearl only made sense under the assumption that we would respond, but they had to force us out of the war right away by making it impossible for us to maintain a military presence in Hawaii. To do this, they had to seize the islands, which is the other reason why the loss at Midway was so devastating to them. But the attack (a) was galvanizing of policy, and (b) raised them from a threat to an enemy. Before, they worried that we might interfere with their plans; after, they guaranteed that we would interfere, unless we were made incapable of doing so. After Midway, they couldn't stop us, and gave us reason to render them incapable of exerting military force. As long as we had the resolve to do so, they were lost; and that they lost at every single step after their initial attacks, giving us confidence of eventual success.
America destroyed (by firebombing) huge swathes of Japanese cities but this didn't bring Japan to surrender - by your logic, this too was stupid.
I recall at the beginning of Clint Eastwood's recent film on Iwo Jima ("Flags of Our Fathers") they talked about America's flagging resolve - evidenced by falls in US Bonds purchases
You keep applying western-values and judging the enemy's plans by your values... which as I noted, is why the US lost in Vietnam. They were utterly convinced that they were winning by measuring body-counts.
It seems your posts are simply to keep repeating endlessly your own western values. It's why the US might well lose again if you can't learn from your mistakes.
I don't doubt that the US had resolve. But destroying huge numbers of men could well have made it a case of "Is it really worth it?"
Fortunately the US had the Atomic Bomb. Just as fortunately the Soviet Union entered the war - which to Japan had the effect much the same as that on Germany when the US entered WWI
I honestly believe that you devote time to looking for any errors I make or exaggerations or hanging statements. You never miss an opportunity to take a shot.. That is not a violation of any forum rule. But you already know that I am sure.
If you can just back off an inch or two once in awhile I would appreciate it. That is not a demand just a request.
They sank more ships. They were effective. Their goal was not "Hey, let's hang on to our pilots", but "Hey, lets destroy as much of the enemy as we can." You quibble about how many pilots they lost. I pointed out that pilot loss was not their concern. You point out again pilot loss. Again I note it wasn't their concern
And again you are wrong. No pilots= no one to fly the planes and kill people. It doesn't matter what your resolve is if you have nothing left to throw at the enemy. Japan was trying to exhaust the US with casualties, but they were exhausting themselves much quicker. Most of the kamikaze pilots went into the sea without killing anyone- they would have been better off with conventional tactics. Again, given the huge loss of men and materiel, the results of the kamikaze missions over Okinawa were not worth the resources that went into it.
Do you think some of the Japanese tactics were rationalized by their cultural myths and superstitions? Enough effort and especially self sacrifice could win the favor of the Kami ( Japanese protective deities) for example
Even the term Kamikaze itself suggests this. In the 13th century an invading fleet was sunk by a Hurricane. The invasion itself was understood as divine retribution for religious heresies and predicted by one of their well known Priests ( Nichiren ). I think there is an element of magical thinking involved in the Japanese approach to making war.
It's hard to understand our tactics and military ethos even today if you are not familiar with our Civil War. I think some of their tactics have roots that are far different than ours...
Actually, I do not devote my time to doing what you believe I do. With respect to this thread, I was reading it with great interest and then I came upon your comments. It was irrelevant to me who made the comments, and I would have replied in exactly the same manner had it been anyone other than you.
Contrary to what you think, I do not look for opportunities to "take a shot". You might consider, at least for a moment, that much of what you write, from the perspective that you write it, actually provokes some of my comments--not necessarily intentionally on your part, of course. You'll be pleasantly surprised to know that there is a great deal of what you write that I just am either not interested in or choose to ignore. And probably much that I don't even see.
If by backing off an inch or two once in a while you mean something to the effect of "please ignore or at least don't comment on what I write a little more", I'm certainly willing to do that. In fact, it would probably be quite beneficial for me as well as for you. We both seem to have a knack of being able to push each others buttons, so to speak, and provoke contention and ill feeling in one another. On the other hand, if you write something in a thread that I have interest in that is as outrageous (to me, anyway) as your comments about the Japanese people and culture were, then I probably will comment and you probably won't like it and you'll probably take it as me taking yet another "shot" at you. I can't help that, but do wish it were otherwise.
Do you think some of the Japanese tactics were rationalized by their cultural myths and superstitions?
Sure they were. But the question is, were they actually effective? Not, did they make sense in line with a certain strain of Japanese religio-military thinking.
And the admiration for these tactics was not ubiquitous. There were voices in the military saying, "This is not a sustainable or effective way of making war." General Kuribayashi at Iwo Jima certainly was of a different mindset, and, man for man, his defense produced the best casualty ratio for Japan of the war.
...you can imagine so-called healing services of the pigpen. The books that could be written, you know: Life in the Pigpen. How to Cope in the Pigpen. Being Happy in the Pigpen. Surviving in the Pigpen. And then there could be counselling, for people who feel unhappy in the pigpen, to try to get them to come to terms with the pigpen, and to accept the pigpen.
I believe your primary interest is to discredit me the best you can at every possible opportunity without exception. You are always ready to pounce..
You are becoming obsessive. I even had to block your private messages to me. Your list of demands and do's and donts in order to coexist with me was very agressive.

Examines quantitative performance analysis in the commercial server market and the embedded market, as well as the traditional desktop market.
Expands coverage of instruction sets to include descriptions of digital signal processors, media processors, and multimedia extensions to desktop processors.
This best-selling title, considered for over a decade to be essential reading for every serious student and practitioner of computer design, has been updated throughout to address the most important trends facing computer designers today. In this edition, the authors bring their trademark method of quantitative analysis not only to high performance desktop machine design, but also to the design of embedded and server systems. They have illustrated their principles with designs from all three of these domains, including examples from consumer electronics, multimedia and web technologies, and high performance computing.
The book retains its highly rated features: Fallacies and Pitfalls, which share the hard-won lessons of real designers; Historical Perspectives, which provide a deeper look at computer design history; Putting it all Together, which present a design example that illustrates the principles of the chapter; Worked Examples, which challenge the reader to apply the concepts, theories and methods in smaller scale problems; and Cross-Cutting Issues, which show how the ideas covered in one chapter interact with those presented in others. In addition, a new feature, Another View, presents brief design examples in one of the three domains other than the one chosen for Putting It All Together.
The authors present a new organization of the material as well, reducing the overlap with their other text, Computer Organization and
This is the very title stealing my heart and soul, I love computer science especially on this focus. I am poor, and could not afford buying a paper edition. So I download this one extremly. But to read it with my old CRT screen is not an easy thing, but for me, I thank you.
I think any one who interested in computer science will love this book, cos it's really a good book...

Perhaps, like me, you’ve already watched video of China’s Got Talent contestant Liu Wei, thanks to the magic of the Internet. Liu is a 23-year old musical prodigy who was electrocuted during a game of hide-and-seek at age 10, costing him his arms but not his passion for piano–he now plays miraculously with his toes.
Maybe, like me, you shared the video with everyone you knew, because the combo of Richard Clayderman tuneage and this adorable, spirited kid’s incredible story were simply too much to keep to yourself. And then of course you watched it with your parents; together you cried, commented, and mentally hugged (to actually hug might’ve been too awkward). And even though they thanked you for sharing the video with them, you could tell they were also wondering why, given your many lessons and ten fingers, you never made anything of your piano playing.

Throughout the month of October, which is Careers in Construction Month, we’ll be exploring a number of different construction career paths at Alberici. To kick off the series, we’ll be taking a look at working in BIM and VDC.
Not all construction work occurs on the jobsite. Alberici’s BIM and VDC experts work to “build” the project virtually to prevent future issues in the field.
BIM, or Building Information Modeling, is a process that involves the creation and management of a digital representation of a facility. BIM representations are 3D and can also incorporate time as a 4th dimension and cost as a 5th dimension. Creating a BIM representation is highly collaborative and requires involvement from multiple stakeholders including architects, engineers and specialty subcontractors. Once a BIM model is created, it can be used to view a project from different angles, to detect design clashes (for example pipes running into ductwork), to verify if work in the field has been installed as designed and as a communication tool for the construction team.
VDC, or Virtual Design and Construction, describes the work that can be done using the models created through BIM.
At Alberici, Virtual Construction professionals combine BIM models created by architects, engineers and subcontractors to create a complete, fully coordinated BIM representation. Using the comprehensive model, Virtual Construction professionals are able to identify clashes in design as well as identify constructability issues. In the field, superintendents and Project Managers use the model to plan and discuss the work and to verify that work is installed as designed.
Alberici’s Virtual Construction professionals also work with the estimating and marketing teams. When Alberici is pursuing work, BIM can be used to show an owner what a new facility would look like. Estimators can pull quantities from a model, a quicker and sometimes more accurate approach to completing an estimate.
There are many different pathways to a career in Virtual Design and Construction, including an increasing number of university programs. Many universities offer courses in the management and use of BIM; some even offer degrees specializing in Virtual Design and Construction within a Construction Management or Engineering program.
Many Virtual Design and Construction professionals come to the field from an architectural, engineering or construction management background, and further their knowledge with continuing education focused on BIM. The Associated General Contractors (AGC) offers a credential for BIM, and several Alberici employees have earned this CM-BIM credential.
Formalized training can lay a solid groundwork for a career in Virtual Design and Construction, but it cannot replace hands-on experience. Managing the process and understanding the intricacies with various software, ensuring all models are coordinated, and managing various competency levels of those working in the model can really only be mastered in the field.
In addition to formal training and hands-on experience, a focus on technology, attention to detail and management capabilities are all essential to success in this field.
As Alberici’s Director of Project Controls and Virtual Construction Brooks Williams explains, working in Virtual Construction is a satisfying because like construction, it “offers fresh challenges, and figuring out how to leverage technology allows us to build better projects.”
Throughout the month of October, which is Careers in Construction Month, we’ll be exploring a number
Continuing with our Careers in Construction series, this week we’re taking a look at the professiona
When the North West Coal & Navigation Company (NWC&NCo.) mines opened in October 1882, Sir Alexander Galt was faced with the problem of how to move coal from Coalbanks to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) main line at Dunmore Junction. In 1883 and 1884 three riverboats - the Alberta, the Baroness and the Minnow - and a fleet of barges moved coal from the mines to Medicine Hat. Unfortunately, the Belly River was completely unsuitable to riverboat navigation: shallow, with many sandbars and a current so strong that it took the boats five days of hard steaming to return from Medicine Hat. In 1883 the boats moved only 180 metric tons of coal along the river; in 1884 they managed to transport 2,729 metric tons. After two seasons, Galt realized that his riverboat gamble had failed. The only sure solution to the problem of moving coal to market was a railway.
After the Alberta docked at Lethbridge on her last trip, she was beached and her engine and boilers removed and placed in the NWC&NCo.'s sawmill in the river valley. The boat's hull was used as a platform by swimmers until the floods of 1902 washed it away, and the bell was used to sound fire alarms and curfew in Lethbridge.
Over that two-year span, the Alberta made just eight round trips, loaded with 500 tons of coal each time. Sir Alexander Galt's experience with the riverboats in 1884 turned out to be the epitaph for river transportation. "In 1884 I waited at Medicine Hat for the water till after the twenty-fourth of May, and by the twenty-eighth of June our boats and barges were tied up for the season."
The Alberta was 30.5 m long and 6.1 m wide, with a gross weight of 150 tons. It was built by John Todd at Medicine Hat, and its engine was manufactured by Rees & Sons of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Launched at Medicine Hat on April 15,1884, the Alberta was taken out of service on June 24,1886.

For many, ritual is a way to formally connect with specific currents of energy. The rituals in this book are intended to align one's soul with the "Death Energy." One might ask, what is "Death Energy?" Simply expressed, it is the current of transition and the essence of melancholy. The workings in this unique book will permit the magician to bask in the "lifeforce" of the Angel of Death. Successful working of any of these devotions will enable you to share consciousness with the Angel of Death on an intimate level as well as becoming "one" with your own death. Not for the faint of heart nor the fearful. These are rites of passion and devotion for the sincere practitioner.
NEWS CHRISTCHURCH MAIL, OCTOBER 16, 2014 UN debate exciting challenge By ARIELLE MONK Daniel Maier-Grant is among a record number of seven Canterbury students selected for a United Nations conference at the end of this year. The St Andrews College student is ‘‘stoked’’ to be among the 4000 international students who will converge on the Hague in December. The Netherlands will play host to the army of high school students debating and lobbying on real world current affairs during the UN Youth Conference. Each delegation represents a country, and are encouraged to form opinions based on the nation’s actual position, not on their personal views. The New Zealand team will act as the United States. Overarching these inter-country relations will be mock UN committees. Students are expected to be up to speed on matters of the six main committees, from disarmament and international security, to economic and financial issues, and several in between. Daniel is prepared to tolerate a wide range of world views, with students from North Korea, America and Norway typically butting heads. ‘‘There’s always going to be different positions with those countries. It teaches you to not have a very Western or New Zealand view on things, and to be able to understand the way in which other countries deal with their issues.’’ Before arriving at the Hague, the Kiwi students are also embarking on a study trip from the US to Europe. The lucky teens will travel to New York, Geneva, Brussels, Amsterdam and Berlin to see what the main UN centres around the world are like. ‘‘UN Youth is quite a close organisation in New Zealand, we know each other really well. One of the main things I’m looking forward to is travelling with people who are literally my best friends.’’ The Canterbury representatives make up about a third of the New Zealand delegation, the most the region has ever sent overseas with the UN. Daniel and his UN Youth fellows (including students from Christ’s College, Rangi Ruru Girl’s School, Methven and Lincoln), have been fundraising since June. They are hosting a Halloween-themed quiz night at the end of the month in Strowan with $15 tickets. ❚ Formoreinfo contact Daniel Maier-GrantatStAndrew’s College.

Clue tomissingtrailer found at chop shop By ANNA PRICE Police are keen to track down a $27,000 generator and a tandem Briford trailer after discovering the trailer’s tag during a chop shop bust in Woodend last week. Investigations are widening as Seen this? This generator andtrailer are identical to those that vanished fromLyttelton Engineering within the last couple ofmonths. Neither has yet been found but the identification tag off the Brifordtrailer was among the items of interest foundin the police bust of a chop shop in Woodend last week. Six Christchurch Heritage Houses open to the public Tickets $25 at Ballantynes more people of interest come to police attention. Constable Mike Kneebone of Rangiora police said the valuable missing generator – a unique model – and trailer went missing from Lyttelton Engineering in the last couple of months. ‘‘We’ve found part of the trailer’s identification at the scene. The only thing we have is its ID tag. But the trailer and generator are still missing,’’ he said. Police are following ‘‘strong’’ lines of inquiry into what appears to be a sophisticated steal-to-order racket linked to the illicit components and equipment ‘‘factory’’ in a backyard on the outskirts of Woodend. ‘‘They’re all very unique kinds of items,’’ Kneebone said. Images on a seized cellphone indicated a well-organised criminal ring. Those images include a green/ blue digger and an irrigation pump. Another digger found in the illicit workshop had been freshly painted black but it is not believed to be the repainted original green/blue excavator. A 26 year old Pines Beach man, Ryan Jay Mills, appeared in the Christchurch District Court last Friday on five receiving counts. EWART DENTAL Les Ewart B.D.S.

About 10,600 delegates from 186 governments, businesses and environmental groups will meet in Poznan for two weeks of talks. The meeting marks the halfway point of a two-year push to agree a new climate treaty in Copenhagen at the end of 2009 to succeed the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012 Much of the debate is about trying to agree on an overall emissions cut by developed nations of 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020, though the final target is not likely to be set until the Copenhagen meeting.
Head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, said meeting the climate change targets at the same time as the world was grappling with recession would be a challenge. Mr de Boer praised President-elect Barack Obama for saying that he would seek to cut United States emissions of greenhouse gases back to 1990 levels by 2020 as part of global action to avert more heatwaves, floods, droughts, more powerful storms and rising seas. US emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels in factories, power plants and cars, are about 14 percent above.
In Europe, economic slowdown has exposed doubts about the costs of an EU goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. UN talks host Poland, which gets 93 percent of its electricity from coal, and Italy are leading a drive for concessions in a package meant to be agreed at a December 11-12 summit of EU leaders in Brussels. The talks in Poland will review new ideas for combating global warming, such as handing credits to tropical nations for preserving forests. China is also suggesting that developed nations should give up to 1 percent of their gross national product in aid to help the poor switch from fossil fuels.
Prime Minister John Key has confirmed New Zealand will seek special treatment for its farmers at climate change talks this month, bringing claims from the Greens that the stance could damage agriculture exports. Mr Key said negotiators in Poznan, Poland, would argue aggressively for any targets on greenhouse gas emissions for New Zealand to take account of the significant contribution farming played in the economy. The industry accounts for half of New Zealand's carbon emissions. But Greens co-leader Russel Norman said the stance would undermine international efforts to reduce emissions and could threaten farm exports as other countries focused on high-emitting industries. "If they want credibility in any of these negotiations, they've got to be seen to be taking action domestically," Dr Norman said. "Undermining the ETS undermines that credibility. If we're asking for anything around agriculture, then we need to be seen to be doing stuff domestically. "The problem is that everyone's got a reason for special treatment, and if everyone gets special treatment, then we don't reduce emissions."
The world financial crisis must not become an excuse for backsliding on efforts to curb global carbon emissions, a top UN environmental official warned Thursday. While acknowledging the severity of the financial turmoil, Yvo de Boer, said: "To use the financial crisis as an excuse not to act on climate change would basically amount to setting yourself up for the next financial crisis. For example, within the next five to 10 years we will be replacing about 40 percent of the power-generating capacity worldwide. If, in the light of the financial crisis, a decision is made to go for cheap and dirty technology, as in the past, that technology will still be around in 30 to 50 years," he said. "The challenge for industry is how it can be part of the solution and not part of the problem," he later told reporters.
An opinion poll in 11 countries has produced what organisers term a "global mandate" for action on climate change. About half of the respondents wanted governments to play a major role in curbing emissions, but only a quarter said their leaders were doing enough. In developing countries, a majority of people were prepared to make "lifestyle changes" to reduce climate change. The survey was commissioned by the HSBC Climate Partnership, which includes business and environmental groups. The survey revealed that 43% of people questioned put climate change ahead of the world's financial instability as an issue of current concern, even though the surveys ran in the turbulent months of September and October. However, the numbers saying they would alter their lifestyles to reduce climate change had fallen in the year between the previous survey, in 2007, and this one.
pending a review came as a bolt from the blue. Stakeholders had been led to expect that there would be some changes to the ETS but the proposal to pass legislation putting it on hold was completely unexpected. The decision has thrown the emerging carbon market into disarray. It has undermined the recent launch of the New Zealand Stock Exchange's carbon trading platform, TZ1. EcoSecurities, one of the largest promoters of emission reduction projects in the world, pulled out from the launch of its New Zealand business. It has brought into doubt the forest sector's investment in large-scale carbon sequestration [storing carbon in forests]. According to one report it led an Asian investor to cancel a 25,000ha afforestation project. There are other indications that investment in new plantings has evaporated.
The Greens are unhappy with National's decision to overturn the previous government's ban on incandescent light bulbs. Energy and Resources Minister Gerry Brownlee has reportedly instructed the Energy Efficiency Conservation Authority to prepare the paperwork to reverse the ban. The legislation would have seen incandescent bulbs switched off in October next year. Green Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons says it's par for the course for National which has opposed every energy efficiency proposal she can think of in recent years. She says National has set a climate change target of a 50% reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 2050 but does not seem to have the slightest idea of how it will get there.

***my paint pots on the background... iL post more pictures of my army as soon as I got to finish painting them all!
Lua scripts are loaded similar to SOC lumps, from any lump that starts with "LUA_" (i.e. LUA_INIT, LUA_GAME, LUA_SKIN, LUA_GLOB) or any file that ends with the .lua extention (similar to .soc) ... The lumps are loaded in the order they appear in the wad.
Before a Lua script is loaded, the Lua scripting system remains uninitialized and dormant, costing no further overhead than SOCs do in terms of memory and processing. When the first Lua script is found, a new Lua state is initialized and all of the hardcoded Lua libraries are loaded into it, which may take some significant processing, but only occurs once.
All Lua scripts run in this same Lua state, so for now I've disabled setting variables in the global environment, in an effort to prevent scripts from accidentally messing eachother up. Attempting to set a variable that doesn't exist (local variables must be declared beforehand) results in a Lua processing error.
Lua processing errors are handled by writing out a detailed error message (as generated by Lua) to the console as a warning alert and the currently running Lua script is halted.
If a Lua error occurs outside of a running script (for instance, while finding the appropriate Lua function to run or preparing arguments for it), however...! Then Lua will panic and crash the game with an I_Error, because this is a bug with the exe and must be fixed!
Local variables are currently out of my control, and some global variables from SRB2 which may be too useful to leave out completely, aren't necessarily network-synchronized and can in theory cause consistency failures.
For instance, if a script makes a local variable outside of all its functions, that variable is global to that specific script lump, and won't be reset between function calls, reset after the game returns to the title screen, or sent to other players should they join after it is set.
When a Lua script is "loaded", it is immediately processed as if the script itself were a function. This means that everything you put inside of a script happens immediately when the wad is added with addfile, such as writing messages to the console, initializing variables and data tables with useful information, and declaring functions and attaching hooks. There is no "initialize this script" function that runs immediately after the wad is added, just the script itself.
After the script is loaded (and processed, generally adding things it needs to the global state as allowed and setting up other necessary local things), it will not be run again. There IS an overhead for loading/running a script, as Lua does its script compilation to bytecode at load time, so "running" a script by re-loading it repeatedly is FAR FROM IDEAL. Instead, Lua scripts are intended to declare functions, which can then be called by SRB2 at any time with minimal overhead.
Unlike a SOC, however, Lua scripts can go a step further and actually declare entirely new "A_Action" functions for its objects to use. These are created by simply declaring a new global function with a name which starts in "A_", which SRB2 will recognize and specifically allow. Then, the newly declared action may be assigned to one or several existing states as its action, exactly the same as any hardcoded action function.
This function will take one to three arguments, named "actor", "var1", and "var2" by convention, which are the mobj_t of the object which called it and the state's var1 and var2 values. The function will be run whenever an object changes states to one which has been set to use this function as its action, and may do anything it damn well pleases.
Scripting hooks are the only other way which Lua functions are currently run. They are declared as local functions, and then passed to SRB2 as an argument of the hardcoded "addHook" function, along with other relevant parameters which vary depending on the hook type.
Throughout SRB2's code, in any convenient place where hardcoded behaviors are present, a call to one of Lua's functions through a scripting hook may be added, allowing script authors and users to create additional behaviors or replace existing ones. For instance, a function may be added for when a specific mobj type's fuse runs out, where the default behavior would cause it to die, instead the written Lua function may cause something else to happen, such as triggering a linedef executor or having a boss stop to contemplate the meaning of life.
SRB2's internal copy of Lua has been heavily modified to suit our needs. This changes it from the standard vanilla implementation of Lua in more ways than simply adding new libraries, so here's a section to explain the changes. Most of these were made in order for Lua to more readily integrate with SRB2.
Vanilla Lua's numbers are stored as "double" and do a lot of floating point math. This has been changed in our version to use ptrdiff_t, a type used for handling large signed integers, which means it is suitable for containing whole numbers, fixed point math (multiples of FRACUNIT), angles (ANGLE_180, etc), or any other unit of measurement SRB2 can possibly handle. However, this also means there's no decimals for script writers to use. All fractional math must be fixed point math.
The only standard libraries SRB2 loads are as follows: basic library, string manipulation, table manipulation. That is it. Everything else has been completely removed or replaced by SRB2-specific functions. The reasoning for this is that the other libraries are unnecessary, "dangerous", or OS-dependent.
The package library allows the loading of additional Lua scripts and completely arbitrary DLL files (dangerous!), which is unnecessary since addfile loads Lua scripts and wad files which are dependent on eachother already handle that with bat files or whatever. Lua scripts CAN load other wads too, if it comes to that, just like any map-based console script can.
The math library was designed for floating point math, and the only functions it provides which are useful to SRB2 are math.abs (which has been replaced by a global abs() as in C) and math.random (which has been replaced by P_Random). Everything else has been replaced by fixed point and fine angle math. Additional functions (such as min(), max(), or FixedFloor()) may be written and provided later if necessary.
The io library has not been replaced yet, but it was very system-dependent and only readily capable of reading/writing/deleting completely arbitrary text files anywhere on your harddrive anyway. Ideally it will be replaced with a library which can only read lumps from wad files (both binary and text) and read/write txt, cfg, and non-gamedata dat files in SRB2's own folder and subfolders. So it might be able to replace your autoexec.cfg, but it shouldn't damage your system.
The os library would be used to get the system clock, force-exit the program, and rename/delete files from anywhere on your computer. It is gone. I don't care if you wanted to write a script that only activates on april fool's day, you're not doing it from the os clock.
The debug library is gone. It could access data meant to only be used internally by SRB2, break assertions, and use arbitrary pointers. That's all I have to say on the matter.
As well as removing all the shit that didn't mesh well with SRB2, several things have been added to Lua syntax as well.
Bitwise operations have been added: & | ^^ << >> and ~, for binary and or xor shl shr and not. Note that ^ in Lua is used for exponents, so ^^ was used for binary xor instead.
do ... end patch, makes do blocks into function() when passed as an argument or assigned as a variable.
Vanilla Lua requires "do" after for/while (as in "while EXP do ... end") -- This requirement has been rendered optional.
Vanilla Lua requires "then" after if (as in "if EXP then ... end") -- This requirement has been rendered optional.
Lua scripting has been thus far designed to very closely mimic what coding for SRB2 in C is like. It primarily consists of calling existing hardcoded functions (such as P_InstaThrust and A_Look) and manipulating data values yourself (such as setting/unsetting any of our plethora of bit-wise flags).
However, as Lua is a scripting language and not the real-deal, there will always be some very strong differences in syntax and implementation, especially when you note that I am working hard to ensure SRB2's stability regardless of what a Lua script may try. In order to write a successful script, one must be aware of the differences from C programming to Lua scripting, in order to be able to transition.
Lua uses "if ... then ... end" structure instead of "if (...) { ... }" as in C. SRB2's custom Lua bastardization library specifically makes "then" and "do" optional, but the { } brackets are used for declaring table structures in Lua, so I'm not going that far to change it. It's important to note that Lua has an "elseif" statement, where "else if" is used in C and will not give you the appropriate behavior in Lua.
C demands every command end with a semicolon so that it can support multi-line operations, in Lua semicolons are optional and generally omitted.
SRB2's Lua library has been extended with bitwise operations, in order to manage all the bitwise flags SRB2 uses and such. These are the & | ^^ and ~ operations. In C, the ^^ operation is just ^, but Lua already has powers (exponents) as ^ so the bit-wise operation became ^^ instead.
Lua scripts use only one type of data structure to hold multiple variables, and that is the 'table'. For all purposes of the C array and the struct, the table is used in Lua. Every structure SRB2 shares to Lua mimics the form of a table, allowing you to set and retrieve values as you wish, with the primary difference being that Lua always uses '.' to access variables in a table, where SRB2 may use '->' for pointers.
Lua does not access/manipulate pointers directly, but it will never automatically make a copy of a table when that table is assigned to any given variable. Thus, a table representing a mobj or other structure may be passed to another function, and that function may manipulate it, as if it were a pointer anyway.
Lua table arrays have a natural starting index of 1, rather than 0 as in C, but all of SRB2's arrays (such as mobjinfo) will be faithful to C. Be aware that table.insert(), ipairs, etc. will start at 1 and ignore any value at 0. (I may look into changing this at some point. Lua used to consider a number value of '0' to be equivalent of true, for instance. We're flexible here.)
Internally, SRB2 has not actually created a table for each mobj_t, player_t, etc., but actually passed Lua a pointer and asked it to be kept a secret. Thus, unlike a regular Lua table, variables may not be assigned haphazardly to any SRB2 structures, and can be controlled or modified as appropriate whenever a value is requested or assigned.
Some values, such as a mobj's x, y, and z position, outright refuse to be edited directly, as it would break the game (blockmaps, linked lists and all that). In this case, there should be provided an alternative method to change these values, such as P_TeleportMove for mobj positions or a BotTiccmd hook for player button presses to be generated.
In Lua, functions do not have to explicitly declare their return value, and are instead declared simply as 'function' or 'local function'. Similarly, variable types aren't explicitly defined, and any variable can contain any type of data, thus the arguments of a function are simply local variable names to use, if the argument is to be accepted at all.
Any function may take any type or number of arguments and return any type or number of values, including 'nil' (in place of NULL, or nothing). It's interesting to note that C functions can only return one value and often use pointers as arguments to mimic the ability to return multiple informative values, but this isn't necessarily practical in Lua as Lua only has tables in place of pointers.
Instead, Lua may easily return several values at once, which can be recorded into multiple variables as such:
New to SRB2 2.1 is a feature of the singleplayer character select screen, in which writing in the skin name as "sonic&tails" (or any other "skin&skin") will start a new game in which the player is using the first character and the second character is added to the game as a 'bot' with limited AI.
These bots differ from previous bots in SRB2JTE and so on in that they are specifically designed for singleplayer use ONLY and take up the slot of the splitscreen player, even disabling its own AI should player 2's controls be touched.
The default AI is intentionally quite stupid (or at least barebones), and specifically refuses to activate its own special abilities regardless of circumstance. It will never attempt to double jump, and will only spindash if it's sitting right next to you while you are charging one yourself.
However, it was brought to my attention that people may wish to attempt to script their own bot AI in Lua, for one reason or another. Since anything hardcoded should be modifiable through Lua, I've added a hook named "BotAI" which can be used to completely override the AI for a specific character skin by name.
The addHook parameter "tails" is the character skin this bot AI gets activated on. The two arguments 'sonic' and 'tails' are the mobj_t of the consoleplayer (player 1, the user at the keyboard) and the bot (player 2, the stupid fox that follows you around). I chose these names just because tails follows sonic, but they can be something more generic like "human" and "bot", "master" and "slave", "alchemist" and "homunculus", etc. etc. if you like, it doesn't matter. The return values are all of the keyboard presses of the bot for this game tic.
Each of those boolean variables are for different keypresses. Bots, for the purpose of simplifying AI, are non-analog keyboard-users, so setting left to true will cause it to turn left at the same rate as turning left by the arrow keys. If more advanced access is required, a low-level hook "BotTiccmd" may be used instead (which activates on any bot type and manipulates the ticcmd directly) or the values of the Tails mobj may be manipulated directly (But that's cheating!).
This method is similar to the above example, except not all keys are required to even exist (You may have a bot which never spindashes, by never writing a spin key in at all), where having multiple return values would force you to at least put a nil in order to have the appropriate number of values.
A hook which is called when a bot or mobj's movement is stopped or altered by collision (specifically their momx, momy, momz, as P_Move and such immediately return a value if the move was not allowed)
A hook which may be called every tic to ask whether a bot should be respawned, in case the AI wishes to continue its existence even far offscreen.
A hook which is called when a bot is initially spawned, where the default AI simply puts the bot on the player 2 spawn thing as normal.
A hook which is called when a bot is in the process of being respawned, which can be used to manipulate the arrival position/movement/state and other such things.

I think Kerdy is on the right track, though. One of the universal concepts of war is that a tactic must have a high Return on Investment - ROI. Basically, you have to put in less of whatever resource you are using than you destroy of the enemy. This is more qualitative than quantitative. The resources are valued at what you and your enemies put into it.
In Vietnam, the US valued the lives of it's people more than the Vietnamese did. This is not a moral statement but one of policy. The Vietnamese Communists - PAVN, VC, and the Viet Minh before them - all had been fighting wars of attrition. They had the manpower and they also had the will to fight in this manner - accepting losses of 10 Vietnamese to every dead American. The manpower is less of an issue. The US had far more men they could throw into the fight. The problem was, the American people did not have the willpower to accept these kinds of losses. The North Vietnamese were at a severely bad spot after the Tet Offensive. But with the support of General Ho Chi Brokaw, they were able to sap the will of the American people to fight.
Keep in mind, that from Industrial War on, it has not been a contest of armies but rather of populations. This was the same in WWII as well, though with the advent of Maneuver Warfare the armies began having better options, but it was still a matter of American and Soviet grinding that won rather than German maneuvers and Japanese martial spirit.
So with your example of the terror bombings - the US killed swathes of Japanese with their bombs but still had not broken their will to fight. What we did was, we broke their ability to build quality materials of war. They were building Arisakas in their basements for Rommel's sake! The Japanese had the will to lose 10 men for every dead American. Fine. If they don't even have the equipment to facilitate killing that one when we have artillery, tanks, ships, fighter-bombers, and all the other fun war-toys to kill 20 of theirs, their will becomes inconsequential. They had the strength of will and the dedications to fly their planes into our ships. Fine. For starts, they didn't really do all that much damage to the ships they hit, and when they did, there were three or four more behind that one. All the while they were done yet another pilot and yet another plane and our firebombs were making it so that while they could replace the pilot they could not replace the plane. And every Zero that became a flaming grease spot on the deck of a USN destroyer was not a pilot defending the skies over Japan, protecting their fleet, or protecting their torpedo bombers which actually would have had a chance at sinking our ships.
Basically, the Japanese were willing to pay the price, but we were able to absorb their expenditure and still be on top. The ROI of banzai charges and kamikazi attacks was too high to be effective.

The People’s Progressive Party (PPP) seems to be getting tired of government’s claims of public office irregularities and reiterated that the administration should either provide evidence and lock up wrongdoers or shut up.
General Secretary Clement Rohee issued another call to the government to reveal the former government’s improprieties, while asking at the government to account for the money they are currently spending.
The GS told media workers that the party was concerned about government’s unauthorized spending and demanded that information be made public immediately. “The PPP calls on the Granger Administration to state how much money is being spent by government without Parliamentary approval and to state the areas in which these monies are being spent.”
He said in this situation of abnormality where only 1/3 of budget relative to each government agency is authorized to be spent, “we have absolutely no idea how much money is being sent (by this government) and on what.”
He said during Parliament’s prorogation last year, the PPP came under constant attack by the then opposition and others claiming that money was being spent illegally, “We are saying now that they’re in the government, let them reveal what are these things that money were spent on unauthorised and have it published.”
Rohee claimed that the government’s extravagance is seen with the luxurious conditions State Houses are being remodeled into, Granger’s “multi -million dollar” inauguration, the victory parties, the luxury trips and his recent Birthday party.
One PPP minister was accused of attempting to transfer state vehicles to herself and associates, and public servants and alleged PPP political appointees accused of wrongdoings have been called out by this government, but no word of actual arrests and charges have risen.
When asked last week, Minister of State Joseph Harmon said that his government was not “bluffing” in its quest to bring those involved in forms of wrongdoings to justice. With numerous forensic audits, committees and review programs ongoing, he said it would take time to compile the evidence and lay the right claims.
Even as the country’s budget is expected to be presented to the nation today, the People’s Progressive Party (PPP) was much clearer that embattled Dr. Jennifer Westford is still among its list of parliamentarians, but remained tight-lipped about when its parliamentarians would take up their 32 seats in the National Assembly
This is because General Secretary (GS), Clement Rohee, during his regular press briefing, Monday August 1, still asked that persons wait to see when the party enters Parliament.
The former Public Service Minister Jennifer Westford is still on the party’s list, the GS confirmed. His response came denying earlier reports that she was booted as a Member of Parliament for the party. When asked if Westford was taken off the PPP list he said, “No”.
When asked if she will be in Parliament, if the party turns up in Parliament, again he said, “Wait and see. When we turn up the answer will be clear as crystal.”
Rohee noted that there has been no discussion to remove Westford from the list and no discussion has been held with any possible replacement.
When asked about image concerns given that the minister was charged for attempted larceny, while another investigation into millions of dollars is also ongoing, Rohee repeated that these persons are “innocent until proven guilty.”
“We have always maintained the position that a person is innocent until proven guilty. We don’t want to act prematurely.”
Outside of this, the PPP expressed concern about what they say is the failure of the government to actively inform the nation via the media. In his statement Rohee said the party “has noted the secrecy with which the Granger Administration has been operating,” and called on them to make several issues clear, particularly economic issues and his trips abroad where matters of national interest were believed to have been discussed.
“Granger has failed miserably at informing the people of this country on what exactly his government is doing to stimulate investment and spur growth of the Guyanese economy, which has been on the decline.” He claimed that the PPP has never failed to keep the nation updated since assuming office in 1992.
He however set aside all questions pertaining to the secrecy surrounding his party taking their seats in Parliament, their concerns of certain developments and their involvement in matters requiring their input such as the procurement commission.

#DisneyInfinityFans to find out more about a #DisneyInfinity project visit https://letsplayagame.co.uk/projects/infinite-infinity/
a BIG thumbs up to everyone involved for their hard work. This is great for everyone, especially those who Disney Infinity means so much to.
But when i tried to make an account, i received an e-mail, but without an Activation Code what i need to activated my account.
@ Sheriff Woody: Do you know how i can fix this problem or do you know someone who can helps me with this problem?
I was pleasantly surprised to see some names there of people who used to be frequent posters on this forum. I had thought that maybe they had given up on the game.
I've tried to make an another account. Cuz i couldn't figure out how to request a Login. But i had to use another emailadress and accountname.
And even now i still didn't got a Activation Code, so how i'm i supposed to play the game if they don't send me the Activation Code.
However I do not think the "Server" will be accessible until after March 3rd but I could be wrong as it seems the approval process is taking some time and the site is evolving.
From what I have gleaned from looking at the description of what Infinite Infinity is there will be a lot to study once we have access to it.
Disney is expensive, and it's only natural that you want to find ways to cut your expenses. For some families, it's the only way that they can go, for others, they might not care about staying at a Disney resort, maybe they visit often, or they just want a place to rest, and some, there are just so many in the group, it makes more sense to rent a house. No matter which way you do it, there will be good things, and a few uhhhhhs. It's best to think carefully about what is best for YOU before you decide.
In order to help you decide which way is going to work best, we've outlined a few of the things to think about
On Property, you'll have a choice of either a restaurant/food court breakfast that you'll need to buy, or else a quick meal in your room, or on the way to the bus stop.
Off Property, if you've managed to find a place with free breakfast, that might just help out with the overall budget! No matter if you like a big meal, or just a snack, it's already included in the price of your room!
Rental: You'll have access to a few more kitchen tools and perhaps even a larger refrigerator to make meals, be it sit down or on the go.
When you stay at a Disney Property, parking is always free. It's free to park at the resort, and it's free to park at the Parks if you take your own car. Of course, you can always use the free Disney transportation too.
Off property visitors are going to need to pay for parking, possibly at their off property resort, AND at the theme parks. When planning your trip, be sure to calculate that into the number of days you plan to stay. For an example, the BLAH LAG charges $ a night to park your car, .That's quite a huge chunk out of the vacation budget when you think about how you're going to have to pay to park at the theme parks as well!
It's definitely sneaky to charge these extra fees. The Orlando Sentinal did a report back in 2016, saying 129 hotels were charging “resort fees” to cover things like WiFi and parking.
If you stay On Property at a Disney Resort, you will not have to pay to park at any of their theme parks. If you are staying off property, you'll have to pay $20 for a standard parking spot, per day, or $40 for a preferred parking spot. Some other hotels do offer shuttles to the parks, but the time you wait can vary wildly, and there's not always the frequency of pick ups. If you rent a house, of course, it's likely you will need to take your own vehicle.
Meals don't have to be eaten at the parks, and honestly, there's nothing easier than heading back mid afternoon for a snack or a late meal. At a Disney property, it's pretty easy and convinient to grab something, but the same goes as you are leaving in your own vehicle and passing by numberous places. There's not really a savings one way of the other, it's just your personal preference. Meals inside of the parks really aren't as expensive as you would think, there's a wide variety of things to get in the $10 or less range.
While you can rest anywhere, with your own transportation you do have the luxury of driving yourself back whenever you want, without waiting for a shuttle to pick you up. I find though, that I like to rest a bit on the Disney bus, and that restores me enough it's an easier walk from the bus stop to my room, and even back again to the food court to fill my mug. We personally find it restful to let someone else do the driving in an unfamiliar area, but those of you with huge strollers, large families or not staying close by really might perfer to drive.
The pool will vary at Disney Properties depending on what level resort you are staying at. Value resports have no water slides, for example. If a deluxe pool is something that is important to your family, you might want to check out the pool at the place you are thinking of staying at first, to make sure it's going to fit your needs. We've found that the pools at the Value on property resorts are more than wonderful, with huge splash pads or splash pools, multiple pools per resort, (Pop Century has 3, and a splash pag, for example) and have poolside games and movies but some friends of ours refuse to stay anywhere that doesn't have a waterslide. That's important to them, so they make sure to check for it.
If you want your resort to scream I'M AT DISNEY!!! (at least on the outside) then you'll want to stay on property. If you just want a place to rest your head, or maybe a more spa like surrounding, well, you also might want to stay at Disney, in one of the moderate or deluxe resorts, or you might be fine staying off property. Off property, you are unlikly to get any Disney themeing, however, if you are renting a house, it's possible that you could get some thememing, to help you stay in The Bubble.
The Bubble is the experience of being at Disney and not leaving it once until your trip is over. Many people enjoy that, myself included. Even though the inside of our resort doesn't scream DISNEY WOOO the theming is still fun, and we really enjoy the touches of Disney everywhere we look, plus going to the gift shop or food court whenever we want. You might not like that though. Maybe you go so often you just don't care, or maybe you don't want to be staring at a giant mouse everywhere you turn, that's totally fine! I would suggest though, if you have NEVER stayed on property, AND if you have small kids, just try it, at least once. There really is something special to be said for staying in The Bubble.
So there's a few things to think about when you are choosing where to stay. Run the numbers, take into consideration your meal needs, but also parking and resort fees. There's nothing to ruin a vacation like the shock of added expenses on your first day. Do a little research ahead of time, and be prepared!
Great tips. I have always wanted to take my Daughter to Disneyland :) Thanks for sharing at the weekend blog hop.

This person , at age 16, dropped out of school to join the Army, but was rejected, for being too young. He then joined the Red Cross as an ambulance driver and was sent to France, after lying and saying he was 17. (Kind of makes me think of Young Indiana Jones under age and joining the Belgium Army!) He drove the ambulance for a year, before he moved back to the United States with the desire to make a career as a newpaperman.
A bit of a rascal running off like that, but as patriotic as they come, even at such a young age, wanting to do his part for his country.

I am Gaia, returned to assist you in recalibrating your First, Root Chakra. Please take a moment to feel the Love and Support that I am sending to you. I wish to thank you for assisting me in OUR process of Planetary Ascension. In return, I am here to assist you in your process of Personal Ascension. Together we are Returning to SELF. Are you ready now to recalibrate your First Chakra?
GOOD! You may find it helpful to exercise or stretch before doing the meditation as it quiets your body and prepares you for greater concentration.
Find a comfortable place to sit, either on the ground or with you feet on the ground, as this first chakra’s main focus is grounding.
The first chakra’s element is earth, so you may wish to find a crystal, or a rock, to use as a focal point for this meditation.
The sense of smell is ruled by the first chakra, so you may wish to light incense or scented candles and/or focus on your environmental aromas.
Visualize yourself in your favorite place in nature…feel the loving energy of the Earth as it enters the base of your spine…in turn, send your love down, deep into my earth…feel your energetic “tail” as you intimately connect with the earth.
When you finish your meditation, take a moment to feel your “tail” connect to the earth of my planet while you are sitting, standing and/or walking throughout your day. To remind yourself of this connection, think or say the following mantra as you go about your daily life.
Before you focus on your body, take a long moment to intimately connect with the Essence of your Multidimensional SELF. You have integrated that Essence of SELF into your Consciousness while in the Integration Chamber of the Violet Temple. You are now ready to integrate fifth/sixth dimensional SELF into your physical body, one chakra at a time.
Allow this Unconditional Love to enter your Crown Chakra and swirl around in your mind to expand your consciousness.
Now, permit the Unconditional Love to connect with your Brow Chakra and stimulate your Higher Vision.
As the Essence of your SELF enters your Throat Chakra, you feel an immense urge to create a new life.
Open your Heart Chakra to absorb the Unconditional Love, as well as the Unconditional Forgiveness and Acceptance that emanates from this Love. Take a moment to share these non-polarized Unconditional Emotions with all the 1st, 2nd and 3rd dimensional portions of your earth vessel.
Experience how your “Power Within” expands as your Solar Plexus Chakra accepts the Unconditional Love, Forgiveness and Acceptance from your opened heart and Higher SELF.
As these higher, unconditional feelings enter your Navel Chakra, your innate instincts and intuition are amplified.
Focus your expanded consciousness, higher vision, higher creativity, unconditionally loving heart, “power within,” and amplified instincts and intuition enter your Root Chakra.
As these multidimensional aspects of your SELF enter your Root Chakra, you instantly feel the force of Kundalini pulsating upwards towards her Divine Complement in your Crown. Lady Kundalini acknowledges your presence, but is single minded in her purpose. You feel your Lightbody anchored in your earth vessel through the coiled snake of Kundalini, and recognize the true Essence of your SELF that your Inner Lightbody protects.
Merge with your Lightbody by allowing it to coil around you. As you do so, the portal to the first and second dimensions opens. Down into the core of Mother Earth you go to ground your Light and to share it with me, Gaia. Into the Mineral Kingdom you travel. You experience yourself as the matrix within the crystal of my planet and the matrix for your first eight cells of this embodiment. All around you are consistent, repetitive geometric patterns which lead you deeper and deeper into the Crystal Kingdom of my planet and your person.
Deep inside my core now, you see and feel my crystal heart, pulsing the heartbeat of my planet. Your increased instincts make you aware that my heartbeat is gradually accelerating from seven cycles per second (cps) upwards towards 13 cps, which is the rate at which polarities will cease to exist.
You feel a flash of recognition from my heart, as I, Gaia, welcome you into the core of my heart. A small fragment of your Essence will remain here for all “time,” until time is no more and you and I, Gaia, ascend into our new fifth/sixth dimensional Home.
Gradually, you rise to my surface to commune with my second dimensional world. As you enter my deep underground caves, you are a bat hanging from the ceiling, as well as a drop of water flowing in my deep underground caves. You follow this flow on to the surface of my body and become a stream, a brook, a river. You are a fish, a tadpole, a frog.
As you jump onto the shore, you are the insect that the frog was pursuing, then the plant that you, the insect, is feeding on. Your reality is one in which all you DO is eat, mate, procreate, survive, and die. Your consciousness is very small, yet simultaneously connected with the body of my entire planet. You sense when it is about to rain, when the wind will blow, or when the sun is rising and setting. You don’t ponder these events, they just ARE. You do not think, you do not feel, you simply ARE.
Imagine your 3D human self now sitting upon my earth, beside a tree, or on a rock. Feel ALL the dimensions of life that you have just experienced inside your human earth vessel, as you welcome my Essence, the Essence of Gaia, entering the base of your spine. As you do so, allow me to assist in the recalibration of your Root Chakra.
Experience the sensation of being the first and second dimensional aspects of your physical body. You are your individual cells, and the atoms within each cell. Your first dimensional perspective allows you little consciousness of the external reality, yet it also ushers you into the quantum reality of unity with All That Is. You are a wormhole, a vortex, into all that can be imagined. Your consciousness now expands into the second dimension.
You are the organs of your body, independent in your casings, yet dependent on the entire body for life. You are your organs of procreation, your kidneys, your pancreas, your heart, your brain. Your first dimensional self connects all these organs through the hormones of your endocrine system, your blood and the molecules of oxygen that your blood carries.
You are your body, without thought or emotion. You are the physical form that holds your consciousness and your Multidimensional Essence. You are every organ, every bone, every cell, and every atom. You are your DNA. You are a chemical factory. Your first chakra activates adrenaline for survival—fight or flight—and testosterone for your masculine power source. Feel your Inner Warrior who is activated with these hormones.
Take a long moment to breathe your conscious awareness and personal Essence into EVERY portion of your body. FEEL your Inner Warrior within your Root Chakra as you emanate your Power of Initiation and Responsibility of Protection. Now breathe this Power and Responsibility down from the base of your spine, through your thighs, past your knees, down your calves, into your ankles, through your feet and deep into the earth to ground your Inner Warrior into your everyday life.
Your Inner Warrior gives you the courage to pursue what you want and protect your right to a happy life. If you have physical symptoms with your right hip, leg, knee, ankle or foot, your Inner Warrior is held back because you fear your own WILL. If you have problems with your left hip, leg, knee, ankle, or foot, your Inner Warrior is held back because you fear your INSTINCTS AND EMOTIONS. Use the courage of your Inner Warrior to confront these fears, and “Do It Anyway!”
Your first chakra also rules many of your eliminatory organs. Breathe into your Root Chakra again. Feel your Inner Warrior. What do you need to release so that you can move forward?
Because you are a warrior, you are brave enough to initiate the total transformation of your earth vessel. From the world of the first and second dimension, the higher dimensions seem far away, yet you are more in harmony with your true Essence than ever. There are no emotions to make you forget your SELF. There are no thoughts to distract you from your SELF. You simply ARE your SELF.
In your simplicity, you can embrace the perspective of total unity. You exist as an unbroken link in the chain that connects you with All That Is. You instinctively know that the polarities of the lower dimensions blur into one as the circle of life is completed. You feel a shift in your root chakra, an opening, a release of tension like turning on a faucet or a flicking on a light switch, the circuit that was once closed is now opened.
You are connected to All That Is AND you are connected to my planet. Remember to maintain your connection to your Lightbody that is coiled within the “snake” of your Kundalini. From within your Lightbody, which is within your physical body, welcome your Soul is the new Captain into the base of your spine, the ROOT of your earth vessel. Feel your ego step aside to “hand the reigns” over to your Soul—YOU! You are Soul who has NOW become Captain of your earth vessel. Your first assistant is your ego. The polarities of your ego’s “I” has blended into the unity of your Soul’s “WE.”
You are ONE with your Soul now and ONE with your SELF! In fact, you feel ONE with everyone, for as you recalibrate your First Chakra, the strong polarities of “I am” begin to blur into the unity of “we are.” The Arcturians will assist you with the “Blending of Polarities,” for they are the Ascension Masters. Their Arcturian Corridor is the primary portal into and out of the physical worlds. As guardians of this portal, they are immediately there when an individual, civilization, and/or planet approaches the “time” when they are ready to raise their resonance to the fifth dimension and beyond.
With each chakra that you recalibrate to the higher frequencies, another illusion of polarity blurs into the Oness of the higher frequencies. Because of this, I now introduce the Arcturians who will guide you through the “Blending of Polarities.”
I started with a base of neon pink by Yes Love (shade 17) and then applied a layer of fairy dust, also known as Kiko Sparkle Touch, shade 228.
I then stamped a full nail floral pattern using Easy Paris shade 48 and Bundle Monster plate BM 321. I smeared one of my nails when I applied my top coat but it wasn't at all noticeable in real life. I've been wearing this manicure for four days now and I still can't stop admiring it. Because the pattern is so big and bold it kind of makes me think of nail wraps :-)

I don’t want to start explaining what is “the internet of things” because it’s a really huge topic, but I’m here to share my first experience into connect an iOS device to a micro controller called Pinoccio and what that means.
Pinoccio at a first first look seems to be like a pumped Arduino with a WiFi shield and mesh radio communication. If you are wondering.. yes is compatible with the Arduino IDE and you can compile your own custom firmware, but do we really need that? Building a firmware with the Arduino IDE that include a network library, shield communication can be really frustrating, if you are not familiar with micro-controllers, is really a long hard road. For instance the memory is a big problem into creating a sort of web-server that can run into a micro-controller.
One of my first desire when I ‘ve got my first iPod Touch was to connect my device on everything and when I started to build my own applications using the iphone sdk, I always tried to figure out how to do that, but I’ve found huge obstacles that I wasn’t still prepared to tackle.
In the earlier realeses of iOS version wasn’t possible to connect the iphone to a sort of prototype board, well not exactly but I have should enroll to the made for iphone/ipod program and the process wasn’t really easy. The accessory framework had very few documentation available to the public. Now we can use the Bluetooth LE to connect with an accessory but it seems to be locked for 1:1 connection (but I’m not totally sure about it, for instance the multipeer connectivity can connect up to 8 devices).
Then I started to use Arduino a little, but the problem was still the connection between the 2 devices, the only option was using the ethernet shield, build something like a webserver and access Arduino pins with a sort of web services. Not so easy and also with a lot of limits about memory, bottlenecks etc in my mind I couldn’t find a way to do something that could be ready for production.
Later Redspark started to sell a cable (in compliance with the made for iphone program). With this cable is possible using the serial communication to make an Arduino talk with an ios device, but under current Apple policy this cable may not be used with apps sold on the App Store.
Then I’ve found ElectricImp, I was really interested into that project but when I heard that I would always need to stay bounded to their cloud platform I gave up, but the Imp is a really cool device if you accept that limitation (or feature).
You can create your own custom script (maybe because you need to communicate in a specific way with a sensor or peripheral)
The idea here is to send all your request to their (or yours) platform and read or write properties with simple calls on the the platform, and this is a reallu smart idea, because most probably the platform manages the traffic on the board, maybe also caching some responses, avoiding bottle necks or massive requests.
To make a simple example about how this board connected to you iOS device can be powerful, I’ve made an easy app that asks the on-board temperature of the two scouts.
We have a lead scout (Optimus Prime) with the Wi-Fi backpack on it and the other scout (Bumble Bee) that communicates through the lead scout.
The lead scout is installed in my home and the other outside – of course the on board temperature is not the real environment temperature because is due to the load of the CPU and the environment temperature itself-.
Let’s imagine that each scout has a Bluetooth LE backpack and a simple OLED display installed in a shoes shop. Each shoes has its own scout (like a price tag) with the display that shows the like/reviews numbers.
Each scout sends an iBeacon signal to identify a specific product close to them. When a user get close to the product using the shop application connects to that scout/ibeacon and get the product details, there is also the possibility to “like” it, once the use press like on the phone the like number on the display is incremented almost in real-time.
The other interesting example could be to measure the energy consumption of our house integrating a hall effect sensor on each scout and display data in a cool web page or into your mobile phone.
Arduino in my opinion created a revolution opening the market to all those boards, these is just the beginning because the revolution of the DIY is cultural and educational.
I hope to have more time to play around using Pinocc.io and this is the first time that I feel I have something “ready for production” and not just a new cool R&D gadget.

The definitive biography of the groundbreaking African American author who had an extraordinary legacy on black writers globally.
Chester B. Himes has been called “one of the towering figures of the black literary tradition” (Henry Louis Gates Jr.), “the best writer of mayhem yarns since Raymond Chandler” (San Francisco Chronicle), and “a quirky American genius” (Walter Mosely). He was the twentieth century’s most prolific black writer, captured the spirit of his times expertly, and left a distinctive mark on American literature. Yet today he stands largely forgotten.
In this definitive biography of Chester B. Himes (1909–1984), Lawrence P. Jackson uses exclusive interviews and unrestricted access to Himes’s full archives to portray a controversial American writer whose novels unflinchingly confront sex, racism, and black identity. Himes brutally rendered racial politics in the best-selling novel If He Hollers Let Him Go, but he became famous for his Harlem detective series, including Cotton Comes to Harlem. A serious literary tastemaker in his day, Himes had friendships—sometimes uneasy—with such luminaries as Ralph Ellison, Carl Van Vechten, and Richard Wright.
Jackson’s scholarship and astute commentary illuminates Himes’s improbable life—his middle-class origins, his eight years in prison, his painful odyssey as a black World War II–era artist, and his escape to Europe for success. More than ten years in the writing, Jackson’s biography restores the legacy of a fascinating maverick caught between his aspirations for commercial success and his disturbing, vivid portraits of the United States.
“Dr. Jackson has presented a much needed view of an important Harlem writer. I had the pleasure of knowing Chester and most of the folk he knew. He was fun. He was good looking. And he was a wonderful story teller. Chester struggled, as most writers do, with being himself. But when he opened the special door to ‘Chester,’ we all could peep inside to a special genius. He was old and I quite young when we met. He had a flashlight to let me see the way down what could have been a dark road. Chester Himes is to writing what Miles Davis is to the trumpet, what John Coltrane is to the saxophone, what lips are to love. I am so glad this research has been completed. Chester deserves this sun to cast his shadow over the library that is the hope of black Americans.” — Nikki Giovanni
“A riveting, one-of-a-kind tale of a writer who saw the subject of race from odd, revealing angles.” — Clifford Thompson, Wall Street Journal
“Chester B. Himes is a bracing journey through the life of an uncompromising writer.” — Michael P. Jeffries, New York Times Book Review
“Makes a convincing case for a writer who's always been something of a tough sell…Jackson memorably characterizes Himes' great gifts as a writer.” — Maureen Corrigan, NPR
“Jackson’s book—big, intelligent and unflinching—is what literary biography looks like when it’s done right.” — Kevin Canfield, San Francisco Chronicle

This is Thumper the mini-lop. I love bunnies. They are super duper cute and incredibly intelligent (for example Thumper has figured out how to climb into the vegetable tray when the fridge is open, pull out the carrot bag, pull out a single carrot and drag it to his hutch. Yep.) We got Thumper 1 1/2 years ago and I absolutely adore him. He took a while to warm up to his, but he's super cuddly now and loves getting long pats. He is a house bunny so his hutch (and Foofoo, our other wee bunny's) hutches are in our dining room, and we let them run around the house and the backyard to get their daily exercise. He is all fixed now so he and Foofoo (she is a girl, Thump is a boy) run around together and they are getting a new hutch soon that they can both snuggle in. Bunnies are kinda like a mix between a cat and a dog and they are such lovely companion pets. Both bunnies get along really well with Toto and Bob and are very sweet natured. He learns tricks really quickly, so far he knows to come when when we call him, he knows a command for when we want him to go back to his hutch, how to beg, and how to walk and beg at the same time(that on is my favourite, sooo cute) So that's my Thumpy bun. Next... Foofoo post
I live in Christchurch, New Zealand with my husband, our wee newborn son Romeo, and our beloved animals; They are Toto the bischon-poodle cross,and Thumper and Foofoo the bunnies. I love all things old fashioned and vintage.

The Japanese were already planning (within their means) at repelling the expected invasion, including to the point of giving people sharpened bamboo poles... according to the book "Operation Downfall"
Japanese naval superiority was largely a function of (a) surprise and (b) the Germans forcing part of the US fleet to stay in the Atlantic. At the beginning of the war, the US and Japanese had rough parity in naval forces (the Japs had more carriers, but only a few of them were comparable to the American bird farms), and if the Americans had been paying attention at Pearl, Yamomoto's forces would have gotten pretty beat up. As soon as the Americans started to respond, the Japanese started to lose at sea.
On land, the Japanese advantage basically consisted of being in dug in defensive positions on a series of volcanic islands. You can call it "tough", or you can call it stupidity. They were never a significant offensive force against a well-equipped enemy.
Japanese had superior tactics, and one of the best fighters at that time (best, when confronting antiquated tactics; of getting into a dog-fight with the Zero)
Initially America had a lot of poor performing planes, including the Brewster F2A Buffalo, Douglas TBD Devastator.
America had inferior torpedoes, and poorer naval tactics regarding night fighting - as demonstrated at battles such as Savo Island.
Claire Chennault had, for the Flying Tigers a better set of aerial tactics using the same 'average performance' plane; the Kittyhawk.
But you aren't getting my point. What is the trade off? How effective would those sharpened sticks have been? They could throw wave after wave at us and so long as we were still willing to kill them, they'd run out of people eventually. We had the will to put a plan into effect that could have cost us the lives of half a million Americans. By that point I bet we could have pretty much eradicated the Japanese people from the face of the planet.
And it didn't really matter because now we are getting into real history rather than what-if's. The Emperor was tired of seeing his people die needlessly. We just needed to give him a good reason to surrender. Hiroshima and Nagasaki later, he did. With the Emporer went the people.
So what I am saying about kamikazis is, they didn't affect the US. They probably helped in bringing the war to a quicker conclusion with fewer Americans dead. Even if the Japanese didn't mind the loss, nor did we! And they lost more irreplaceable material than we did.

Given the push by some in the community to define gender as purely a social construct, it is helpful to consider the issue of gender identity from the perspective of the gospel. According to the Bible, back in the beginning, the human race only had two genders: male and female. Adam was a male human, and Eve a female human. The first chapter of the Bible makes this clear:
Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them (Gen 1:26–27).
As originally created by God, the human race had only two genders: male and female. This is something that we can assume was clear to Adam and Eve in the garden. We know that God created Adam first, but when God created Eve by fashioning a woman from Adam’s rib, Adam was aware of the difference. In fact, on seeing Eve, he exclaimed: “This at last is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of a man” (Gen 2:23). It is interesting that in Hebrew, man is pronounced ish, and woman is isha, where isha is simply the feminine form of ish. So in Hebrew thinking, a woman is simply a female human. A similar kind of logic also lies behind the English word woman. The most likely derivation of the word woman is from the compound wife-man, where the word wife originally meant simply a female human. So in both Hebrew and English a woman is a female human.
Adam and Eve would have been aware of the gender differences between themselves. After the creation of Eve, the biblical record in Gen 3 consistently distinguishes the man from the woman. The Bible is clear on the difference between the two, and we can assume that Adam and Eve also knew the difference, and were happy with the sex that God had assigned to each one respectively.
But if as originally created by God only two genders existed (male and female), and those genders corresponded to the physical sex of the person in question, why do we have certain people today who claim that gender is fluid, asserting that gender does not necessarily correspond to the physical sex of one’s body?
Firstly, sin has consequences for the genetic and hormonal health of humans. Some of these consequences can have the effect of confusing gender in a small number of situations. Adam and Eve in the garden did not suffer from any genetic problems; but outside the garden of Eden, genetic problems in the form of genetic mutations arose in the process of the transmission of genes from one generation to the next.
Scientifically speaking, physical sex is determined by the kind of sex chromosomes that a person has. A pair of X chromosomes means that you are female, whereas an X chromosome together with a Y chromosome means that you are male. However, in a small number of cases, the typical XX or XY chromosome situation may be affected by some kind of genetic mutation, leading to various intersex conditions, where there is some ambiguity in a person’s physical sexual identity. Most times when this happens, a person is either XX or XY, but the hormones that are responsible for male or female sexual development do not kick in as expected. In addition, in rare situations, a person might be born with a genetic condition that is neither XX or XY. It is possible to be XXX or XYY. These particular conditions do not normally create any problems. However, it is also possible for a person to be XXY, XXXY, XXXXY, XO, XX male, and XY female. These conditions are more problematic.
Living in a fallen world, it is a fact that a small minority of people might suffer from an intersex condition, where our chromosomes or hormones might not function as they should. In such situations, it should be left up to the parents in consultation with the medical professionals to work out what gender (if any) a particular child should identify with. At the same time, it needs to be acknowledged that these are exceptional situations. In the vast majority of circumstances, humans are either XX female, or XY male. It is important for Christians to be aware that some people, through no fault of their own, might have been born with an intersex condition. Such situations should be treated with understanding, compassion, and concern.
However, it is necessary to distinguish between intersex conditions that have some objective basis in biology versus intersex conditions that are purely the result of a distorted way of thinking about gender. which brings us to the second way in which sin affects human gender.
The Bible teaches that sin also results in distorted and unnatural thinking about sexuality, which includes mental confusion about gender. For example, In Rom 1 the Apostle Paul identifies some of the consequences of sin on human thinking. Sin results in futile thinking and foolish, darkened hearts, and this impacts upon human sexuality through unnatural thinking regarding sex (Rom 1:21). One of the effects of sin is that human thinking is often characterized by stupidity. And the concept of gender fluidity is an excellent example of such irrationality.
If you are genetically XX and have all of the standard female body parts, then it flies in the face of biology and the gender that God has graciously gifted you to pretend that you are not female. Likewise, if you are genetically XY and have all of the standard male body parts, you should not pretend to be anything other than a man. Boys should be boys, and girls should be girls. It is not for us to pretend to be what we are not according to God’s design.
The idea of accepting the gender that God has given you found expression in the law of Moses. Deuteronomy 22:5 legislated that “a woman shall not wear a man’s garment, nor shall a man put on a woman’s cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord your God.” Our Creator clearly does not accept that men should pretend to be women, or vice versa. Having created two genders (male and female), clearly God does not want that distinction to be blurred.
Overall, we can say that the fall of the human race has introduced an element of gender confusion into what was originally a system of two clearly distinct genders. But it is significant at this point to realize that redemption in Jesus affects the issue of human gender in three major ways.
The first difference that Jesus makes is that as he saves us, he sanctifies us so that we can start thinking correctly about gender. Instead of having darkened minds, we can start to have clarity on the issue, and understand that there are fundamentally only two genders for the human race, the male gender and the female gender; and that these correspond (in normal circumstances) to the physical gender of our body as it has been assigned to us by God. The concept of gender fluidity is not just irrational; it also constitutes a rejection of God, and it is not consistent with how we should be thinking about gender as people who have been saved by Christ. If you pretend that you are a female even though God has created you as a male, then that is a form of idolatry. It is wrong for us to refuse to accept the gender that God has given us, which is the gender that in the vast majority of situations is obvious from the design of our body, and is written on our birth certificate.
Secondly, redemption in Jesus has implications for those who unfortunately suffer with a genuine intersex condition. Jesus has come to set us free from all of our genetic imperfections. He has come to heal all of our diseases. For those Christians who find themselves with a genuine intersex problem, Jesus promises therapeutic benefits. He promises to heal you of your condition. On the day of resurrection, your imperfect genes or chromosomes will be replaced by a perfect set of genetic material, and you will be the person that God has intended you to be, either male or female. In this way, Jesus gives hope to everyone who is genuinely suffering from an intersex condition, who turns to him in faith.
Thirdly, redemption in Jesus also helps to put the issue of gender identity into eternal perspective. Even though the Bible suggests that male and female will still exist in the kingdom of heaven after the day of resurrection, in the end, the Bible also tells us that salvation in Jesus means that the difference between male or female (which is so important and fundamental to each individual’s self-understanding in this life) will lose its significance in the world to come. Jesus teaches in Matt 22:30 that marriage is only for this life. In the resurrection, humans “neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven,” which in their right station do not engage in sexual activity. In other words, redemption in Jesus ultimately renders the distinction between the sexes useless. Redemption does not do away with gender or remove distinctions between gender, but it will ultimately consign those differences to human history. In the new heavens and the new earth, it will not matter whether you are male or female. More than anything else, we all will be human. There will be a unity between the two different genders based on our common humanity which has been saved and sanctified through Jesus.
Overall, we need to realize that the modern trendy talk of gender fluidity and gender queer is basically nonsense from God’s perspective. It is really just a perfect example of how human pride and autonomy can lead us into irrationality. The Bible rejects all such talk of gender fluidity. What it promotes instead is a fundamental gender staticity. In the beginning it was Adam and Eve, male and female. The original situation was gender static, not gender fluid. The original static situation has been confused to some extent as a result of the fall, but redemption in Jesus means the restoration of gender clarity in the context of an overarching unity of male and female, who in Christ share in a common humanity. In the vast majority of cases, our wobbly bits (to quote a phrase) determine our gender, and that is simply the way that God has made us. Instead of indulging in biological fancy, the vast majority of us who are either XX or XY should wholeheartedly accept the gender that God has graciously given us at conception: female if XX, and male if XY.
I don’t know about you, but back when I was growing up there were only two genders, male and female. But these days, apparently, gender identity is not so simple. Following on from the sexual revolution of the 1960s, feminist-inspired social scientists in the 1970s challenged the traditional view that a person’s gender reflects a person’s physical sex. The traditional view that boys are boys and girls are girls was replaced with a view that believes that gender is a social construct, that gender differences are basically just an invention of society.
The view that gender is just a social construct that is potentially subject to change is held by increasing numbers of people today. And so we have a significant number of people in Western nations in particular who subscribe to the view that gender is a person’s self-representation as either male or female or anything in between, depending on how that person feels. As a result, you do not have to go far these days to hear people talking about being gender diverse, gender fluid, inter-gender, gender neutral, a-gender, non-gendered, non-binary, gender queer, or bi-gender.
The most famous gender fluid person in the world today is probably Miley Cyrus. The girl who became famous in the role of Hannah Montana now describes herself as being gender fluid. To quote Cyrus, gender “has nothing to do with any parts of me or how I dress or how I look. It’s literally just how I feel.”
And it is not just sexually emancipated American celebrities who are promoting this kind of view. Here in Australia, gender fluidity has seemingly become a concept that is politically correct. This can be seen especially in the agenda of the ironically named Safe Schools Coalition, which (as of 28 February 2016) boasts that they have 515 schools signed up to their program, over 15,000 trained school staff, covering over 400,000 students. Taking a leaf out of the book of the advocates for marriage equality, they have chosen a positive but polarizing term by which to identify their organization, a name that implies that anyone who opposes their views must be in favor of unsafe schools. But regardless of their name, it is necessary to recognize their agenda, and to bring it under scrutiny. Just how safe or healthy are the policies of the Safe Schools Coalition?
A quick perusal of the resources page of the Safe Schools Coalition website is enough to understand their agenda. “Gender is not uniform,” they say, meaning boys can wear girls’ uniforms if they want to, and vice versa; or as they say: “everyone should be able to wear the uniform that makes them comfortable.” What though if a certain student feels more comfortable not wearing any uniform at all? What’s to say that that also isn’t a valid option? They also call upon students to “Stand out” against discrimination based on gender. They proclaim that “Change is coming.” Now that their program has arrived at your school, apparently everyone will be safe! They also promote LGBTI-friendly activities in school, such as “Our school is celebrating IDAHOT” where IDAHOT stands for the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia. They even suggest that students can celebrate IDAHOT by wearing rainbow colors to school, or by dressing up as a queer for a day. Furthermore, they advocate making your school safe by being more inclusive of gender diversity such as asking what pronouns students want to be called by (whether he, she, e, or ze). Students are also actively recruited by this program to promote the concept of gender fluidity through various means within the school community. For example, students are encouraged to put up posters with messages such as “It’s okay to be gay,” and to promote discussion about gender inclusivity by inserting equal marriage rights into school assignments, or by getting guest speakers who support LBGTI issues to address the school assembly.
The Safe Schools Coalition website also features prominently materials produced by Minus18, which claims to be “Australia’s largest youth-led organisation for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transexual youth.” A booklet created by Minus18 called OMG I’m Queer tells teenagers that “Sex is your physical aspects (ie your wibbly wobbly bits),” but “Gender … is how you feel in your mind” in terms of your sexuality. It goes on to say that what gender label a person uses to describe himself, herself, or zemself is totally “up to you.”
The overall message of the Safe Schools Coalition is: “Believe what you want, and be who you want to be. If you want to be a boy, then be a boy. If you want to be girl, then be a girl. If you want to be something else, then that is totally up to you, and everyone should respect your choice.”
The views of the Safe School Coalition are a great example of the idea of sexual freedom taken to the nth degree, but the amazing thing is that this is being taught in schools across Australia with government approval and support in the way of funding. Overall, the doctrine of gender fluidity is the latest example of political correctness that totally rejects biological and biblical norms. The wider community will definitely be hearing more about gender fluidity in the years to come, and Christians need to be aware of this growing sexual radicalism.

Something delayed the arrival of the Wesleyan minister, and a young man came temporarily in his stead. It was the thirteenth of January, 18—, that Mr. Stockdale, the young man in question, made his humble entry into the village, unknown, and almost unseen. But when those of the inhabitants who styled themselves of his connection became acquainted with him, they were rather pleased with the substitute than otherwise, though he had scarcely as yet acquired ballast of character sufficient to steady the consciences of the hundred and forty Methodists of pure blood who, at this time, lived in Nether-Mynton, and to give in addition supplementary support to the mixed race which went to church in the morning and chapel in the evening, or when there was a tea—as many as a hundred and ten people more, all told, and including the parish-clerk in the winters time, when it was too dark for the vicar to observe who passed up the street at seven ‘o clock—which, to be just to him, he was never anxious to do.
It was owing to his overlapping of creeds that the celebrated population-puzzle arose among the denser gentry of the district around Nether-Mynton; how could it be that a parish containing fifteen score of strong, full-grown Episcopalians, and nearly thirteen score of well-matured Dissenters, numbered barely two-and-twenty score adults in all?
The young man being personally interesting those with whom he came in contact were content to waive for a while the graver question of his sufficiency. It is said that at this time of his life his eyes were affectionate, though without a ray of levity; that his hair was curly, and his figure tall; that he was, in short, a very lovable youth, who won upon his female hearers as soon as they saw and heard him, and caused them to say, “Why didn't we know of this before he came, that we might have gied him a warmer welcome!”
The fact was that, knowing him to be only provisionally selected, and expecting nothing remarkable in his person or doctrine, they and the rest of his flock in Nether-Mynton had felt almost as indifferent about his advent as if they had been the soundest church-going parishioners in the country, and he their true and appointed parson. Thus when Stockdale set foot in the place nobody had secured a lodging for him, and though his journey had given him a bad cold in the head, he was forced to attend to that business himself. On inquiry he found that the only possible accommodation in the village would be found at the house of one Mrs. Lizzy Newberry, at the upper end of the street.
The boy said that she was a widow-woman, who had got no husband, because he was dead. Mr. Newberry, he added, had been a well-to-do man enough, as the saying was, and a farmer; but be had gone off in a decline. As regarded Mrs. Newberry’s serious side, Stockdale gathered that she was one of the trimmers who went to church and chapel both.
“I'll go there,” said Stockdale, feeling that, in the absence of purely sectarian lodgings, bo could do no better.
“She's a little particular, and won't hae gover’ment folks, or curates, or the pa’son’s friends, or such like,” said the lad, dubiously.
“Ah, that may be a promising sign. I'll call. Or no; just you go up and ask first if she can find room for me. I have to see one or two persons on another matter. You will find me down to the carrier's.”
In a quarter of an hour the lad came back, and said that Mrs. Newberry would have no objection to accommodate him, whereupon Stockdale called at the house. It stood within a garden hedge, and seemed to be roomy and comfortable. He saw an elderly woman, with whom he made arrangements to come the same night, since there was no inn in the place, and he wished to house himself as soon as possible; the village being a local center from which he was to radiate at once to the different small chapels in the neighborhood. He forthwith sent his luggage to Mrs. Newberry’s from the carrier's, where he had taken shelter, and in the evening walked up to his temporary home.
As he now lived there, Stockdale felt it unnecessary to knock at the door; and entering quietly, he had the pleasure of hearing footsteps scudding away like mice into the back quarters. He advanced to the parlor, as the front room was called, though its stone floor was scarcely disguised by the carpet, which overlaid only the trodden areas, leaving sandy deserts under the furniture. But the room looked snug and cheerful. The firelight shone out brightly, trembling on the bulging moldings of the table-legs, playing with brass knobs and handles, and lurking in great strength on the under surface of the chimney-piece. A deep arm-chair, covered with horse-hair, and studded with a countless throng of brass nails, was pulled up on one side of the fireplace. The tea-things were on the table, the teapot cover was open, and a little hand-bell had been laid at that precise point toward which a person seated in the great chair might be expected instinctively to stretch his hand.
Stockdale sat down, not objecting to his experience of the room thus far, and began his residence by tinkling the bell. A little girl crept in at the summons, and made tea for him. Her name, she said, was Marther Sarer, and she lived out there, nodding toward the road and village generally. Before Stockdale had got far with his meal a tap sounded on the door behind him, and on his telling the inquirer to come in, a rustle of garments caused him to turn his head. He saw before him a fine and extremely well­made young woman, with dark hair, a wide, sensible, beautiful forehead, eyes that warmed him before he knew it, and a mouth that was in itself a picture to all appreciative souls.
“Can I get you anything else for tea?” she said, coming forward a step or two, an expression of liveliness on her features, and her hand waving the door by its edge.
“Nothing, thank you,” said Stockdale, thinking less of what he replied than of what might be her relation to the household.
He conscientiously examined the tea-things, and found them all there. “Quite sure, Miss Newberry,” he said.
Stockdale remained in some doubt till Martha Sarah came to clear the table. “Whose house is this, my little woman?” said he.
“No. That's Mrs. Newberry’s mother. It was Mrs. Newberry who comed in to you just by now, because she wanted to see if you was good-looking.”
Later in the evening, when Stockdale was about to begin supper, she came again. “I have come myself, Mr. Stockdale,” she said. The minister stood up in acknowledgment of the honor. “I am afraid little Marther might not make you understand. What will you have for supper? There's cold rabbit, and there's a ham uncut.”
Stockdale said he could get on nicely with those viands, and supper was laid. He had no more than cut a slice when tap-tap came to the door again. The minister had already learned that this particular rhythm in taps denoted the fingers of his enkindling landlady, and the doomed young fellow buried his first mouthful under a look of receptive blandness.
“We have a chicken in the house, Mr. Stockdale; I quite forgot to mention it just now. Perhaps you would like Marther Sarer to bring it up?”
Stockdale had advanced far enough in the art of being a young man to say that he did not want the chicken, unless she brought it up herself but when it was uttered he blushed at the daring gallantry of the speech, perhaps a shade too strong for a serious man and a minister. In three minutes the chicken appeared, but, to his great surprise, only in the hands of Martha Sarah. Stockdale was disappointed, which perhaps it was intended that he should be.
He had finished supper, and was not in the least anticipating Mrs. Newberry again that night, when she tapped and entered as before.
Stockdale's gratified look told that she had lost nothing by not appearing when expected. It happened that the cold in the head from which the young man suffered had increased with the approach of night, and before she had spoken he was seized with a violent fit of sneezing, which he could not anyhow repress.
“And I've a good mind—” she added, archly, looking at the cheerless glass of water on the table, which the abstemious young minister was going to drink.
“Well,” said Stockdale, looking down at the glass, “as there is no inn here, and nothing better to be got in the village, of course it will do.”
To this she replied, “There is something better, not far off, though not in the house. I really think you must try it, or you may be ill. Yes, Mr. Stockdale, you shall.” She held up her finger, seeing that he was about to speak. “Don't ask what it is; wait, and you shall see.”
Lizzy went away, and Stockdale waited in a pleasant mood. Presently she returned with her bonnet and cloak on, saying, “I am so sorry, but you must help me to get it. Mother has gone to bed. Will you wrap yourself up, and come this way, and please bring that cup with you?”
Stockdale, a lonely young fellow; who had for weeks felt a great craving for somebody on whom to throw away superfluous interest, and even tenderness, was not sorry to join her, and followed his guide through the back door, across the garden to the bottom, where the boundary was a wall. This wall was low, and beyond it Stockdale discerned in the night-shades several gray headstones, and the outlines of the church roof or tower.
“It is easy to get up this way,” she said, stepping upon a bank which abutted on the wall; then putting her foot on the top of the stone-work, and descending by a spring inside, where the ground was much higher, as is the manner of grave-yards to be. Stockdale did the same, and followed her in the dusk across the irregular ground till they came to the tower door, which, when they had entered, she softly closed behind them.
Then from under her cloak she produced a small lighted lantern, which the minister had not noticed that she carried at all. The light showed them to be close to the singing-gallery stairs, under which lay a heap of lumber of all sorts, but consisting mostly of decayed framework, pews, panels, and pieces of flooring, that from time to time had been removed from their original fixings in the body of the edifice and replaced by new.
“Perhaps you will drag some of those boards aside?” she said, holding the lantern over her head to light him better. “Or will you take the lantern while I move them?”
“I can manage it,” said the young man; and acting as she ordered, he uncovered, to his surprise, a row of little barrels bound with wood hoops, each barrel being about as large as the nave of a common wagon-wheel. When they were laid open Lizzy fixed her eyes on him, as if she wondered what he would say.
“Yes, barrels,” said Stockdale, simply. He was an inland man, the son of highly respectable parents, and brought up with a single eye to the ministry, and the sight suggested nothing beyond the fact that such articles were there.
“You are quite right; they are barrels,” she said, in an emphatic tone of candor that was not without a touch of irony.
“Yes,” said she. “They are tubs of spirits that have accidentally come over in the dark from France.”
In Nether-Mynton and its vicinity at this date people always smiled at the sort of sin called in the outside world illicit trading, and these little tubs of gin and brandy were as well known to the inhabitants as turnips. So that Stockdale's innocent ignorance, and his look of alarm when he guessed the sinister mystery, seemed to strike Lizzy first as ludicrous, and then as very awkward for the good impression that she wished to produce upon him.
“Smuggling is carried out here by some of the people,” she said, in a gentle, apologetic voice. “It has been their practice for generations, and they think it no harm. Now, will you roll out one of the tubs?”
“To draw a little from it to cure your cold,” she answered. “It is so burning strong that it drives away that sort of thing in a jiffy. Oh, it is all right about our taking it. I may have what I like; the owner of the tubs says so. I ought to have had some in the house, and then I shouldn't ha’ been put to this trouble; but I drink none myself, and so I often forget to keep it indoors.”
“I will, to oblige you, since you have a right to it,” murmured the minister; and though he was not quite satisfied with his part in the performance, he rolled one of the tubs out from the corner into the middle of the tower floor. “How do you wish me to get it out—with a gimlet, I suppose?”
“No; I'll show you,” said his interesting companion. And she held up with her other hand a shoemaker's awl and a hammer. “You must never do these things with a gimlet, because the wood-dust gets in; and when the buyers pour out the brandy, that would tell them that the tub had been broached. An awl makes no dust, and the hole nearly closes up again. Now tap one of the hoops forward.”
“Oh yes, it will,” said she. “Take the tub between your knees and squeeze the heads, and I'll hold the cup.”
Stockdale obeyed; and the pressure taking effect upon the tub, which seemed to be thin, the spirits spurted out in a stream. When the cup was full he ceased pressing, and the flow immediately stopped. “Now we must fill up keg with water,” said Lizzy, “or it will look like forty hens when it is handled, and show that ’tis not full.”
“Yes, the smugglers; but the buyers must not know that the smugglers have been kind to me at their expense.”
By her direction be held the tub with the hole upward, and while he went through the process of alternately pressing and ceasing to press she produced a bottle of water, from which she took mouthfuls, then putting her pretty lips to the hole, where it was sucked in at each recovery of the cask from pressure. When it was again full be plugged the hole, knocked the hoop down to its place, and buried the tub in the lumber as before.
“They have put you into a very awkward corner,” said Stockdale, emphatically. “You must, of course, as an honest person, sometimes feel that it is your duty to inform—really, you must.”
“Well, I have never particularly felt it as a duty; and, besides, my first husband—” She stopped, and there was some confusion in her voice. Stockdale was so honest and unsophisticated that he did not at once discern why she paused; but at last he did perceive that the words were a slip, and that no women would have uttered “first husband” by accident unless she had thought pretty frequently of a second. He felt for her confusion, and allowed her time to recover and proceed. “My husband,” she said, in a self-corrected tone, “used to know of their doings, and so did my father, and kept the secret. I cannot inform, in fact, against anybody.”
“I see the hardness of it,” he continued, like a man who looked far into the moral of things. “And it is very cruel that you should be tossed and tantalized between your memories and your conscience. I do hope, Mrs. Newberry, that you will soon see your way out of this unpleasant position.”
By this time they had passed over the wall and entered the house, where she brought him a glass and hot water, and left him to his own reflections. He looked after her vanishing form, asking himself whether he, as a respectable man, and a minister, and a shining light, even though as yet only of the halfpenny-candle sort, were quite justified in doing this thing. A sneeze settled the question; and he found that when the fiery liquor was lowered by the addition of twice or thrice the quantity of water, it was one of the prettiest cures for a cold in the head that he had ever known, particularly at this chilly time of the year.
Stockdale sat in the deep chair about twenty minutes sipping and meditating, till he at length took warmer views of things, and longed for the morrow, when he would see Mrs. Newberry again. He then felt that, though chronologically at a short distance, it would, in an emotional sense, be very long before to-morrow came, and walked restlessly round the room. His eye was attracted by a framed and glazed sampler in which a running ornament of fir-trees and peacocks surrounded the following pretty bit of sentiment:
Before he had done thinking that no other name from Abigail to Zenobia would have suited his young landlady so well, tap-tap came again upon the door; and the minister started as her face appeared yet another time, looking so disinterested that the most ingenious would refrained from asserting that she had come to affect his feelings by her seductive eyes.
The minister, being still a little pricked in the conscience for countenancing her in watering the spirits, saw here a way to self-chastisement.
“No, I thank you,” he said, firmly; “it is not necessary. I have never been used to one in my life, and it would be giving way to luxury too far.”
“Then I won't insist,” she said, and disconcerted him by vanishing instantly. Wondering if she was vexed by his refusal, he wished that he had chosen to have a fire, even though it should have scorched him out of bed and endangered his self-discipline for a dozen days. However, he consoled himself with what was in truth a rare consolation for a budding lover, that he was under the same roof with Lizzy—her guest, in fact, to take a poetical view of the term lodger; and that he would certainly see her on the morrow.
The morrow came, and Stockdale rose early, his cold quite gone. He had never in his life so longed for the breakfast-hour as he did that day, and punctually at eight o'clock, after a short walk, to reconnoiter the premises, he re-entered the door of his dwelling. Breakfast passed, and Martha Sarah attended, but nobody came voluntarily as on the night before to inquire if there were other wants which he had not mentioned, and which she would attempt to gratify. He was disappointed, and went out, hoping to see her at dinner. Dinner-time came; he sat down to the meal, finished it, lingered on for a whole hour, although two new teachers were at that moment waiting at the chapel door to speak to him by appointment. It was useless to wait longer, and he slowly went his way down the lane, cheered by the thought that, after all, he would see her in the evening, and perhaps engage again in the delightful tub-broaching in the neighboring church tower, which proceeding he resolved to render more moral by steadfastly insisting that no water should be introduced to fill up, though the tub should cluck like all the hens in Christendom. But nothing could disguise the fact that it was a queer business; and his countenance fell when he thought how much more his mind was interested in that matter than in his serious duties.
However, compunction vanished with the decline of day. Night came, and his tea and supper; but no Lizzy Newberry, and no sweet temptations. At last the minister could bear it no longer, and said to his quaint little attendant, “Where is Mrs. Newberry to-day?” judiciously handing a penny as he spoke.
“Anything serious happened?” he asked, handing another penny, and revealing yet additional pennies in the background.
“Oh no, nothing at all!” said she, with breathless confidence. “Nothing ever happens to her. She's only biding upstairs in bed, because ’tis her way sometimes.”
Being a young man of some honor, he would not question further, and assuming that Lizzy must have a bad headache, or other slight ailment, in spite of what the girl had said, he went to bed dissatisfied, not even setting eyes on old Mrs. Simpkins. “I said last night that I should see her to-morrow,” he reflected; “but that was not to be.”
Next day he had better fortune, or worse, meeting her at the foot of the stairs in the morning, and being favored by a visit or two from her during the day—once for the purpose of making kindly inquiries about his comfort, as on the first evening, and at another time to place a bunch of winter-violets on his table, with a promise to renew them when they drooped. On these occasions there was something in her smile which showed how conscious she was of the effect she produced, though it must be said that it was rather a humorous than a designing consciousness, and savored more of pride than of vanity.
As for Stockdale, he clearly perceived that he possessed unlimited capacity for backsliding, and wished that tutelary saints were not denied to Dissenters. He set a watch upon his tongue and eyes for the space of one hour and a half, after which he found it was useless to struggle further, and gave himself up to the situation. “The other minister will be here in a month,” he said to himself when sitting over the fire. “Then I shall be off, and she will distract my mind no more! . . . And then, shall I go on living by myself forever? No; when my two years of probation are finished, I shall have a furnished house to live in, with a varnished door and a brass knocker; and I'll march straight back to her, and ask her flat, as soon as the last plate is on the dresser!”
Thus a titillative fortnight was passed by young Stockdale, during which time things proceeded much as such matters have done ever since the beginning of history. He saw the object of attachment several times one day, did not see her at all the next, met her when he least expected to do so, missed her when hints and signs as to where she should be at a given hour almost amounted to an appointment. This mild coquetry was perhaps fair enough under the circumstances of their being so closely lodged, and Stockdale put up with it as philosophically as he was able. Being in her own house, she could, after vexing or disappointing him of her presence, easily win him back by suddenly surrounding him with those little attentions which her position as his landlady put it in her power to bestow. When he had waited indoors half the day to see her, and on finding that she would not be seen, had gone off in a huff to the dreariest and dampest walk he could discover, she would restore equilibrium in the evening with “Mr. Stockdale, I have fancied you must feel draught o’ nights from your bedroom window, and so I have been putting up thicker curtains this afternoon while you were out.” or “I noticed that you sneezed twice again this morning, Mr. Stockdale. Depend upon it, that cold is hanging about you yet; I am sure it is—I have thought of it continually; and you must let me make a posset for you.”
Sometimes in coming home he found his sitting-room rearranged, chairs placed where the table had stood, and the table ornamented with the few fresh flowers and leaves that could be obtained at this season, so as to add a novelty to the room. At times she would be standing in a chair outside the house, trying to nail up a branch of the monthly rose which the winter wind had blown down; and of course he stepped forward to assist her, when their hands got mixed in passing the shreds and nails. Thus they became friends again after a disagreement. She would utter on these occasions some pretty and deprecatory remark on the necessity of her troubling him anew; and he would straightway say that he would do a hundred times as much for her if she should so require.
Matters being in this advanced state, Stockdale was rather surprised one cloudy evening, while sitting in his room, at hearing her speak in low tones of expostulation to some one at the door. It was nearly dark, but the shutters were not yet closed, nor the candles lighted; and Stockdale was tempted to stretch his head toward the window. He saw outside the door a young man in clothes of a whitish color, and upon reflection judged their wearer to be the well-built and rather handsome miller who lived below. The miller's voice was alternately low and firm, and sometimes it reached the level of positive entreaty; but what the words were Stockdale could in no way hear.
Before the colloquy had ended, the minister's attention was attracted by a second incident. Opposite Lizzy's home grew a clump of laurels, forming a thick and permanent shade. One of the laurel boughs now quivered against the light background of sky, and in a moment the head of a man peered out, and remained still. He seemed to be also much interested in the conversation at the door, and was plainly lingering there to watch and listen. Had Stockdale stood in any other relation to Lizzy than that of a lover, he might have gone out and examined I into the meaning of this; but being as yet but an unprivileged ally, he did nothing more than stand up and show himself in the lighted room, whereupon the listener disappeared, and Lizzy and the miller spoke in lower tones.
Stockdale was made so uneasy by the circumstance that as soon as the miller was gone, he said, “Mrs. Newberry, are you aware that you were watched just now, and your conversation heard?”
‘When you were talking to that miller. A man was looking from the laurel-tree as jealously as if he could have eaten you”
She showed more concern than the trifling event seemed to demand, and he added, “Perhaps you were talking of things you did not wish to be overheard?”
“Lizzy, be frank!” said the young man. “If it was only on business, why should anybody wish to listen to you?”
“Ah, yes,” she said, smiling in spite of her preoccupation. “Well, Cousin Owlett has spoken to me about matrimony, every now and then, that's true; but he was not speaking of it then. I wish he had been speaking of it, with all my heart. It would have been much less serious for me.”
“It would. Not that I should ha’ chimed in with him, of course. I wish it for other reasons. I am glad, Mr. Stockdale, that you have told me of that listener. It is a timely warning, and I must see my cousin again.”
“But don't go away till I have spoken,” said the minister. “I'll out with it at once, and make no more ado. Let it be Yes or No between us. Lizzy, please do!” And he held out his hand, in which she freely allowed her own to rest, but without speaking.
“Because I am thinking—thinking of something else,” she said, with embarrassment. “It all comes upon me at once, and I must settle one thing at a time.”
“At any rate, dear Lizzy, you can assure me that the miller shall not be allowed to speak to you except on business? You have never directly encouraged him?”
She parried the question by saying, “You see, he and his party have been in the habit of leaving things on my premises sometimes, and as I have not denied him, it makes him rather forward.”
“You are too timid. It is unfair of him to impose so upon you, and get your good name into danger by his smuggling tricks. Promise me that the next time he wants to leave his tubs here you will let me roll them into the street?”
She shook her head. “I would not venture to offend the neighbors so much as that,” said she, “or do anything that would be so likely to put poor Owlett into the hands of the exciseman.”
Stockdale sighed, and said that he thought hers a mistaken generosity when it extended to assisting those who cheated the king of his dues.
“At any rate, you will let me make him keep his distance as your lover, and tell him flatly that you are not for him?”
“Please not, at present,” she said. “I don't wish to offend my old neighbors. It is not only Owlett who is concerned.”
“On my honor, I won't encourage him as my lover,” Lizzy answered, earnestly. “A reasonable man will be satisfied with that.”
Stockdale now began to notice more particularly a feature in the life of his fair landlady which he had casually observed, but scarcely ever thought of before. It was that she was markedly irregularly in her hours of rising. For a week or two she would be tolerably punctual, reaching the ground-floor within a few minutes of half­past seven; then suddenly she would not be visible till twelve at noon, perhaps for three or four days in succession; and twice he had certain proof that she did not leave her room till half­past three in the afternoon. The second time that this extreme lateness came under his notice was on a day when he had particularly wished to consult with her about his future movements; and he concluded, as he always had done, that she had a cold, headache, or other ailment unless she had kept herself invisible to avoid meeting and talking to him, which he could hardly believe. The former supposition was disproved, however, by her innocently saying, some days later; when they were speaking on a question of health, that she had never had a moment's heaviness, headache, or illness of any kind since the previous January twelvemonth.
“What, do I look sickly?” she asked, turning up her face to show the impossibility of his gazing on it and holding such a belief for a moment.
“Not at all; I merely thought so from your being sometimes obliged to keep your room through the best part of the day.”
“Oh, as for that, it means nothing,” she murmured, with a look which some might have called cold, and which was the look that he worst liked to see upon her. “It is pure sleepiness, Mr. Stockdale.”
“It is, I tell you. When I stay in my room till half-past three in the afternoon you may always be sure that I slept soundly till three, or I shouldn't have stayed there.”
“It is dreadful,” said Stockdale, thinking of the disastrous effects of such indulgence upon the household of a minister, should it become a habit of every-day occurrence.
“But then,” she said, divining his good and prescient thoughts, “it happens only when I stay awake all night. I don't go to sleep till five or six in the morning sometimes.”
“Oh no, there is no need for doing that; it is all natural to me.” And she went away without further remark.
Stockdale might have waited a long time to know the real cause of her sleeplessness had it not happened that one dark night he was sitting in his bedroom jotting down notes for a sermon, which unintentionally occupied him for a considerable time after the other members of the household had retired. He did not get to bed till one o'clock. Before he had fallen asleep he heard a knocking at the door, first rather timidly performed, and then louder. Nobody answered it, and the person knocked again. As the house still remained undisturbed, Stockdale got out of bed, went to his window, which overlooked the door, and opening it, asked who was there.
A young woman's voice replied that Susan Wallis was there, and that she had come to ask if Mrs. Newberry could give her some mustard to make a plaster with, as her father was taken very ill on the chest.
The minister, having neither bell nor servant, was compelled to act in person. “I will call Mrs. Newberry,” he said. Partly dressing himself, he went along the passage and tapped at Lizzy's door. She did not answer, and, thinking of her erratic habits in the matter of sleep, he thumped the door persistently, when he discovered, by its moving ajar under his knocking, that it had only been gently pushed to. As there was now a sufficient entry for the voice, he knocked no longer, but said, in firm tones: “Mrs. Newberry, you are wanted.”
The room was quite silent; not a breathing, not a rustle, came from any part of it. Stock-dale now sent a positive shout through the open space of the door: “Mrs. Newberry!” still no answer, or movement of any kind within. Then he heard sounds from the opposite room, that of Lizzy's mother, as if she had been aroused by his uproar though Lizzy had not, and was dressing herself hastily. Stockdale softly closed the younger woman's door and went on to the other, which was opened by Mrs. Simpkins before he could reach it. She was in her ordinary clothes, and had a light in her hand.
“It is no matter,” said her mother. “I can let the girl have what she wants as well as my daughter.” And she came out of the room and went downstairs.
Stockdale retired toward his own apartment, saying, however, to Mrs. Simpkins from the landing, as if on second thoughts: “I suppose there is nothing the matter with Mrs. Newberry, that I could not wake her?”
Still the minister was not satisfied. “Will you go in and see?” he said. “I should be much more at ease.”
Mrs. Simpkins returned up the staircase, went to her daughter's room, and came out again almost instantly. “There is nothing at all the matter with Lizzy,” she said, and descended again to attend to the applicant, who, having seen the light, had remained quiet during this interval.
Stockdale went into his room and lay down as before. He heard Lizzy's mother open the front door, admit the girl, and then the murmured discourse of both as they went to the store-cupboard for the medicament required. The girl departed, the door was fastened, Mrs. Simpkins came upstairs, and the house was again in silence. Still the minister did not fall asleep. He could not get rid of a singular suspicion, which was all the more harassing, in beings if true, the most unaccountable thing within his experience. That Lizzy Newberry was in her bedroom when he made such a clamor at her door he could not possibly convince himself, notwithstanding that he had heard her come upstairs at the usual time, go into her chamber and shut herself up in the usual way. Yet all reason was so much against her being elsewhere that he was constrained to go back again to the unlikely theory of a heavy sleep, though he had heard neither breath nor movement during a shouting and knocking loud enough to rouse the Seven Sleepers.
Before coming to any positive conclusion he fell asleep himself, and did not awake till day. He saw nothing of Mrs. Newberry in the morning, before he went out to meet the rising sun, as he liked to do when the weather was fine; but as this was by no means unusual, he took no notice of it. At breakfast-time he knew that she was not far off by hearing her in the kitchen, and though he saw nothing of her person, that back apartment being rigorously closed against his eyes, she seemed to be talking, ordering, and bustling about among the pots and skimmers in so ordinary a manner that there was no reason for his wasting more time in fruitless surmise.
The minister suffered from these distractions, and his extemporized sermons were not improved thereby. Already he often said Romans for Corinthians in the pulpit, and gave out hymns in strange cramped meters that hitherto had always been skipped because the congregation could not raise a tune to fit them. He fully resolved that as soon as his few weeks of stay approached their end he would cut the matter short, and commit himself by proposing a definite engagement, repenting at leisure if necessary.
With this end in view, he suggested to her on the evening after her mysterious sleep that they should take a walk together just before dark, the latter part of the proposition being introduced that they might return home unseen. She consented to go; and away they went over a stile, to a shrouded foot-path suited for the occasion. But, in spite of attempts on both sides, they were unable to infuse much spirit into the ramble.
“You yawned—much my company is to you!” He put it in that way, but he was really wondering whether her yawn could possibly have more to do with physical weariness from the night before than mental weariness of that present moment. Lizzy apologized, and owned that she was rather tired, which gave him an opening for a direct question on the point; but his modesty would not allow him to put it to her, and he uncomfortably resolved to wait.
The month of February passed with alternations of mud and frost, rain and sleet, east winds and northwesterly gales. The hollow places in the plowed fields showed themselves as pools of water, which had settled there from the higher levels, and had not yet found time to soak away. The birds began to get lively, and a single thrush came just before sunset each evening, and sang hopefully on the large elm tree which stood nearest to Mrs. Newberry’s house. Cold blasts and brittle earth had given place to an oozing dampness more unpleasant in itself than frost; but it suggested coming spring, and its unpleasantness was of a bearable kind.
Stockdale had been going to bring about a practical understanding with Lizzy at least half a dozen times; but what with the mystery of her apparent absence on the night of the neighbor's call, and her curious way of lying in bed at unaccountable times, he felt a check within him whenever he wanted to speak out. Thus they still lived on as indefinitely affianced lovers, each of whom hardly acknowledged the other's claim to the name of chosen one. Stockdale persuaded himself that his hesitation was owing to the post­ponement of the ordained minister's arrival, and the consequent delay in his own departure, which did away with all necessity for haste in his courtship; but perhaps it was only that his discretion was re-asserting itself, and telling him that he had better get clearer ideas of Lizzy before arranging for the grand contract of his life with her. She, on her part, always seemed ready to be urged further on that question than he had hitherto attempted to go; but she was none the less independent, and to a degree which would have kept from flagging the passion of a far more mutable man.
On the evening of the first of March he went casually into his bedroom about dusk, and noticed lying on a chair a great-coat, hat and breeches. Having no recollection of leaving any clothes of his own in that spot, he went and examined them as well as he could in the twilight, and found that they did not belong to him. He paused for a moment to consider how they might have got there. He was the only man living in the house; and yet these were not his garments, unless he had made a mistake. No, they were not his. He called up Martha Sarah.
Martha said that Mrs. Newberry had given them to her to brush, and that she had brought them up there, thinking they must be Mr. Stockdale's, as there was no other gentleman a-lodging there.
“Of course you did,” said Stockdale. “Now take them down to your mis'ess, and say they are some clothes I have found here and know nothing about.”
As the door was left open he heard the conversation downstairs. “How stupid!” said Mrs. Newberry, in a tone of confusion. “Why, Marther Sarer, I did not tell you to take ’em to Mr. Stockdale's room!”
“You should have left ’em on the clothes’ horse,” said the young mistress, severely; and she came upstairs with the garments on her arm quickly passed Stockdale's room, and threw them forcibly into a closet at the end of a passage. With this the incident ended, and the house was silent again.
There would have been nothing remarkable in finding such clothes in a widow's house had they been clean, or moth-eaten, or creased, or mouldy from long lying by; but that they should be splashed with recent mud bothered Stockdale a good deal. When a young pastor is in the aspen stage of attachment, and open to agitation at the merest trifles, a really substantial incongruity of this complexion is a disturbing thing. However, nothing further occurred at that time; but he became watchful and given to conjecture, and was unable to forget the circumstance.
One morning, on looking from his window, he saw Mrs. Newberry herself brushing the tails of a long drab great-coat, which, if he mistook not, was the very same garment as the one that had adorned the chair of his room. It was densely splashed up to the hollow of the back with neighboring Nether-Mynton mud, to judge by its color, the spots being distinctly visible to him in the sunlight. The previous day or two having been wet, the inference was irresistible that the wearer had quite recently been walking some considerable distance about the lanes and fields. Stockdale opened the window and looked out, and Mrs. Newberry turned her head. Her face became slowly red; she never had looked prettier or more incomprehensible. He waved his hand affectionately, and said good-morning; she answered with embarrassment, having ceased her occupation on the instant that she saw him, and rolled up the coat half-cleaned.
Stockdale shut the window. Some simple explanation of her proceeding was doubtless within the bounds of possibility; but he himself could not think of one; and he wished that she had placed the matter beyond conjecture by voluntarily saying something about it there and then.
But, though Lizzy had not offered an explanation at the moment, the subject was brought forward by her at the next time of their meeting. She was chatting to him concerning some other event, and remarked that it happened about the time when she was dusting some old clothes that had belonged to her poor husband.
“Do dead men come out of their graves and walk in mud?” murmured the minister, in a cold sweat at the deception that she was practicing.
“Mere words—a phrase that will do for my sermon next Sunday.” It was too plain that Lizzy was unaware that he had seen actual pedestrian splashes upon the skirts of the tell-tale overcoat, and that she imagined him to believe it had come direct from some chest or drawer.
The aspect of the case was now considerably darker. Stockdale was so much depressed by it that he did not challenge her explanation, or threaten to go off as a missionary to benighted islanders, or reproach her in any way whatever. He simply parted from her when she had done talking, and lived on in perplexity, till by degrees his natural manner became sad and constrained.
The following Thursday was changeable, damp, and gloomy, and the night threatened to be windy and unpleasant. Stockdale had gone away to Knollsea in the morning, to be present at some commemoration service there, and on his return he was met by the attractive Lizzy in the passage. Whether influenced by the tide of cheerfulness which had attended him that day, or by the drive through the open air, or whether from a natural disposition to let by­gones alone, be allowed himself to be fascinated into forgetfulness of the great-coat incident, and, upon the whole, passed a pleasant evening; not so much in her society as within sound of her voice, as she sat talking in the back parlor to her mother, till the latter went to bed. Shortly after this Mrs. Newberry retired, and then Stockdale prepared to go upstairs himself. But before he left the room he remained standing by the dying embers a while, thinking long of one thing and another, and was only aroused by the flickering of his candle in the socket as it suddenly declined. and went out. Knowing that there were a tinder-box, matches, and another candle in his bedroom, he felt his way upstairs without a light. On reaching his chamber he laid his hand on every possible ledge and corner for the tinder­box, but for a long time in vain. Discovering it at length, Stockdale produced a spark and was kindling the brimstone when he fancied that he heard a movement in the passage. He blew harder at the lint, the match flared up, and looking by aid of the blue light through the door, which had been standing open all this time, he was surprised to see a male figure vanishing round the top of the staircase with the evident intention of escaping unobserved. The personage wore the clothes which Lizzy had been brushing, and something in the outline and gait suggested to the minister that the wearer was Lizzy herself.
But he was not sure of this; and, greatly excited, Stockdale determined to investigate the mystery, and to adopt his own way for doing it. He blew out the match without lighting the candle, went into the passage, and proceeded on tiptoe toward Lizzy's room. A faint gray square of light in the direction of the chamber window as he approached told him that the door was open, and at once suggested that the occupant was gone. He turned and brought down his fist upon the hand-rail of the staircase: “It was she, in her late husband's coat and hat!”
Somewhat relieved to find that there was no intruder in the case, yet none the less surprised, the minister crept down the stairs, softly put on his boots, overcoat, and hat, and tried the front door. It was fastened as usual; he went to the back door, found this unlocked, and emerged into the garden. The night was mild and moonless, and rain had lately been falling, though for the present it had ceased. There was a sudden dropping from the trees and bushes every now and then, as each passing wind shook their boughs. Among these sounds Stockdale heard the faint fall of feet upon the road outside, and he guessed from the step that it was Lizzy's. He followed the sound, and, helped by the circumstance of the wind blowing from the direction in which the pedestrian moved, he got nearly close to her, and kept there, without risk of being overheard. While he thus followed her up the street or lane, as it might indifferently be called, there being more hedge than houses on either side, a figure came forward to her from one of the cottage doors. Lizzy stopped; the minister stepped upon the grass and stopped also.
“Is that Mrs. Newberry?” said the man who had come out, whose voice Stockdale recognized as that of one of the most devout members of his congregation.
“Yes,” she said, hurriedly; “and you must go at once round to where the chaps are waiting, and tell them they will not be wanted till to­morrow night at the same time. I go to burn the lugger off.”
On she tripped at a quickening pace till the lane turned into the turnpike-road, which she crossed, and got into the track for Ringsworth. Here he ascended the hill without the least hesitation, passed the lonely hamlet of Holworth, and went down the vale on the other side. Stockdale had never taken any extensive walks in this direction, but he was aware that if she persisted in her course much longer she would draw near to the coast, which was here between two and three miles distant from Nether-Mynton; and as it had been about a quarter-past eleven o'clock when they set out, her intention seemed to be to reach the shore about midnight.
Lizzy soon ascended a small mound, which Stockdale at the same time adroitly-skirted on the left; and a dull monotonous roar burst upon his ear. The hillock was about fifty yards from the top of the cliffs, and by day it apparently commanded a full view of the bay. There was light enough in the sky to show her disguised figure against it when she reached the top, where she paused, and afterward sat down. Stockdale, not wishing on any account to alarm her at this moment, yet desirous of being near her, sank upon his hands and knees, crept a little higher up, and there stayed still.
The wind was chilly, the ground damp, and his position one in which he did not care to remain long. However, before he had decided to leave it, the young man heard voices behind him. What they signified he did not know; but, fearing that Lizzy was in danger, he was about to run forward and warn her that she might be seen, when she crept to the shelter of a little bush which maintained a precarious existence in that exposed spot; and her form was absorbed in its dark and stunted outline as she had become part of it. She had evidently heard the men as well as he. They passed near him, talking in loud and careless tones, which could be heard above the uninterrupted washings of the sea, and which suggested that they were not engaged in any business at their own risk. This proved to be the fact; some of their words floated across to him, and caused him to forget at once the coldness of his situation.
“Oh no. He's only got a share. There's another or two in it—a farmer and such-like, but the names I don't know.”
The voices died away, and the heads and shoulders of the men diminished toward the cliff, and dropped out of sight.
“My darling has been tempted to buy a share by that unbeliever Owlett,” groaned the minister, his honest affection for Lizzy having quickened to its intensest point during these moments of risk to her person and name. “That's why she's here,” he said to himself. “Oh, it will be the ruin of her.”
His perturbation was interrupted by the sudden bursting out of a bright and increasing light from the spot where Lizzy was in hiding. A few seconds later, and before it had reached the height of a blaze, he heard her rush past him down the hollow like a stone from a sling, in the direction of home. The light now flared high and wide, and showed its position clearly. She had kindled a bough of furze and stuck it into the bush under which she had been crouching; the wind fanned the flame, which crackled fiercely, and threatened to consume the bush as well as the bough. Stockdale paused just long enough to notice thus much, and then followed rapidly the route taken by the young woman. His intention was to overtake her, and reveal himself as a friend; but run as he would he could see nothing of her. Thus he flew across the open country about Holworth, twisting his legs and ankles in unexpected fissures and descents, till, on coming to the gate between the downs and the road, he was forced to pause to get breath. There was no audible movement either in front or behind him, and he now concluded that she had not outrun him, but that, hearing him at her heels, and believing him one of the excise party, she had hidden herself somewhere on the way, and let him pass by.
He went on at a more leisurely pace toward the village. On reaching the house he found his surmise to be correct, for the gate was on the latch, and the door unfastened, just as he had left them. Stockdale closed the door behind him, and waited silently in the passage. In about-ten minutes he heard the same light foot­step that he had heard in going out; it paused at the gate, which opened and shut softly, and then the door-latch was lifted and Lizzy came in.
Stockdale went forward and said at once, “Lizzy, don't be frightened. I have been waiting up for you.”
“Yes,” he answered, becoming angry now that she was safe indoors, and not alarmed. “And a nice game I've found you out in to­night. You are in man's clothes, and I am ashamed of you!”
“I am only partly in man's clothes,” she faltered, shrinking back to the wall. “It is only his great-coat and hat and breeches that I've got on, which is no harm, as he was my own husband; and I do it only because a cloak blows about so, and you can't use your arms. I have got my own dress under just the same—it is only tucked in. Will you go away upstairs and let me pass? I didn't want you to see me at such a time as this.”
“But I have a right to see you. How do you think there can be anything between us now?” Lizzy was silent.
“That makes no difference. Whatever did you engage in such a trade as that for, and keep it such a secret from me all this time?”
“Well now,” said he, more tenderly, “no harm is done as yet. Won't you, for the sake of me, give up this blamable and dangerous practice altogether?”
“I must do my best to save this run,” said she, getting rather husky in the throat. “I don't want to give you up—you know that; but I don't want to lose my venture. I don't know what to do now! Why I have kept it so secret from you is that I was afraid you would be angry if you knew.”
“I should think so. I suppose if I had married you without finding this out you'd have gone on with it just the same?”
“I don't know. I did not think so far ahead. I only went to-night to burn the folks off, because we found that the excisemen knew where the tubs were to be landed.”
“It is a pretty mess to be in altogether, is this,” said the distracted young minister. “Well, what will you do now?”
Lizzy slowly murmured the particulars of their plan, the chief of which were that they meant to try their luck at some other point of the shore the next night; that three landing-places were always agreed upon before the run was attempted, with the understanding that, if the vessel was burned off from the first point, which was Ringsworth, as it had been by her to-night the crew should attempt to make the second, which was Lullstead, on the second night; and if there, too, danger threatened, they should on the third night try the third place, which was behind a headland further west.
“Suppose the officers hinder them landing there too?” he said, his attention to this interesting programme displacing for a moment his concern at her share in it.
“Then we shan't try anywhere else all this dark—that’s what we call the time between moon and moon—and perhaps they'll string the tubs to a stray-line, and sink ’em a little ways from shore, and take the bearings; and then when they have a chance they'll go to creep for ’em.”
“Oh, they'll go out in a boat and drag a creeper—that’s a grapnel—along the bottom till it catch hold of the stray-line.”
The minister stood thinking; and there was no sound within doors but the tick of the clock on the stairs, and the quick breathing of Lizzy, partly from her walk and partly from agitation, as she stood close to the wall, not in such complete darkness but that he could discern against its whitewashed surface the great-coat and broad hat which covered her.
“Lizzy, all this is very wrong,” he said. “Don't you remember the lesson of the tribute-money—‘Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's?’ Surely you have heard that read times enough in your growing up?”
“My father did it, and so did my grandfather, and almost everybody in Nether-Mynton lives by it; and life would be so dull if it wasn't for that, that I should not care to live at all.”
“I am nothing to live for, of course,” he replied, bitterly. “You would not think it worth while to give up this wild business and live for me alone?”
“I cannot give you my word to-night.” And, looking thoughtfully down, she gradually moved and moved away, going into the adjoining room and closing the door between them. She remained there in the dark till he was tired of waiting, and had gone up to his own chamber.
Poor Stockdale was dreadfully depressed all the next day by the discoveries of the night before. Lizzy was unmistakably a fascinating young woman, but as a minister's wife she was hardly to be contemplated. “If I had only stuck to father's little grocery business, instead of going in for the ministry, she would have suited me beautifully!” he said, sadly, until he remembered that in that case he would never have come from his distant home to Nether-Mynton, and never have known her.
The estrangement between them was not complete, but it was sufficient to keep them out of each other's company. Once during the day he met her in the garden path, and said, turning a reproachful eye upon her, “Do you promise, Lizzy?” But she did not reply. The evening drew on, and he knew well enough that Lizzy would repeat her excursion at night—her half-offended manner had shown that she had not the slightest intention of altering her plans at present. He did not wish to repeat his own share of the adventure; but, act as he would, his uneasiness on her account increased with the decline of day. Supposing that an accident should befall her, he would never forgive himself for not being there to help, much as he disliked the idea of seeming to countenance such unlawful escapades.
As he had expected, she left the house at the same hour at night, this time passing his door without stealth, as if she knew very well that he would be watching, and were resolved to brave his displeasure. He was quite ready, opened the door quickly, and reached the back door almost as soon as she.
“Then you will go, Lizzy?” he said, as he stood on the step beside her, who now again appeared as a little man with a face altogether unsuited to his clothes.
“And I am sure you will enjoy it!” she exclaimed, in more buoyant tones. “Everybody does who tries it.”
They opened the wicket and went up the road abreast of each other, but at some distance apart, scarcely a word passing between them. The evening was rather less favorable to smuggling enterprise than the last had been, the wind being lower, and the sky somewhat clear toward the north.
“ ’Tis, unfortunately,” said she. “But it is only from those few stars over there. The moon was new to-day at four o'clock, and I expected clouds. I hope we shall be able to do it this dark, for when we have to sink ’em for long it makes the stuff taste bleachy, and folks don't like it so well.”
Her course was different from that of the preceding night, branching off to the left over Lord's Barrow as soon as they had got out of the lane and crossed the highway. By the time they reached Chaldon Down, Stockdale, who had been in perplexed thought as to what he should say to her, decided that he would not attempt expostulation now, while she was excited by the adventure, but wait till it was over, and endeavor to keep her from such practices in future. It occurred to him once or twice, as they rambled on, that should they be surprised by the excisemen, his situation would be more awkward than hers, for it would be difficult to prove his true motive in coming to the spot; but the risk was a slight consideration beside his wish to be with her.
They now arrived at a ravine which lay on the outskirts of Chaldon, a village two miles on their way toward the point of the shore they sought.
Lizzy broke the silence this time: “I have to wait here to meet the carriers. I don't know if they have come yet. As I told. you, we go to Lullstead to-night, and it is two miles further than Ringsworth.”
It turned out that the men had already come; for while she spoke two or three dozen heads broke the line of the slope, and a company of men at once descended from the bushes where they had been lying in wait. These carriers were men whom Lizzy and other proprietors regularly employed to bring the tubs from the boat to a hiding-place inland. They were young fellows of Nether-Mynton, Chaldon, and the neighborhood, quiet and inoffensive persons, who simply engaged to carry the cargo for Lizzy and her cousin Owlett, as they would have engaged in any other labor for which they were fairly well paid.
At a word from her, they closed in together. “You had better take it now,” she said to them, and handed to each a packet. It contained six shillings, their remuneration for the night's undertaking, which was paid beforehand without reference to success or failure; but, besides this, they had the privilege of selling as agents when the run was successfully made. As soon as it was done, she said to them, “The place is the old one at Lullstead;” the men till that moment not having been told whither they were bound, for obvious reasons. “Owlett will meet you there,” added Lizzy. “I shall, follow behind, to see that we are not watched.”
The carriers went on, and Stockdale and Mrs. Newberry followed at the distance of a stone's throw, “What do these men do by day?” he said.
“Twelve or fourteen of them are laboring men. Some are brickmakers, some carpenters, some masons, some thatchers. They are all known to me very well. Nine of ’em are of your own congregation.”
“Oh, I know you can't. I only told you. The others are more church-inclined, because they supply the pa'son with all the spirits he requires, and they don't wish to show unfriendliness to a customer.”
“We choose ’em for their closeness, and because they are strong and sure-footed, and able to carry a heavy load a long way without being tired.”
Stockdale sighed as she enumerated each particular, for it proved how far involved in the business a woman must be who was so well acquainted with its conditions and needs. And yet he felt more tenderly toward her at this moment than he had felt all the foregoing day. Perhaps it was that her experienced manner and bold indifference stirred his admiration in spite of himself.
The hired carriers paced along over Chaldon Down with as little hesitation as if it had been day, avoiding the cart-way, and leaving the village of East Chaldon on the left, so as to reach the crest of the hill at a lonely, trackless place not far from the ancient earthwork called Round Pound. An hour's brisk walking brought them within sound of the sea, not many hundred yards from Lullstead Cove. Here they paused, and Lizzy and Stockdale came up with them, when they went on together to the verge of the cliff. One of the men now produced an iron bar, which he drove firmly into the soil a yard from the edge, and attached to it a rope that he had uncoiled from his body. They all began to descend, partly stepping, partly sliding down the incline, as the rope slipped through their hands.
The men remained quite silent when they reached the shore; and the next thing audible to the two at the top was the dip of heavy oars, and the dashing of waves against a boat's bow. In a moment the keel gently touched the shingle, and Stockdale heard the footsteps of the thirty-six carriers running forward over the pebbles toward the point of landing.
There was a sousing in the water as of a brood of ducks plunging in, showing that the men had not been particular about keeping their legs, or even their waists, dry from the brine; but it was impossible to see what they were doing, and in a few minutes the shingle was trampled again. The iron bar sustaining the rope, on which Stockdale's hand rested, began to swerve a little, and the carriers one by one appeared climbing up the sloping cliff, dripping audibly as they came, and sustaining themselves by the guide-rope. Each man on reaching the top was seen to be carrying a pair of tubs, one on his back and one on his chest, the two being slung together by cords passing round the chine hoops, and resting on the carrier's shoulders. Some of the stronger men carried three by putting an extra one on the top behind, but the customary load was a pair, these being quite weighty enough to give their bearer the sensation of having chest and backbone in contact after a walk of four or five miles.
“He will not come up this way,” said the carrier. “He's to bide on shore till we be safe off.” Then, without waiting for the rest, the foremost men plunged across the down; and when the last had ascended, Lizzy pulled up the rope; wound it round her arm, wriggled the bar from the sod, and turned to follow the carriers.
“Yes. Well, it is a bad night's work,” said Stockdale, heavily. “But I'll carry the bar and rope for you.”
Stockdale shook his head, and taking the bar, walked by her side toward the down, and the moan of the sea was heard no more.
“ls this what you meant the other day when you spoke of having business with Owlett?” the young man asked.
Her companion could not blind himself to the fact that where tastes and pursuits were so akin as Lizzy's and Owlett's, and where risks were shared, as with them, in every undertaking, there would be a peculiar appropriateness in her answering Owlett's standing question on matrimony in the affirmative. This did not soothe Stockdale, its tendency being rather to stimulate in him an effort to make the pair as inappropriate as possible, and win her away from this nocturnal crew to correctness of conduct and a minister's parlor in some far-removed inland county.
They had been walking near enough to the file of carriers for Stockdale to perceive that, when they got into the road to the village, they split up into two companies of unequal size, each of which made off in a direction of its own. One company, the smaller of the two, went toward the church, and by the time that Lizzy and Stockdale reached their own house these men had scaled the churchyard wall and were proceeding noiselessly over the grass within.
“I see that Owlett has arranged for one batch to be put in the church again,” observed Lizzy. “Do you remember my taking you there the first night you came?”
“Yes, of course,” said Stockdale. “No wonder you had permission to broach the tubs—they were his, I suppose?”
“No, they were not—they were mine; I had permission from myself. The day after that they went several miles inland in a wagon-load of manure, and sold very well.”
At this moment the group of men who had made off to the left some time before began leaping one by one from the hedge opposite Lizzy's house, and the first man, who had no tubs upon his shoulders, came forward.
“I find that we can't put any in Badger's Clump to-night, Lizzy,” said Owlett. “The place is watched. We must sling the apple-tree in the orchard if there's time. We can't put any more under the church lumber than I have sent on there, and my mixen hev already more in en than is safe.”
“Nothing at all, please. Ah! it is the minister!—you two that can't do anything had better get indoors and not be seed.”
While Owlett thus conversed, a tone so full of contraband anxiety and so free from lover's jealousy, the men who followed him had been descending one by one from the hedge; and it unfortunately happened that when the hindmost took his leap, the cord which sustained his tubs slipped; the result was that both the kegs fell into the road, one of them being stove in by the blow.
“Oh, no—about two guineas and a half to us now,” said Lizzy, excitedly. “It isn't that—it is the smell! It is so blazing strong before it had been lowered by water that it smells dreadfully when spilled in the road like that! I do hope Latimer won't pass by till it is gone off. ”
Owlett and one or two others picked up the burst tub and began to scrape and trample over the spot, to disperse the liquor as much as possible; and then they all entered the gate of Owlett's orchard, which adjoined Lizzy's garden on the right. Stockdale did not care to follow them, for several on recognizing him had looked wonderingly at his presence, though they said nothing. Lizzy left his side and went to the bottom of the garden, looking over the hedge into the orchard, where the men could be dimly seen bustling about, and apparently hiding the tubs. All was done noiselessly, and without a light; and when it was over they dispersed in different directions, those who had taken their cargoes to the church having already gone off to their homes.
Lizzy returned to the garden gate, over which Stockdale was still abstractedly leaning. “It is all finished; I am going indoors now,” she said, gently. “I will leave the door ajar for you.”
But before either of them had moved, the faint clatter of horses’ hoofs broke upon the ear, and it seemed to come from the point where the track across the down joined the hard road.
They entered the house, and Lizzy bolted the door. “Please don't get a light, Mr. Stockdale,” she said.
“I am,” said Stockdale. “But, Lizzy Newberry, I love you, and you know it perfectly well; and you ought to know, if you do not, what I have suffered in my conscience on your account these last few days!”
The trotting of the horses seemed to have again died away, and the pair of listeners touched each other's fingers in the cold “good-night” of those whom something seriously divided. They were on the landing, but before they had taken three steps apart the tramp of the horsemen suddenly revived, almost close to the house. Lizzy turned to the staircase window, opened the casement about an inch, and put her face close to the aperture. “Yes one of ’em is Latimer,” she whispered. “He always rides a white horse. One would think it was the last color for a man in that line.”
Stockdale looked, and saw the white shape of the animal as it passed by; but before the riders had gone another ten yards Latimer reined in his horse, and said something to his companion which neither Stockdale nor Lizzy could hear. Its drift was, however, soon made evident, for the other man stopped also; and sharply turning the horses’ heads they cautiously retraced their steps. When they were again opposite Mrs. Newberry’s garden, Latimer dismounted, the man on the dark horse did the same. Lizzy and Stockdale, intently listening and observing the proceedings, naturally put their heads as close as possible to the slit formed by the slightly opened casement; and thus it occurred that at last their cheeks came positively into contact. They went on lIstening, as if they did not know of the singular circumstance which had happened to their faces, and the pressure of each to each rather increased than lessened with the lapse of time.
They could hear the excisemen sniffing the air like hounds as they paced slowly along. When they reached the spot where the tub had burst, both stopped on the instant.
“Well, no,” said Latimer. “Maybe this is only a trick to put us off the scent. They wouldn't kick up this stink anywhere near their hiding place. I have known such things before.”
“Yes,” said Latimer, musingly. “Unless ’tis all done to tole us the wrong way. I have a mind that we go home for to-night without saying a word, and come the first thing in the morning with more hands. I know they have storages about here, but we can do nothing by this owl's light. We will look round the parish and see if everybody is in bed, John; and if all is quiet, we will do as I say.”
They went on, and the two inside the window could hear them passing leisurely through the whole village, the street of which curved round at the bottom and entered the turnpike-road at another junction. This way the excisemen followed, and the amble of their horses died quite away.
She knew that he alluded to the coming search by the officers, to divert her attention from their own tender incident by the casement, which he wished to be passed over as a thing rather dreamed of than done. “Oh, nothing,” she replied, with as much coolness as she could command under her disappointment at his manner. “We often have such storms as this. You would not be frightened if you knew what fools they are. Fancy riding o’ horseback through the place; of course they will hear and see nobody while they make that noise; but they are always afraid to get off, in case some of our fellows should burst out upon ’em, and tie them up to the gatepost, as they have done before now. Good-night, Mr. Stockdale.”
She closed the window and went to her room, where a tear fell from her eyes; and that not because of the alertness of the riding-officers.
Stockdale was so excited by the events of the evening, and the dilemma that he was placed in between conscience and love, that he did not sleep, or seven doze, but remained as broadly awake as at noonday. As soon as the gray light began to touch ever so faintly the whiter objects in his bedroom, he arose, dressed himself, and went downstairs into the road.
The village was already astir. Several of the carriers had heard the well-known tramp of Latimer's horse while they were undressing in the dark that night, and had already communicated with one another and Owlett on the subject. The only doubt seemed to be about the safely of those tubs which had been left under the church gallery stairs, and after a short discussion at the corner of the mill, it was agreed that these should be removed before it got lighter, and hidden in the middle of a double hedge bordering the adjoining field. However, before anything could be carried into effect, the footsteps of many men were heard coming down the lane from the highway.
“D— it, here they be,” said Owlett, who, having already drawn the hatch and started his mill for the day, stood stolidly at the mill door covered with flour, as if the interest of his whole soul was bound up in the shaking walls around him.
The two or three with whom he had been talking dispersed to their usual work, and when the excise officers and the formidable body of men they had hired reached the village cross, between the mill and Mrs. Newberry’s house, the village wore the natural aspect of a place beginning its morning labors.
“Now,” said Latimer to his associates, who numbered thirteen men in all, “what I know is that the things are somewhere in this here place. We have got the day before us, and ’tis hard if we can't light upon ’em and get ’em to Budmouth Custom-house before night. First we will try the fuel-houses, and then we'll work our way into the chimmers, and then to the ricks and stables, and so creep round. You have nothing but your noses to guide ye, mind, so use ’em to-day if you never did in your lives before.”
Then the search began. Owlett, during the early part, watched from his mill window, Lizzy from the door of her house, with the greatest self-possession. A farmer down below, who also had a share in the run, rode about with one eye on his fields and the other on Latimer and his myrmidons, prepared to put them off the scent if he should be asked a question. Stockdale, who was no smuggler at all, felt more anxiety than the worst of them, and went about his studies with a heavy heart, coming frequently to the door to ask Lizzy some question or other on the consequences to her of the tubs being found.
“The consequences,” she said, quietly, “are simply that I shall lose ’em. As I have none in the house or garden, they can't touch me personally.”
“Owlett rents that of me, and he lends it to others. So it will be hard to say who had any tubs there if they should be found.”
There was never such a tremendous sniffing known as that which took place in Nether-Mynton parish and its vicinity this day. All was done methodically, and mostly on hands and knees. At different hours of the day they had different plans. From daybreak to breakfast time the officers used their sense of smell in a direct and straightforward manner only, pausing nowhere but at such places as the tubs might be supposed to be secreted in at that very moment, pending their removal on the following night. Among the places tested and examined were:
After breakfast they recommenced with renewed vigor, taking a new line; that is to say, directing their attention to clothes that might be supposed to have come in contact with the tubs in their removal from the shore, such garments being usually tainted with the spirits, owing to its oozing between the staves. They now sniffed at
And, as soon as the mid-day meal was over, they pushed their search into places where the spirits might have been thrown away in alarm:
But still these indefatigable excisemen discovered nothing more than the original telltale smell in the road opposite Lizzy's house, which even yet had not passed off.
“I'll tell ye what it is, men,” said Latimer, about three o'clock in the afternoon, “we must begin over again. Find them tubs I will.”
The men, who had been hired for the day, looked at their hands and knees, muddy with creeping on all fours so frequently, and rubbed their noses, as if they had had almost enough of it; for the quantity of bad air which had passed into each one's ‘nostril had rendered it nearly as insensible as a flue. However, after a moment's hesitation, they prepared to start anew, except three, whose power of smell had quite succumbed under the excessive wear and tear of the day.
By this time not a male villager was to be seen in the parish. Owlett was not at his mill, the farmers were not in their fields, the parson was not in his garden, the smith had left his forge, and the wheelwright's shop was silent.
“Where the devil are the folk gone?” said Latimer, waking up to the fact of their absence, and looking round.
“I'll have ’em up for this! Why don't they come and help us? There's not a man about the place but the Methodist parson, and he's an old woman. I demand assistance in the king's name!”
“Well, well, we shall do better without ’em,” said Latimer, who changed his moods at a moment's notice. “But there's great cause of suspicion in this silence and this keeping out of sight, and I'll bear it in mind. Now we will go across to Owlett's orchard, and see what we can find there.”
Stockdale, who heard this discussion from the garden gate, over which he had been leaning, was rather alarmed, and thought it a mistake of the villagers to keep so completely out of the way. He himself, like the excisemen, had been wondering for the last half-hour what could have become of them. Some laborers were of necessity engaged in distant fields, but the master-workmen should have been at home; though one and all, after just showing themselves at their shops, had apparently gone off for the day. He went in to Lizzy, who sat at a back window sewing, and said, “Lizzy, where are the men?”
Lizzy laughed. “Where they mostly are when they are run so hard as this.” She cast her eyes to heaven. “Up there,” she said.
Stockdale looked up. “What—on the top of the church tower?” he asked, seeing the direction of her glance.
“Well, I expect they will soon have to come down,” said he, gravely. “I have been listening to the officers and they are going to search the orchard over again and then every nook in the church.”
Lizzy looked alarmed for the first time. “Will you go and tell our folk?” she said. “They ought to be let know.” Seeing his conscience struggling within him like a boiling pot she added, “No, never mind, I'll go myself.”
She went out, descended the garden, and climbed over the churchyard wall at the same time that the preventivemen were ascending the road to the orchard. Stockdale could do no less than follow her. By the time that she reached the tower entrance he was at her side, and they entered together.
Nether-Mynton church tower was, as in many villages, without a turret, and the only way to the top was by going up to the singers’ gallery, and thence ascending by a ladder to a square trap-door in the floor of the bell-loft, above which a permanent ladder was fixed, passing through the bells to a hole in the roof. When Lizzy and Stockdale reached the gallery and looked up, nothing but the trap-door and the five holes for the bell-ropes appeared, The ladder was gone.
“Oh yes, there is,” said she. “There's an eye looking at us at this moment through a knot-hole in that trap-door.”
And as she spoke the trap opened, and the dark line of the ladder was seen descending against the whitewashed wall. When it touched the bottom Lizzy dragged it to its place, and said, “If you'll go up, I'll follow.”
The young man ascended, and presently found himself among consecrated bells for the first time in his life, nonconformity having been in the Stockdale blood for some generations. He eyed them uneasily, and looked round for Lizzy. Owlett stood here, holding the top of the ladder “What, be you really one of us?” said the miller.
She stepped up beside them, and then they went on to the next stage, which, when they had clambered over the dusty bell-carriages, was of easy ascent, leading toward the hole through which the pale sky appeared, and into the open air. Owlett remained behind for a moment to pull up the lower ladder.
Stockdale here beheld all the missing parishioners, lying on their stomachs on the tower roof, except a few who, elevated on their hands and knees, were peeping through the embrasure of the parapet. Stockdale did the same, and saw the village lying like a map below him, over which moved the figures of the excisemen, each foreshortened to a crab-like object, the crown of his hat forming a circular disk in the center of him. Some of the men had turned their heads when the young preacher's figure arose among them.
“I'd’ as lief that it hadn't been,” said Jim Clarke. “If the pa'son should see him a trespassing here in his tower, ‘twould be none the better for we, seeing how ‘a do hate chapel members. He'd never buy a tub of us again, and he's as good a customer as we have got this side o’ Warm’ll,”
“In his house, to be sure, that he may see nothing of what's going on—where all good folks ought to be, and this young man likewise.”
“Well, he has brought some news,” said Lizzy. “They are going to search the orchet and church; can we do anything if they should find?”
“Yes,” said her cousin Owlett. “That's what we've been talking o’, and we have settled our line. Well, be dazed!”
The exclamation was caused by his perceiving that some of the searchers, having got into the orchard, and begun stooping and creeping hither and thither, were pausing in the middle, where a tree smaller than the rest was growing. They drew closer, and bent lower than ever upon the ground.
The interest in the movements of the officers was so keen that not a single eye was looking in any other direction; but at that moment a shout from the church beneath them attracted the attention of the smugglers, as it did also of the party in the orchard, who sprang to their feet and went toward the church-yard wall. At the same time those of the Government men who had entered the church unperceived by the smugglers cried aloud, “Here be some of ’em at last.”
The smugglers remained in a blank silence, uncertain whether “some of ’em” meant tubs or men; but again peeping cautiously over the edge of the tower they learned that tube were the things described; and soon these fated articles were brought one by one into the middle of the church-yard from their hiding-place under the gallery stairs.
“They are going to put ’em on Hinton’s vault till they find the rest,” said Lizzy, hopelessly. The excisemen had, in fact, begun to pile up the tubs on a large stone slab which was fixed there; and when all were brought out from the tower, two or three of the men were left standing by them, the rest of the party again proceeding to the orchard.
The interest of the smugglers in the next maneuvers of their enemies became painfully intense. Only about thirty tubs had been secreted in the lumber of the tower, but seventy were hidden in the orchard, making up all that they had brought ashore as yet, the remainder of the cargo. having been tied to a sinker and dropped overboard for another night's operations. The excisemen, having re-entered the orchard, acted as if they were positive that here lay hidden the rest of the tubs, which they were determined to find before nightfall. They spread themselves out round the field, and advancing on all fours as before, went anew round every apple-tree in the inclosure. The young tree in the middle again led them to pause, and at length the whole company gathered there in a way which signified that a second chain of reasoning had led to the same results as the first.
When they had examined the sod hereabouts for some minutes, one of the men rose, ran to a disused porch of the church where tools were kept, and returned with the sexton’s pickax and shovel, with which they set to work.
“Are they really buried there?” said the minister, for the grass was so green and uninjured that it was difficult to believe it had been disturbed. The smugglers were too interested to reply, and presently they saw, to their chagrin, the officers stand two on each side of the tree; and, stooping and applying their hands to the soil, they bodily lifted the tree and the turf around it. The apple-tree now showed itself to be growing in a shallow box, with handles for lifting at each of the four sides. Under the site of the tree a square hole was revealed, and an exciseman went and looked down.
“It is all up now,” said Owlett, quietly. “And now all of ye get down before they notice we are here; and be ready for our next move. I had better bide here till dark, or they may take me on suspicion, as ’tis on my ground. I'll be with ye as soon as daylight begins to pink in.”
“You please look to the linchpins and screws; then go indoors and know nothing at all. The chaps will do the rest.”
The ladder was replaced, and all but Owlett descended, the men passing off one by one at the back of the church, and vanishing on their respective errands.
She knew from the words “Mrs. Newberry” that the division between them had widened yet another degree.
“I am not going home,” she said. “I have a little thing to do before I go in. Martha Sarah will got your tea.”
“Oh, I don't mean on that account,” said Stockdale. “What can you have to do further in this unhallowed affair?”
“You are not going to run any danger, Lizzy?” said the young man, his tenderness reasserting itself.
Stockdale entered the garden gate, and stood behind it looking on. The excisemen were still busy in the orchard, and at last he was tempted to enter, and watch their proceedings. When he came closer he found that the secret cellar, of whose existence he had been totally unaware, was formed by timbers placed across from side to side about a foot under the ground, and grassed over.
The excisemen looked up at Stockdale's fair and downy countenance, and evidently thinking him above suspicion, went on with their work again. As soon as all the tubs were taken out, they began tearing up the turf, pulling out the timbers, and breaking in the sides, till the cellar was wholly dismantled and shapeless, the apple tree lying with its roots high to the air. But the hole which had in its time held so much contraband merchandise was never completely filled up, either then or afterward, a depression in the greensward marking the spot to this day.
As the goods had all to be carried to Budmouth that night, the excisemen’s next object was to find horses and carts for the journey, and they went about the village for that purpose. Latimer strode hither and thither with a lump of chalk in his hand, marking broad arrows so vigorously on every vehicle and set of harness that he came across that it seemed as if he would chalk broad arrows on the very hedges and roads. The owner of every conveyance so marked was bound to give it up for Government purposes. Stockdale, who had had enough of the scene, turned indoors, thoughtful and depressed. Lizzy was already there, having come in at the back, though she had not yet taken off her bonnet. She looked tired, and her mood was not much brighter than his own. They had but little to say to each other; and the minister went away and attempted to read; but at this he could not succeed, and he shook the little bell for tea.
Lizzy herself brought in the tray, the girl having run off into the village during the afternoon, too full of excitement at the proceedings to remember her state of life. However, almost before the sad lovers had said anything to each other, Martha came in in a steaming state.
“Oh, there's such a stoor, Mrs. Newberry and Mr. Stockdale! The king's excisemen can't get the carts ready nohow at all! They pulled Thomas Ballam’s, and William Roger's, and Stephen Sprake's carts into the road, and off came the wheels, and down fell the carts; and they found there was no linchpins in the arms; and then they tried Samuel Shane's wagon, and found that the screws were gone from he, and at last they looked at the dairyman's cart, and he's got none neither! They have gone now to the blacksmith's to get some made, but he's nowhere to be found!”
Stockdale looked at Lizzy, who blushed very slightly, and went out of the room, followed by Martha Sarah; but before they had got through the passage there was a rap at the front door, and Stockdale recognized Latimer's voice addressing Mrs. Newberry, who had turned back.
“For God's sake, Mrs. Newberry, have you seen Hardman the blacksmith up this way? If we could get hold of him, we'd e'en a'most drag him by the hair of his head to his anvil, where he ought to be.”
“Why, there isn't a horse in the place that has got more than three shoes on, and some have only two. The wagon-wheels be without strakes, and there's no linchpins to the carts. What with that, and the bother about every set of harness being out of order, we shan't be off before night­fall—upon my soul we shan't. ’Tis a rough lot, Mrs. Newberry, that you've got about you here; but they'll play at this game once too often, mark my words they will! There's not a man in the parish that don't deserve to be whipped.”
It happened that Hardman was at that moment a little further up the lane, smoking his pipe behind a holly-bush. When Latimer had done speaking he went on in this direction, and Hardman, hearing the exciseman's steps, found curiosity too strong for prudence. He peeped out from the bush at the very moment that Latimer's glance was on it. There was nothing left for him to do but to come forward with unconcern.
“Sorry to hear that,” said Hardman. “I've been out for a stroll, to look for more hid tubs, to deliver ’em up to Gover'ment.”
“Oh yes, Hardman, we know it,” said Latimer, with withering sarcasm. “We know that you'll deliver ’em up to Gover'ment. We know that all the parish is helping us, and have been all day! Now, you please walk along with me down to your shop, and kindly let me hire ye in the king's name.”
They went down the lane together, and presently there, resounded from the smithy the ring of a hammer not very briskly swung. However, the carts and horses were got into some sort of traveling condition, but it was not until after the clock had struck six, when the muddy roads were glistening under the horizontal light of the fading day. The smuggled tubs were soon packed into the vehicles, and Latimer, with three of his assistants, drove slowly out of the village in the direction of the port of Budmouth, some considerable number of miles distant, the other excisemen being left to watch for, the remainder of the cargo, which they knew to have been sunk somewhere between Ringsworth and Lullstead Cove, and to unearth Owlett, the only person clearly implicated by the discovery of the cave.
Women and children stood at the doors as the carts, each chalked with the Government pitchfork, passed in the increasing twilight; and as they stood they looked at the confiscated property with a melancholy expression that told only too plainly the relation which they bore to the trade.
“Well, Lizzy,” said Stockdale, when the crackle of the wheels had nearly died away, “this is a fit finish to your adventure. I am truly thankful that you have got off without suspicion, and the loss only of the liquor. Will you sit down and let me talk to you?”
He did not answer to this, and she moved toward the door slowly, as if waiting for him to say something more.
“You don't offer to come with me,” she added, at last. “I suppose that's because you hate me after all this?”
“Can you say it, Lizzy, when you know I only want to save you from such practices? Come with you? Of course I will, if it is only to take care of you. But why will you go out again?”
“Because I cannot rest indoors. Something is happening, and I must know what. Now come!” And they went into the dusk together. When they reached the turnpike road she turned to the right, and he soon perceived that they were following the direction of the excisemen and their loads. He had given her his arm, and every now and then she suddenly pulled it back, to signify that he was to halt a moment and listen. They had walked rather quickly along the first quarter of a mile, and on the second or third time of standing still she said, “I hear them ahead—don’t you?”
“Ah,” said he, a light breaking upon him. “Something desperate is to be attempted—and now I remember, there was not a man about the village when we left.”
“Hark!” she murmured. The noise of the cart-wheels had stopped, and given place to another sort of sound.
“ 'Tis a scuffle,” said Stockdale. “There'll be murder! Lizzy, let go my arm; I am going on. On my conscience, I must not stay here and do nothing!”
“There'll he no murder, and not even a broken head,” she said. “Our men are thirty to four of them; no harm will be done at all.”
“Then there is an attack!“ exclaimed Stockdale; “and you knew it was to be. Why should you side with men who break the laws like this?”
“Why should you side with men who take from country traders what they have honestly bought wi’ their own money in France?” said’ she, firmly.
“They are,” she contradicted. “I and Owlett and the others paid thirty shillings for every one of the tube before they were put on board at Cherbourg, and if a king who is nothing to us sends his people to steal our property, we have a right to steal it back again.”
Stockdale did not stop to argue the matter, but went quickly in the direction of the noise, Lizzy keeping at his side. “Don't you interfere, will you, dear Richard?” she said, anxiously, as they drew near. “Don't let us go any closer; ’tis at Warm'ell Cross where they are seizing ’em. You can do no good, and you may meet with a hard blow!”
“Let us see first what is going on,” he said But before they had got much further the noise of the cart-wheels began again, and Stockdale soon found that they were coming toward him. In another minute the three carts came up, and Stockdale and Lizzy stood in the ditch to let them pass.
Instead of being conducted by four men, as had happened when they went out of the village, the horses and carts were now accompanied by a body of from twenty to thirty, all of whom, as Stockdale perceived to his astonishment, had blackened faces. Among them walked six or eight huge female figures, whom, from their wide strides, Stockdale guessed to be men in disguise. As soon as the party discerned Lizzy and her companion four or five fell back, and when the carts had passed came close to the pair.
“There is no walking up this way for the present,” said one of the gaunt women, who wore curls a foot long, dangling down the sides of her face, in the fashion of the time. Stockdale recognized this lady's voice as Owlett's.
“Now, look here, youngster,” said Owlett— “oh, ’tis the Methodist parson!—what, and Mrs. Newberry! Well, you'd better not go up that way, Lizzy. They've all run off, and folks have got their own again.”
The miller then hastened on and joined his comrades. Stockdale and Lizzy also turned back. “I wish all this hadn't been forced upon us,” she said, regretfully. “But if those excisemen had got off with the tubs, half the people in the parish would have been in want for the next month or two.”
Stockdale was not paying much attention to her words, and he said, “I don't think I can go back like this. Those four poor excisemen may be murdered, for all I know.”
“Well, I shall go as far as Warm'ell Cross to see,” said Stockdale, decisively; and without wishing her safe home or anything else, the minister turned back. Lizzy stood, looking at him till his form was absorbed in the shades; and then, with sadness, she went in the direction of Nether-Mynton.
The road was lonely, and after nightfall at this time of the year there was often not a passer for hours. Stockdale pursued his way without hearing a sound beyond that of his own footsteps, and in due time he passed beneath the trees of the plantation which surrounded the Warm'ell Crossroad. Before he had reached the point of intersection he heard voices from the thicket.
The voices were not at all feeble, or despairing, but they were unmistakably anxious. Stockdale had no weapon, and before plunging into the pitchy darkness of the plantation he pulled a stake from the hedge to use in case of need.
“Here!” answered the voices; and pushing through the brambles in that direction, he came near the objects of his search.
“Poor Will Latimer the exciseman!” said one, plaintively. “Just come and cut these cords, there's a good man! We were afraid nobody would pass by to-night.”
“The rascals!” said Latimer, getting now into a rage, though: he had seemed quite meek when Stockdale first came up. “ ’Tis the same sort of fellows. I know they were Mynton chaps to a man.”
“What are you going to do?” said Stockdale. “I'd fain go back to Mynton, and have at ’em again,” said Latimer.
“But,” said Latimer, more frigidly, as they came out of the plantation, “we don't know that these chaps with black faces were Mynton men. And proof is a hard thing.”
“And therefore we won't do nothing at all,” said Latimer with complete dispassionateness. “For my part, I'd sooner be them than we. The clitches of my arms are burning like fire from the cords those two strapping women, tied round ’em. My opinion, is, now I have had time to think o't, that you may serve your gover’ment at too high a price. For these two nights and days, I have not had an hour's rest; and, please God, here's for home-along.”
The other officers agreed heartily to this course,’ and thanking Stockdale for his timely assistance, they parted from him at the cross, taking themselves the western road and Stockdale going back to Nether-Mynton.
During that walk the minister was lost in reverie of the most painful kind. As soon as he got into the house, and before entering his own rooms, he advanced to the door of the little back parlor in which Lizzy usually sat with her mother. He found her there alone. Stockdale went forward, and, like a man in a dream, looked down upon the table that stood between him and the young woman, who had her bonnet and cloak still on. As he did not speak, she looked up from her chair at him, with misgiving in her eye.
“A share will be mine, a share my cousin Owlett's, a share to each of the two farmers, and a share divided among the men who helped us.”
“Don't ask that,” she whispered. “You don't know what you are asking. I must tell you, though I meant not to do it. What I make by that trade is all I have to keep my mother and myself with.”
He was astonished. “I did not dream of such a thing,” he said. “I would rather have swept the streets, had I been you. What is money compared with a clear conscience?”
“My conscience is clear. I know my mother but the king I have never seen. His dues are nothing to me. But it is a great deal to me that my mother and I should live.”
“It is good of you,” she said, trembling a little. “Let me think of it by myself. I would rather not answer now.”
She reserved her answer till the next day, and came into his room with a solemn face. “I cannot do what you wished” she said, passionately.
“It is too much to ask. My whole life ha’ been passed in this way.” Her words and manner showed that before entering she had been struggling with herself in private, and that the contention had been strong.
“Then, Lizzy, we must part. I cannot go against my principles in this matter, and I cannot make my profession a mockery. You know how I love you, and what I would do for you; but this one thing I cannot do.”
“But why should you belong to that profession?” she burst out. “I have got this large house; why can't you marry me and live here with us, and not be a Methodist preacher any more? I assure you, Richard, it is no harm, and I wish you could only see it as I do! We only carry it on in winter; in summer it is never done at all. It stirs up one's dull life at this time o’ the year, and gives excitement, which I have got so used to now that I should hardly know how to do ‘ithout it. At nights, when the wind blows, instead of being dull and stupid, and not noticing whether it do blow or not, your mind is afield, even if you are not afield yourself; and you are wondering how the chaps are getting on; and you walk up and down the room, and look out o’ window, and then you go off yourself and know your way about as well by night as by day, and have hair-breadth escapes from old Latimer and his fellows, who are too stupid ever to really frighten us, and only make us a bit nimble.”
“He frightened you a little last night, anyhow; and I would advise you to drop it before it is worse.”
She shook her head. “No, I must go on as I have begun. I was born to it. It is in my blood, and I can't be cured. Oh, Richard, you cannot think what a hard thing you have asked, and how sharp you try me when you put me between this and my love for ‘ee!”
Stockdale was leaning with his elbow on the mantel-piece, his hands over his eyes. “We ought never to have met, Lizzy,” he said. “It was an ill day for us. I little thought there was anything so hopeless and impossible in our engagement as this. Well, it is too late now to regret consequences in this way. I have had the happiness of seeing you and knowing you at least.”
“You dissent from Church and I dissent from State,” she said, “and I don't see why we are not well-matched.”
That was an unhappy evening for both of them, and the days that followed were unhappy days. Both she and he went mechanically about their employments, and his depression was marked in the village by more than one of his denomination with whom he came in contact. But Lizzy, who passed her days indoors, was unsuspected of being the cause; for it was generally understood that a quiet engagement to marry existed between her and her cousin Owlett, and had existed for some time.
Thus uncertainly the week passed on, till one morning Stockdale said to her: “I have had a letter, Lizzy. I must call you that till I am gone.”
“Yes,” he said. “I am going from this place. I felt it would be better for us both that I should not stay after what has happened. In fact, I couldn't stay here, and look on you from day to day, without becoming weak and faltering in my course. I have just heard of an arrangement by which the other minister can arrive here in about a week and let me go elsewhere.”
That he had all this time continued so firmly fixed in his resolution came upon her as a grievous surprise. “You never loved me!” she said, bitterly.
“I might say the same,” he returned, “but I will not. Grant me one favor. Come and hear my last sermon on the day before I go.”
Lizzy, who was a church-goer on Sunday mornings, frequently attended Stockdale's chapel in the evening with the rest of the double-minded, and she promised.
It became known that Stockdale was going to leave, and a good many people outside his own sect were sorry to hear it. The intervening days flew rapidly away, and on the evening of the Sunday which preceded the morning of his departure Lizzy sat in the chapel to hear him for the last time. The little building was full to overflowing, and he took up the subject which all had expected, that of the contraband trade so extensively practiced among them. His hearers, in laying his words to their own hearts, did not perceive that they were most particularly directed against Lizzy, till the sermon waxed warm and Stockdale nearly broke down with emotion. In truth, his own earnestness, and her sad eyes looking up at him, were too much for the young man's equanimity. He hardly knew how he ended. He saw Lizzy, as through a mist, turn and go away with the rest of the congregation, and shortly afterward followed her home.
She invited him to supper, and they sat down alone, her mother having, as was usual with her on Sunday nights, gone to bed early.
“We will part friends, won't we?” said Lizzy, forced gayety, and never alluding to the sermon—a reticence which rather disappointed him.
It was the first meal that they had ever shared together in their lives, and probably the last that they would so share. When it was over, and the indifferent conversation could no longer be continued, he arose and took her hand.
Stockdale bent over her and kissed her, and she involuntarily returned his kiss. “I shall go early,“ he said; hurriedly. “I shall not see you again.”
And he did leave early. He fancied, when stepping into the gray morning light, to which was to carry him away, that he saw between the parted curtains of Lizzy's window; but the light was faint, and the panes glistened with wet; so he could not be sure. Stockdale mounted the vehicle, and was gone; and on the following Sunday the new minister preached in the chapel of the Mynton Wesleyans.
One day, two years after the parting, Stockdale, now settled in a midland town, came into Nether-Mynton by carrier in the original way. Jogging along in the van that afternoon, he had put questions to the driver, and the answers that he received interested, the minister deeply. The result of them was that he went without the least hesitation to the door of his former lodging. It was about six o'clock in the evening, and the same time of year as when he had left; now, too, the ground was damp and glistening, the west was bright, and Lizzy's snowdrops were raising their heads in the border under the wall.
Lizzy must have caught sight of him from the window, for by the time that he reached the door she was there holding it open; and then, as if she had not sufficiently considered her act of coming out, she drew herself back, saying, with some constraint: “Mr. Stockdale!”
“I did not. I was not quite sure when my business would lead me to these parts.” “You only came because business brought you near?”
“Well, that is the fact; but I have often thought I should like to come on purpose to see you. But what's all this that has happened? I told you how it would be, Lizzy, and you would not listen to me.”
“I would not,” she said, sadly. “But I had been brought up to that life, and it was second nature to me. However, it is all over now. The officers have blood-money for taking a man dead or alive, and the trade is going to nothing. We were hunted down like rats.”
“Yes, he is in America. We had a dreadful struggle that last time, when they tried to take him. It is a perfect miracle that he lived through and it is a wonder that I was not killed. I was shot in the hand. It was not by aim; the shot was really meant for my cousin; but I was behind, looking on as usual, and the bullet came to me. It bled terribly, but I got home without fainting, and it healed after a time. You know how he suffered?”
“He was shot in the back, but a rib turned the ball. He was badly hurt. We would not let him be took. The men carried him all night across the meads to Bere, and hid him in a barn, dressing his wound as well as they could, till he was so far recovered as to be able to get about. He had gied up his mill for some time, and at last he got to Bristol, and took a passage to America, and he's settled in Wisconsin. ”
“I own that we were wrong,” said she. “But I have suffered for it. I am very poor now, and my mother has been dead these twelve months. But won't you come in, Mr. Stockdale?”
Stockdale went in; and it is to be presumed that they came to an understanding, for a fortnight later there was a sale of Lizzy's furniture, and after that a wedding at a chapel in a neighboring town.
He took her away from her old haunts to the home that he had made for himself in his native county, where she studied her duties as a minister's wife with praiseworthy assiduity. It is said that in after-years she wrote an excellent tract called “Render unto Caesar; or, The Repentant Villagers,” in which her own experience was anonymously used as the introductory story. Stockdale got it printed, after making some corrections, and putting in a few powerful sentences of his own; and many hundreds of copies were distributed by the couple in the course of their married life.

FRAMINGHAM, MA: Paul Rocha, 84, a resident of Framingham for 60 years, died peacefully in the presence of family on Friday, June 15, 2018. He was the beloved husband of the late Muguette Rocha with whom he shared 63 years of marriage. Born in New Bedford, MA., he was the son of the late Joseph and Evangelina Rocha and brother to eight siblings. At the age of 21 he met Muguette LeBlanc, who had moved to the US from Canada, and they were married in 1954 while living in Fairhaven MA. They eventually moved to Framingham in 1957.

After writing a ton of content in preparation for my presentation at Squares conference, I ended up scrapping lots of it to keep my time below an hour and a half. Now that I've had some time to go back through and make some edits, I now present to you, the scraps.
Making responsive websites is hard. Throw a bunch of opinionated people in the mix and it can seem nearly impossible. Let’s dig into what it takes to handle the pixels and the people really well. From beginning to end, we’ll walk through a solid, designer-focused process to make your next project a success.
These steps (the result of much thought and experience) are not meant to be exhaustive coverage on the much written about subject of Responsive Web Design, but rather suggestive in nature to inspire you to plan your work accordingly.
Though written through the lens of responsive design, the motivation behind these steps can be applied in some capacity to nearly all digital design endeavors that involve a designer and a stakeholder.
The pitch is fertile ground– fresh tilled soil if you will. You have the power to decide what type of work you want to do, how you want to do it, and who you want to do it with. Put on your game face and get prepared. Don’t wander into a meeting with stakeholders without being ready to handle virtually every question that could come up.
What’s your process? What should we do? What is your rate? How much will X cost? How long will X take?
The sale goes hand in hand with the pitch. If you weren’t prepared during your pitch, whether you sought out a client or they found you, you’ll be forced to conform to their process or lack thereof. If you don’t have a process or a plan, the client will set priorities instead of you. I’m not saying that clients shouldn’t set priorities, but rather their priorities should be tucked properly into your specifically and thoughtfully designed process.
The contract is signed, you’ve got your deposit and everyone’s excited. This is you’re chance to officially reinforce what you’ve pitched and sold in addition to the flow of the project. Here you should cover the client’s business objectives and goals (eg. “We want to capture email leads for our current and future products.”), as well as the plan to accomplish those goals. You should cover the team involved and who will be responsible for what. Deadlines, Content, Design, Development, and Deliverables should all be covered here. Explain your process, in what way you’ll present your work, and how the client should give feedback, and at what time. Cover how you’ll incorporate feedback and at which points in the project will it be too late to give certain feedback (eg. Major design changes during launch is too late.)
The goals of the project, drive the project. But even deeper than that, you need to excavate the why behind the goals. Sometimes the why is clear: “We want to sell our thing to make money.”
Other times it’s foggy: “We want to collect emails.” Lots of assumptions can be made about collecting emails but the idea behind goal setting is getting everyone on the same page about what will make the project a success. The less abstract the better. You need details. Lots and lots of details. If the client has already prescribed a solution to their problem, you need to interrogate the solution mercilessly. Poke holes in it. Challenge it. You need to make sure you’re solving the root issue and not just a side effect of a root issue.
Once at MailChimp headquarters, I sat in on a presentation by Michael Lopp, who worked at Apple for over 8 years. He talked about how Apple had DFRs (Directly Responsible For) on each team. These DFRs were directly responsible for a specific area of a project. If Steve Jobs thought, “Why are these animations screwed up on iOS?” He could go immediately to the DFR over animation.
We need DFRs on our projects too. It may feel slightly uncomfortable at first to link your name and everyone else’s name with a specific item, but that’s what needs to be done. Extreme accountability.
Who’s doing what. We need specifics here too. From your side and the client’s side. You need to know who will be your main contact. Are they answering to others or do they have final authority to approve decisions? If they have a boss who will make final decisions, you need to know that too. Ideally, you could have access to that boss, and involve that person in the conversations surrounding the details of the project.
Who’s in charge of the content? Who has final say over the button labels? Own it. There’s an old saying that goes “Measure twice. Cut once.”
Again. Get specific. No vague answers like “early 2015” or sometime in the next few weeks. Nail it down. Set a date. Make it real. This puts the necessary pressure on everyone involved to get their stuff done on time. This is especially crucial when dependencies exist between team members. For example, “We can’t launch the website until the copy is final.” Great, who’s in charge of the copy? When will they have it done? Is anyone going to review it? Who? When? Make sure there are deadlines for the work that needs to be done.
Consulting Company (You!) - Initial wireframe review (if you’re even doing wireframes) - Initial UI maps or visual exploration (style tiles, element collage, etc.) - Initial development build. This can be rough, it’s ok if it doesn’t match initial visual designs just yet, the client needs to start seeing things in a browser, because that’s when it becomes real. - Content reviews (if you’re helping with the content) - Subsequent reviews of the previously listed items - Etc.
Set deadlines for everything, not just the pie in the sky launch date. Oh and while I’m at it, when has anyone ever launched anything in one day. We need to start thinking of launch week or launch month instead. I’ve never launched one thing that I didn’t immediately need to tweak once it was live, which is another big reason to get the site into the browser as soon as possible.
Equally important, make sure everyone knows about and agrees to the deadlines. It’s easy to vaguely set deadlines and assume everyone will follow them, but it’s more difficult upfront to explicitly express and gather unanimous sign off on each deadline. This one act alone can work wonders for the flow of the project. No client colleague can swoop and poop on the designs right before the project goes live and demand changes if the person directly responsible for the sign off has indeed signed off.
We’re pirates on a treasure hunt here and should have a nice map to use based on the previous steps. During this block of time dedicated to research and discovery, we’ll familiarize ourselves with the material. This is when we need to transform ourselves into a Sponge Bob and soak as much information as possible.
Are we working on a redesign or starting from scratch? There should be a lot of back and forth with you and the client during this time. Ask, ask, ask, ask, ask. Don’t assume too much during this period. Clarify objectives for the site. Find other sites or applications that do similar things and study them. Soak up as much information as possible, including but not limited to:
Define what you’re trying to do here and ask the most important question– why are we trying to do it? Don’t settle for an answer like, “We’re trying to make a responsive website, because the client is paying me to.” Challenge yourself and the client to uncover the core essence of the digital exercise. Are you selling something? Do you want to collect email addresses? Do you want people to use your app?
Study the sites that the client has told you she likes. Ask why she likes them. Determine if the examples are relevant or not, discuss with your client.
Pull inspiration from other places– colors, UI patterns, color schemes, screenshots of sites and apps.
As the designer, you are the human advocate– a liaison for the users. Put yourself in their shoes to understand their wants, their needs, and their desires so you don’t have a one-sided view of the project as a whole.
Examine closely what exists and what doesn’t and see how it all fits together. Perhaps you’re redesigning an e-commerce site, so you examine the retailer’s product line-up, the categorization of goods, the hierarchy, and start plotting these things like pieces of a puzzle. Are there duplicated batches of information? Could their be a clearer presentation format? Does the content seem confusing as it exists or could items be moved around to be made more simple.
Some people like to use sticky notes and have everything up on a wall, which works great for group sessions, but if you’re like me you may want to make a good old fashioned ordered list in a word document. You can do this by examining existing content, by working with the client to determine future content, or in some cases a combination of both.
The Content is the most important piece of our digital puzzle. The proverbial meat to the bones. You can think of the content like a human’s muscles. If the content is strong and well defined, the appeal to users will be as well. If the content is weak and lacking, it won’t be able to perform well and won’t be able to command much attention.
When I first got started in web design, I put very little thought into the content. My designs were art and I was serving myself. Overtime I realized that my designs are merely an empty vessel to serve up knowledge and information to the Almighty User. Yes they’ll have a certain flavor, but the designs are ultimately a tool for serving (and persuading).
An experience will fall flat when the content is an afterthought. Early on in the kickoff as well as during research and discovery phase, talk about the content with your client. Devise a game plan for who’s directly responsible for the content and how it will be implemented.
I typically divide a project’s design phase into two sections, depending on the scope and team dynamic:
These two sections are unique and individualistic, yet dependent and intertwined around each other. But alone they can’t do much without considering the content and the code. All of these pieces work together in concert much like a human body in the real world.
“Everything is so interconnected that nobody has a clear domain of work any longer— the walls are gone, so we’re left to learn how to collaborate in the spaces where things connect.”
Interconnectedness is the name of the game. We can no longer treat design, development, etc. as completely separate things. They’re all dependent on each other. Consider the human body, how the skeleton provides a framework and structure for the muscles to wrap around. The skin, hair, eyes, etc. provides the visual layer for all that lies beneath. And the organs (brain, heart, lungs, etc.) brings everything to life. It’s all interconnected and dependent. Likewise with our websites.
If the skeleton provides structure for our bodies, so does the IA for our websites. If something is broken, it’s painful. If we can sign up for a newsletter but can’t ever seem to unsubscribe, that’s broken. If we try to order some food from a local restaurant’s website and keep getting a PDF, that’s broken.
Structure is important for our bodies and our websites. The smallest fracture can cause unbearable pain. In contrast, a healthy skeletal system is appropriately crafted to provide a solid structure for the rest of the body to balance. The muscles, organs, and everything in between are tucked within the skeleton. Similarly our content, visual designs, and even lines of code are nestled into place in accordance with the site’s IA. Sorting out the structure of your site in some form or fashion is incredibly important.
The content serves as the muscular structure for your project. If the content is strong and well-defined your project will have plenty of substance to maintain active visitors, who can ultimately be persuaded to take action based on a set of business objectives. Think of Apple. Visit their site to check out the MacBook Pros and every detail is covered about the capabilities, the manufacturing process, the thought that went into the design, not to mention the software that comes pre-installed. You could spend hours combing through all of the content. It’s well-defined, sculpted, and attractive, not unlike the physique of a professional athlete with his or her fit body capable of great feats of strength and skill.
On the other hand, it would be easy for Apple to completely bombard their website users with a barrage of information overload, but they elegantly layer the information in a well-structured format– served appropriately in bite-sized chunks. The content is properly placed and well-rounded, not like the guy at the gym who only does curls and has freakishly large biceps that overshadow the rest of his body.
When we meet another person for the first time, we literally interface with that person. Interface is defined as “a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc., meet and interact.” When we shake hands with someone, we feel the strength of their grip, look into their eyes, notice details about their face, hair and skin. We make judgements instantaneously. We decide quickly how we feel about that person. Was our interaction fluid? Awkward? Fun? Average? Was the person impressive? Did they seem prideful and arrogant or meek and humble? Were they genuinely interested in you or were they only self-seeking?
We can ask the same questions about an interface design. The interface is the single point of contact between humans and machines, but the interface itself is not a self-contained object. It’s deeply connected to the content and the structure of the site. Like skin grafted to muscle, wrapping around bones, the interface is the presentation layer for all of the thought, effort, and work that was poured out into the creation of the system as a whole.
A strong skeleton with healthy muscles, healthy skin, well-kept and well-groomed, is ideal for the human body, and ideal for a website. Good structure, good content, and visually appealing features all working together harmoniously.
This makes everything tick. The brain, the heart, the lungs. Organs give life to our bodies and empower the necessary functions for survival, both voluntary and involuntary. To be as efficient as possible, our code powers the predetermined structure, content, and interface. Any lines of code written that do not directly affect the website are fluff– extraneous bits of data that simply create longer load times and rack up technical debt. Just like the structure, content, and appearance, the code should be succinct and necessary.
When designing, you need to have a strong opinion about each detail of your layout while respecting the constraints of front end development. Can your designs be easily reproduced in HTML/CSS or is there some heavy customization involved. Customization isn’t inherently bad, but you need to make sure that you’ve calculated that decision with the developer and you both agree that it’s necessary and not a poorly thought out design that relies on customization to cover the mistakes.
The majority of thoughts and articles on responsive design seem to focus primarily on this main area–development. Perhaps rightly so since this is, you know, what makes the actual thing work. But too much jargon and deep focus without a clear vision of the larger picture can alienate people who just aren’t there yet with their skills and understanding. So for this post’s sake, I’m covering this section from a strategic point of view, not a tactical one.
I am a designer. I identify myself as a designer even though I can write HTML/CSS, enjoy writing SASS, and (if the need arises) hack my way around in JavaScript. Heck, the first language I ever learned was Actionscript 2.0, back in the Flash era. But still, I’m a designer. It’s what I’m best at so I shy away from being directly responsible for the code base of an entire client project.
With all that being said, it’s really important to start the development of a website as early as possible in the process. Actually writing code. If you’re a “web designer” that doesn’t know how to code (or at the very least the principles of how HTML and CSS work), you need to be in conversation with the developer on the project as early and as often as you can during the design process. The developer can build an early core structure and help you make decisions that will improve the overall quality of the site.
Showing clients a coded version of their site in-progress, even if it’s blocky and un-styled will produce results above and beyond what static comps can do by themselves. As long as you’ve properly outlined your process during the kickoff and the client has a clear understanding of how design and development converge to form the final product.
In the end you should be delivering a website, not a set of static comps. I’m guilty of this many times over and nearly every time it’s happened I’ve cringed when seeing the final product that was handed off by me and developed by some stranger. These are the projects where I only want to put my preciously designed comps in my portfolio without a link to the final coded bastardization of my beautiful art. I’m exaggerating, but it’s my own fault if this happens.
Seeing a project through to the end is hard work, and by the time the coded designs are up and running, you’re probably sick of looking at it all, only noticing the mistakes. But it’s crucial that you as the designer are involved in the deployment of the site, if (and it’s a big if) you care enough about the project to get your hands dirty in the eleventh hour. I hope you do. We’re all counting on you to make something great– so is your client.
In nearly every project I’ve been involved in, the seemingly best results are in the final 10% of CSS tweaks. The details. The polish. The painful back and forth of tweak after tweak, which at the time may seem trivial, but in the end provides a cleaner and more holistic experience for the end user, who may not notice the subtle details directly, but they will notice a site and a design that feels “clean” and fits together nicely. They may not know why and that’s precisely the point. You’ve done the hard work of pushing, finessing, crafting, and tweaking the final product, so the burden of connecting the dots and sorting information isn’t on the user. You’ve relieved them from that arduous task. You’ve designed a website.
Every layer of separation between the design, development, content creation, and decision making, adds an unknown variable to the web design process. The more separation, the more variables. The more variables, the more time and effort each task will take.
Everyone’s brain works differently, so not all concepts will be understood the same way. A developer will tend to think of concepts in terms of how everything relates to the data under the hood, and what is and isn’t technically possible. A designer will tend to think of concepts in terms of the interface.
Everything is connected so make sure you spend lots of time in the gaps where things overlap. Take the process outlined above and make it your own. Your project will be different and may not need certain steps, but you can move forward with confidence and boldness having a plan of attack. Go forth and make websites!

The Democracy Center works to foster a more vibrant local and global democracy by supporting more sustainable, united and stronger communities of action. We do this by providing non-profits and other groups, which directly promote our mission, affordable space for meetings, events, fundraisers, etc. and by connecting student organizers to local campaigns.
Since its founding in 2001, the Democracy Center has gone through many changes. The Center is a vibrant activist and progressive community space located in the heart of Harvard Square. In a city where independent non-commercial space is rare, the Center provides an exciting alternative space for a variety of student and community groups in and around the Boston area.
The Center has become a true progressive community hub. From 60 families who pick up their farm shares every week in the summer, to local youth after-school programs, to author and Obama’s transition team strategist Mike Lux presenting his new book, the Center offers the progressive community a place to meet, network, collaborate and participate in other cultural and educational activities. In addition to providing space for events, movie showings, meetings, workshops, and classes, we are taking the first steps to develop our student-community organizing initiative. Our work lies in providing both student and community groups with the necessary information, training, and tools to work together in order to achieve our common goals for justice with peace.
By offering affordable space and logistical resources to organizers, activists, creatives, and neighbors, particularly those with little or no budget, the Democracy Center’s Meetinghouse Program supports vibrant community organizing and community building toward a more sustainable, just, connected, expressive and equitable world.
The Meetinghouse Program covers the ground level of the Democracy Center. This includes the four rentable rooms and access to common spaces (e.g., bathroom) in the center. On a case-by-case basis, it can include the Democracy Center Coordinator’s assistance in planning events.
Community Organizing and Community Building - the Meetinghouse Program explicitly promotes and supports people and projects aimed at bringing about a more sustainable, just, connected, expressive and equitable world. We encourage un(der)funded progressive organizations to use the space.
Inclusion and Partnership - We specifically encourage LGBTQIA2&+ people, people of color, women, neurodivergent folks, poor and working class people, undocumented immigrants, formerly incarcerated people, and youth to use our space to grow their movements. We do not and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), immigration status, education, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, housing status, prior conviction record, or military status.
Unfortunately, the Democracy Center is only partially wheelchair accessible, no accessible bathroom on site. The Mandela, Parks, and Chavez rooms are accessible, but the Library is not. Wheelchair users are welcome to use the accessible restroom at Daedalus while we plan our improvements for bathroom accessibility. To reach that bathroom, exit the ramp and turn left on Bow St, at the next building (Daedalus) use their accessible entrance and their restroom will be on the right.
Our work to support community organizing and community building means that we are explicitly a working and building space for progressive movements. We do not host personal, private social functions (e.g., birthday parties). Event requests are evaluated by the Democracy Center Coordinator for how well they align with the Meetinghouse Program’s mission.
The Democracy Center coordinator exercises sole discretion on decisions about event bookings. We welcome events and organizations from a wide ecosystem of approach and understanding while striving to maintain an atmosphere of accountable community, where traditionally marginalized people can thrive.
In terms of maintaining a healthier and safer space for everyone, event organizers take primary responsibility for what happens at their events. Problems, abuses, and conflicts should be reported to the Democracy Center Coordinator, who may facilitate, support, or intervene as needed.
At our heart, the Meetinghouse Program strives to create a community center atmosphere: honesty, transparency, collaboration, communication, grace, and flexibility from all parties make our work more successful and nourishing.
For years, some of the most popular and critically acclaimed series on television have been produced by and aired on the pay-TV network HBO. That was good news for HBO but bad news for viewers who balked at the idea of having to pay for an expensive, extensive cable TV package just to be able to watch The Sopranos or Game of Thrones. Those viewers finally got what they'd been asking for in 2015, when HBO launched HBO Now, a stand-alone subscription service that allows viewers access to HBO programming on TVs, computers and mobile devices without the need for a cable TV subscription.
A subscription to HBO Now includes access to HBO's entire catalog of series, including both current offerings and now-defunct series. That means that viewers can watch the entire run of shows such as The Sopranos, Sex in the City, Deadwood, True Blood, The Wire, Entourage and Big Love, and they can also stay up to date with current favorites such as Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, Veep and The Leftovers. New episodes of these current series are available on HBO Now as soon as they air on the traditional network.
In addition to episodic scripted series, HBO Now also includes access to nonfiction series such as Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and special programming such as Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo.

Construction output is reportedly on the rise again, but risks from the economic uncertainty around Brexit, post-Grenfell regulatory changes and the well-documented skills shortages in building trades are raising a lot of questions about the future for the builders’ merchants industry.
That’s why the Build Show is aiming to give builders’ merchants the most well-informed, forward-looking predictions, innovations and insights they need, as part of the construction industry’s largest event, UK Construction Week, which returns to the NEC from 9 to 11 October.
Focusing on UKCW’s theme for 2018, the future of construction, the Build Show will feature the latest advancements in building products, policy and projects, all designed to help builders’ merchants stay up to date and one step ahead of their competitors.
Nathan Garnett, UKCW event director, said: “For most people working in the trades, finding the time to keep up to date with the latest products and sourcing the best deals while juggling work commitments feels impossible.
“That’s why the Build Show is always an unmissable event for specialist trades and general builders. It brings the latest products, ideas and manufacturers to one place and is broken down into specific sections to make the search easier. It’s a much-needed opportunity to be inspired and encouraged, to make deals, and to take away lots of new ideas and products to apply straight away.”
Jamie Govier, Managing Director of Build Show’s major sponsor, Easy-Trim Roofing and Construction Products, said: “This year the Easy-Trim stand will take a glimpse into the future of British manufacturing. We have come a long way yet our journey has just begun.”
New for 2018 are four additional sections to the show, with more than 100 exclusive product launches planned in Offsite; Doors, Windows and Glass; Roofing, Cladding and Insulation; and Tools, Health and Safety.
The Offsite Theatre, supported by the Modular and Portable Building Association, will offer sessions on all aspects of premanufacturing, volumetric and other types of offsite construction. With almost every volume housebuilder now actively exploring these methods of construction, it is essential to understand the new opportunities that this presents.
The most innovative products will be on display throughout the Build Show via the Innovation Trail, with the opportunity to talk to manufacturers about the solutions their products can offer. Companies being featured in this year’s Innovation Trail include Addex Group, Fischer Fixings, Quinn Building Products, Rawlplug, Rockwool, Soudal, Styrene Packaging & Insulation and Velux.
The Regeneration Hub, sponsored by Easy-Trim, will explore the latest developments, trends, innovations and projects that are going to rejuvenate cities and towns across the UK, boost local communities, improve transportation links, and provide office spaces and housing. Experts speaking in the hub will include Jules Pipe, the GLA’s deputy mayor for planning, regeneration and skills; Tim Bloxham, director of Urban Splash; and Brian Berry, director of the Federation of Master Builders.
The Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment will also be holding its conference addressing sustainability on 10 October and, after hearing from the experts, delegates will be able to meet environmentally-conscious manufacturers such as Kedel, a company that manufactures all its products from recycled plastic.
It will be the third year of the BMF Pavilion, which will host the first BMF Young Merchants Conference on 11 October, with guest speaker Olympian Steve Backley OBE. The theme for the conference is ‘Building for the Future’ and fits in perfectly with the overall theme of this year’s UKCW. BMF members exhibiting at the show include Danosa, Fibo, Intact, Kingspan, Marley Plumbing & Drainage, and Marsh Industries.
This year also sees the launch of the UKCW Role Models Campaign to champion the existing talent in the industry and to inspire the next generation.
Role models are taking part in an outreach programme, going to colleges and schools in the coming months to talk to students and teachers at key stages of their education to explain what inspired them to choose construction as a career and to bust any myths around the image of construction.
Thirty seven inspiring men and women have recently been shortlisted for this campaign, and the overall Role Model of the Year will be announced on 10 October.
Debates on major national and international construction issues will take place on the UKCW Stage. Speakers already confirmed include Phil Wilbraham, Expansion Programme Director at Heathrow; Bridget Rosewell OBE, Commissioner at the National Infrastructure Commission; Ben Derbyshire, RIBA President; and Ruth Davidson, National Housing Federation Executive Director.
Other benefits for visitors include an extensive programme of free CPD sessions, the Beer & Ale Festival, sponsored by Velux, and a chance to celebrate with the Construction Enquirer Awards.
Last year was UKCW’s most successful yet with more than 30,000 trade visitors. This year is set to be even bigger with a forecast of 35,000 visitors.
Ninety percent of visitors to the Build Show say they are there to source new products and suppliers, 79% to network with suppliers and other visitors, and 76% to talk to product experts and exhibitors’ technical staff.
They included 3,771 professionals from architectural and design firms, more than 3,000 contractors and 7,651 housebuilders and developers.
Free tickets for visitors are also available now available. They also allow access to the other UK Construction Week shows: Building Tech Live, Timber Expo, Civils Expo, Surface & Materials Show, Plant & Machinery Live, HVAC 2018 and Energy 2018, as well as Grand Designs Live on 10 and 11 October.
Keep up to date with the latest information about exhibitors, product launches and speakers at the Build Show via the website and on Twitter at @BuildShow or using the hashtag #BuildShow2018.
With only hours left until this year’s Build Show sponsored by Easy-Trim kicks off, builders’ merchants still undecided about making the journey will want to take a look at the latest announcements about what’s on at the show at Birmingham’s NEC between 9-11 October, before they miss out on the industry’s biggest event of the year.

Track barriers originally were erected to keep cars separated from spectators. In addition to concrete walls to prevent the cars from driving off track, debris-spewing accidents necessitated fencing to contain airborne objects.
Catchfences should have the same properties as walls, but they can’t block the view. Chain link fence is a good compromise: It’s cheap, plentiful, easy to put up and surprisingly strong given its high visibility.
Chain-link fabric is an elastic metal mesh. It can give in two ways: gentle forces cause the mesh to deform. The diamonds stretch out of shape, but when the force is removed, the fabric springs back to its original shape. The fence can also deform by stretching the wires that make up the mesh. A large-enough force will break the wire entirely.
The All Star Race, let’s face it, is a series of gimmicks strung together in the cause of entertainment. Not that there’s anything wrong with doing that. It’s what every sport does. People like home runs? Then let’s have an ‘event’ in which people just try to hit home runs. People…

When Sandbank invited us for the media launch of their International Breakfast Buffet, I was doubtful that the teenagers would want to join us so early in the morning on a weekend as that is the only time they get to sleep in, but I had a resounding, "Yes!"
The last time we were invited here, everyone had such a swell time. This time, with the introduction of the buffet, the kids couldn't ask for a better place to have breakfast!
#5 was in such high spirits, helping himself to the fried chicken wings, roti prata, mini hash browns, sausages, ham and bacon! What a treat for him.
The spread was extensive enough, with usual breakfast items like nasi lemak, porridge with condiments, chicken pau, an assortment of breads, baked beans, cold cuts, chicken curry, pancakes and cereal which the kids had fun dispensing by themselves.
For the egg station, we normally go for the omelette or sunny side up. Here, they even have egg benedict!
The kids remarked that this place comes the closest to feeling like we are on vacation at a resort, where we go down to the hotel lobby for buffet breakfast, and spend the whole day by the beach. Such a wonderful place for the family to bond and unwind from the stresses of the week.
As it was a media event, the kids were kept entertained with balloon twisting and glitter tattoo by Weekends Pte Ltd.
After they had their fill of yummy food, the younger kids couldn't resist the inviting pool and quickly changed into their swimmers. The simple toys we had brought along kept them happy for quite awhile!
After seeing them well-fed and playing merrily, I could sit down and enjoy another round of food in peace. When the kids are happy, mummy is happy.
Sandbank's Breakfast Buffet is available every Saturday, Sunday and on Public Holidays from 8.30am to 12noon. Adults: $19, Kids (from 4-12): $9.50. Do note that each seating is for 2 hours and reservations are recommended.
{GIVEAWAY} I am delighted to be able to giveaway a {Buffet for 4 PAX} at Sandbank at East Coast Park to 2 lucky families!
Leave a comment on Mummy Wee's Facebook post stating your name, email address and tell us what your kid's favourite breakfast food is! (You can also leave your email privately at mummyweedotcom@gmail.com)

Teachers get the entire summer off, right? Well....that's not quite true. The fact is, true teachers don't get the summer "off." They spend their summers scouring Pinterest, Facebook, teacher blogs, and Twitter for new ideas to incorporate into their curriculum the next year. In the middle of June, I was browsing Facebook and I saw this geometry idea that challenged my thinking.
The post was titled, "How to Turn 2 Circles into 1 Square" and you can find it here on their blog. I couldn't get my head wrapped around this and I had to watch the video.
I took to Twitter and tweeted the video to my teammates to keep in mind for our geometry unit this year. Our 2nd grade Texas learning standards have us "decomposing" shapes to make new shapes. First, I gave each learner an index card. We discussed the attributes of the card (it's a rectangle...four sides, and four vertices). Then, I told the class that I wanted them to cut the rectangle into two three-sided figures....with NO leftover pieces from the card. They did great! While a few kiddos had trouble at first, they quickly figured it out and we cut the rectangles into two triangles.
Now, it was time for a challenge. I had the learners pair up with a partner and take two strips of paper. We made the strips become circles by gluing the ends together. Finally, I told the partners their challenge was to make the two circles into one square.
This was a great opportunity to discuss the attributes of a square (four equal sides) and how it is similar, but different from a rectangle (where two sides are long and two sides are shorter).
This first group was QUICK QUICK to get it! And they eagerly and professionally shared their thinking with the class. They cut the two circles apart into lines and then glued them together into the form of a 3-D square.
This group did great thinking, too! They took the circles apart, then glued them on top of each other to make a perfect 2-D square.
I can't leave out these two future teachers! They needed to use the board and markers to teach everyone their thinking.

My sister, Kelly, and I planned a 8:00am 20 mile bike ride for this morning. As 8:00am is a late start for me, I decided to take advantage of my extra time this morning and make a traditional weekend breakfast of French Toast.
I dipped three tiny piece of Publix Bakery Multigrain bread into a mix of Almond Milk, Egg White and Cinnamon then browned it up on the stove top. Once the toast was finished I slathered the piece with a little Almond Butter and topped them with a mix of Syrup, Strawberries & Blueberries I had heated up in the microwave for a minute.
For the bike ride I had the pleasure of wearing my new bike skirt I purchased a couple of weeks ago.
Basically the bike skirt is a pair of regularly padded bike shorts with a skirt underneath. I was worried how practical the skirt would be on the bike, but it worked quite well.
As cute as the skirt was, the padding wasn’t as much as I was hoping. After 20 miles my butt was thankful to be done.
When we returned to the apartment my tummy was growling so I had a good sized snack to hold me over until lunch.
My platter consisted of a Multi-Bran Vita Top with a slather of Almond Butter, a Kiwi and Cherries. Yes, you can eat the kiwi with the skin on! 🙂
Mmmmm Kiwi is one of my favorite fruits. I don’t like the texture of the skin and tend to eat mine in with a spoon out of the skin “cup” 🙂
THey’re just cute athletic shoes from target. I hate riding my bike with my bulky running shoes and am too cheap to buy real bike shoes. These work perfectly 🙂
Hi Meghann! I just started my own blog, lenabanana.wordpress.com, and would really love it if u came and took a look!! I love ur blog and read it everyday! Thanks so so much,
I love riding my bike in the morning! I wish i had a path like that near my apartment. I usually ride on a busy road!
Enjoy the lunch! What a great looking breakfast! Restaurant quality for sure! Love working out in skirts….I need to get some more
Awesome bike ride today! I wish my sisters lived close to me! So glad you two get to do so much fun stuff together.
I think it’s awesome that the two of you do so much together!!! I live something like a 7 hour plane ride from my sister so that’s a no go.
I just caught up on your wonderful cruise vacation!!! HOW FUN!!! Looks like you two had such a blast:) Love the bike skirt I so need to check that out!!! Have fun today!
What a cute bike skirt! Have you ever tried running skirts – and if so, what kind do you like? I’ve thought about it but haven’t gotten around to getting one yet, I’ve heard they are super comfy!
Blog reading turned me on to eating kiwis with the skin still on – a good scrub, and they’re good to go 🙂
I was wondering about the shoes too 🙂 Are they biking shoes or just those cute keen-like ones with sneaker-ish bottoms?
oh man your breakfast french toast looks so tasty! I hope you have a nice time at your blogger lunch!
I have a super padded gel seat cover that helps way more than padded shorts. Gotta stay comfortable!
So nice that you can workout/catch up with your sissie. I wish my sister would do active activities with me! So cute of you two!
Ohmygoodness, I’ve never even seen a bike skirt before!!! When I was picking out bike shorts I just went with the ones with the thickest padding 😛 As always, I’m totally jealous of the wonderful bike paths in Florida!
I love your blog! What kind of bike do you have there (pictured)? I am really wanting to get into cycling, but am a total newbie and am trying to get some feedback on women’s bikes…

Meamorphism is a ground breaking new art movement developed by internationally known artist Ali Meamar in collaboration with Sony Corporation. This art movement combines traditional “fine art” making with the newest digital media technologies. Meamorphism pieces are created using Digital Canvases that provide the user with a dynamic viewing experience and that can be manipulated by the viewer. Each Meamorphism piece allows the viewer to see infinite variations of the artwork.
Meamar Dream : “Our mission is to promote the meamorphism art movement into education communities. We will achieve this by teaching the Meamorphism techniques and technology at the college and high school levels as well as in after-school programs.
By combining traditional art making with digital technology that most young people use on a daily basis, we strongly believe that Meamorphism will attract students back to art classes. Meamorphism will engage the young people in creation and innovation exercises. As the program develops many after-school programs will initiate classes for Meamorphism, which will allow to keep the youth off the streets and potentially safer and away from drugs. Many charity programs deal today with hunger but few programs deal with keeping the soul of our young generation healthy. Meamorphism is one such program. We need additional funding sources to help us finance the deployment of Meamorphism in the youth communities and especially in the high schools and colleges”.
Lots and lots and lot of sharpened sticks vs. lots of rifles, artillery, machine guns, bombs, etc.? Sticks lose.
With 20-plus years of coaching experience under her belt, including 12 seasons as a Division 1 head coach, Amanda Butler has all the tools and experience to take over the helm of the Clemson women’s basketball program. Butler stepped into her role as head coach on April 12, 2018, ready to make her mark on Clemson.
With an overall head coaching record of 230-159, Butler is no stranger to success, having led her team to 10 postseason berths in 12 years. Four of those 10 postseason appearances came in the NCAA Tournament, advancing to the Second Round three times and the First Round once.
In 12 years at the Division I level, Butler has coached her teams to seven 20-win seasons, including a 24-8 season while with the Gators, tying a program record for wins in a season.
Most recently, Butler spent 10 seasons at the head of the Florida Gators women’s basketball program, posting a 190-137 record in that span with eight postseason berths. She averaged 19.0 wins per season in her 10 years at Florida and was responsible for six of the program’s 15 total 20-win seasons.
Under her direction, the 2008-09 squad (24-8) cracked the top-25 in the national polls for the first time since the 2001-02 season. Butler coached the team to a program-best 15-game winning streak and won a program-record seven consecutive games against SEC teams.
Butler’s mentorship led to 10 All-SEC selections and eight All-SEC Freshman Team honorees during her 10 years at Florida. Following the spectacular 2008-09 season, Sha Brooks received WBCA and AP All-America Honorable Mention status.
As a coach, Butler was a United States Marine Corps/WBCA NCAA Division I National Coach of the Year finalist in 2016.
Butler began her head coaching career at Charlotte, where the 49ers posted a 40-22 record in two seasons. She led the 49ers to two WNIT berths and the team’s first-ever share of the Atlantic 10 Conference regular-season championship.
In her debut season, Butler’s team posted a 21-9 mark and a WNIT appearance, earning her Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year honors.

If anyone is the prophet of the punch line, it is Amos. He travels up from the south to preach to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel and he pulls no punches. "Woe to the complacent", he begins, and then in a quick series of brush strokes lets them know how God sees them: lying upon their beds, stretched out on their couches, eating their tender lamb and calves, drinking fine wine while the music plays and they anoint themselves with the best oils. Then, the punch line: they shall be the first to go into exile. The party is over!
In a similar vein Jesus paints a portrait of "Richman" - tradition has named him Dives (Latin for "rich man") - dressed in the best, eating the best, insulated in his own little world, while at his door Lazarus lies starving, with only dogs coming to lick his sores. It is a scene of total indifference to the plight of the poor. God's response is clear. The wheel will turn. And when it does, so shall Lazarus and Richman. What was a gap between them becomes a chasm.

The goodness of God whom we call Father, Son, and Holy Spirit has been clearly revealed to the world first through the People of Israel and then fully in the life and message of Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus the Christ, Jesus the Lord.
This goodness of God is shared with us each day in the Church and in our lives, and God’s goodness is promised to us in the eternal Kingdom. May we all receive life in God forever. God bless!
This weekend, March 10-11, every parish will hold the annual national Collection for the Catholic Campaign for Human Development. Your donations will go to help fund programs for the needy and poor in America as well as Mission efforts here in the United States. Thank you for your generosity!
Among our Church Alive Campaign goals, the fourth and final objective proposed by Father Ken White and the parish campaign team in 2013 was the demolition of the former convent and the rectory and the construction of a NEW Ministry Center. The cost of such a construction project was estimated to be at least $1.5+ million. About $400,000 of that amount was to be raised by the Church Alive Campaign, but as it stands, about $250,000 has been donated for such a NEW Ministry Center. An extra $1.25+ million would be needed.
Because of the upcoming On Mission parish mergers (first unveiled in 2016) and because constructing a New Ministry Center is cost prohibitive at this time, our pastor and the pastoral and finance councils have asked Bishop David Zubik and diocesan officials if we might use our remaining Campaign funds to upgrade our existing Ministry Center rather than build a new one. These funds would go toward replacing the roof, the electrical wiring, and possibly the windows.
By changing this Ministry Center project, we can use funds donated by our parish community to enhance this parish building and insure the continued presence of our former convent and current Ministry Center. At this time, officials of the Diocese have given permission to change the original plans and continue renovating our current Ministry Center.
Thank you for your annual support of our Parish Share Campaign which allows us to support Bishop Zubik and our Diocesan Church of Pittsburgh! Our 2018 Parish Share Campaign has begun, and all registered households have been sent your campaign pledge letter.
Our 2018 Parish Share goal is to raise $67,780 for the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. Each household is asked to contribute $250 or more at this time or to make an 11 month pledge. On behalf of our Bishop and our entire Diocesan Church, thank you for helping our parish community to meet our 2018 Parish Share goal before Easter Sunday!

Delegate Bob Marshall, the notoriously anti-gay legislator from Manassas has apparently recovered from his apoplectic fit he threw when the court struck down his beloved anti-marriage equality amendment. For the 2015 session he has introduced HB1414. This little piece of work seeks to exempt state employees or officials from having to help gay citizens.
Provides that a person shall not be required to perform, assist, consent to, or participate in any action or refrain from performing, assisting, consenting to, or participating in any action as a condition of obtaining or renewing a government-issued license, registration, or certificate where such condition would violate the religious or moral convictions of such person with respect to same-sex marriage or homosexual behavior.
He has the gall to call it a “conscience clause”. The irony is that the judge who struck down his anti-marriage amendment cited an animus on the part of the state to its LGBT citizens. I guess animus never goes out of fashion.
Even if there were a legitimate religious reason for having such a law (and the legitimacy of any such reason is up for healthy debate), freedom of religion is only one of the freedoms that we enjoy in America. It is just one among many and must be balanced against the other freedoms we enjoy.
However, even bothering to have that debate gives Marshall more legitimacy than he deserves. This bill is state-sponsored discrimination, pure and simple. To call it anything else is to miss that Marshall is using religion to attack a group of people simply because he doesn’t like them. It is more than past time for Virginia to be done with this nonsense.
I urge everyone in Virginia to write to your state delegates and senators to urge them to vote against this bill.
Fortunately, Governor McAuliffe has said he will veto this if it gets to him but it would be best if it never got that far. Please contact your state delegates and senators and ask them to vote this atrocity down!

By William Essilfie and Veronica Roach on April 21, 2017 in Arts and Entertainment, NYC, Politics, Reviews, Theater
After a previously sold-out run off-Broadway, Lynn Nottage’s breathtaking play, Sweat, opened recently at the Studio 54 theater. The show, based in Reading, PA, focuses on deindustrialization and its lasting ramifications. In our current political climate, Sweat’s arrival could not be more timely. The show forces its audience to fully delve into the lives of blue-collar workers in America. In a country becoming increasingly divided, as evidenced through the 2016 Presidential Elections, Sweat explores and explains with breathtaking eloquence and clarity the malaise that has spread through many segments of the nation.
For those who have not seen the show, it focuses on the lives of friends working together at a local steel mill. Slowly, as jealousy flares and the workers realize their jobs–and the cultural status that came with them–are dwindling, they each begin to turn on each other. In trying so hard to save themselves and clinging to the work ideals many of their past family members have learned to expect, they are forced to find new work as the impacts of globalization and deindustrialization affect their town.
The show’s strong text is paired with skilled actors and a mundane yet detailed set. The play is primarily set in the local bar, where audience members watch the lives of these workers unfurl as if they were flies on the wall. In each interaction, one can see the close friendships of the characters. In particular, the show focuses on the close bond between two friends: Tracey (played by Johanna Day) and Cynthia (played by Michelle Wilson). In initial scenes, the two characters laugh and drink, jovially sharing stories about their students and their factory jobs, just like normal close friends do. However, after Cynthia is promoted to a role off the factory floor, jealousy flares as Tracey copes with not getting the promotion she truly wanted. As this jealously increases, tensions rise with conversations about race (as Tracey becomes convinced Cynthia was promoted solely for being Black) and the responsibilities of friendships.
To learn more about the show and how it came to be, we sat down with its playwright Lynn Nottage who–in addition to playwriting–is a Professor at Columbia’s School of the Arts. Nottage, originally from Brooklyn, studied at Brown University for her undergraduate degree and later studied and taught at the Yale School of Drama. She has won two Pultizer Prizes and received both the Guggenheim Fellowship and MacArthur Grant.
As the new semester begins, The Lion will be spending some time in Uniquely Human on other people — how we interact with them, how they interact with us, and how those interactions shape our personality. This is the first column in our new series.
Columbia students spend a lot of time in elevators. Imagine – you step into an empty elevator on the top floor of a building. As you descend, one, two, even three people walk into the elevator, an experience so typical you hardly notice. But this time as they enter, something curious happens.
After walking in the elevator, each person faces the back instead of turning around to face the front doors. While one person doing this may go unnoticed, after two or three people perform this strange action you too turn around to face the back.
Although your instinct may be to resist that ending to the story, from its origin on Candid Camera in the 1950s, through multiple scientific studies the result is always the same — the majority of people will adopt the new social norm.
This action of changing your behavior to adapt to those around you is called social referencing, and for decades, its powerful sway over social activities has been confirmed in sociological and psychological studies. That people would adapt their behavior to their social situations is not itself revolutionary, although the extent to which people adopt ‘non-logical’ behaviors to fit in a new social norm can often be humorous.
The truly controversial idea is a much newer one, and comes out of modern neuroscience: not only do you change your external behaviors to adjust to a new social environment, your core personality adjusts to fit with a new social reality.
This brain re-wiring can perhaps paradoxically be best illustrated by when the system goes wrong. Have you ever flinched when you have seen someone get hit in a particularly painful location, or felt warm when you have seen two people hug? Now imagine if instead of experiencing a vague sense of those feelings, you physically felt every sensation you saw in someone else. Every touch is replicated on your arm, with every swallow you see you feel the food slither down your throat, and the pain of another sharply becomes your own.
This condition is called mirror-touch synesthesia, and it is one of the most common synesthesias – an estimated 1.5% of the population experiences the world this way. While the physical aspects of this disorder are fascinating and deserve their own column, where it really gets interesting is in how synesthetes experience emotional reactions.
In a number of mirror-touch synesthetes, the act of seeing someone respond emotionally causes a mirrored emotional response. Because they can acutely feel the happiness, sadness, anguish of the people around them, it can become incredibly difficult for mirror-touch synesthetes to distinguish their own emotions from the emotions of those around them. They find themselves disappearing into others.
As is common in neuroscience, observing such an extreme example of a system going wrong teaches us about how the system should work under normal circumstances. One possible explanation comes from mirror neurons. Discovered a little over a decade ago in monkeys and recently in humans, mirror neurons are cells located in parts of the brain corresponding to sensation and motor activity.
Unlike other cells nearby, these special mirror neurons fire identically both when they are performing an activity, like processing touch or moving your arm, and when observing someone else do the same task. While the purpose of these neurons is still speculative, there is evidence of their role in subconscious mimicry, empathy, self-awareness, and even theory of mind.
Of course, when a typical human observes other people, they don’t acutely feel those external sensations in the same way. That is because there are other inhibitory neurons ‘downstream’ of the mirror neurons, which stop you from acting on their firing. It’s likely that in mirror-touch synesthetes, that ‘turn off’ signal does not get sent, or the original signal from mirror neurons is so strong that it cannot be turned off.
So while mirror neurons might allow us all to understand each other at low levels of activity, cranking their response up causes people to in some ways become other people. Mirror touch synesthetes brings a normally subconscious process to the surface, and they raise some interesting questions in the process.
If we’re somehow experiencing the actions and emotions of other people within our own minds on a subconscious level, do these ‘outside’ factors become a part of us? Do we correspondingly change parts of our core personalities in response? We will seek to explore these very questions in the next column.
The Columbia Sertoma Club is one of the oldest and most prestigious SERVICE organizations in the Columbia area. Started in 1950, its mission is twofold: to raise money for other local charitable organizations by coordinating and hosting fundraising projects and events, and to encourage civic engagement by hosting weekly meetings featuring community leaders of all types.
Since 1950, the club has assisted approximately 100 local charities and raised approximately $4 million.

Meiló is the name of the cloud island owned by Sameiro Sousa, and there are three portals into this wonderfully topsy-turvy world. First is the garden on the upper level, where Sousa has installed some beautiful and airy artworks:
The home portal takes you to an upside-down house on the bottom of the island, stuffed with fabulous art!
And finally, the Underworld portal takes you a colourless vantage point to see the whole of the underside of the cloud island, completely with ghostly trees and faces:
We had been walking along the shore and it was time to go home. We made our way up the beach, the last part was quite steep shingle. I had the male biped attached to me by a long lead. He said, “I’ll race you to the top, Clowie!”
We started running side by side. Our paws (and feet) slipped back with each step, it was difficult to go fast. I knew I’d be able to win because four paws are better than two feet on a slope. I started to get ahead of him and then I realised I needed some help with a problem, so I sat. He didn’t notice, he kept running.
He stopped just before he reached the end of the lead and turned round. The female biped arrived next to me and asked, “What is it, Clowie?”
I held one of my front legs up and she knelt down and took my paw. She looked at the pads, I think she was checking for something sharp in them. Then she checked between my toes – that tickles, but I kept still so that she would continue and find the problem. She pressed each pad gently and I just kept still. She moved her hands up little by little until she’d almost reached my elbow.
Then she paused, she could feel something in the hair at the back of my leg. She leaned forward to get a better look. The male biped, who had returned, asked, “What is it? Can I help?”
She replied, “It’s dried out seaweed all tangled up in her fur. It’s really sharp and it’s digging into her armpit.”
They began pulling at the seaweed, but it was difficult for me to keep my balance. The female biped got up and stood beside me, so that I could lean on her. She held my leg up and held some of my hair out of the way, while the male biped pulled the seaweed away. After a few minutes of pulling and tugging, he asked the female to see if she could feel any seaweed left.
She said she couldn’t and she put my leg down. I stood up and moved my leg. I took a couple of steps. That felt so much better! I gave them both a nudge with my head to thank them. They smiled and patted me and then we climbed up the shingle together. When we reached the promenade a couple of bipeds approached us and asked if they could stroke me. They made a fuss of me and said they’d seen me stop and sit to get help. They told my bipeds that I’m really clever.
It’s always nice to get attention and to be told I’m clever, but asking for help from my bipeds was the obvious thing to do when seaweed was attacking me. Even a coral reef sends out a message for help to the fish that live in it, when it’s under attack by seaweed! Seaweed is usually harmless and smelly, but it can be nasty. Everyone needs a helping hand sometimes – those opposable thumbs can be really useful!
OUCH Clowie, good job your Mom saw that prickly stuff. I am always on the beach but my coat is short so I don’t get many unwanted visitors trying to crab a ride on me( look, I put crap instead of grab Bawahwhhaa). I sometimes cut my pads on sharp shells.. Have a wonderful week, catch ya next Wednesday xx00xx
Things do get tangled in a long coat sometimes. You actually put ‘crab’ – which is quite apt when we’re talking about the beach!
Oh no! I can’t even begin to imagine. That must have really hurt. Is the heavy dry seaweed a seasonal thing? Just curious if there are other times that might be best to visit. Glad you were helped out!
It was uncomfortable! We haven’t often come across dry seaweed. I think it needs a storm to drive it high onto the beach followed by good weather to dry it out. It usually stays damp and rots.
Youch! Clever you for letting them know your predicament. Must have hurt a lot. Our little girl Millie will stop on a walk and demand that something be removed that is irritating her – it must be a girl thing 😉
It did hurt and it was getting worse with each step. I think Millie has the right idea! I hate it when things get caught up in my fur. I like doing the things that get me messy, but then I like someone to help me get cleaned up!
You ARE clever, Clowie! Plus brave and strong. Thank goodness you’re such a good communicator. And that your bipeds understand you so well.
Thank you, Cupcake. They do usually understand what I’m telling them but not always. I hate having stuff stuck in my fur!
Wow, you are super duper clever Clowie! The worst thing our hooman encountered at a beach was she accidentally stood on a dead jellyfish in Australia! Even though it was dead it still managed sting her a bit and she had to get the hooman vets to look at it. Now she has a funny line of pale skin on the bottom of her foot from the tentacle!
Thank you. I hear jellyfish stings can be very painful, she was wise to sit and wait for help. Jellyfish are difficult to see when they’re on the beach, until it’s too late!
She said she didn’t even notice it until she lifted her foot up and it pulled away from the stingers. Luckily a life guard and local carried her up the beach and she was taken the hospital really quickly.
The ones I’ve seen look like little pools of water, until you look very closely. I’m glad she got help so quickly.
Clowie! Mean, nasty, icky, seaweed attacked you! I’m so glad your bipeds were there to help you otherwise you would have been terribly uncomfortable. I didn’t even know that kelp had sticky bits but I guess next trip to the shore you’d better AVOID that stuff…….! 😉
Hi Sammy! I don’t think it was particularly sticky, sometimes the long hair on the back of my legs is very good at trapping things and as I move it becomes more entangled. There are some disadvantages to having a long coat!
Moms are great, they always know when something is up and they help us out. Glad you were rescued from that seaweed!
I’ve never seen powdered kelp, but my bipeds eat some types of seaweed. They get dried sticks, which they soak before cooking.
Haha! The Newfs coats pick up all sorts of interesting things when out and about, but no seaweed (yet!). Good thing it was caught right away!
Yes, I expect you know exactly what I mean about some things working their way into the coat and being difficult to get out without pulling out a load of hair!
Bella and DiDi: That seaweed can be really uncomfortable. You are right in that we all need help at some point or another.
That’s funny, I taught my dog the same thing. I’d always say, “Sit if you need help”, and he learned it pretty quickly! It sure is nice to have a cue like that to be able to communicate that you need some assistance.
It’s great that you and your bipeds understand each other so well! I don’t like sharp, scratchy things on my skin, either, and I’m glad they got rid of that seaweed for you!
It was a relief when they got rid of the seaweed for me. I’m glad I can get my bipeds understand me most of the time.
Thank you, I’m really glad you like my tales. I don’t like it when things get caught up in my fur! I like the sea, but I like rivers and lakes even more.
Oh Clowie, what an important post and the value of helping each other and what a wonderful family you are. We have to admit we laughed (BOL) when you said that it tickled to have your paw inspected. That was cute. The rest was scary and we’re so glad you got relief. Wag wag, Max & Bella
Thank you, it is important to help each other out. I do find it difficult to keep my paws still when they’re checking them for me. I sometimes wriggle them at home when it’s just routine grooming!
I never thought about dried seaweed getting tangled in fur. Good things your bipeds were so attentive. 🙂
All sorts of things get tangled in my fur. Sticks, seeds, brambles… I’m glad they removed the seaweed for me.
Yeowzer Clowie, that is so unusual…and I thought you were living in the mtns??? This was at a beach? In Spain? Glad your female biped knew to look carefully…purrrrs, Savannah peeEss we are getting some professional photos next week of Ray Charles and Sister Rachel…will post as soon as we have them…we are workin’ hard to get them a home
We do live in the mountains and it’s usually plants that grow on them that I get stuck in my fur these days. This was on a holiday in England and it is unusual to come across dry seaweed – it’s usually wet and smelly!
Oh poor Clowie! Thank goodness your bipeds were there to help! I am so glad it doesn’t hurt anymore and you are right, without opposable thumbs we can’t do it ourselves! Barks and licks and love, Dakota
I’m glad they paid attention and sorted the seaweed out for me. Opposable thumbs are very useful sometimes!
Hi Clowie. Glad all is okay and what a cutie you are! Happy Wordless Wednesday from the BlogPaws Blog Hop!
I'm a Pyrenean Mountain Dog, or Great Pyrenees. I look after my bipeds and our cats. I enjoy blogging about my adventures.

How well we look as we grow older depends on many factors, such as eating healthy, exercising, and staying physically as well as mentally fit. Beyond this, some areas we don't have control over, such as genes. But there are plenty of other habits women often do as they grow older that can make them look older.
Don't be afraid to change it up: Yes, change happens. Don't fight it. Women's styles, in particular, change often, so keep up by changing your hair, makeup and clothes.
Spend some $$$ on yourself: Yes, you deserve it. As we grow older, our bodies change, so take the time to select good clothing that flatters your body.
Don't forget exercise: Yes, exercise is just as important as we grow older as it was when we were younger. In fact, exercise will keep our weight down, relieve aches and pains, and make us feel and even look better.
Don't skip on sleep: It's OK to sleep and even take naps if necessary. Sleep allows the body to rejuvenate. Depriving yourself of sleep will make you look older. More importantly, not getting enough sleep is linked to a greater risk of diabetes and other health problems.
Don't ignore your teeth: Not only is taking care of your teeth important for preventing gum disease that can even lead to heart problems, keeping your teeth white and gleaming will make you look younger.
Don't worry about wrinkles: This will only make you look older. No beauty products on the market will take away wrinkles as you grow older. Retinol can get rid of fine lines and wrinkles, but Botox and other types of invasive products and procedures can make you look fake. Wear those age lines proudly.
What is going on with your hair??: Hair, like skin, changes with age. Make sure you are changing, too. Ask your hairdresser to recommend a hair style, length and color that will flatter your looks.
When it comes to makeup, more is NOT better: Heavy makeup will only make you look older. Keep it light and simple. Read fashion magazines or ask your friends for recommendations on new makeup styles.
Let's talk about your bra: Well, let's just say that when the law of gravity kicks in, you need to invest in a good bra. Better department stores offer specialized bra-fitting services.
Sexy?: Sure, you can look feminine and attractive as you grow older. Growing older doesn't mean you have to look or act like a spinster. Hey, look at Jane Fonda -- sexy at 70!
Our work with the Painted Dog Conservation group has finished its second year now. As mentioned in the newsletter, we have identified and named 6 packs of dogs in Mana Pools numbering abo t 120 dogs, pending pup survivorship. There are now 4 dogs collared. The Vundu pack has 3 collars presently, the Alpha male and female and a 2 year old. The collar is due to come off the alpha female so that the data accumulated over a 2 year period can be down loaded. The collar on Cochise, the 2 year old was placed as he is a possible candidate to disperse from the pack and join another or start his own. READ MORE
It was on the evening drive when we found the pride of lions with the little cubs that we also found Nathan Pilcher and Carl Ruysenaar who have been in Hwange for nearly two months now filming lions. Mike knows Nathan well as they had spent time recording the release of the white -eye birds on North Island in the Seychelles in 2007. We wanted to catch up with the guys and find out what footage they had managed to collect during their stay here.
On one afternoon we all decided to get together to film and photograph elephants wallowing at the new mud wallow at Davisson’s Camp. Great plan, the only problem is no -one bothered to tell the elephants. So we had tea instead and chatted about what these guys have been up to.
Nathan has been with Aquavision for over six years now so he has had a lot of exposure and experience in wildlife filming. Wilderness and Aquavision have enjoyed a wonderful working relationship for many, many years now. Nathan’s brief was to film lion and elephant interaction during the dry season. This was based on the fact that there was a huge pride of lions in the concession last year, but now that pride has unbundled into smaller prides and they no longer are the monopoly of the area.
It is quite tricky to have a brief or plan in your mind as to what story you want to tell in terms of wildlife, because usually what happens is that another story develops instead of the one you want to tell. Just like animals and raising teenagers: the way you think it is going to work out doesn’t always go that w ay. C’est la vie.
There is a pan to the south west of Davisson’s called Ngamo. Mike absolutely loves this area. It is almost like a world of its own because it has different vegetation and in the dry season it looks flat and desolate. You can see the heat haze rising from the sandy earth off this flat moon -scape pan that stretches almost more than five km’s from one side to the other. In the middle there is a windmill that looks like a single lonely tinsel decoration on a Christmas tree as it glistens in th e heat and reflection of the sun.
It is here that Nathan and Carl discovered a new story. A lone male cheetah who is a unique and cheeky character. It appears he fights way above his weight. They filmed him trying to take down a waterbuck – this is amazing. Normally cheetah would form a coalition to take on such a large antelope, but not this guy. And while this was all going on, elephant and baboon were going about their normal business of getting to the water across this vast pan before moving on to sear ch for feed in this drying landscape. A heady capture for wildlife filming for sure.
Apparently, this cheeky cheetah is not scared to take on kudu and scoffs at impala – a mere snack not worth the energy to take down! He is a big boy and Mike and I had the great pleasure of seeing him at Ngamo. We photographed him taking a sundowner at one of the pools there’¦it was pure magic to see.
And now back to the brief of the lions. The interaction that Nathan and Carl are hoping for is not apparent as yet, but there is another month of dry season so we will wait and see. In the meantime, the guys are up early and out late. Putting in a fourteen hour day in this magical office is what a lot of people dream about. It is hard work; physically and mentally. There is a lot of waiting and a lot of nothing. But when something magical happens -what a life! – Marian
Mike and Marian Myers have embarked on an exciting new adventure! Follow this bushwhacker and city girl through news, views, videos and photos posted weekly on their blog “Mike and Marian on Safari’.
When we first arrived, Ron Goatley, MD of Wilderness Zimbabwe, took us out and showed us the concession and the main roads. We all know that main roads in the bush look absolutely nothing like main roads at all. They look like bush roads that are bumpy and windy and look exactly the same as one another. In fact, I could just be driven round in a massive circle and probably wouldn’t know my way back to camp.
But on Thursday, it was our turn to ‘˜fly solo’. As Mike has guided for many, many years, being in the bush is so natural for him and it didn’t take long to get the feel for where we were heading. So we set off for Madison Pan which is on the way to the airstrip and then to the second pan past the airstrip, with the intention of landing up at Broken Rifle Tree.
Everything in the bush has a story behind it. So you can imagine the intrigue about Broken Rifle Tree. Whichever way you think about it, it doesn’t sound good. Once upon a time, way back in the day when the concession was first secured by Wilderness; Ron Goatley, Brian Worsely and Duncan Edwards were scouting the area and took a rest under the tree to ponder. Duncan decided to get a better look around so he climbed up the tree. Although Brian told Duncan exactly where the riffle had been placed, Duncan managed to jump down from the tree, straight onto the rifle and break it. And that is how the pan got its name.
When we got to Broken Rifle Tree, there was nothing happening. It seems if you just settle down in the shade of one of the trees there, something will happen. And it did. Elephants started to file out from the bush across the pan. Two bulls: one old bull and one Askari. In elephant terms an Askari is a young elephant bull that hangs around with an older elephant bull to learn about life. The word is derived from Arabic and used in many ways, but most usually it means ‘soldier’ and was used in central African colonies where local soldiers served with European colonial troops.
It was like watching theatre: elephants enter stage left; elephants enter stage right. Baboons everywhere filling in the gaps and from front left came three beautiful sable antelope. Birds also came in to drink: lots of yellow-billed kites and an African hawk -eagle. It was a pantomime – which is always fun.
When the show was over for us and we had enough magical footage, we left to find the road to Davisson’s Camp. Mike was delighted with his first video footage as it seemed to look good for a first attempt. Lots of exploring and learning ahead! – Mike & Marian
If you practice yoga, you will have heard instruction to keep yourself grounded in any of the poses that you go into. But even if you don’t practice yoga, you will have heard the expression to keep your feet on the ground as a way to say that you need to be in touch with who you are, where you are and what you are intending to do. Little Makalolo in Hwange, Zimbabwe has five classic safari tents on the ground. One of the five tents is a family room which takes an additional two in twin beds in a second room adjoined to the main bedroom.
Little Makalolo is an uncomplicated experience. The main area is very comfortable. There is a lounge and bar to the right as you walk in; and to the left is the dining room. In front is the fire pit and to the right of that is the swimming pool. In front of the main area is the most glorious outlook over Little Makalolo Pan. Because of the time of the year, this pan is active just about all day long. Elephant stream in from all over in small breeding herds of between 10 and 20 at a time to come and quench their thirst. They usually don’t stay that long because they have to move great distances now to find browsing in between visits to water holes.
I find it so hard to see the baby elephants and the young elephants following their mothers and the matriar chs. Some of the babies are so little they easily fit under their mother’s stomachs which means that they are under a year old. I worry about whether the mother has enough food and water and rest to be able to lactate to sustain her baby. The harsh truth is that she probably doesn’t.
I know that, despite the fact that the elephants’ hip bones are starting to show as an indication of the dry season stresses, I keep myself grounded in the knowledge that this time will pass. The rains will come. Most will survive, and some will not. I watch these elegant silent giants pad with languid steps until they smell and see the water; then they can’t help themselves. Despite the tiredness and the sore bodies from covering such large distances, they run and they trumpet with delight for a drink of water.
As an experience to get in touch with Africa, Little Makalolo offers just that. The camp gives you comfort that you need and the area gives you the entertainment that wild Africa offers. At this time of the year, game i s aplenty in large herds. Despite the fact that it is the dry season, you have your feet on the ground and can reach for the stars!

The Netherlands is a densely populated, multicultural country in Western Europe, full of friendly people who mostly like to be as normal as possible.
Water and the Netherlands are inextricably bound together. Without the dunes, dykes and High-Tec flood barriers, two-thirds of the Netherlands would frequently be flooded.
To keep Dutch heads above water in the Low Countries, consultation and teamwork are essential. This consultative approach to reaching a consensus became a general lifestyle in the Netherlands: 'the polder-model'.
The Dutch are seen as informal and approach­able, as accessible as their flat homeland; one of the characteristics of Dutch society is its strongly egalitarian and liberal character.
The Netherlands is a paradise for those who love historic cities (17th & 18th century), flow­ers and windmills.
The Netherlands is famous for its drainage systems, land reclamation, water barriers, bridge building and water management.
In the Netherlands the currency is the Euro (€). Foreign currencies can be exchanged at the Airport as well as at the private exchange offices throughout the city. Local banks, where Traveller's cheques can be cashed, serve between 9:00 and 17:00 hrs. All major credit cards (such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are accepted in most of the restaurants, shops etc.
The voltage in the Netherlands is 220 volts (50 Hz AC). The selected hotels have a 220-volt outlet for shavers, but travelers are advised to bring a power converter and an adapter for two-prong, round plugs with side grounding contacts.
The currency is the euro, which is abbreviated as € and EUR. Larger shops and businesses generally accept all major credit cards.
The Netherlands is 1 hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time in the summer. This is the same time as in Western Europe and parts of Central Continental Europe.
Value-added tax and service charges are included in hotel, restaurant, shopping bills and taxi fares. Tips for extra service are always appreciated but not necessary. It is customary to give taxi drivers and waiters a tip of about 10 per cent. A lavatory attendant is usually tipped € 0.10 or € 0.20.
All participants must have a valid passport in order to enter the Netherlands. Citizens of some countries may need to obtain a visa before arrival. For further information please contact the nearest Dutch Embassy or Consulate to check visa regulations.

Set in the harrowing days following 9/11, a U.S. Special Forces team, led by their new Captain, Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), is chosen to be the first U.S. troops sent into Afghanistan for an extremely dangerous mission. There, in the rugged mountains, they must convince Northern Alliance General Dostum (Navid Negahban) to join forces with them to fight their common adversary: the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies. In addition to overcoming mutual distrust and a vast cultural divide, the Americans—accustomed to state-of-the-art warfare—must adopt the rudimentary tactics of the Afghani horse soldiers. But despite their uneasy bond, the new allies face overwhelming odds: outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy that does not take prisoners.

Unfortunately, both TVs were available in-store only, but it was well worth the trip if getting the best deal was your goal.

Bart De Keyzer is the graphic designer/illustrator who created the animal poster series shown above. He works out of his design studio, 3rd Floor, located in Breva, Netherlands. He describes these self-promotional pieces this way:
“The design for these educational poster series was inspired on the old ones we used to have in schools. They should help children to learn the different letters in the alphabet by linking them to a recognisable animal. A book based on the same concept is on it’s way.”

This bridge sits in the middle of 4 groups of private property and is not really viewable to the public. Please don't trespass. This abandoned 1909 Pratt Thru-truss single-span bridge on stone piers crosses a dry oxbow of the Little River in Hughes county, Oklahoma. Research leads us to believe it "may" have been at or near the location of a circa 1859 Beale Road Iron bridge (military bridge), which was one of six locations in Eastern Oklahoma, that Whipple patent Iron bridges were constructed along the route of the Beale Road. This existing abandoned bridge is very near the site of Edwards Trading Post, which was active from the 1830's thru the 1870's, The Beale Road was surveyed and constructed ending in about 1859, as a major wagon route to California. It started in Fort Smith, Arkansas and south of Fort Smith crossed the Poteau river and ran West to California.
The attached newspaper photo/story says the 1909 bridges are being built on "concrete and steel" piers. To me this suggests, considering it is 1909, Lally Columns, which were riveted steel cylinders packed with rubble and concrete. An inexpensive method of construction. This bridge is on Stone piers, it is 100ft in length. The original 1859 Beale Road bridge across Little River was on Stone piers and was 100ft in length. This suggests to me that the original 1859 piers "might" have been refurbished and used, possibly enlarged. The mortar looks to me to be just external, as a way to seal things, and could have been added any time between 1909 and 1948. We do know that all the 1859 Beale Road Iron bridges (6 in all) were erected on masonry stone piers. Given that both the original 1859 Whipple patent Bowstring bridge and this 1909 Pratt thru-truss bridge are 100ft. in length, and the 1909 bridge is on stone piers that would be correct for the older bridge, and given that it appears to be located in the correct location of the original Beale Road bridge of 1859, it is easy to surmise the piers were reused.
I have spent over 40 years researching the Beale Wagon Road that went from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Los Angeles, California. This road was the Southwest's first federally funded interstate highway. being built between the years 1857-1860. The Beale Bridges were built during the years 1859-1860. The total cost of the road and bridges was $285,000. The Beale Road has been marked with historic signs through the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma is being signed at present. Gene has been of great assistance to me in my research on the Beale Bridges. Jack Beale Smith. The photos of the 1909 bridge were taken by Mike Shockley of Holdenville, Oklahoma.

Paul Allen (Better known as Microsoft co-founder) rolled out world’s biggest plane.The plane is designed to send satellites into orbits. Allen teamed up with Scaled Composites, a Mojave-based aerospace company founded by Burt Rutan, to build the Stratolaunch carrier plane. Picture showing plane is pushed out of the hanger for the first time to begin fuelling test, in the Mojave Desert, California.
Note: Paul Allen has also been associated with other space business. His diverse business portfolio includes the SpaceShipOne project that sent fellow billionaires into space.
Stratolaunch is capable of delivering payloads to multiple orbits and inclinations in a single mission.
Stratolaunch was founded in 2011 by Paul G. Allen. Stratolaunch is developing an air-launch platform to make access to space more convenient, reliable and routine.
Stratolaunch is the world’s largest aircraft by wingspan and is the largest all-composite plane ever built. It is expected to cost $300m – although whether it came in on budget has not been revealed.
Allen’s Stratolaunch Company has partnered with Orbital ATK to “air launch” the company’s Pegasus XL, a rocket capable of delivering small satellites weighing as much as 1,000 pounds, to orbit. The rockets would be tethered to the belly of the giant plane, which would fly them aloft, and once at an altitude of 35,000 feet or so, the rockets would drop and “air launch” to space.
The plane is designed to release rockets that will carry satellites into space. The actual launch demonstration is planned for 2019. The plane will be larger than Howard Hughes’ 1947 H-4 Hercules, known as the “Spruce Goose,”
In contrast, Russia’s Antonov An-225 is currently the world’s largest active plane, originally built to transport the Buran space shuttle.
Stratolaunch’s reusability and air-launch capabilities enables to take an airport-style approach to operations for launch services. Stratolaunch will take off from a runway, rather than a logistically vulnerable fixed range. This allows us to avoid hazards such as inclement weather, airborne traffic and heavy marine activity. Stratolaunch’s airborne launch platform significantly reduces the risk of costly delays or cancellations.
For Allen, it’s all about LEO, or low-Earth orbit. He, and others, such as Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit, are betting that they can reduce the cost of launching small satellites to space. And that, will lead to new ways to beam the internet all across the globe, provide better Earth sensing capabilities, better communication, and open up all sorts of avenues.
More than a decade ago, Allen had hoped to spark a revolution in space travel when he funded SpaceShipOne. SpaceShipOne, which became the first commercial vehicle to enter suborbital space. The project ultimately won the Ansari X Prize, and a $20 million award. He then licensed the technology to Branson and moved on to other pursuits.
But with Stratolaunch, he is back in the space business. Stratolaunch’s launch profile resembles that of SpaceShipOne, which was carried to launch altitude by its own mothership, called the WhiteKnight.
Allen isn’t the only US billionaire with such interest in space technology. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon CEO, and Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO are also eyeing the same pie.
SpaceX successfully launched a used rocket into space. And the company plans to fly two customers around the moon in 2018. It’s already delivered satellites and has made resupply trips to the International Space Station.
Like Musk, Bezos wants to reuse rockets to drive down the cost of space travel. But for the time being, Blue Origin is mostly interested in conducting suborbital flights for tourists.
Sir Richard Branson, also derived its launch system from Scaled Composites. Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo space planes will launch passenger flights from the belly of a WhiteKnightTwo carrier plane, which has a wingspan of 140 feet (42 m).
In the first round of financing series in support of their neuropsychiatric diagnosis and treatments, the Mindstrong Health managed to raise 14 million dollars. Mindstrong Health is a neurological minded start-up. They have employed an Al-powered platform which is meant to take notes on the interaction patterns via smartphones to monitor brain functions. Mindstrong is intent on avail cognition and mood biomarkers digitally in a continuous manner. This is noted to encompass attention, speed, and executive as well as memory function. ARCH Venture Partners spearheaded this first round of financing, Foresite Capital, Optum Ventures, One Mind Brain Health Impact Fund, as well as Berggruen Holdings.
Dr. Tom Insel, who is the Mindstrong Health President and co-founder, said that the most exciting part of Mindstrong is seeing how individuals are transforming their typing and scrolling mannerisms on smart devices into the meticulous cognitive function,. This cutting edge process is just a benchmark for monitoring and a step to making more impressive ways to improve mental health. The world population faces mental issues, and such problems are not exclusive to one group. He attests that smartphones are a step forward to monitor and could help manage such issues.
Also, the CEO of Foresite Capital, Jim Tananbaum, said that the team that founded Mindstrong Health has incomparable knowledge of how the medical field goes about to treat and care for those ailing from mental complications and disorders. All those worried about helping and bettering the experience of these patients will now have a platform that greatly enhances how such treatments are tackled. The Mindstrong Health CEO, DR. Paul Dagum, added that all the new medicine is now measured objectively, but the mental tracking of patients has been constricted to the clinics. To be able to help the patients effectively, they look to have measures that are currently there for patients with chronic diseases, which is the intention of Mindstrong Health.
Jim Tananbaum, along with Foresite Capital, has been key in aiding the medical industry by investing in worthwhile ventures that are made to improve the treatment of those afflicted by conditions that do not yet have proper/modern means of treatment. They boast of 1.1 billion dollars in assets which they manage. Jim has been in the medical circles for over 20 years and has gone to found his own biopharmaceutical companies as well as healthcare investment practices such as NASDAQ: GENZ, Theravance Inc, and much more. Jim is a Yale graduate holding BSEE and BS degrees, a Harvard M.D and also M.S from MIT.

The importance of family in an individual's career was a poignant theme when Sri Lanka's top apparel exporter Brandix felicitated 39 Associates and six Supervisors at the Group's annual Employee of the Year (EOY) Awards ceremony held recently at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium.
Selected after a rigorous examination of their performances and contributions to the Group's growth in 2011, the winners of these coveted awards were also rewarded with company-sponsored study tours to China, India and Bangladesh, and within Sri Lanka.
A highlight of the awards ceremony was an invitation to an immediate family member of each recipient -- a parent or spouse -- to come up on stage to formally pin special Employee of the Year insignia that can be worn on the award winners' uniforms.
The gala awards presentation, followed by pulsating musical entertainment by some of the country's top artistes, brought to a close an activity packed day for nearly 5,000 Brandix team members who also witnessed the Men's and Women's finals of the Brandix 'Rasadiya Kusalanaya' (Mercury Trophy) Volleyball Tournament for non-executive associates at the Group's 38 manufacturing locations, and a demonstration of mechanical and technical skills by the winners of the 'Mech Challenge' - a competition organised for the Group's mechanics.
"In a quality and speed driven Group such as Brandix, the performance of every single one of our 40,000 plus associates is critical to our success," said Colonel Sujith Jayasekara, Group HR Manager - Works HR of Brandix. "This emphasis on performance is reflected in the efforts put in to select and recognise our top performing personnel."
He said the valuable exposure and training that award winners would receive through the study tours will contribute significantly to further professional development and enhance their prospects. Associates were chosen for the Employee of the Year awards through a comprehensive process based on the achievement of defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). A significant feature of the 2012 EOY Awards was the inclusion of recipients from the Brandix Group's offshore factory locations -- Brandix Apparel India, Ocean India, Seeds Intimate Apparel India and Brandix Casualwear, Bangladesh.
The award-winning associates will also get an opportunity to share their experiences on how their lives have been enriched after joining Brandix, as well as their learnings subsequent to the overseas study tours, when they are hosted to an informal tea with the Brandix Group CEO and the Leadership Team.
The pioneer of the concept of 'total solutions' in Sri Lanka's apparel sector, the Brandix Group is supported by 38 manufacturing locations in Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh. The Group provides direct employment to over 40,000 people, and offers indirect employment to an equivalent number. The Group's foray into India in the form of Brandix India Apparel City - a 1,000 acre self-sufficient industrial park - is based on the 'Fibre to Store' concept and uses the advantages of scale and strong business fundamentals to leverage global expertise to offer 'total solutions' within the site. Brandix has also set up a large operating unit in Bangladesh extending its regional presence in South Asia.
Recent initiatives to reinforce the Group's standing as an employer of choice include engagement with academia and support to universities to develop programmes that will lead to a more skilled workforce.
In July 2011, Brandix was adjudged 'Asia's Best Employer Brand' at the CMO Asia Awards for Excellence in Branding and Marketing in Singapore. Brandix was also ranked among the Top 5 Employer Brands in Sri Lanka in a recent national survey covering top companies in the country.

Description Chris Mason farm after 1904 flood; note high water marks on the barn at the far left. In 1904 the greatest flood in Fort Collins history occurred. A wall of water nearly 14 feet high burst through the Poudre Canyon, spreading out over the bottom land farms sweeping away everything movable. 15 bridges were wiped out as well as all irrigation head gates. Flood waters covered N. College to a depth of 5 feet, as 150 houses were swept off their foundations.

Cavafis’ “Monotonia” and Vainegem’s “The Revolution of Everyday Life” serve as departure points for an audiovisual sculpture that attempts to deconstruct the very meaning of monotony; lack of variety, tedious repetition and routine. Deconstruction leads us to a cycle of events whose components are: illusion, obstruction, liminality and condition. Each component has individual characteristics, it is acted out differently and it is not bound to any specific order but is instead used to identify and create certain sets of scenarios.
The combination of image, sound, light and performance is intended to increase the level of sensory stimulation of the audience in order to suggest certain emotional thematics and structures. The objective then becomes to trigger the audience with a connecting language in multiple instances in a seemingly monotonous cycle.
By utilizing the above elements a process of sequencing possible combinations was established and put in conjunction with real life experiences. Through this methodology of connecting reference points the backbone of ‘Monotonia’ was created and an audiovisual translation by MedeaElectronique was initiated.
What if you wake up one day with the feeling that one day has become an imitation of the other, subsequently followed by yet another, identical. Imagine the realization, of something so simple, but with a striking sensation, that whatever happened has happened again, over and over again. Knowing that the only way to change it – is to break the repetitive cycle so that it happens no more.
Triggered by the meaning of the word ‘monotony’, a dialogue between Manolis Manousakis from Greece and Michael Larsson from Sweden was established οriginating from Kvafis’ ‘Monotonia’ and Vanegeim’s ‘The revolution of everyday life’. Τhese two writings acted as departure points for a conversation surrounding four identified thematics; liminality, condition, illusion and obstruction.

Having been an Adobe Lightroom user for many years and becoming frustrated with the lethargy of Win 7, 32bit and also not being able to upgrade to the latest version of Lightroom which only runs on 64bit OS, I bit the bullet and took advantage of the free upgrade path to Win 10, 32bit and then did a clean install of Win10 64bit.
I followed the readily available guidelines carefully and decided to install the new 64bit image on a clean SSD drive so I could keep my old SSD should there be any serious dramas. All seemed to go to plan until I had to restart the PC when re-installing Lightroom, after which I encountered the black screen of death!
I will cut the long story short by saying that after many re-starts and attempts to repair the installation I noticed, following one of these re-starts that the mouse pointer was present on the black screen. A quick Google on my tablet alerted me to the possibility of a graphics driver issue. Indeed the mouse pointer seemed to be able to go well beyond the edges of the monitor.
The solution involved pushing the set-up button on the monitor following which I discovered that the "real" windows desktop existed as a pip in a corner of a large black area. By enlarging the pip I could work with is as normal and was able to update the graphics driver and then set the monitor to its normal mode of operation.
Since then Win 10 64bit has been fine and with 16gig of RAM on board I am very happy! But what a lot of messing around and tearing hair out! Be warned!

Part of the reason we think within a win-lose box is that it is hard to see through all the fog, numbers, deceptions, and misinformation that surrounds politics. Don’t worry – your Buncombe Republican leadership team is here to help.
For starters, thanks to literally hundreds of engaged volunteers, we kept the Republican percentages high enough in Buncombe that the left was not able to undo Congressmen Meadows and McHenry or State Senator Edwards.
Pelosi, Inc. did not add one of our House seats to her stable in part because Buncombe County is uniquely comprised of two Congressional Districts – 10 and 11 – that impairs the left’s ability to dominate the outcome. And although Congressmen McHenry and Meadows did not carry Buncombe, they took their districts with 59% of the votes.
NC Senate District 48 Republican Candidate, Chuck Edward’s race encompasses Henderson and Transylvania Counties and 13 South Buncombe precincts. Within his District in Buncombe there are 11,828 registered Democrats and 11,404 registered Republicans and 14,350 registered UNA’s. While coming in 47% to 53% against his challenger in Buncombe, Senator Edwards won his District 56% to 44%. His strong numbers in Buncombe helped secure a representative who has worked very hard as a conservative voice for that part of his constituency.
Marilyn Brown and Amy Evans, as first-time General Assembly candidates, also have much to celebrate. Both were only 3-7 percentage points below the Republican incumbents who lost their seats in 2014.
Our NC House 116 candidate Marilyn had significant support from the NCGOP, former Congressman Charles Taylor and others which opened the door for a creative campaign against incumbent two-termer Democrat Brian Turner. Mr. Turner outspent Mrs. Brown $250,000 to $100,000, but in spite of Mr. Turner’s money, experience and name recognition, Marilyn garnered over 45% of the votes. Congratulations on running an honest campaign Marilyn. Are we correct that your opponent failed to reciprocate that honesty?
As near as we can tell NC House 115 candidate Amy Evans had a war chest of $6,000 – including $3,000 of in-kind donations, individual contributions and $1,000 from the Buncombe County Republican Women’s club. She also ran against a well-heeled two-term Democrat incumbent – John Ager – who raised $160,000 – curiously including $5,200 from the Cherokee Tribal Council. Amy still pulled 16,858 votes for 42% of the total.
With that kind of funding and those kinds of numbers, both of these first-time candidates have lots to celebrate – so do the people who worked to help them.
Former NC General Assembly member Mark Crawford knew out of the gate that his was a near impossible-to-win race for the NC Senate District 49 seat against his opponent – Democrat incumbent Terry VanDyn. We are always grateful for Mark’s willingness to throw his hat into a very liberal ring and thus prevent the opposition from funneling their campaign funds into other races.
Mark’s race outcome mimicked the Democrat verses Republican voter registration in that district which encompasses North Buncombe, East Buncombe, West Buncombe and most of Asheville. There are 62,808 registered Democrats and 34,415 registered Republicans in NC Senate District 49. Mark secured over 32,000 votes with a 34% showing. Thank you for stepping up in such a strong way Mark.
The next big race was for Sheriff. There are a lot of people disappointed that Shad Higgins “lost” this race – no one more than Shad. Why did that happen? As best we can determine, our sheriff’s candidate’s Achilles heel was probably his limited law enforcement experience. Many of our poll workers reported hearing things like, “Would you rather vote for a man with experience or one who has never been in law enforcement?” In the end, they obviously did not know our Shad; nor, the darker background of his opponent and thus went with that question. Time will tell who really “won” this one.
When Shad stops unnecessarily kicking himself, we encourage him to look at the numbers. This Buncombe County Sheriff’s Race mimicked the Buncombe results between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. President Trump and Shad Higgins both lost by over 20,000 votes – mostly because they struggled to sway unaffiliated voters. You’re in good company Shad.
We regret that Buncombe’s corruption tainted county government was not secured by a 4th Republican Commissioner seat for Glenda Weinert – and thus for us. As a first-time candidate, Glenda made a good show. Her biggest support came from North Buncombe with precinct percentages mostly 60% or better in her favor. The one exception was the Weaverville Town Hall where she lost by only 1/2% point. Still, not enough to carry the rest of her District.
It’s important to know that since 2012, Commissioner District 2 has been shifting to the left. Commissioner Fryar won his District 2 seat in 2012 and was reelected in 2016. In both cases, the difference in winning and losing was no more than several hundred votes. District 2 encompasses North Buncombe, Black Mountain and Fairview and is an increasingly tough arena for a conservative candidate. Glenda was awesome, had great qualifications and she should be applauded for her courage and conviction in stepping forward.
Congratulations are due to incumbent Republican District 3 Commissioner, Robert Pressley, who was reelected to his seat. He secured approximately 51% of the votes – suggesting he also garnered Democrat and/or UNA votes. There were 670 votes between he and his opponent. Robert’s District encompasses the semi-circle of Leicester, Hominy Valley and South Buncombe where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 700 voters. We’re glad that come January Robert will still be at the Buncombe governance table.
Speaking of numbers, if you are curious, the most recent figures we could access come from July. Here is the breakdown in Buncombe County: Democrats – 74,957, Republicans – 46,004, and Unaffiliated – 72,402. Looking at those numbers helps explain why Buncombe County is such a tough, but exceedingly important political pivot point in our region and why county-wide races are so difficult for our candidates.
Though Buncombe County as a whole voted against all six of NC’s Constitutional ballots, four passed across the state. Republicans helped by knowing what they were voting for and supporting the state-wide vote. To the extent that all of this initiative was intended to support liberties, constrain the spending frivolity of our opposition or restrain power interests, four out of six is a great victory. Most importantly – we now have a voter ID requirement in our State Constitution.
One of the biggest disappointments to all of us was the outcome of the state-level judicial races – and most especially that of Chief Justice Barbara Jackson. In case you missed that outcome, it tracks to the last-minute candidacy of a fake and Democratically funded Republican who successfully pulled votes from Ms. Jackson. Anyone who knows that losing Ms. Jackson is a great loss for all North Carolina citizens.
If you were a part of the Buncombe County Republican Party volunteer pool, please celebrate our very broad and targeted effort to support our Republican candidates in their election bids. We put roughly 18,000 sample conservative ballots into the hands of early and election day voters supplemented with a gazillion digital media postings, emails and phone calls. We had four billboards supporting our candidates and the amendments – along with banners, ads in various newspapers, radio spots on three stations, an active HQ, thorough early-voting coverage and committed election day coverage for 60 of the most important polls among the 80 in our county.
We don’t have the data on election day, but early voting coverage was especially important this year. Thanks to the majority of our leaders and volunteers who stepped up and made sure that most of the time in most of the places, we had a volunteer working the polls. Republican early voting in Buncombe County was up 29% over 2014.
A celebratory shout out is due to the Angry Buncombe Taxpayer group for their nothing short of spectacular effort to bring voter attention to the truth of county government corruption under Democratic dominance. The time, energy, money and creativity invested by these folks merits much appreciation by all conservative minded people. May we be candid? No individual or group in Buncombe’s history has ever developed a more creative and relentless effort to politically educate the voters on a problem, the facts and a solution.
We would be amiss if we did not bring a note of concern to your attention. During the campaign several of our Republican candidates mentioned that once in office they didn’t plan to necessarily operate as Republicans. That matters because we feel our party’s special platform and principles are what being a Republican is all about and a reason that other Republicans work so hard for our candidates.
But there’s another reason that running as a Republican should suggest one serve as a Republican. To quote someone else, our opposition treats their platform and principles “as a religion.” If we are to counter their excesses in both platform and principles (read them to better understand just how scary the liberal-progressive Democrat movement really is), do we not need to hold to our own platform and principles (read them to better understand just how grounded in normalcy and reality the conservative Republican movement really is) with at least matching enthusiasm?
We hear a lot about diversity – but when it comes to having conservative diversity of thought at the table of governance, too many are tempted with a fun to the safety of middle-ground. Under most circumstances that’s less about statesmanship than a wish to be liked.
We continue to encourage our Republican elected officials to function as Republicans. As the only political movement capable of defeating the excesses of our opposition, that dedication is crucial. President Trump’s success with a model of promise followed by sincere action offers further example. Republicans like to vote for candidates then know stand for something they can count on.
We close by reminding Buncombe Republicans that ours is a ‘David vs. Goliath’ reality. The liberal-progressive-socialist movement – as manifested in today’s Democrat Party – outnumbers us dramatically and has more money, media support and momentum. This year, building on the support of our predecessors, we made sure they knew they were in a fight and that Buncombe County’s 46,000 Republicans are alive and well in spite of their relentless attacks on our community’s traditional values and standards of normalcy.
Special Note – special thanks is due to our BCGOP Secretary Linda Humphries for gathering data and in general doing what she always does – help us get to get to good and ever better places…
Yesterday our Buncombe County Republican Women voted unanimously that I as the corresponding Secretary of the Club be instructed to send a letter commending the Buncombe County Republican Leadership and citizen workers a congratulatory letter commending their organized, persistent, and faithful work and guidance in this election cycle. Our Chairman Carl Mumpower and Secretary Linda Humphries have accurately and faithfully documented the dynamics of our participation in their usual splendid manner in Chairman Carl’s above letter to all of us. On behalf of the Buncombe Women’s club thank you for this fine letter. I could do no better so please know we add our appreciation, and grateful thanks for your leadership that includes other officers, precinct captains and their faithful workers at the polls and in their communities. Thank you for our hard working candidates and their advisors. 2020 has already begun so lets put on our armor and make new and interested relationships. The opportunities are there so “be of good cheer and remember it is always onward and upward”. B.Budd Corresponding Sec. Buncombe County Republican Women
I am extremely proud to be a lifelong Republican and am 100% grounded in the fact that we are good people trying to keep the things that made our country the best moral example for the world to see alive. It’s clearly gonna be a uphill battle going forward but I see no other choice, our country is worth every drop of blood, sweat, and tears we invest in her. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the sacrifices our military and civilian service people have given.

I don't know where you are getting this "superior tactics" thing. The Thach Weave (to take an example) compensated for the Zero's then-superiority by Midway.
When talking about Savo Island, it should be kept in mind that, for all the naval losses, the Japanese failed to put a significant crimp in the Guadalcanal campaign.
America used F2A-3 in WWII. This was a heavier version of the F2A-1 which was used so effectively in Findland against Soviet airforce. Problem at Midway was mostly the operational inexperience of US aircrews. The F2A-3 thus served as a sort of scapegoat for lack of experience of American Pilots. This was displayed by most of the American air units participating in battle, with the exception of the carrier Yorktown and some elements of Enterprise. F4F-3 and F4F-4, as well as P-40 series were effective in holding the line until newer types began arriving in 1943, once the pilots figured out how to fight with them. It think in the beginning it was more a matter of marginal pilot skill (compared to Japanese) than marginal airplanes. I think, the biggest disparity in equipment quality was in the torpedoes. The Japanese torpedos were much better designed and the American torpedoes frankly sucked. As for the torpedo bombers, the Nakijima B5N was best in the world at this time, and the TBD was badly outclassed in comparison, but even the better designed TBF came up short at Midway. This was mostly because of air operational failure, poorly trained aircrews (most of VT-8 never even launched a torpedo in training before taking on the Nihon Kaigun), and sucky torpedoes, rather than aircraft failure. TBD did well enough at Coral Sea attacking Shoho and I don't think a TBF ever a sank ship with a torpedo. Of course what does it say about all of us Orthocks, that we have so many informed opinions about Pacific War?
Yup. The British used the export version of the same F2A-3 that the Marines were stuck with in Midway. Just like the Marines, the British airmen, mostly from Australia and New Zealand were inexperienced in combat air operations. In addition, their version was even more underpowered with refurbished Wasp radials from DC-3 airliners. These radials had a problem with oil leaks, which was aggravated by the tropical operating condtitions. The British lost many Brewsters to accidents, poor maintenance and ground Japanese ground attacks.
In the East Indies, the Brewsters were slightly different from what the British were using, the Dutch version was slightly lighter and was equiped with better WASP engines. The biggest problem faced by the Dutch was that they were heavily outnumbered in the Japanese onslaught. They were however, more successful than the British in their air operations, and even used the Brewster with some success as a dive bomber against Japanese troopships, before they were finally overwhelmed by superior numbers.
A great account of both British and Dutch air operations in Malaysia, Burma and the East Indies is volume one of the three volume A Bloody Shambles series, which describes just how unprepared those forces were in fighting the Japanese.
In contrast to American, Dutch and British experiences, the Finns were altogether successful with their Brewsters. Like the British and Dutch, the Finns also used a de-navalized version of the F2A, but theirs was the F2A-1 model which initially was lighter, but then they added armor plate and four 12.7 mm M/G which reduced the Finnish model's performance, so that it was actually slower than the F2B-3 version used by the Brits and Dutch. The Finns also had the same problem with oil leaks from the refurbished WASPs, but they solved it by inverting one of the cylinder rings in each cylinder. I have no idea why this worked, but it apparently did and maybe the arctic operating conditions helped also. More importantly, the Finns benefited from the mistakes of others and figured how to fight the Brewster to its best advantage, by making slashing dive attacks on Soviet bombers using the heavy M/G to rip the Soviet aircraft apart. They also took advantage of the Buff's long range (the Buff had a wet wing and had an range comparable to a A6M2), and consequent fight endurance to loiter and make repeated attacks on Soviet formations. Finally, one cannot overstate the contribution to Finnish succes by the poor aircrew quality and inept air operations of the Soviet airforce, whose most experienced members were exterminated during Stalin's purges. Consequently, In Finnish hands the Brewster achieved a kill ratio of 26:1, ironically making the type both one of the worst and yet one of most most successful types deployed in WWII. Trivia: One Brewster airframe in Finnish service alone accounted for over forty confirmed kills at the hands of its various pilots, making it the single highest scoring fighter airframe so far in aviation history. Finnish Brewsters were finally scrapped in 1953.
**Other countries that purchased Brewster in WII were the French and Belgians. Oddly enough the USAAF took advantage of the Buffalo's long range to operate the type as a photo recon aircraft from Australia early in 1942.
I wanted to open up discussion on the nature of prisons and their current state. I'm on the phone right now but ill throw up something more concrete.
I feel that our prisons are in need of much reform. Maybe even the idea of punishing we need to address first. Who decides someone gets x number of years anyway.
“There is your brother, naked, crying, and you stand there confused over the choice of an attractive floor covering.”
Judges have to be the worst people. I think judges will be judged much more harshly by Christ on the Last Judgement.
There was a thread all about this in "Politics", IIRC. Which is not to say it can't be discussed again here. I've never been to prison. The closest I ever got was driving by some.
Was going to be part of a prison ministry in the Orthodox parish I had been a member of, but it never came to fruition. Oh well....
Again, the state. Some crimes in some states carry mandatory sentences. Other laws don't but have sentencing guidelines applied by juries and/or judges.
Having spent more days in the court system as an observer than I care to recount, I hate, hate, hate mandatory minimum sentences. Some/most of those sentences were passed by legislators to express displeasure with the class most likely to commit the crimes associated with them, while others were the result of a local need to keep prisons full.
Of course, there are ways around such things. One local judge will give a 20-year sentence and suspend all but one day of it upon the payment of a nominal fine. It still goes on the book as a 20-year sentence, but for many offenders credit for time served bounces them free that day. (Most crack offenders can't afford the bond and sit in jail for months awaiting trial or an opportunity to plead out.) The judge usually does this for lesser drug offenses.
If we're talking about jail/prison conditions themselves, of the three prisons/county lockups I've been in (again, as an observer), two were on exhibit especially because the people who run them think they border on the side of endangerment.
Blessed Nazarius practiced the ascetic life. His clothes were tattered. He wore his shoes without removing them for six years.
I taught a class at Jessup State Prison ( "The Cut" ) for two years. The guards were scarier than the prisoners.
Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
Why? It uses the same techniques as a lot of athletes. Military and police pretty much train exclusively using bodyweight and calisthenics.
The ocean, infinite to men, and the worlds beyond it, are directed by the same ordinances of the Lord. ~ I Clement 20
I got arrested once but I wasn't taken to prison or jail. They checked me into some home for troubled yuoth for the night. My dad went to prison once.
Anyhow, I think the ultimate problem with our prison system is overcrowding. Simply put, 90% of the people in prison don't really belong there. You can blame the "War on Drugs" for that. Many of these people who are nothing other than harmless drug users are coming out of prison worse than when they went in. A drug addict doesn't belong in the same environment as a convicted rapist, murderer, or robber.

Division Midway Alliance (DMA) began its sponsorship drive for the 2016 Festival of Nations at the beginning of April. Several media sponsors — KBOO, I Heart Radio and Slavic Community Center of NW — are on board to help DMA reach the public with news about the Festival.
Without media sponsors, DMA would have to spend a lot of money to advertise the festival. “Such expenditures would take away from our ability to pay local artists and performers for their work,” said Lori Boisen, DMA District Manager. “These sponsorships are very appreciated, and help us have the best possible festival by using marketing funds to pay great artists to perform.”
KBOO was a big part of why the 2015 Festival of Nations was such a success. Another part of that success was I Heart Radio/Ron Tonkin Toyota, which also returns this year. Like last year, both will have booths at the Sept. 17 festival.
DMA is pleased to welcome Slavic Community Center of NW as a new media sponsor. NW Slavic Community Center is a partner with Afisha Agency and Slavic Family Radio. All three entities serve the metro area Slavic community of up to 125,000 people. “We really want to reach out to our diverse community,” said Boisen. “And the Slavic Community Center helps us ensure that our large Slavic community will be represented at this year’s festival.”
DMA is still seeking media sponsors to spread the word to the diverse communities in East Portland. Potential media sponsors can contact sponsor coordinator Kem Marks at kem@divisionmiday.com or 503.841.5201. Marks will be happy to assist with any questions or to sign up sponsors.
Consider making a tax-deductible donation to the Division Midway Alliance. You’re support is greatly appreciated!

The cost of readmissions is a critical issue facing the healthcare industry. In 2014 alone, roughly 1.8 million readmissions cost Medicare $24 billion. The Readmissions Reduction Program (RRP) was implemented as part of the Affordable Care Act to reduce this spending to account for certain excess readmissions. As with any program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) makes refinements over time.
One change is the 21st Century Cures Act, which requires CMS to implement an adjustment to RRP based on socio-demographic status (SDS). This change is a result of hospitals asserting that some populations, vulnerable due to socio-demographic challenges, were more likely to be readmitted
CMS has closely reviewed reports by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine on the issue of accounting for social risk factors in CMS’ quality programs, and has listened to the industry. This has resulted in an interim adjustment to RRP for federal fiscal year (FFY) 2019, included in the FFY 2018 Inpatient Prospective Payment System final rule. This interim methodology consists of:
Grouping: Hospitals will be grouped into national quintiles based on their ratio of full-benefit dual eligible patients to total Medicare FFS and
Comparison: Hospitals will then be compared to the condition-specific median excess ratio of all hospitals within their quintile.
Adjustment: The SDS adjustment is budget neutral nationally. The Medicare savings using the current methodology in the RRP program will be the same as the Medicare savings with the SDS adjustment.
Hospitals in the higher quintiles (higher percentage of full-benefit dual eligible patients) will have a less stringent benchmark; hospitals in the lower quintiles (lower percent of full-benefit dual eligible patients) will have a more stringent benchmark.Therefore, although the program is budget neutral nationally, there will be winners and losers within each quintile.
CMS has not provided the file it will use to identify full-benefit dual eligible patients. DataGen used a proxy to estimate the impact of the SDS adjustment. The cutoff full-benefit dual eligible ratios for quintile distribution using the proxy data sources are as follows:
The figure above offers a view of which states will have a larger proportion of Quintile 1 hospitals, and which will have a higher proportion of Quintile 5 hospitals. This figure is based on proxy data and represents our assumptions of how CMS will define these quintiles.
Based on their own data, hospitals should be able to determine where they may fall in the SDS quintile distribution. DataGen is analyzing the impact of the estimated SDS adjustments to each hospital’s RRP performance and the resultant change in reimbursement.

Another consequence of P256f engine overheating may be a blown head gasket. Heat makes aluminum swell almost three times faster than cast iron. Thermal stress can distort the head and make it swell in areas that are hottest like those between exhaust valves in adjoining cylinders, and areas that have restricted coolant flow like the narrow area that separates the cylinders. The typical aluminum head swells most in the middle, which can crush the head gasket if the head gets too hot. This will usually cause the head gasket to leak compression between adjacent cylinders, or leak coolant into the cylinders.
P256f engine code provides below are generic codes that may not apply to all vehicles. Car manufacturer uses specific P256f DTC code that are different from the codes shown below. Foreign vehicles may also use DTC codes different from the generic Engine Diagnostic codes.
Starting letter P diagnostic code shows that there are problems in engine, transmission and emissions systems.
If your "Check Engine Light" is on, it means your vehicle has one or more OBD II Trouble Codes so you have to check your engine diagnostic code tool. If your vehicle is an older model with a non-electronic Vehicle Speed Control And Idle Control System, you can check the distributor cap to see whether the spark is getting from there to the coil and on to the spark plugs.
Don't forget ! If your P256f engine code not resolved on and there are trouble codes in your computer, your vehicle will not pass an OBD 2 emissions test. The light must be off and there must be no codes in memory to pass an OBD 2 emissions test. In addition, all of the OBD II self-monitors that check for faults must have run and completed without finding any further problems to pass the test.
Segmentation of File Share Data LocationsDespite the massive cloud migration movement, most data still live on local file shares. In a recent report, IDG states that only 33% of secure file sharing and storage data has been migrated to the cloud. Most interestingly, the surveyed organizations collectively plan to migrate another 39% of that data in the next 3 years but have no plans to migrate the remaining 28% of their data. They go on to quote similar statistics for other data types but the conclusions are the same, data will be split between cloud and on-premise locations for the foreseeable future.
There are a variety of reasons for this segmentation. For example, productivity and profit may drive some file shares toward cloud services, while others remain on-premise because of concerns with security, control and trust. This means that increasing bandwidth will not be enough to guarantee total cloud adoption.
Enterprise IT professionals continue to face file server migration challenges primarily driven by a fundamental lack of support for security and control. It isn’t that cloud storage services are oblivious to these concerns. On the contrary, many have implemented their own mechanisms to secure data. But are enterprises willing to accept these new models – even in the face of accelerating cloud migration pressure? Can they become comfortable entrusting critical, corporate data to faceless third parties? Can they afford to redesign and re-implement existing security practices and administrative procedures?
Unfortunately, the answers seem to lean towards the negative. When faced with the costs of upgrading existing infrastructure or increasing workforce productivity needs, business executives may explore cloud adoption as a modern reflex. But, since they typically operate in a Windows environment, using Active Directory for authentication to Windows file servers with NTFS based access cont…
Local Tories have asserted that Liberal Democrats have changed our policy on an in-out referendum. So let’s look at the facts the Liberal Democrat position in 2008 (when our MPs walked out the Commons after being refused a debate on an in-out referendum) was that we wanted a referendum to decide whether the UK should stay in the EU in the light of the Lisbon Treaty. The Conservative position was that a referendum should decide the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty itself. The 2010 manifesto said: “Liberal Democrats … remain committed to an in/out referendum the next time a British government signs up for fundamental change in the relationship between the UK and the EU – so no change there; the manifesto still committed us to an in-out referendum; however because the Lisbon Treaty had already been ratified by 2010, the Conservative referendum had become impossible, but the Liberal Democrat referendum was still entirely possible. The European Union Act 2011 says that when there is fundamental change in the EU-UK relationship there must be a referendum about such changes themselves – not an IN/OUT referendum as per the Liberal Democrat manifesto. So what happened? It’s very easy to explain the Coalition Agreement says: ”We will amend the 1972 European Communities Act so that any proposed future treaty that transferred areas of power, or competences, would be subject to a referendum on that treaty – a ‘referendum lock’.” No mention there of any in-out referendum. The Coalition Agreement adopted the Conservatives’ position lock, stock and barrel. We need to ask the Conservatives why they are attacking Liberal Democrats for standing by a the Coalition Agreement which on EU referenda accepted Conservative policy, not Liberal Democrat.

I have put my energies into working to make our area a better place, and work with people of all opinions. Our communities are paked with talented people that want to make a difference, but all too often they are marginalised by council bureaucracy or tribal party politics. I am a Liberal Democrat; however people come before party every time.
My priority is to create happier and prosperous Teignmouth - to give more responsibility and resources to local people to unleash their energy and talent.

I know because at one time I would have placed a gleaming "YES" next to each and everyone of them. I was addicted to video games for over ten years.
-I would happily avoid going on dates (or shorten them) to get back to playing Star Wars and Street Fighter II.
We become addicted to various things because we don't feel that we can control anything in our own worlds.
I traded in a reality that I could not control (or felt I couldn't anyway,) for one that I COULD control...a fantasy world.

Right from the start characters get to use some very impressive skills and wear a wide range of costumes, from elegant business suits to magnificent battle armor. This game is one of our top picks because of its topnotch AAA quality design and fun gameplay.
TERA is a game that is well-known for having the best combat system of any MMO. It’s very fun and addicting. In other MMO games, the player can just stand there and trade blows or spells with the enemy. TERA’s innovative action combat system is much more exciting than that. Players have to aim, dodge attacks, chain combos, and time attacks or defense just right. There is currently a promo where players who sign up will receive a free Dragonette pet so now is a great time to start playing TERA.
TERA’s features include: beautiful graphics, seven races, twelve classes, group/solo dungeons, challenging bosses, PvP battlegrounds, and a huge seamless open world with no loading screens.
This game is a must-try if you love combat and want to play an MMORPG with fun features and an active, friendly player community.
These are the best MMORPGs that you can play on your browser. You won’t need to download and install a game client for these games.
When you first start playing League of Angels 2, prepare to be amazed by its stunning graphics, superb character designs, interesting story quests, and well-crafted dungeons. Even though it can be played on a browser, the amount of content available and the complexity of the game is truly astounding.
Naruto Online is a free to play browser-based MMORPG that is based on the Naruto anime/manga. It’s surprisingly fun and is currently very popular. The game has has cool ninja characters, a single player mode, nine epic story arcs, multiplayer dungeons, bosses, and battlefields. Solo play is good, but if you enjoy playing with others then it’s easy enough to form a ninja group since the player community is very friendly and chill. This is a great choice for social players.
Buy to play is a rather new concept in MMORPGs. Generally, MMO games have either been free or subscription-based. Now there is a third option – buy to play – in which players must buy the game to get access to it but there is no subscription needed. In short, there is a one-time fee for unlimited play.
Guild Wars 2 (GW2) is definitely the best buy to play MMORPG around. GW2 has everything an MMO needs to succeed: high-quality graphics, an interesting personalized story, vast maps, awesome quest mechanics and fun combat. That’s why it is the bestselling MMORPG in the world.
the gameplay encourages player cooperation – kill/loot-stealing is not a problem, resources and exp are shared fairly
Where to buy: Guild Wars 2 on Amazon (Note that this link goes to the latest expansion pack. The core game is included in the expansion purchase so this is the best way to buy the game.)
The new Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited MMORPG is now buy to play. No more subscription fee is needed if you buy the game. There are a few Downloadable Content (DLC) packs that you can buy but they are optional.
Which one to pick? GW2 is overall the best game for combat, community, and PvE/PvP. However, if you love the “RPG” part of “MMORPG” then try ESO because it has a better, more memorable story and setting.
Subscription or pay to play MMORPGs are those that require a monthly membership fee. This type of MMO has generally been less popular nowadays because there is so much competition from free to play titles. However, there are still quite a lot of people who prefer to one monthly fee instead of having to buy items from a cash shop.
This is the game that proved that there is still a market for subscription MMORPGs even though there are tons of free to play games around. The fact is, if your game is good enough, people are more than willing to pay a monthly fee to play it. Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn (FFXIV:ARR) is a game amazing enough that people will pay for it even though there are free options around.
So what makes this game so good? Well, first of all the Final Fantasy franchise is quite popular. Fans trust the developers to produce and maintain an awesome MMO game. Secondly, the quality of the game is topnotch. Everything from the character designs, environments, animations, cutscenes, sound, voice acting, etc. is a joy to see and hear. Thirdly, it is playable on the PC, Mac, Playstation 3 and Playstation 4. That makes the audience for the game bigger. Lastly, the core gameplay is very fluid and smooth, which makes it easy for players to get completely immersed in the game.
a flexible class system that allows players to level up all classes and crafting skills with one character
Here is the list of the best upcoming MMORPG games of 2016. These are are all currently under development but are expected to be released in 2016. However, most release dates are not set in stone so the information given below is a bit more speculative than factual.
When 2016 comes around, Star Citizen will be a game that has already released several “modules” of content. The single player parts will most likely be finished and playable. The massively multiplayer part of the game is scheduled to be launched in 2016.
So what is Star Citizen? It is a space simulation that seems like it is trying to be all things to all people. If the developers can pull this off then this could very well be the best MMORPG of 2016. The list of the features is eye-poppingly ambitious: customizable ships, real physics, multicrew spaceships, first person space combat (of course!), a player run economy, an MMO persistent universe but with private servers, both single-player and co-op multiplayer campaigns, etc.
An MMORPG without PvE? Say it ain’t so! But this is exactly what Camelot Unchained promises: a completely Realm vs Realm (RvsR) MMO experience with absolutely no grinding on mobs. Another crazy thing is that in a game genre where free to play is the norm, this upcoming MMO game is going to be pay to play (with a monthly recurring subscription).
The game will not have instanced PvP, instead the RvsR will play out in a massive open world. The three realms are the Realms of the Tuatha Dé Danann, King Arthur and Vikings.
A highly anticipated sandbox MMORPG, Pathfinder Online is due for an open beta in 2016. The developers have promised players a world in which they can build structures, harvest resources, craft goods, and sell them in markets. In short,it will have a player-driven economy. Social groups such as parties, companies, settlements, and kingdoms can work together as a social/political unit and war with other social groups. Open world PvP will also be available. It looks really fun. Is it going to be like Eve Online except with a fantasy theme?
Update: Sadly, it seems that Goblinworks doesn’t have enough money to finish developing the game. They do still have some staff that are keeping the game working but the future is uncertain.
Crowfall is Kickstarter-funded MMORPG that is being billed as a “Throne War Simulator” or, in other words, a hybrid strategy/MMO game. This high concept game will work as follows: there is an eternal War of the Gods and Immortal Champions (the players) travel in between realms to fight in campaigns that last 1-3 months or until some condition is met.
So while all player characters are persistent, campaign worlds are not. The temporary campaign worlds last for four seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter), progressively getting more and more dangerous. The idea is that at the start of the campaign players will begin with nothing. They need to explore, adapt, and survive in a completely new, deadly world with the “fog of war” in place.
One of the developers innovations is that the worlds are made of voxels (think Minecraft) so that the entire setting is destructible. Sounds exciting! This could be the next big thing.
According to PCGamer, Civilization Online will be a sandbox MMO game where players must work together to acquire resources, build structures, research new technologies, create cities, and progress their civilization. Every week new land will be opened up and as the new areas become available, the borders of the different civilizations will touch. This is when civilization vs civilization PvP wars will occur.
When City of Heroes (CoH) closed, a group of fans and developers decided to create a spiritual successor to their beloved game. City of Titans is an upcoming superhero themed MMORPG full of costumed crimefighters and crooks of every description. The concept is intriguing enough but the game is quite low budget (for an MMORPG) so it would be best if players don’t expect super amazing graphics. A few videos have been released such as this one. Nonetheless, this is one MMO that is worth checking out.
Over 200,000 people have already downloaded the early alpha version of Life is Feudal: Your Own (LiF:YO), a niche indie game by Russian developer Bitbox Ltd, according to their press release. Confusingly, there are actually two versions that will be released, the aforementioned (LiF:YO) and the Life is Feudal: Sandbox MMORPG (LiF:MMO) which is scheduled for release in 2016. The concept of both games is the same: a sandbox game in which players can build wherever they want, with a robust crafting system and hardcore full loot PvP.
Crafting in the game will not be limited to items or buildings – players can expect full terraforming capabilities including changing ground levels, digging tunnels, raising hills, building structures, and more. The graphics of the game look quite decent so far, with a reassuringly realistic style. This is another ambitious project that seems like it could be enjoyable to play.
R.O.H.A.N. II is the sequel to the R.O.H.A.N: Blood Feud MMO game. Unlike the original, R.O.H.A.N II will feature MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) and RTS (real time strategy) gameplay elements. The developer’s press release confirms that it will be out for the PC by early 2016. The game looks promising but there is very little information about the game right now but you can visit the Korean language teaser site linked below.
Nebula Online is an upcoming space MMORPG with old school full loot PvP. It has been in development since 2013 by Komar Games (a Ukrainian studio) which has since been bought by Mizar Games. Apart from the old school hardcore PvP, the game will also feature real-time space battles, a player driven economy, customizable ships, player-built space stations, and three unique races. It looks like much of the early gameplay will be exploring the infinite reaches of outer space where there are aliens, abandoned stations, undiscovered planets, and more. The official website states that Nebula Online will be available for the Windows, Mac, Linux, and various devices such as iOS, Android and Windows Phone.
The game looks very promising right now. Although Komar/Mizar Games is not known for MMO games because they have made only mobile games so far, they have been regularly releasing gameplay videos that show the progress they have made.
Das Tal is an upcoming MOBA set in an MMO-style persistent fantasy world. The developers also call this a “PvP Sandbox MMORPG” and are promising a “high adrenaline” experience with open PvP, full loot, a player-controlled economy with all gear crafted by players, skill-based combat, and a large variety of randomly-generated game worlds with unique maps and rules. Game worlds will last for around three months and will end in a large-scale PvP event.
The actual release date is unknown. They have a lot of news, videos and twitch streams that you can find on their Facebook page.
That is the end of the list so far. Bookmark this page and visit it later to see which games have launched. We will be updating the list as more information about upcoming games is released.

One game that folks kind of forget, but is worth mentioning now that it has gone F2P, is Wildstar. It has a mobile combat system without the usual targeting of WoW, hard raids, and weirdly intense housing. I forgot about the game after it came out, but came back when it went free to play, and overally haven’t seen a single barrier between those who play and those who don’t.. Plus hey.. space cowboys.

I know this old, anyone try warframe, i know its not your classic medieval era type deal. Not sandbox either. But its free to play everything in the game can be earned by grinding, or you can pay for it. Good community. Also they have live twitch stream once a week showing the spokesman playing through a level or two, and before any major update they stream on twitch and talk about updates and whats to come and answer questions about their game to people on twitch and talk ideas they have and would like to do. So they also have twrrific devs

Rift is dying, can’t trust the devs, they’re very toxic to the people who speak their minds because they can’t and won’t take criticism from anyone…I played the game for over a year and liked it but the more I played the more I saw how sloppy the devs were getting with content…with the way they treat some of the players I’m not going back

What the MMO world needs is revisions of older games (LOTRO, SWTOR etc) with completely new engines, for updated graphics, a customer understanding that you will need better systems to lay them, and that the subs will be higher to pay for the reduced player base for these games. Maybe even a change in pace, story timelines etc.
The games grow stale because developers have this massive problem of NOT investing in the content, due to GREED. They do not seem to realise that the money will come with continued investment.
I know that there are thousands of players in the older games that long for their worlds to be re-written and improved but for some reason companies WILL NOT listen. They exist on stats of earnings and feed that.

Cool, because thats what a lot of the gamers want to play right? pixel art games that lack good gameplay and good graphics. Its an industry, they make money from people who can spend money. Adults. Kids do not have money to spend on games. Sure they can pester parents, but it’s ultimately adults who spend the money. I dont give a **** if games are age appropriate, who cares.
Each to their own on what they want to play, your welcome to your pixel art but you are the minority. The MMO’s these day’s suck in the sense that they are hollow, same **** different day. Im still waiting for an awesome skill based MMO, but not with pixel art.

Exactly, but just like he said, WoW made that system popular. It didn’t create the system, but it made it popular because of how famous WoW was / is. EQ was popular, but never reached the height WoW did.
Shakaka - October 19th, 2016 at 1:14 am none Comment author #3437 on Best MMORPG 2016 by Best MMORPG 2016
Let’s just remember that many people didn’t even have computers and/or the internet when EQ came out in 1999. I bought my first computer so that I could play it!
If we take into account the fact that the vast majority of people in developed countries have access to computers now (and at the time WoW came out in 2004), and the fact that the original EQ is STILL running with a decent player base, I think it becomes apparent that EQ shits all over WoW and every other MMO since.
IMO, the issue we have with MMO’s today (and I have tried many of them), is that they are just too damn easy! You should genuinely need to strategise and work together to overcome obstacles, and not just in a raid setting. If you can get to max level in a week, no one will appreciate the process.
When SoE launched EQ2, they made it into a weird clone of WoW and it failed miserably because people got bored. I suspect if they had not tried so hard to force their play style into click – click – win, they might still own the franchise instead of DBG!

Blizzard has made a good move by choosing to hide subscription numbers going forward. Expect them to decline sharply.

Legion is amazing. Period. I quit when MoP came out, thought I’d try Legion just to see if it could live up to the hype, and it has. Check out the youtube reviews, forums, whatever you want. WoW is still the biggest MMORPG out there and its not hard to see why. And the guy below talking about handing out gear.. Rares don’t drop epic gear in Legion, and the best gear is still only obtainable through Raiding/PvP. People complaining about WoW don’t realise that Blizzard are trying to cater to a wider audience whilst still pleasing their hardcore fanbase. And they’re doing so incredibly well with this expack.

I’ve played WoW since Vanilla, and I was extremely excited for Legion for the entire year before it launched. I couldn’t wait. Then it launched, I played it a few hours a day for about 2 weeks and then got extremely bored. I don’t know why, but I just completely stopped caring about it. Whatever I liked about WoW just completely went away with Legion. I played the Nostalrius Vanilla private server (which is coming back!) and I love that and will play it again when it is back. Legion just doesn’t feel like WoW to me anymore or something.

Legion sucks and wont be playing it. seems to many ppl complain about not killing rares and now they just hand them out to ppl. back in BC epic gear meant you knew how to play and now they just hand them out.. the game takes no skill to play.
Final Fantasy XIV: A Real Reborn has a touch of anime too it. Less than other FFs, but has its elements of its cuteness, coolness, humour and other parts. Besides being the most complete MMO.

WoW has lost many people, but everyone should know it still takes the spot and has like x4 the number of subscribers FFXIV has, minimum. I love FFXIV and other MMOs as well, but honestly, when you take a good look at every single detail and aspect of the game, WoW still beats every other one out there and deserves its place as god of MMORPGS.

If you really like pvp, this is probably not the game for you. There is no world pvp, and there is pretty limited instanced pvp as well. They came out with more pvp with the most recent patch, but this is almost 2 years later and they are finally adding decent pvp.
As for the pve factor… there are only 4 end game bosses at a time. Yes, they can be challenging but for a group of elite people, they are done quite easily. For a group of people who are only so-so at raiding, it is almost impossible to kill those 4 bosses before the next content comes out. There is no good medium.
They do have an easier mode, but it is cleared within the first day of release by most people. Which isn’t very rewarding. They do have 24man raids but those are also expected to be cleared the first day of release, and just farmed for gear after that.
The game has a lot of things to do if you are just starting, but for someone who has been playing for a while, it loses its interest very fast.
The worst part about it is, it followed the exact same format from the first expansion. It felt like the same exact game with the same exact classes. Wasn’t much of anything added.
My biggest complaint is, that the end game raid has very little to do with the main story. The entire story is about the dragon conflict, and you do not fight a single dragon in the end game raids.

What? there are plenty of dragons in the Heavensward 50-60 level endgame raids. Even as flying mounts and now as primal/trial.
No other MMO has so much to do in the endgame (alt classes, crafting, housing, relic / anima weapons, hunts, dailies, weeklies, fates, 24 man raids, leves, tribes etc…), even WoW: Legion is being inspired by FFXIV.

I’ve got over 3000 hours into FFXIV, and you’re full of it. First, there’s a huge difference between lore and narrative. WoW has a VAST advantage over FFXIV when it comes to lore. FF doesn’t even come close. The NARRATIVE of FF may be more in your face, but it’s largely trite anime-trope-riddled garbage, with the exception of possibly 2 patch updates.
Second, gameplay diversity? The entire game is on rails. All the mechanics are recycled from previous patches, there are two forms of vertical progression, and only two, and the it all boils down to the same thing every other mmo does: Raid, Glamour farm, or gtfo.
Third, monthly updates? WTF are you smoking? Decent sized patches, which are roughly a third the size of a WoW patch, come every 3.5 months. The off patches that may occur in between introduce a moronic new mini game that no one asked for or balance updates.
P.S. Don’t get me wrong, i’ve enjoy FF for what it is, but I keep a clear mind about it. Don’t delude yourself into thinking FF will ever reach the depth a game like WoW, which has been around for 4 times the amount of time FF has and also has 4 times the budget. ARR was built around the idea of creating a theme park atmosphere with no competition that the people that couldn’t hack it in WoW could seek refuge in.

WoW is continuing to lose subscribers. I have actually gone in and tried both factions, to level 100, 1 char each faction, and the community absolutely horrible. In comparison, ffxiv has older (yes, actually older, and not children lying or 30 year old man-boys raging) and kinder community. Oh, and also FFXIV is reaching 6 million subs soon. Because the trial people all convert to at least standard sub (the cheaper version of sub). Even my fc (guild) is experiencing population influx. I would say that right now the activity level is about equal. If you’re gonna get mad, just know that I did enjoy WoW’s content when I was there to evaluate it…just based on my few months of experience I can’t think of too many real new players who would want to stay in a toxic community like that, hostile and prejudiced against “newbs”. Very un-nurturing and suspicious guilds requiring new people to prove they’re new. Or at the first sign of the newb having knowledge, immediately accuse of being fake-new. Something is wrong with WoW community and this will keep driving the new players away (and some old players away too)

I wonder what server you played on. Not that it matters really. Noobs are not hated on. I know tons of guilds really only exist to give new players a leg up with basic gear and bags. Yet there are still the annoying players that constantly barrage trade chat begging for gold.
I do find Wow a Bit boring lately, but mostly because I don’t raid, do pvp or group much. So it’s mostly my fault. But don’t knock the communities…we like fresh meat.

So you bought the game, all expansions,a sub and tried two characters (probably on the same server) and you can now state that the community sucks and whatever garbage you mention? Somehow I don’t believe you and think you are only trying to trash talk WoW since you know nothing about it.

Hi, me and a few of my old guild mates are looking to get back in to an MMO together, we met playing Star Wars: The Old Republic and have gone on to play Final Fantasy XIV together. Between us we’ve all played the usual, WoW, LOTRO, and so on.
In a perfect world we’d get something as close to SW:TOR as we could, proper end-game raids, a good UI, decent PVP, with good group levelling. And I mean a proper MMORPG, not any Destiny or Division crap.

You went to play Final Fantasy XIV or your friends? If you’ve gotten far enough in Final Fantasy XIV (level 50+) or didn’t start with a tank, black mage or lancer job, those 3 jobs start slow, then Final Fantasy XIV could or should have been the MMO your looking for. Or your mostly into PvP?
Final Fantasy XIV is the most complete MMO, even a decent pvp now since patch 3.2. But it strength remains in its PvE endraids and class rotations, especially the more demanding endraids.

Tera & Skyforge are just like Black Desert & Archeage… mostly much of the same style. Great looking graphics but nothing unique to stand out. Ive tried all 4 of em and none of them held my interest for more than a few days.
The comment about Ryzom is good, its a very unique and interesting game, its main flaw being very underpopulated.
In case you didn’t know there is the original Star Wars Galaxies MMORPG you can play for free at swgemu.com. If you like a challenging and true sandbox hardcore MMO you cant go far past this one, or perhaps Anarchy Online if you like sci-fi games.

I will never understand how WoW is not the most complete mmo. It has been polished to perfection. tons of lore, plenty of pvp in different formats and styles and world pvp through zones or the entire server for those who enjoy that. end game content in each expansion suited for those who enjoy that, and even enjoyable by casual raiders. PvP trophies, PvE drops and catalogues of just fun loot to grab, which theres tons of. many mounts to collect, achievements, plenty of classes and races. It has been polished and updated continuously since i was in middle school and its still #1 declining or not. you cant beat that level of polish. whoa the visuals are not guild wars 2 or lineage level but thats the art style from the “warcraft” franchise that came before. And it is represented perfectly. it doesnt have “decent pvp” its wonderful compared to almost any mmo. the only one that comes close to as enjoyable is gw2, has plenty of different battlegrounds and arenas and rewards to match. titles to collect and easter eggs and secrets hidden all over. my favorite being the hypnocroak cause i love futurama. for people who say they had a bad experience with the community must not have engaged the community warmly. ive always been treated nicely and could find assistance around every corner. an explanation from passerby if i needed it.

We tried on its first appearence and when reached level 60 instead of being cool we cannot find anyone to raid with. It was only go there kill or grab them return. PVP is out of discussion. We’ve been killed or kicked tons in a couple of minutes.
Looking for a D&D style MMO where i can level alone or in couple where i can explore large world and not being so repetitive!
Man oh man! cant wait for camelot unchained, pathfinder and crowfall!!! They look great, sound great and have awesome trailers.
Pathfinder isn’t coming out, bud. They’ve all but officially announced that production has been halted on that game.

well at 40 years of age i have played more than my fair share of mmo’s and find it increasingly difficult to find anything to play for more than a month or 2. I did get addicted to a few games over the years as i am a pvp lover RYL( Risk Your Life) was one that combined flagging for pvp but it was a 24hour thing flag yourself for pvp and you are unable to unflag for 24 hours. Had pvp levels than meant allot higher pvp level more dmg you do. I also loved AOC (Age Of Conan) for the sheer brutality nudity and vulgarity it was a mature age MMO for good reason and i have many fond memories of decapitating people and tearing heads off as well as some awesome and fun PVE raid mechanics that really took some hard work to beat. DAOC was another fav for the pvp but also lineage2 i had allot of fun with pvp also back in the olden days.
Fast forward to current affairs i got The Division played thru beta and upto now been waiting years for it and now DELETED. Was such a fun game in beta pvp was fun and going rogue was insanely fun with proximity chat meaning trash talk was just a button press away. Now its a broken pile of shit plagued by hackers one shotting you through 4 walls from 300 meters away and remote looting your drops its PURE S–T.
Please if anyone has some suggestions on a decent pvp and pve game tried all the shit out currently its all CRAP.

While the End-game for the mostly new MMO Blade and Soul, is, to me, absolute CRAP because it turns into “get a literal ton of gold. Upgrade weapon a tiny bit. Now I need even more gold”, the PVP is extremely, extremely fun and satisfying. Essetially, you can do 3v3 or 1v1, and you fight in a circular, flat, empty circle, so it’s just you, and them. 3v3 is tag in tag out style, still 1v1, but allies can help for a couple seconds at a time.
Combat is extremely fluid, and all stats are equalized, except Skills, but that’s ok, just means you have to play through thr story and get to max level first. Don’t worry easy. That unlocks free all your Abilties as you level up. Once you do, you can fight those Adrenaline fueled fights at max potential 🙂

I have tried and tried to search for something special……….but nothing. Help!!, my brain needs a challenge and most of all fun with good banter with players.

Permanent curses (you can get turned into a cow permanently and have skills, how awesome is that, pigs, werewolf which can be transformed only in real life full moon, deer, spider, vampires to come and others, and other curses), hardcore mode, lots of hidden and secret things (hidden npc/objects arround the world which give you classes, items, skills and so on), lots of thinking when fighting (energy system, the more you fight the less energy you have, better fight in a group). I got addicted quite fast of that game. The game will come out in december on steam and it will be buy to play, but you can play it now for free.

I just want to say that this is the first time I have enjoyed and benefitted from reading a “Best MMO’s” webpage. Good descriptions! I look forward to trying some of the aforementioned games. I used to play LOTRO (I’m a huge LOTR fan), and I am looking to play something similar. When I joined LOTRO, the game was already quite old. There were still quite a few people, but not as many as I would have liked. The most important thing for me is having beautiful scenery, an interesting story, and lots of people to play with (I enjoy the social aspect of online games). I would love more than anything to start a big game when it launches. Based on those preferences, could someone please recommend a game for me?

FFXIV has some great main and class story parts and cutscene elements when reaching the endgame. But has a some stretched and medicore pieces between too.
FFXIV is gorgeous, but after playing for 1000+hours, you might get overdosed. But when flying with a new mount over the glacier landscapes of west Coerthas or between the forest trees of the forelands, even after 1000+h it can stil feel gorgeous again.
Just be warned, If you start it, it starts very slow and can deceive. While the deep end game raids gameplay are fast and furious.

And FFXIV has a very big community. If your serious and reach the real end game raids, you’ll have to form a static group with other 7 players (8 in total, 2 tanks, 2 healers and 4 dps), and raid 2-3x a week at set time for 2-3hours each, using Teams/Chat speak too).

I have been a gamer all of my life, clear back to the original Atari and playing chess via email. Haha. I used to love console games from the PS1 / PS2 era. I’ve also done betas for several games. Aion, Rift, Warhammer Online and continued to play well after beta.
I started WoW in 2007, leaving behind Planetside as there were less and less people playing Planetside. I still play WoW. So, I will use WoW as the example since I have played for so long but what I am going to say, holds truth for any MMO.
PEOPLE: Back in the day, while leveling, you could holler out in trade chat for help with some mini boss or quest you were soloing. You would get 50 people in trade, arguing over who was going to come and help you. Then they would all show up and kill it. It was hilarious.
I played Horde and we would raid Southshore. I would have so many people in my Vent from both factions and we would end up starting a world pvp event. I would laugh so hard I would have tears rolling down my cheeks. No one got bent out of shape or angry. We weren’t mean to each other. It was all good fun.
I would power level people a lot. Give them mats to help with their professions so they could make better gear or show them where to farm for things easier. I would patiently answer all of their questions and give them links to helpful sites for mat farming, leveling a profession, gear enchants, addons and the like. In turn, that person would end up in one of my pug groups in some raid. It was a win win situation. Now, in trade chat all you see is hostility. That same person I helped extensively is now an elitist jerk, calling some new player a retard for asking a question. I call them out on their nastiness and remind them who helped them back in the day. Then I message the person that needed help and help them in hopes they stay in the game and are not turned off by the nastiness.
It takes nothing to be kind to people and it’s not like you can pay your mortgage with in game gold. Help others and it benefits everyone. This awful behavior is one of the biggest reasons that gamers get such a bad rep from people in general.
Whatever game you play, learn to appreciate the time and effort the devs have put into it. Everything from graphics to terrain and all else in between. Don’t like the gear? Get an art program and create some new looks and show them off to the devs. They may even hire you and you can stop a possible dead end job you are in, IRL and work for the company you have been paying to play their game.
It takes a lot to create a game and years. Time, effort, deadlines, money…lots of money. Servers are not cheap to obtain and not cheap to keep up maintenance on. Battling code on a daily basis is draining. There are free classes online to learn code from A to Z. Want to know how difficult it gets…do one of those classes in spare time. Then you will understand how hard it really is and why patches take time to come out.
People from WoW will get so angry and talk about all the money that Blizzard / Activision makes per year. Yes, it truly is a lot of money. However, they have companies all over the world. Huge buildings they still have to pay air conditioning on in those offices and server rooms. Water, electric and the like. Not to mention their employees wages. 24/7 jobs for people. They still find it in their hearts to give to charities like, Make A Wish. They create in game pets and sell them for 10.00 with much of that going toward charity. I always buy several pets for people just because of that donation. Let’s face it…10.00 is that meal from McDonalds that you would have purchased.
So let’s give these devs from whatever game you play, a break. They are trying to create something beautiful that we can escape to from our daily lives. We all need escape sometimes, right? Why bring your daily grind of life into a world you go to, to escape?

FFXIV endgame is very challenging and rewarding. Sure there are a few farm and daily instances, but some of the “peak” pve end raids are though (not for casual players), but there are enough stuff for casuals too. Those hard end raids get nerft, when new hard raids come out. So there stuff for all tastes (hardcore, semi-hardcore, casual).
The “farming” parts are redoing raids for good item drops (or for glamour gear) or some special gil (gold), but there a lot too do in the end game:
When it comes to content, FFXIV is the best (only WoW has more content, but FFXIV is better balanced, can use one character for all classes and looks way more gorgeous and is over more rewarding, besides having a great and usefull crafter system… and with time, FFXIV will catch up, FFXIV getting new content ever few months;.. there’s a reason why many call FFXIV “the new WOW”)

There’s nothing challenging about FFXIV raid content at all. It’s more things to memorize, more things to dodge and activate and more damage to get f—d by. You also need lots of decent skilled players otherwise you’ll have a hard time. A primary school dropout could learn that stuff in a day.
I played wow from launch till the release of cataclysm. I can tell you what changed in that game that caused peoples attitudes to change.
It was the dungeon finder, was it a pain in the butt to look for a group for dungeons and raids prior to the dungeon and raid finder? Yes. However because it was such a pain, people behaved because they wanted to make friends that would run the dungeons with them again and again. Being as i played a Priest i would log in, find my favorite tank, wrangle up a few dps and we’d spend the rest of the night running every instance we could. Post dungeon finder, people no longer had to cultivate relationships to run instances and such, if people didn’t like your attitude so what, re queue. That single innovation is what destroyed the community in that game.
As far as people complaining about blizzard making money. Yes, they absolutely have a right to do so.. Blizzard got greedy as a subscription based game it should never have a cash shop, i.e. those little pets and mounts that you buy for $10 and yes i can remember some of them being far more pricey. No game should have both a subscription plan and sell expansions, then try to get extra cash from selling in game items. In game item sales are for a free to play type game where there is no subscription, no initial purchase, and no purchase of expansion packs… This is blizzard being downright greedy.

Dungeon finder helps in FFXIV, but you still raid best content 2-4x a week with “static” groups and still hang out with your FC (and housing). With DF, you just go with you FC members. At least in FFXIV it DF and Party Finder work well, but still have statics and FC fully working.

I found that a lot of “quality of life” improvements took the game downhill. Dungeon finder is the main one, but also cross-realm zones, heirloom gear, removing elites from leveling quests, introduction of gear score, and now Legion introduced multi-tap so now there’s even less of a reason to group up. The community is basically dead unless you’re either lucky enough or try hard enough to get into a good guild. There’s no reason to make friends leveling so trying to even talk to people is usually fruitless. WoW isn’t hard anymore except for the top-tier raids and dungeons. My favorite part of the game was leveling because I loved the world so much, but now leveling is terrible because it’s so solitary and easy.

I finally quit GW2 after the Scarlet Briar story and the new area opened. I was fed up with an NPC party carrying the plot instead of my player character, plus the gratuitous political correctness of that NPC party. I had three maxed characters with two more on the way and all I did was grind for elite armor, not event the heroic stuff. It was taking forever.
I think the game I’ve spent the most total time in is The Secret World, far more than any of the 15 to 20 other titles I have tried. Even when I left I would come back after 3 to 6 months of something else. The story is unlike any other game I’ve seen, combat could be a bit better, but it’s more than adequate, and there is a lot of good top-end material, with more coming out every few months.
I am currently playing Skyforge. It is quite playable for many reasons similar to Defiant, but by that same token I am not likely to last much past 6 months. They have tried to smooth over the incessant grind by gradually introducing new areas of the game based on your progression, but since it is in perpetual open Beta, there just are not enough players to really make the squad finder system work. It has nice combat, and great presentation, but it feels constrained when you do the same 5 to 10 instances of the 30 or so available instances every day.

I can agree with most of this, but I don’t really mind not being the most important thing on the planet when I play an MMO. In fact, that’s how most MMO’s have been, even WoW. You’re just some guy who’s really good at getting stuff done with others.

Graphics do not make a good game. If graphics are your basis of what is good then Order 1886 is the best game ever made.

I don’t think he was implying graphics solely make a game good. I think he meant that as time goes on, games should look better while also expanding on older ideas or creating entirely new ideas to make better games.
There’s a surge of 8-16bit games, due to programs that allow anyone to make a game on their own computer, cheaply, and then sell their junk on Steam. I played 8 and 16 bit games from the 70’s through the late 80’s. It’s 2016. I understand nostalgia, but games progression shouldn’t be moving backwards… ever. Playing a (new)low graphic or 2D game in 2016 is like going to a Guns N Roses concert. The nostalgia wears off as soon as Axel opens his mouth and you’ve realize you made a terrible fucking mistake.

Let’s look at that for a minute. Graphics are not easy. The programs are 1. Expensive..into hundreds of dollars for ONE license on ONE system. Xfrog, Maya Lightwave, Poser, and you would want to have the PRO versions of them which is even more expensive. 2. They have huge learning curves to them. A lot of game companies who are just starting out are on a tight budget as is.
A lot of gamers are kids and teen-agers. Who are not in the working class yet. Not many parents are going to buy a computer that has a huge processor and state of the art graphics card, just so their child can play a video game. If they raise graphics, these kids would not be able to play and that company is going to fall from subscription loss. Same with consoles..they are hundreds of dollars in cost when they are introduced.
Even in World of Warcraft, the characters were just recently upgraded in graphics with new skins. However, some players had to revert to the use of the old skins because it causes them too much lag or they have to play on the lowest settings possible which…is not a good thing because then you cannot see things on the ground you need to avoid standing in or see far distances. Not being able to see what’s going on around you or bad lag, is not going to keep someone playing. I have seen people lagging so badly because they try to play on highest settings. They fall through the floor or teleport through a wall. Or get stuck and can’t move at all. You can only tweak a system so much.
You can’t blame the devs for people not having high end systems but wanting to keep their subscriptions up so they can continue to provide people with solid entertainment. 🙂

It is amazing the amount of new mmorpgs that are going to released in 2016. But I could not help to notice that almost all of them are PvP based. Don’t get me wrong, I love PvP, but do all these developers really think PvPers are the majority of the player base? *boggled*
Most mmorpg players, or the ones that usually throw some serious cash down are the PvE / Casuals. There is almost nothing new for them in 2016. We can always say frack the carebears, but the truth is, we need them as much as they need us. It’s about a healthy economy, cash for game devolpment, PvE content for us PvPers when we just want to take a break. Most PvPers I would say like to do PvE as well.
Personally, I think it’s to much PvP and in the end these games will either fail, or be happy with a very small niche player base. They certainly won’t attract the majority of the market.

I think a big part of that is that when you focus on pvp it is cheaper and takes a lot less development time, but I completely agree with you. If they really want to game to be a successes then PVE needs to be the focus. I think a lot of these guys just don’t want to put the time and money into what it would take make solid quests and other pve systems and are just hoping to make a quick buck.
David - March 1st, 2016 at 12:17 am none Comment author #1578 on Best MMORPG 2016 by Best MMORPG 2016
It is also the case that PvP focused players are seemingly always looking for a new game. I don’t know why that is but it probably has to do with the lack of current great PvP games, that PvP can grow stale more quickly than PvE in general, that PvP is notoriously hard to balance, and that PvP players are often just pickier in general due to the increased competitive nature.
On the other hand, there are a lot of great PvE focused games available already for PvE focused players looking for something new. Additionally, PvE focused players seem far more likely to stick with games for much longer periods, meaning less of them are available to move to new game and so the market can simply not bear as many PvE focused titles.

At a certain point, everybody in pvp oriented games reaches the same level, same gear and ability. Then you have thousands of other players just like you, using the same strategy and everything taking longer than it used to. People completely miss the point of pvp.
In the division, you have ganking parties looking for smaller and more undergeared players to kill. That same party of gankers will come across another 4 man party who display high end gear and they’ll run by without a shot fired.
Pvp used to be fun. You would have players who were highly geared, hunting down other highly geared players for an epic battle. Hell, I used to play games like Perfect World in their beginning and you’d constantly get world messages and whispers telling you that “Such and such player from Goonsquad is having a duel with such and such person from WAR. Get over here quick!” When you showed up there would be a massive crowd waiting for the fight to start. Then you’d witness a 30 minute long battle that was fun and exciting. People would even place bets.
Pvp is definitely not fun anymore. It seems devs leave the pvping open ended and lower lvl or undergeared people are taking the grief for it. You also have to take into account that some people can be totally boss at pve and suck horribly bad at pvp. People liken pve and pvp to one another, but it’s far from the same. Non-pvpers and non-pvp elitest get tired of failing at a game over and over. Making mostly pvp games or games where entering into pvp saturated environments to get the best gear will eventually turn off the flow of players. Not everyone likes to have to pvp to be the best. Some people just want to have fun on their own and don’t like playing games that force you to have to go co-op. Which is another problem with games today. Forced co-op sucks.

Stony, I know you posted this a while ago, but I wanted to say, that you are right. People who are hard core pvp based game players seem to be very high strung. My fiance is one of those people. I play WoW on a rp/pvp server and even in the pve, it gets frustrating when I am on my cloth wearing priest and try to kill some mob that a plate wearer at my same item level can 3 shot, while I die to it. Warlords of Draenor expansion changed a lot of the issues where you had to have two sets of gear, one for raiding and one for pve and Legion is going to expand on that as well. No more different gear sets. They have been trying to find a way to balance it more for both types of players and I think the progress is amazing.

Prefer PvE too. And good PvE is by no means simple. It can get very intense, especially when wiping at 1% a few times, before finally getting the first kill.
FFXIV has small-ish groups of mostly 8-4 (some are max 24). But due to the small-ish sized PvE, there is more pressure and responsibility on each player, making it all the more rewarding and intense.

It doesn’t matter what’s the majority of the player base! Especially on Camelot Unchained the successor of DAOC the devs have stated over and over again that they are making the game for their loyal audience of players and not for the general public. It was exactly that loyal audience that backed and still backs the games development up to this day and guess what they are almost all of them pvpers.

I agree Scott. Open world PVP is becoming very popular, but people usually either love it or hate it. I’m in the hate it crowd and would much rather see open world exploration, not unlike some of the survival games (7 Days to Die), but more MMO like. Features that are described such as “great graphics”, “good gameplay” have completely different meanings depending on your style and interests. Fallout 4 might have very detailed, modern graphics but I would prefer games with vegetation and color. Skyfall was a disaster for me due to it’s lack of color, whereas I loved Oblivion.
Likewise, “gameplay” often means interesting weapons and flashy combat moves to some, but I remember some of the best “gameplay” coming from the older LOTRO or Age of Conan games, where PVP was optional and open world exploration was easily possible.
Open world exploration, open world PVP (or optional PVP), graphics based on a green growing world vs. burned out, dark worlds, … those the the things that categorize games for me. Even sci-fi vs medieval settings and things like that are less important compared to the former.

Until recently, Facebook had dominated the social media landscape among America’s youth – but it is no longer the most popular online platform among teens, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Today, roughly half (51%) of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 say they use Facebook, notably lower than the shares who use YouTube, Instagram or Snapchat.
This shift in teens’ social media use is just one example of how the technology landscape for young people has evolved since the Center’s last survey of teens and technology use in 2014-2015. Most notably, smartphone ownership has become a nearly ubiquitous element of teen life: 95% of teens now report they have a smartphone or access to one. These mobile connections are in turn fueling more-persistent online activities: 45% of teens now say they are online on a near-constant basis.
The survey also finds there is no clear consensus among teens about the effect that social media has on the lives of young people today. Minorities of teens describe that effect as mostly positive (31%) or mostly negative (24%), but the largest share (45%) says that effect has been neither positive nor negative.

In the clip below, taken from former Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward's ongoing radio show Rock 50, he pays tribute to some of the greats of rock and blues including Deep Purple, Cream, Howlin' Wolf, Bo Diddley, Jimi Hendrix and others.
Meanwhile, Ward pays tribute to rock n’ roll legend Chuck Berry, who passed away Sunday at age 90 in St. Charles County, Missouri, with the following:
“When my grandchildren ask, what was rock 'n' roll? I will open my scrapbook to a time when a guitarist, singer and songwriter played and influenced untold thousands of musicians. Like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, I would hold onto his coattails while he illuminated a reachable path to my wildest dreams.
“I’ll show my grandchildren a picture of this suited up man dancing and playing on one leg and strutting across the stage. I'll play the first 30 seconds or so of “Johnny B Goode”. That's what rock 'n' roll looks and sounds like, kids. And when they ask who this man is, I'll tell them smiling, Chuck Berry, kids, Chuck Berry.

Which is too bad, because this Volvo P1800 successor had a lot to offer...
Amid the ever-growing fallout that is a result of Dieselgate, Volkswagen could be forced to make some drastic moves to cut costs to weather the storm, including the closure of the firm's plant in Dresden, thus ending production of the ultra-luxurious Phaeton sedan.

It was a glorious time; to celebrate, Chevrolet unleashed a big-block sport version of its wildly popular Silverado pickup truck.

If we are being honest with ourselves, America, we haven't been very good at producing many sedans worth talking about. Sad to say, but unfortunately it's true. Over the past few decades, Chevy, Ford, and Chrysler have produced a very minimal amount of four door fantasy cars, and instead have come out with things like the Ford Fusion, Chevy Malibu, and the Chrysler 200, all of which leave us simply wanting, and needing, more from our domestic distributors. These cars are passable, sure, but they don't inspire us like some of their competitors from BMW, Audi, and even Acura.

Kinetic Energy Recovery systems were a hot topic before the 2009 F1 season got under way. Every team wanted the advantage of extra horsepower, but the drawbacks associated with the system proved to be insurmountable for most teams. BMW-Sauber went so far as to run KERS on Nick Hiedfeld's F109 chassis but not on Robert Kubica's car. Kubica you see, is not the size of a jockey, like most F1 drivers, and it was determined that managing weight distribution would be to difficult with him in the car. Kubica is a measly inch taller and fifteen pounds heavier than Hiedfeld. In a Formula one car that could be considered the difference between a thimble and an elephant.
The schedule for the 2010 Formula One season was confirmed yesterday. As per the demands of most of the major teams, Formula One will return to North America next year. Most the manufacturer-based teams (Ferrari, Mclaren-Mercedes, Toyota) consider North America to be their most important consumer market. They certainly sell more passenger cars in the United States, for more money, than any other country.
After the debacle that was the 2005 US Grand Prix, interest in F1 supposedly waned in our country. The race was canceled after 2007, and the Canadian Grand Prix canceled after last year. (Robert Kubica won that race, bringing the only win to the BMW-Sauber team. I was pleased).
The F1 circus is going to return to Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Contrary to popular rumor the European Grand Prix will be held on the Valencia street circuit, as it was last week. Eh, this track makes for a boring race, but hey, they have a bridge!
Personal beefs aside, the race schedule increases to 18 races from the 17 races scheduled this season. For more info you can visit Speedtv.com.
. . . All of my wildest dreams are coming true. Last week, Autoshopper reported that Peugeot and ORECA will both contest the Petit LeMans this year, with no immediate word from Audi. Well, that word has been given; Audi will campaign two R15 Diesels in this years Petit.
Following this announcement, the LMP1 field is now so populated with awesome cars and teams that I don't think I can stand it (I'm excited; can you tell?). Along with Team Joest Audi, LMP1 will feature both Peugeot 908s, ORECA's Courage-derived prototype, De Ferran and Patron/Highcroft Acura ARX-02s, as well as the Intersport Lola, the Zytek Hybrid prototype, and several other private entries. Somebody pinch me, I'm dreaming.
Joining the LMP1 fracas are the LMP2 cars, BP Lola/Mazda coupes, as well as the Fernandez Acura ARX-01b. I've already gushed wildly about the GT2 class, featuring BMW, Corvette, Porsche, Ferrari, Panoz, the Robinson Ford GT, and many others. This is literally shaping up to be the best Sports Car race, on American soil, ever. If you'll excuse me, I have to go hyperventilate into this paper bag for a minute . . .

Here is an interesting story. The island nation of Samoa has enacted legislation to officially change which side of the road commuters drive on. This is the first such major 'right of way' policy change by an industrialized nation since Ghana switched lanes in 1974.
Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, the Prime Minister of Samoa provides some decent reasoning for the change: Australia and New Zealand, Samoa's two largest neighbors, both drive on the left, a-la Britain and Japan. Until now, Samoa has been a right hand-driving nation, like the U.S. and Germany. In order to benefit from the thousands of used right-hand-drive autos available from its two large and wealthy neighbors, Samoa is altering its 'side of the road', if you will. There is civil unrest, of course, but this seems like the right idea for the country.
Boy, New GM may have shed plenty of toxic debt, but they've retained every bit of the arrogance they've compiled over the years. In an earlier post we outlined the "Saab/Koenigsegg" deal for you, a financial transaction that is moving at a snail's pace. Well, GM likes to spread the procrastination around. Opel, a long time subsidiary of the General, is currently up for bids. It has been since GM declared bankruptcy, and there have been several bidders. Why hasn't it been sold already? Simple; GM wants to maintain a stake in the company so that it can regain management of Opel should the capital become available. "Hedging their bets," so to speak.
Last week we examined Porsche's impressive website. This time I'd like to exercise my unrealistic auto fantasy by checking out an American manufacturer. Cadillac, to be specific. If there is an American company producing desirable cars (even after all of Detroit's marketing puffery, this is still debatable), it is Cadillac. The Cadillac V-Series line has produced some interesting offerings, from the original CTS-V to the XLR-V, with its Bvlgari-designed dash and gauge cluster. Everything I have read regarding the new CTS-V makes me a little hawt under the collar. Let's see if Cadillac has done an acceptable job with their web campaign.
The European Grand Prix was held in Valencia, Spain this weekend. As far as I'm concerned the show could have been better, but the result was nothing short of inspirational. Rubens Barrichello, at age 37 the oldest driver on the grid, performed flawlessly to take his first win in over five years. This win is also the first for him since leaving Ferrari to join the Honda F1 team (Now 'BrawnGP'). His win Sunday has changed Barrichello's view on his future in the sport. During the current season he has expressed dismay at what he perceived to be unfair "team orders," stating that he felt the team was concentrating more effort on his BrawnGP stablemate Jenson Button. Barrichello had also alluded to retirement after after the 2009 season, stating that he "didn't really see the point in racing in 2010" which would be his eighteenth consecutive season at the top level of motor sport. He has changed his mind, after the race expressing his desire to stay on with Brawn.
New GM, Old GM, same dummies, different titles. First Fritz Henderson blasts my hero, Bob Lutz, publicly, stating that "Lutz may have his opinions, but he works for me." That's pretty pompous right there. Then Henderson turns around and tries to pitch a re-badged Saturn Vue as a Buick. Fortunately NEW GM has to listen to potential customers, who all verbally retched at the idea. Twitter officially killed the Vue-ick ('ick' being the operative suffix there . . .).
Here's the real crime: The G8 chassis is already re-badged as a Chevrolet, for the MIDDLE EASTERN market!! You scumbags!! Introduce a vehicle that I actually drool over, that actually stands its ground against the German competition, that can be made into a Chevy EASILY, but you're still stuck on the SUV/Crossover gravy train. I thought you didn't like 're-badging,' Fritzy? Or does that apply only to cars that aren't completely cost effective to produce? Or are you just laughing in the face of the American public because we are to stupid to notice? It's obvious that no one is going to buy crap, so why talk to us as if we are still falling for the 'Super Rebate' Ponzi scheme of the late Nineties . . . also, why isn't Lutz in charge instead of this 'Washington Puppet' Henderson? Age probably has a lot to do with it; Lutz is in his late seventies . . .
In a surprise announcement Toyota has made it clear that they plan on increasing four cylinder engine production at their Huntsville, Alabama plant. This is a surprising announcement considering Toyota completely abandoned its NUMMI plant earlier this month.
We may be looking at the next Buick Regal, assuming Fritz Henderson doesn't invent some reason why it offends his 're-badging' sensibilities. The 2010 Vauxhall Insignia VXR seen here is about as striking as a GM product has ever been. (I'm still keen on the '89 era IROC-Z, spent my entire childhood lusting after that car; until I discovered it was making an earth shattering 195 bhp, sigh.) It's from GM's current German arm, Opel. It rides on the same Epsilon II platform that underpins the Chevy Malibu and Buick LaCrosse.There is an interesting assortment of parts that go into the VXR, including bits from Saab, Opel, and GM's Korean subsidiaries. The 321 bhp 2.8-liter twin turbo V6 is sourced from Holden, those same wonderful Aussies who brought us the GTO and G8 before Fritzy decided DESIRABLE cars were not on the docket for GM . . . eeerrr, Government-installed CEOs rub me the wrong way . . . my thoughts on Henderson and his 'rebadging' hypocrisy in a later post . . .
Anyway, here we feature a brief gallery of Insignia VXR images, as well as a link to the origninal story in Edmunds Inside Line.

it was perfectly acceptable to juggle, 10 potential partners or more while weighing up their relative attributes. Every year as Singles’ Day approaches, thousands of college students and young working people post messages. Some men postpone marriage until their financial situation is more secure and use wealth to attract women. From the point of view of anthropology and sociology, dating is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the family, are also changing rapidly, and the were to many forces, including advances in technology and medicine. If two people go together, it may mean that they are dated, but their relationship has not advanced to a relatively long-standing and sexual boyfriend-girlfriend-relationship, although you are cohabiting.. In the United Kingdom, a poll of 3,000 engaged or married couples resulted in an average duration between first meeting and accepted proposal of marriage of 2 years and 11 months. In the United States. If you just copy and paste the same message to each person you want to speak, it will not be obvious that you have to take a special interest in them. It can be a lot of things in common is important, but it is not enough to justify the monotony of filling out hundreds of pages of questions
More modern approaches, such as blind dates, speed dating and dating websites are not as popular as abroad, and are not very effective by the majority of the population..
Analyst Geoffrey GORS described dating as an American peculiarity of focusing on youth of college age and expressed in activities such as American Proms.
Too many one-off dates, the nowhere can leave the best of us ready to hang the little black dress in exchange for a pair of pjs and a pint of you know what.
They charge a fee to enable a user to post a profile of themselves, perhaps with the help of video or still images as descriptive data and personal preferences for dating, such as age, Hobbies, and so on.
Courtship complete the arranged marriages omitted in the case in which the couple prior to the wedding.
You choose the people that you are interested in, instead of being automatically matched with someone.
In the case of Cupid.com we speak with allow you to a lot of different people to find the right person for you.
With Cupid.com the Internet dating no longer just a boring, complicated process. The most important way to find out whether you are really meant to be someone, speak with them. For me, the biggest difference between Brazilians and Americans is that they are less dependent when it comes to family.

I've been neglecting this blog, but what is new- I get busy and forget. I do update my bento blog much more often at least!
I've been up to a lot. I just did an art show this weekend and sold a little yarn. I've been spinning, weaving, dyeing, sewing and working with the critters. Here are some shots of yarn.
These yarns are all naturally dyed during a dye workshop I took a couple weeks ago. The first two on the left are cochineal, one was dipped in ammonia, and there is a slight difference, but not enough to show in the photo. (not to mention that the picture is taken with artificial light at night!) The third skein is cochineal overdyed with one dip of indigo. I hope that the indigo holds up. The next skein is just indigo, several dips to get it reasonably dark. Then there is a walnut overdyed with indigo, a dill overdyed with indigo, a walnut and a dill. The dill and walnut are lighter than expected, which is probably due to a high mineral content in the water in Grass Valley. It was fun and hopefully will help get me to try more natural dyeing.
This second picture is some handspun cormo I've been working on. Over the summer I was on a lime and orange kick. I mentioned it to a friend at Lambtown and talked her into watching my booth when she mentioned that one of my favorite wool vendors had some lime green and orange roving for sale. I ran and grabbed it. I've spun a few bobbins, but still have a reasonable amount to go. I have an idea for this yarn, but I need to see just how much I have when I'm done to make sure it will work.
It's not the best picture, as I'd just had a tooth filled, but I do like the dress. I didn't think that the skirt was full enough, so I made a corded petticoat to wear under it. I do like how the skirt fits with the corded petticoat, a tucked petticoat and my full plain petticoat layered under it. I wore it with my new robert land boots to a Civil War period dance on Saturday. (yes, I know it's about 15 years too early.... It's what I had!)
I have been knitting a little bit, I've got several socks going, and a pair of mittens almost finished. I also finally decided to just serge the raw edges of the towels I took off of my loom months ago. I hope that they hold up, but they've already been gifted, so I don't have any pictures of them. I also made a dress for Gianna, but it's still a little big for her.
I babysat my 15 1/2 month old niece tonight- she's definately a busy girl. She's picked up a TON of new words this month. Tonight I heard the most of "hi," "no," "mine," and "meow." I think she also told me "nothing" at one point when I asked what she was doing.
It's only about 3" wide, threaded as an 8 harness rosepath, the treadles are tied like a twill, but it's woven as an overshot....
I have a two day old pup who is just the tiniest thing. I keep thinking that she's not going to make it, but she's acting just like a normal pup other than her size and seems to be eating just fine. Yesterday I took some pictures of her with a half sibling who is about a week old.
Wolfie can come by and add some of the fluff to your floor too! Can't you see how happy he is to roll it all off?
Why was I complaining about navy blue fabric and navy blue thread in my last post? Well it had to do with something I've been working on for Sutter's Fort. I recently finished docent training there, and now I'm getting a period costume together.
These pictures were taken in my parent's living room- with a small house and two cats, there is no way my place is that neat.
The dress is made from a blue and tan plaid "homespun" cotton fabric. I used a pattern from Sutter's Fort called the "1840's Wrapper Dress." I did alter the pattern a little bit to cartridge pleat the skirt. (I had to add a strip of fabric to the pleated part of the skirt and put a binding on the bodice where the skirt was sewn.) I also lengthened it a little bit. In the pictures I'm wearing period undergarments- three petticoats, a chemise, a corset and a pair of drawers. I also need to work on an apron, and I have a straw bonnet that I need to modify a little bit. I'm also trying to figure out how to put my hair up- it's so thick, that while I can braid it, one braid won't stay up on my head. I think I might be able to do some sort of figure 8 bun if I do two braids.
Now I'm very tempted to start on another dress from the Laughing Moon Ladies' Round Dress pattern. I'm leaning toward view B, or maybe view C with the sleeves of view B.
I have many projects going on in the fibery world. I've been working on an 1847 costume on the sewing front. It's coming along, but I'm getting distracted by other things too.
it's farther along than the picture now, but this one shows the cables better. I've also got a regia cotton surf sock started, as well as a pair of mittens from Folk Mittens.
I have to say, I fell a thousand times and probably I spent the more of the time on my knees than stand up, but anyways, it was really nice and I can't wait to do it again!
We went to Mamitas Beach here in Playa Del Carmen, we rent the equipment at Sup Playa, which is located just beside the Hyatt Hotel. I really recommend it if you want to do paddle, the owner is really nice and the prices are correct, related to the service and the equipment at your disposal.

I am not a PvPer, am a PVEer through and through. I have never played PvP on a consistent basis, with one big exception – DAOC. I agree with Winn and Rob. I loved it.
It was a long time ago now, but IIRC I was taken into a realm battle with a high level player when I was only level 7, which apparently was supposed to be too low. Couldn’t wait to go back when I was the right level for RvR (DAOC’s version of PvP).
when Lotro first came out I bought the lifetime sub just to play the Ettinmoores that was a fun pvp system for a little while till they made all the monsters wimps.

DAOC is still going strong. Lots of returning players, me included. A lot of zerging and 8-mans 30v30v30 up to 100+v100+v100+. It’s still the best pvp experience out there and proves that graphics do not make the game. DAOC came out in 2001 and its graphics are dated, but what a fun game. Don’t know how it would be to start as a level 1, but if you have higher level toons give it a try!! I think leveling can be very fast now – like 1 to 50 in a couple of hard days.

That’s quite a stretch. I’ve played from headstart release, and the game has developed very well in the last three years. I believe it to be the best Buy to Play (no subscription) MMO on the market today. Many of my guildmates, who have also played since the beginning, agree with me. If anyone is curious, you can give it a shot – they have a Free to Play model with non-game-breaking limitations (mostly in an attempt to prevent gold sellers and spammers). If at any point you are interested in purchasing the full game w/ expansion, you can buy it through the in-game gem store or through their website.

Although flawed, the initial game showed lots of promise and at the time the devs were making all sorts of promises to keep our hype up… but as time went on ANet’s poor decision making and tight schedules turned this game into a complete, chaotic mess. Heart of Thorns was their chance to make things right and they blew it… (though they did try to rectify the “DPS-centric religion” and give more power to other builds, which was a good thing IMO.)
Instead of fixing what needed to be fixed to make a good, solid base for what would come after, they decided it was a good idea to rush content out of the door and lay even more “foundations” for future content and features. This didn’t solve anything, it actually added even more problems to the pile.
They also alienated the old and loyal player-base they had by trying to cater to everyone possible AND selling Heart of Thorns in a nifty “2-in-1 package” that included the core game. A great deal for new players but what about those who had already bought the core game all those months/years ago? It was complete BS and ANet didn’t give a damn because all they wanted was more players, even if that meant taking a sh*t over the old ones.
One of the reasons why I left GW2 was because the game had become stale for me. I didn’t care for PvP, PvE and RP were my main focus and, unfortunately, I got to a point where I had everything I wanted and couldn’t be bothered with leveling more alts.
Once you reach that point where you’re comfortable with what you have and have done, you’ll start noticing just how lacking this game is on the end-game department. The last 3 months before I left, I did nothing more than karma/bag trains. LITERALLY. It was a grind-fest in its purest form. Dungeons were out of the equation too because Anet nerfed the rewards/gold so bad, nobody wanted to do them anymore. I was struggling for reasons to keep at it… and it also affected my will to RP with other people, to point I just got up and left.
You may not notice it in the first months, maybe even year of gameplay because the game feels “new” to you – your rose-tinted shades don’t let you see its flaws, not immediately, but once that feeling is over the flaws that looked little will now look like immense gaps. From my experience, this is what happens to the people who decided to play GW2.

Played since beta and I can assure you that not all older players are complaining. They attempted to rectify the situation of expansion by giving those who already had the base game an extra character slot($10 value). It’s not much, but it’s something. On top of it IvoryOwl completely overlooked the fact that end-game is now Raids. PvE exists. Why just mention dungeons? Why not mention the fact that Fractals go to 100 now? Like I said Raids are what we asked for for a long time, and we finally have them. I can assure you it’s not all “DPS-centric religion” anymore.

Older player? Lots of folks like you talk about being older player beta? are you talking testing phases of early gw you played through the proph, factiona, nightfall, eotn? because even that was a better model of gw than gw2 ever was. If you compare the first to the second and have played the second since beta. you’ll truly see how little it’s developed and how even gw2 debut was a step back. the new action and dynamic combat was great but that’s nearly the only thing that was an improvement

Another example of kids thinking anyone who doesn’t share their opinion is wrong. What some people like in a game others don’t.
I have tried some MMOs that others love and I hated them, not my style, move on. No point crying about it. I probably like some games you hate. This means to most of the kids commenting on this thread that i am “wrong” rather than having a diiffereing opinion. It is the curse of internet comments that children ( or those that act like them ) refuse to beleive two people can hold differing opinions without one being wrong

Big lover of MMORPGs here! I am constantly looking for emersive and polished games. Curently I am following Crowfall (medieval-fantasy game) and I highly suggest to take a sniff. There is also another good space-oddity on the way! It is called Star Citizen (upgraded EVE). I dont’t know much about this title but I know it will be damn big. This game will offer exploration of planets (in realistic sizes) and offcourse you will be able to name newly discoverd creatures! SC offers a lot! Best to check it out yourself.
So medieval-fantasy lovers check out Crowfall(it is a practicaly mix of everything you ever played and offers a lot of freshnes)

If the combat is good and there’s more than just one or two map types people can and will PvP endlessly. Some people play PvE only games or choose to PvE exclusively. Considering that PvP in general (competition) is the more widely embraced game mode people will play it as long as it’s good.=

I’ve been playing MMO’s since their creation and I can tell you if it’s kept fresh then yes they will play it. Not every game has to be logged in 24/7 to be a success. However if it’s anything like Warhammer Online was, people will flock to this game in droves because a very large player base miss that game. The only reason it failed is because of bad changes to the game. So that crowd alone will come to this game.

A game similar to this came out years ago. I forget the name. I think it was fury, or fury unleashed. Something along those lines. I was pumped to play it, as I’m a huge pvp fan. The idea to level off of only pvp was right up my alley. Unfortunately the game failed because of new players not able to advance very far with current players. Needless to say the very purpose of the game was also it’s downfall.

It’s hard for a game to try and balance PvE and PvP in order to cater to both. I deal with jerks and buttholes daily, so I don’t really want to deal with it in a game. One could have a dozen games that are designed around PvP, but let one game be designed around PvE’ers and you’ll still hear bitching from the PvP folks. A game with ‘hardcore’ pvp? You can keep it. I’ll go play somewhere I can escape reality for awhile without having an asshat get his/her jollies by ruining my limited game time.

I felt wow and gw were 2 fail pve games. I quit both within a year. One of the more successful pve/pvp blends that have out of date gfx was Dark Age of Camelot. When you died no one could steal your gear and you knew the specific zones that had pvp/pve risk/rewards. The cheating and the devs unwillingness to balance the classes they played ran off a good amount of players.

Considered all realms had completely different classes with advantages/disadvantages the class balance was quite good too.
Especially how they balanced CC, area damage and the interupt mechanic. You could have group vs group fights that lasted 10-20 minutes if both groups were evenly matched but you could also win against a zerg/raid of 5-10 groups that didn’t know what they were doing.

You pampered pve player. Mobas are dominating right now because of constant pvp. Not everyone likes playing PvE. Oh look guys, a mob attacks right, then left, then up every time. Make sure your prepared…. Go watch a video on how to do it so we can just blast through it. OMFG, we are so accomplished….. PvP is fun. You never know what the person your going against will do.

A large portion of MMO players have no interest in MOBA’s, quite a lot of people aren’t interested in PvP.
The genre is irrelevant, he’s right. The problem is no company has approached PvP in MMOs in the same manner as Riot have in LoL.

Trust me we do. We couldn’t care less about pvetards. For as long as there are at least 150 active players on each faction active at a time pvp is perfectly fine. And yes we only care about doing pvp 24/7 and nothing else.

Although i’m not super excited about Wildstar either, i keep hearing all this random hype about Black Desert when it’s obviously yet another pretty looking grind fest. According to their own FAQ “There is no level cap, but after level 50 players may find it very hard to level up” and by god as long as there’s a possibility some no-life will have the free time to hit lvl 100 and destroy everybody else because there’s also PvP. Not to mention that the majority of experience comes from monsters. They might as well have just named it “open world grind fest”
I mean, unless the levels aren’t going to be important enough to matter or they’re going to somehow cap you, but then that begs the question why even include levels, or levels after a certian point if it doesn’t do anything.

To be honest u not missing allot in Black Desert..i Played the russian version and yes the graphics is good..but at the end i got bored after 1 month of playing. theres alot grinding. and there is no dungeons in the game…fighting system is good. u need to buy houses to be able to craft. fishing is nice in the game. And did i mention the grinding….but its not a bad game. its worth trying

that’s why it had to go free to play. now you need to pay to achieve anything. Even those of us who paid full price for the game now get nothing, so it was easy to walk away. and dont get me started on archeage or sky forge, talk about dumb games.

Black Desert is not about standing in the main city’s queuing waiting for dungeon and raid queues. Its not a themepark MMO, its a true sandbox MMO where you can literally do whatever you want. The grind is part of the game, and the combat makes it fun. Build boats, go fishing, siege castles, in depth crafting, amazing combat, insane graphics. Its easily the most in depth and fun MMO i’ve played in 10 years. Its not for people who give up after an hour and need their hands held every step of the way.

Where do you see pvp? Why, when you are trying to grind ofc! Someone comes to PK you and unloads their ultimate then instantly turns off pvp…fun.
Cheats? Rife with them although DAUM announced a wave of bans, all that got was spam posts on the forums.
Crafting? No, that’s not accurate. You collect materials (yourself or worker) then get a worker to make something. It’s really, really basic.
The bottom line is getting as many blackstones as you can to try and improve your gear which you can have since day 1. IF the God of RNG allows you will eventually improve your gear.
Horse breeding? Get horse to lvl 30…turn on auto-loop. Check next day to fill up carrots. Leave for another day.

I know you have the link up there and you did mention that but I would like to add that even if they don’t have money now, the game is still playable. They have a live server which was updated last month.

B&S has been anticipated for so many years that it’s now on par with flops like Johnny Romero’s Daikatana. Whatever NCSoft can pull out of their hat, it won’t be enough to make up for all the delays. Ultimately, B&S is going to be a game built on outdated engine with outdated game mechanics..

Blade and Soul?! I’m relieved that I bought the lowest package. Played Beta, and after a couple hours… I looked at my screen… Knowing I’ve played Arch Age for Months, along other games like Wildstar; Skyforge; all FF online… anyway… BoS will go down the drain… Sure I will play tom 10 PST… only bc it’s the week end… or I may load it.. stare at screen, and close the window.

I just uninstalled blade n soul. Its just another Kor grinder with no real pvp. You have to flag and the person you want to fight has to flag. It looks like and runs smooth but lacks to much for me.
BnS lasted 2 weeks and then began losing mass amounts of players. I post today as I just logged out for the last time. Too much of a hurried cash grab, trying to make up for what they lost with Wildstar. The game could have been great if they took some time and polished it before release. It’s almost as if the people that paid for premium benefits, got screwed more than the F2Pers because of all the bugs revolving around the cash shop/premium fluff. Check out the Blade and Soul reddit for more info if needed.
As for Black Desert, that’s another short-lived game. I don’t understand why these companies even bother putting years of work into games that last a few months.

Fittingly, Prblms by 6lack is an awesome record to kick off the new year with. There’s an awesome feeling when a record can hit you in a spot that reassures you that you’re never the only one going through whatever it is you’re going through. This record has done this for me for the last 4 days or so. Not to mention its absolutely fire as well.
I love uptempo face scrunching music any day of the week, but it takes a special record to slow you down every now and again. As well as being a first-time encounter for us here at the Nation, 6lack’s Prblms came via our submissions portal, so to kick off the new year batting a thousand is a sign of more dopeness to come.
Through all the good, bad and ugly of our day to days, music for so many of us is a both a beautiful escape and our gold plated armour for life. This year more than ever, we’re committed to filtering out as much of the rubbish that passes for music these days. The Nation has always been about finding and recognizing these gems and we’re on a mission to trim the fat that has become the music industry.

I sent my comments in to the Scrumy guys, and Dan responded by saying "We converted your seven bucks into 17,276 Colombian Pesos and we're swimming in it Scrooge McDuck style, thanks for upgrading!" Now you know how developers spend their hard-earned money. Anyway I'm impressed that Dan didn't just make the number up and actually converted seven bucks US at the current exchange rate.
So I've been playing around with Scrumy lately. From the name I'm sure you've figured out that it's some sort of tool that helps you manage Scrum-based projects. It actually works for any sort of agile-ish project, so you don't have to give up whichever agile cult with which you may already be affiliated.
Scrumy lets you play around for free, although with the free version you'll be in one endless sprint until the end of time. That gets tiresome after a while, so I finally opened up my wallet, blew the dust off my credit card, and parted with a whole $7 (USD) for the privilege of using Scrumy Pro for a whole month. By the way, I'm positive that contrary to what the developers say about the name in their slick intro video, they affectionately refer to their product as "screw me" when we're not listening. But I digress.
My $7 obviously entitles me to deliver my demands to the developers and readily expect to have them fulfilled within two weeks. Anything can be done in two weeks, right? So obviously this budget tool has a few shortcomings, and who better than me to point them out? Ready? Here we go...
Can't see "to do" items in the backlog. There's a backlog (great). You can add stories to it (great). If your story has to do items that greatly enrich your understanding of the story, you're unable to see them when it comes time to assign the story to a particular sprint (utterly maddening).
There's no search. I can't possibly be expected to remember where I put things, that's why I'm spending all this time painstakingly typing stuff into someone else's web app. If there's no search, I can't find stuff without digging through everything and clicking around like mad.
Would be great if edits were pushed out. I'm working on a project with a buddy in Toronto. We often chat about how things are going, and play with the stories and tasks until we agree on the next sprint. It would be fantastically, over-the-top-mega-cool if he could see changes as I was making them. And vice-versa of course, sometimes he has good ideas too.
No obvious way to promote a "to do" to a story. Drag "to do" to story column (nope). Drag "to do" to backlog (nope). Open up "to do" and search for "make story" button (nope). Bang head against screen, open "to do", copy text, select "new story", paste, bang head again.
The Scrumy Scrumy board isn't public. I mean really, how cool would it be to be able to see how the Scrumy guys setup their own project, and what they have coming down the pipe. Read only, of course, except for respected, rational individuals such as myself who should be given full access.
Now don't get me wrong, Scrumy is refreshingly simple and I'm really enjoying working with it. It does just what it sets out to do (replacing sticky notes) admirably well. It doesn't lock you down to particular iteration lengths. It doesn't make you do a bunch of complicated category, project, user setup crap. It embraces the simplicity and flexibility of paper (mostly), while providing the many benefits of taking it online (oh crap, the cat destroyed our project tracking system AGAIN). I wish more products were this fun to use and had such wonderfully ambiguous names.

I’m not ashamed to say it nearly brought me to tears. There is something about cooking – and cooking something so ancient – that delivers a feeling of satisfaction that can hardly be described. It’s entirely transcendental. And the best part? You get to eat it.
It all started when one of my dear friends suggested making pasta out of chickpea flour and that she had seen a vegan version using ground flax seeds. I found the recipe and followed it, but it didn’t work, I tried again, and after another pretty epic fail where I felt totally out of my depth, I decided to go the classic egg route. Not only was it better, it was absolutely, unbelievably delicious. In fact, I could hardly trust that what I was eating was made from chickpea flour, since it tasted so much like the beloved white pasta of my past. How is this not a thing?! It’s so easy and infinitely healthier, why isn’t everyone and their uncle Bob making pasta with chickpea flour?
I made this pasta three time in a week and found the prefect al dente cook time, all kinds of things to dress it with (olive oil, Pecorino, black pepper – guh.), and that I could freeze it to come back later and pop a nest into boiling water for almost-instant dinner that even my three-year-old loves. Rejoice!
The only potential issue with using chickpea pasta like this is that since the chickpea flour is made from ground raw chickpeas, and some people who are sensitive to legumes may find this difficult to digest (i.e. lots of farts). I don’t know how to overcome this issue since sprouting the chickpeas, then dehydrating them, then grinding them seems like a whole lotta rigmarole, so I’m using chickpea flour and calling this an indulgence, like socca. If you know you have legume issues, I suggest purchasing sprouted chickpea flour, which is a little more challenging to find, but you can certainly buy it online.
Now that I understand the correct moisture levels and consistency, I’m going to go back and try the vegan version again, perhaps using something other than flax this time. If any of you have had success, please let me know!
Do you need a pasta machine for this recipe? Kind of. Unless you are very skilled at rolling out pasta by hand, I recommend picking one up (there’s always one at the second-hand store). Pasta machines are simple to use, and make this process very fast, fun, and satisfying. The one I have is pictured below (it’s Atlas brand #notsponsored), and it creates flat sheets that are perfect for lasagna or ravioli, or you can run the thin sheets through the spaghetti or tagliatelle roller, like I have done for this recipe.
And there’s another recipe in this recipe, and that is for the delightful Basil-Pea Pesto. Herb-y, nutty, and bright, it’s a cinch to whip up and keeps for 2-3 days in the fridge, so you can make it ahead or use the potential leftovers for many delish things (it’s a great dip or sandwich spread). Use frozen peas if that’s all you have – no stress! And I like to use even more peas and basil to finish this dish off, so that it is even more satisfying with all the bright flavours and textures. I hope you enjoy it as much as my family does.
1. Measure out 2 cups / 250g of chickpea flour and place in a mound on clean work surface. Make a large well in the center of the mound and crack three eggs into it, along with the salt and olive oil. Using your hands, mix the ingredients together until you have a smooth dough (if the mixture is dry, add a tablespoon of water to moisten it. If the dough is wet, add the remaining flour, one tablespoon at a time until it less sticky). Knead the dough for about five minutes, then cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for at least half an hour.
2. Unwrap the dough and divide it into quarters, then again for that you have about eight equal portions. Work with one portion at a time, and cover the rest. Flour your work surface and work the dough into a square-ish shape, about the width of the pasta maker (the pasta will become much longer, not wider, so it’s best to take full advantage of the width). Flour the dough again and run it through the thickest setting on the machine (usually #1). Change settings to the slightly thinner setting (usually #2) and run it through the machine. If your pasta sticks at all, dust both sides with more flour. Repeat until the pasta is your desired thickness, then feed it through the cutter of your choice. I went to #6 before cutting it into tagliatelle.
3. As soon as the pasta comes through the cutter, toss it generously with flour and spread it out on clean work surface to dry, or use a pasta drying wrack if you have one.
4. Bring a pot of well-salted water to a rolling boil. Add the amount of pasta you’re using to the water and cook for about 2-3 minutes (don’t overcook! This pasta will disintegrate quickly if boiled for too long). The pasta should float to the top of the pot when it’s ready and be al dente. Drain and plate quickly.
5. You can finish this pasta two ways: one, place the pasta back into the pot and fold in the peas, basil, desired amount of pesto, and a glug of olive oil, the divide among the plates. Alternatively, divide the pasta among the plates, dollop with the pesto, drizzle with olive oil, and garnish with pine nuts and basil. Grind fresh pepper over the top and serve immediately.
1. Bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Add peas and turn off the heat. If using fresh peas, let them sit for about 2-3 minutes until bright green. If using frozen, let them sit for about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the pine nuts until lightly golden. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. Place peeled garlic in a food processor and pulse to mince. Add the toasted pine nuts (reserve a few for garnish), olive oil, salt, basil, and one cup / 140g of peas and blend on high to mix. Add more olive oil if you like a looser pesto. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
I’m currently on holidays in Canada and I’m going to keep this post short and sweet so that I can get back to all of my funky food projects, reading on the dock, and naps. So many naps. I hope you’re all having a glorious summer so far!

This looks so incredible!! I haven’t made pasta in a few years, but will definitely need to try this recipe. Enjoy your time with family back here in Canada!
I use my pasta maker when making chickpea nacho chips to get them thin enough and it works REALLY well for that!! Worth the shelf space!!!
This is better than the store bought stuff eeeeasily. It was my first time making pasta. Just used a rolling pin and pizza cutter instead of a pasta maker -not ideal but definitely doable for now. Thank you, Sarah!! Had to give up gluten/wheat recently, so I’m sooooo happy to have a good old comfort food back on my plate <3
The tagliatelle seemed to require even less cooking time (fyi I also used a pasta machine on setting #6) I cooked mine 2 minutes in rapidly boiling water and they were overcooked (still delicious!). Next time I’ll try cooking them only for one minute. They were honestly delicious, I couldn’t taste the flax or the chickpeas, they pretty much just tasted like regular pasta !
The cost varies quite a lot depending on the location. If you write an email to: info@mynewroots.org my manager can give you an overview of the 2017 costs. Hope that helps and I also hope to host you one day soon!
For those of you who wanted a vegan version of this, I tried it with very finely ground flaxseeds and water in place of the eggs and it worked !!
I didn’t even need to dust the pasta with flour it wasn’t sticky at all. I used just under 3 tbsp of flaxseeds which I ground in my blender until they were very, very fine, added them to a bowl with 8 and 1/2 tbsp of warm water and let that sit for about 5 minutes. Then I followed the instructions, except I salted the pasta water instead of the dough. You’ll have to knead the dough a bit more than if it had eggs in but it’ll work eventually.
This is a perfect pasta recipe, especially after a workout! Please, share more pasta recipes, Sarah! You’re doing a great job!
Hey Sarah, love your recipes and this one looks deeehlicious. I was wondering how you deal with gas from all the legumes? I’m struggling with all the bloating and gassiness that comes from eating lentils and especially chickpeas/beans. is there a trick to it?
How tasty does this recipe look! Thanks for the share, love checking out your blog for weekly dinner ideas.
Oh wow, now you made me drool all over my keyboard 🙂 Looks absolutely delicious and needs to go on my recipe bucket list immediately.
Your homemade pasta looks amazing. I haven’t tried making pasta, but this recipe looks do-able, thanks!
I am so inspired by this. As someone who needs to follow a gluten free diet, I love finding fresh new pastas that I am able to enjoy!! Can’t wait to try it!! Thanks so much for sharing.
THANK YOU for this fantastic and unique recipe. My husband and I are neither gluten-free nor vegan however we always are drawn to your gorgeous recipes. We may have polished off all “4-6 servings” in one sitting…
Oh this looks so delicious! I am totally a sucker for anything with basil. I have tried making socca before, and it made for some really delicious homemade pizzas! I’ve never made chickpea pasta though, or pasta, for that matter! I really want to try this recipe and test out my pasta-making skills 🙂
I have a great love for pasta and love, love homemade pasta. This pasta sounds A-mazing and will be on my weekend cooking list. I have a good feeling about this one…similar to the MNR classics and go to recipes- ‘Best Ever Lentil Salad’, ‘Happy Crackers’ and ‘Raw Choc Brownie’
I’ve never made my own pasta before. I am very curious about using chickpea flour. It looks amazing though and that pesto sauce is just, WOW!
Hello Sarah, this sounds perfect!!! Do you think it makes sense to use roasted chickpeaflour to make it more easily digestable? I found some online. Thanks for your answer!
Looks delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe! I just hope it will be easy for me to make it look and taste the way it looks here.
I’ve tried vegan pasta made with tofu in place of egg before and it was incredible. It had that great chewy texture and everything. Try it 🙂
The funny thing is, and I have not had a look at your blog for a month or two, and this is almost exactly what I made for dinner tonight! I was so surprised when I checked in with your blog later in the evening! The combination of peas, basil and lemon are delicious! I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts as I prefer their flavour but other than that we were on the same page. Delicious! 🙂
Thanks for the great idea! I wonder of it’s like with Jeruzalem artichokes, when you cook them with a spring of rosemary you stop the digestion issue! Worth a try when boiling the pasta with rosemary if it helps reduce the effects. Learn this from a Australian organic food supplier.
Hi this looks amazing. I need to get the pasta machine but I like the pesto recipe too. I’ve been cooking a ton of your recipes from your last book! It was such a pleasure meeting you. Kathleen from LA!
Hi Sarah, do you reckon this recipe would also work in an automatic pasta machine? I’ll try doing it on the one I have at home and let you know the results. Oh, and thanks for this recipe, I’ve been looking for a decent gluten-free pasta recipe for ages!!!!!
I saw somewhere that psyllium husks are a pretty rad binder for GF pasta. I’ve not made pasta from scratch yet but a friend made me psyllium husks gnocchi that held together incredibly well. Could be worth an experiment!
This pasta dish looks super delicious and as a pasta lover seeing all these pictures make me fee really hungry. :-p
You. Are. Amazing!! I am for sure gonna try this. I’m a bit of a socca addict after making your recipe… (Ive actually forgetten I’ve made batter the day before and I’ll sit and wonder what’s in my fridge after a long day of feeding others, then when I remember, I literally skip to the kitchen yelling “pancakes!!” in a gleeful, five yr old kinda way). There was even maybe (definitely) joyful clapping of hands.
Fun fact: I attempted a chickpea gnocchi in culinary school and it was like eating lumps of sad, yellow dry wall. #majorfail
can you tell me if the taste is too strong, I mean, let’s suppose you were making it for a person who is not that into “alternative” pastas… would it please a picky eater?
I realize you are in vacations, so no problem if you cannot answer me before the weekend. It is quite likely that am going to take the risk… 😉
Is there any way for you to add “Print With Photo” option for all of us out here? You photos are lovely and I like to have an image with my saved recipes so I have a vague idea of what it is I’m making. Please please please??? xoxoxo
Oh yes! Please do let your vegan fans know when you find a workaround on the chickpea pasta… can’t wait to try it minus the eggs!
This seems like a perfectly perfect place to substitute aquafaba for egg. I think that sounds like it would be far more successful than flax, if a bit less healthy.

"Wow, Lauren was fantastic! Never did I imagine that selling my house could be so easy! Lauren responded immediately to my inquiry and promptly provided me with an excellent and professional marketing proposal. I knew instantly I was in the right hands. She gave me current and accurate information about my house and the recent market activity, and a property analysis summary showed what I could expect to receive for my home. This was all done without the Hard-Sell technique, which I really appreciated! The photographs posted of my home were top notch and showed the very best of my home! Thanks again Lauren, it truly was a delight to work with you!"
when others just did not take the time to describe a property with a one of a kind location. You went the extra mile with superb marketing and promotional material. We put the home on the market in early February and it sold by the end of March. What more can you ask for from your Real Estate Agent? If I ever have a need for the # 1 agent in Santa Cruz I know who to call.
For those you might be interested and read this, Lauren sold our Condo for the highest price recorded in our complex in an all cash sale.
Thank You again for managing the Buyer agent, the escrow company and of course me, your most difficult client."
"Lauren is the BEST! She did a fantastic job selling our home last April in 10 days for cash. Daily she helped us look for a wonderful home for all of our needs in the area we wanted. We actually were thinking of building but when this beautiful home popped up, she jumped right on it and did an amazing job. Her thought on writing a cover letter helped us win our home. We're still pinching ourselves because we cannot believe we got this incredible home. Thank you so much Lauren for helping our dreams come true. You are the BEST!"
"When we first met Lauren, we were considering selling our house while real estate prices were starting to fall. Lauren did a detailed market analysis for us, walked us through what to expect but never pressured us. In the end, we decided not to move. Four years later, when we felt ready again, we called her. This time, it took us a year to find a house we could call our own. Throughout this entire process, Lauren was extremely patient, professional and always full of advice. I can't imagine going through this process with any other real estate agent. Once we found a house to buy, we had to sell ours fast. From preparing our house, to writing counter offers, Lauren's advice was valuable every step of the way. We received multiple offers and were able to close faster than we thought was possible!
We feel Lauren's years of experience in real estate and her relationship with other realtors is what enables her to get such good results for her clients. Selling is where Lauren really shines. We would work with her again in a heartbeat."
"We had a tough time selling our home until we finally found Lauren. In our first meeting we could tell she was very competent and extremely well versed in our market. She made excellent and reasonable suggestions regarding preparing our home for the market and once we were ready she took over and did a great job. The level of advertising utilizing several different media sources was outstanding. We are convinced that her efforts help us dramatically shorten our sales cycle and maximize our selling price. It is with great confidence that we recommend Lauren and her team to anyone interested in buying or selling property in our market."
Lauren is a smart professional with a prestigious real estate background. We were treated with consideration & respect and felt valued as her clients. We appreciated…

Health IT company athenahealth will use its data to report on the flu and other communicable diseases during the government shutdown. The company will monitor and share population health information from across its national big data set.
The athenahealth network is composed of clinical, operational and business performance data from nearly 44,000 medical providers and 40 million patient records nationwide.
The government shutdown, athenahealth executives note in a news release, has resulted in the furlough of almost 70 percent of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workforce.
As described in a recent tweet from CDC Director Tom Frieden (@DrFriedenCDC16h), “CDC had to furlough 8,754 people. They protected you yesterday, can’t tomorrow. Microbes/other threats didn’t shut down. We are less safe.”
“The CDC normally provides weekly reports on flu activity across the country,” Josh Gray, vice president of athenaResearch at athenahealth, said in a news release. “This information is critical to effectively track outbreaks and encourage public vaccination.”
“Every season is unpredictable,” Gray added. “We hope the CDC is restored to full capacity as soon as possible. In the meantime we’ll leverage athenahealth’s cloud-based technology to report on disease patterns across our national network.”

Housing has been propped up by Central State intervention. As that ends, Phase II of the retrace to pre-bubble valuations is at hand.
The absence of stories about the bottom in housing will mark the final nadir, because the real bottom can only be reached when everyone has abandoned housing as a pathway to easy money. Only when the public and investor class alike have completely lost interest in real estate as a "sure-fire" investment can the real trough be reached.
This destruction of long-held habits and beliefs takes a long time. The closest analogy might be the stock market in the last secular Bear market. Stocks topped out in 1966, though the economy lumbered on until 1969 before faltering. Stocks then meandered for 13 years of stagflation, losing 66% of their inflation adjusted value in 1966 by 1982.
People gave up on stocks. I call this loss of faith "when belief in the system fades:" note how household participation in stocks topped out in 1969, three years after the peak in the market. Participants clung to their belief in stocks for about four years after 1969, at which point participation cratered as they finally abandoned their faith in a "permanent Bull market."
In August 2006, near the top of the housing bubble, I suggested a three-part scenario for the housing bust: it would take eight more years to play out, and the declines would occur in sharp downlegs following a phase-shift model.
Here we see the first phase shift decline and the Central State engineered "recovery," which has now rolled over.
Here is CoreLogic's snapshot of housing (via Calculated Risk). There is still a long way to go down before the market retraces the entire bubble.
The Federal Reserve has bet that housing valuations can be propped up by lowering the interest rate on mortgages. To the degree that a few fence-sitters might be tempted to take the plunge, lower rates have a modest follow-through--but the real determinant of housing is employment, which as we all know, has tanked.
Here's the civilian employment ratio, which reflects the percentage of the labor force that has a job:
By this broad measure, employment has declined to levels last seen thirty years ago. We can also look for clues to housing's future by looking at wages, which have dropped steeply:
These charts pose a simple yet profound question: how can people buy a still-expensive house if they don't have a job, or their income is plummeting?
The proximate triggers for the next phase-shift down include a decline in Central State intervention in the housing market and a return to official "recession" as the "soft patch" turns into a quagmire.
In an era where "market sentiment" swings wildly from day to day and the nation awaits every quarterly report from Apple as the "definitive" bellwether not just on stocks but the entire Galactic Mood, then the notion that trends can take years to play out doesn't sit well with our impatient demands for a "bottom." But long-term trends take years to play out, whether we like it or not.

The main negative involving debt settlement is what could go onto your credit file. It can affect it badly and for years to look. On the other hand, you will be in a position to walk right out your debts far quicker than you would of without the settlement. Future credit, however, will be almost impossible to get for an extended period of time.
If come across yourself in credit card debt might be the period for reducing the total. The debt can climb quickly right now there come 24 hours when you have to look at that balance and make a decision shell out it out of. The decision to prevent charging and paying recorded on your debts is the action.

On Labour Day Weekend some friends and I paddled out to Grenadier Island, one of the 1000 Islands downstream from Kingston, Ontario in the St Lawrence river. It was a new area for me and I was looking forward to doing some exploring. I'd been upstream in the Ivy Lea area years ago, so I knew the paddling would be interesting both because of the currents and the incredible houses that have been built on some of the islands. Leaving from Mallorytown Landing, we paddled over to Grenadier and set up camp, our base for the weekend.
I woke up during the night as rain began dropping on my tent. Oh no, not a rainy weekend after weeks of glorious hot weather! It got worse. By morning, the rain turned to showers but two of us decided to make a re-supply run back to the cars to ferry over things which didn't make the cut on the trip out the day before. On the return crossing, the wind picked up. A lot! The crossing quickly turned into a sideways surf ride! By the afternoon the wind was clearly trying to blow the water out of the river, or so it seemed! Paddling was put on hold while we scratched around for other things to do.
With paddling on the river temporarily put on hold, we followed the island trails visiting some geocaches, some old houses, a golf course (!), a couple of ancient cars and an ice vender! Cold beer! Just the thing when you're stranded on the shore for a weekend without paddling!

My results and the results of my clients are not typical. I am in no way telling you that you will experience what I or my clients have experienced. It is my opinion that most people who purchase ANY how to or improvement product... including, but not limited to my own, get little if any results. I believe this is because they do not take action, and they do not keep trying after hitting the inevitable roadblock. If you want to succeed, you need a good plan, a solid work ethic, and the ability to keep working toward your goals when you hit a snag. If you simply keep buying how to information and never use it, you are wasting your time.
A trip back to Leighton Mos via Martin mere did occur, I wasn't blessed with good weather and didn't see the two star species, and came away feeling pretty let down.
I stayed at the same little site I'd stayed at in July, you'll remember, no internet, mobile phone or washing/toilet facility. Ten pounds a night with electric- three nights are just about managable. I'll look for somewhere different next time though.
Star species one was an Osprey, present on Monday evening but not afterwards. Star species two was a Bittern. seen Tues and Thurs but unfortunately not by me. The best I got were sightings of a Marsh Harrier, Greenshank, and Red Deer.
Great Black Backed Gull was seen at a distance, look at the size of it compared with a Mallard duck.
It's the first time I've photographed anything in the pitch dark so I am very happy with these two shots. I only got 3 shots in total so 2 out of 3 that I can use can't be bad can it? I think they could have been sharper, but as I said I'm happy with these for my first effort.
Let me tell you though, it was not easy. I hadn't got the light set up that Chris G uses, I had only one flash and a live band playing in the distance which carried through the night air made it very difficult.
I only saw two badgers and only for a period of 30 mins. I desperately wanted the badgers to come closer but the two I saw don't like the light, Chris G can vouch for that, they hang around on the edge of the light but don't come close. The one I was hoping for was not seen at all.

Root canal therapy is the most commonly performed procedure amongst all endodontic treatment procedures. An endodontist performs root canal treatment to treat problems related to the soft inner pulp of a tooth.
Root canal treatment is required when nerve tissue inside the teeth degenerates. Without root canal treatment, the infection in the tooth pulp can result in an abscess, which in turn can cause damage to the jawbone. You will need a root canal to save your tooth and to ensure that the tissue around the root of the tooth remains healthy and free from inflammation.
There are several reasons why your tooth may become irritated and inflamed, such as: deep decay, big fillings, trauma to the tooth, a chipped tooth or even repeated dental work.
You may need a root canal if a tooth is causing you pain or if the gums adjacent to the tooth are tender and swollen. Another symptom is if the tooth appears discolored and has become extra sensitive to heat and cold. If these symptoms reveal inflamed and infected pulp inside the tooth then your dentist may recommend a root canal procedure.
Dental caries(cavities), chipped teeth, cracked dental fillings, and injury to the teeth can cause damage to the dental pulp. If dental caries are not treated in time, the decay spreads inwards into the tooth pulp causing nerve damage. Cracked dental fillings allow saliva and harmful bacteria to reach the root canal and infect the pulp. Fractured teeth can expose the pulp. Injury to the teeth can cause pulp damage even if there are no external signs of damage to the inside of the teeth.
When the nerves inside the tooth pulp die, the tooth dentin and enamel can no longer receive organic nutrients and moisture. The inflamed tissue surrounding the tooth causes toothache and infection can damage the bones around the teeth. If the damaged pulp is not treated, bacterial infection and inflammation can loosen the tooth and it may have to be removed. Therefore, root canal therapy is necessary to preserve the tooth and also protect the jawbone.
The procedure takes place in four steps. First, the dentist studies the x-ray of the infected tooth and then administers a local anesthetic. Then, the dentist removes the inflamed nerve tissue through an opening in the crown of the tooth. The root canal is cleaned properly so that no debris or bacteria is left behind. This will ensure that infection and tissue swelling does not happen again. In the second step of the root canal procedure, the dentist will seal off the cleaned root canal cavity. This is to prevent fluids and bacteria from entering the cavity. In the third step the root canal is filled with gutta-percha and adhesive cement mixture. In the fourth and final step, a crown is placed on the sealed tooth which allows the tooth to function normally.
After completion of root canal therapy you might feel some discomfort for few days following the treatment. To alleviate the discomfort you can follow the dentist's recommendation on taking an over the counter pain medication. In more extreme cases the dentist may prescribe an antibiotic and prescription-strength pain reliever to help reduce any remaining infection.
Following root canal therapy you should never chew directly on the repaired tooth until its final restoration has occurred or your tooth may crack. Also, keep in mind that the longer you wait to complete the final restoration the more likely bacteria will reinfect the treated canal requring the therapy to be performed all over again.
Root canal therapy, like every other treatment, is not free of unknowns and complications. There is a possibility that during the procedure a shaping file could break and get stuck in the root canal or that the root of the tooth fractures. In other cases a good seal may not be achieved due to the shape of the root. Lastly, it is possible to miss a hidden root or an extra canal that is in need of treatment. Of course these complications are the exceptions not the norm.
In the event that root canal therapy is unsuccessful, the dentist can discuss alternative options including repeating the treatment or extracting the infected tooth.
As long as I can remember, I have loved numbers. I love numbers in repetition, numbers in sequence, and random numbers that somehow work themselves out mathematically in my head.
The ultimate kismet for me, numerically speaking, happens every day at 11:11. I love to see this particular time of day (and night) appear on my phone, digital clock or the lower-right corner of my computer screen. I can’t exactly explain why, but I do. When I see it, I’m compelled to shout it out loud – “11:11!” – or else it doesn’t “count” somehow (no pun intended). I even set my clocks a few minutes apart throughout the house, so if i miss it on one clock, I can see it on another.
If it’s close, I’ll also sit and watch the clock until it hits 11:11. My really good friends call or email me at 11:11 to make sure I don’t miss the experience. Now that is love! It’s actually a bit contagious, my love of numbers, and now that you have read this, I will go ahead and say it: you will forever be aware of the 11:11’s that cross your path. YOU ARE WELCOME!
In celebration of the dearly anticipated date, 11-11-11, we at CrinkledNose.com are hosting the numerical party of the century. As part of our countdown, we started our celebration on 11-10, complete with chili, cheesecake, and my own awesome brownies (pictured above)! (We didn’t want to wait until the last minute.) We’re blowing it out, Times Square ball-drop style, when the time hits 11:11:11 on 11-11-11.
You see, I’ve been waiting a long time for this day! I see the time 11:11 every day, but to get to see it on the day of, well that’s a bit overwhelming for someone like me.
And I really appreciate the excitement and enthusiasm of all my co-workers hosting the festivities, mostly on my behalf. It’s a special holiday for me, and even though we at CrinkledNose don’t have a holiday photo card for a single day that happens once every hundred years, what other photo greeting card company has a fraction of the groovy coolness to say, “I love you, Vicki,” by turning carrots and celery into number 11’s on a paper plate?
Maybe next century we’ll have a “Happy 11-11-11 Day” CrinkledNose card. Until then, wishing you good numbers, and a happy 11-11-11, from my house to yours.

Perhaps you have heard of the LGBTQ community (individuals) being called "The Family." During my seemingly huge leave of absence around here, I ran directly into my fair share and maybe some of yours too of family.
Beginning Thursday morning (I won't say bright) I had an another appointment with my VA therapist. For what ever reason she couldn't be there so I did a "walk in" which left me to the highest bidder. Or biggest loser. My appointment though was anything close to a loss when I quickly discovered I was talking to a real live transgender doctor at the VA.
Of course I was geeking and trying to keep my mind on the subject of why I was there to start with-me and I never grow tired of talking on the subject.
Plus, part of the discussion just had to center on coming out stories and the world at large now for transgender women and transgender men.
While growing older is inevitable, many of the troubles we associate with aging–including dementia, disability, and an increased dependence on others–are not. The choices we make now can help us to maintain our vitality, a sharp mind, and our independence as we age.
Filled with simple, everyday actions we can take to avoid disease, promote vitality, and prevent dementia and late onset Alzheimer’s, The Aging Brain is an easy-to-use guide to maintaining brain and body health throughout our lives. Based on solid, up-to-date scientific research, the interventions explained in this book not only prevent progression toward dementia even in those who have already shown mild cognitive impairment, they also reduce disability and depression and keep people living independently longer than those who do not practice these methods.
For anyone hoping to slow the aging process, as well as anyone who acts as a caregiver to someone at risk of or already beginning to suffer from dementia

Music can tell stories, increase brain power, and even influence our mood. In this episode of The Brain Warrior’s Way Podcast, Dr. Daniel Amen and Tana Amen are joined by Grammy Award winning producer Barry Goldstein to talk about all things music. Goldstein, also the author of the bestselling book “The Secret Language Of The Heart”, provides scientific research to illustrate how what we hear can affect how we feel.
Daniel Amen:	Welcome back to the Brain Warrior's Way Podcast. We're so excited for the next three podcasts. I actually have one of our dear friends Barry Goldstein whose musical experience spans many styles and genres; from co-producing that grammy award track "69 Freedom Special" with Les Paul, for best rock musical, best rock instrumental in 2005, to providing ambient music for Shirley MacLaine.
Barry has composed and produced for television, film, major record labels and top ten recording artists. In addition, Barry reached Billboard Top Ten albums on new age charts with the New York Times' Bestselling authors Neale Donald Walsch, Anita Moorjani and yours truly Dr Daniel Amen.
We did that last year with the Brain Warrior's Way album which we'll talk about. In addition he's composed and produced music for authors like Gregg Braden, my friend Dr Joe Dispenza, Colette Baron-Reid. Barry's just done so many things.
His bestselling book "The Secret Language Of the Heart" provides the latest scientific research on the benefits of sound, music and vibration. His music is used in hospitals, hospices, cancer centers and medical practices. And the reason we wanted to have him on, besides "we love him and he's our friend". Music is such a hot topic when it comes to the
It's one of the things that has been show to actually grow the hippocampus. The seahorse shaped structure in your brain that's responsible for memory. It can decrease stress hormones. It can improve your mood. There's so many neuroscience and cognitive benefits to it.
Daniel Amen:	Thank you for being with us. So how did this all start for you? How did you fall in love with music and why healing?
Barry Goldstein:	Well it took quite a couple of turns to get to this point. At a young age, I discovered the power of music sitting behind a piano with my mom. Just her playing and me realizing the resonance that happened in room when you hit a piano. So I think I fell in love with it at an early age. As I progressed to becoming a music producer, in New York City, I realized that I was beginning to lose my love of music by [inaudible 00:03:01] a hundred hours of studio time to create a five minute song. And how stressed I was becoming actually within that.
So I started to, kind of, take away everything I knew about music and started to create in a much different way of composing and just allowing the music to come through me as opposed to spending that meticulous time in production and
Barry Goldstein:	I did some research on the internet and at 60 beats per minute, most of us between 60 and 70 beats maintain a relaxed state. So I said "well I really want to reconnect with my heart" and so I began to take these hour long journeys, I call them "of decomposing".
Barry Goldstein:	Yeah I thought "no one will listen to this but maybe it will help me with me my stresses. People encouraged me, they said "you need to put this music out there because it's very, very calming".
They were hour long pieces, not a lot of melody. And now we're learning in research this exact type of music is how we're targeting people with insomnia. So at 60 beats per minute, very long tones, not a lot of melody, really kinda induces us to relaxation. So I think I was doing it then and then I became very curious as we began to gather testimonials from people of how they were using it. In dentist's offices, and for sleep, and with their mom who had dementia.
Tana Amen:	So I'm one of those people, I use that music to go to sleep. I mediate to it. I actually did a long dental procedure with no anesthesia because I just didn't want the anesthesia.
Tana Amen:	But using meditation and music, so I never really understood how it affects your brain. But clearly it does, music is very powerful.
Daniel Amen:	[crosstalk 00:04:56]Well we love it so much that Barry's music is the brain enhancing music we have one Brain Fit Life. And, it's similar to our Billboard charting album "The Brain Warrior's Way"
Daniel Amen:	I love saying that. 'Cause there's music for sleep, there's music for relaxation. There's music for focus, creativity, motivation.
Daniel Amen:	So how is that all different? I mean you target the beat of the heart but when you want to help someone feel happier, or more focused, how do you change the music for that?
Barry Goldstein:	Yeah, well it does target the beat of the heart and the heart-brain relationship is really interesting. When you're targeting your heart you're really targeting your brain as well and vice-versa. So if I'm slowing down and I'm in that relaxed state and my heart is coming down ... And my heart rate is coming down to a relaxed state, I'm not gonna be in beta, you know, with that. I'm gonna move to a slower brain wave state as well.
There's this conversation that happens between the heart and brain that's targeting these. But really a lot of it, as well as dynamics, within music. So when we're trying to relax in the evening, you want very little melody. But if you have an important business meeting and you want to be motivated and inspired, you know you're going to listen to something with rhythm right? You're gonna want to feel that in your body.
Barry Goldstein:	And so, you're working with dynamics as well and we've showed this in research with attention, you know when there's dynamics in music. For example, when you go to a concert and all of a sudden there's a pause in the music. Your attention is completely grabbed by that silence because all of a sudden that dynamic has changed.
Barry Goldstein:	Yeah, by creating these dynamics you can target different moods and enhance different moods.
Tana Amen:	So, without knowing any of the science. I mean, I think most of us intuitively know that music changes our moods, changes our states and it can do it very quickly.
Tana Amen:	And I know, like I just said, for sleep I will often meditate to that type of music you talked about. Those long, sort of drawn out, I don't know what you would call it technically, but slower type of music.
Tana Amen:	I'm a rock girl, put some Def Leppard on and I'll get motivated and I want to work out. That's my happy place.
Daniel Amen:	I grew up loving Cat Stevens and as soon as I do, because it reminds her of her drug addict uncle, the trauma when she was four years old.
Barry Goldstein:	Right, and I think that's really where we're going with music. Now that we're starting to see more and more research on it, we're getting more specific because it's not just a panacea where we can prescribe music like we do medicine.
Tana Amen:	[crosstalk 00:08:04]Music can be therapeutic but it can be traumatizing based on your experience.
Barry Goldstein:	That's right and I think that's where we're starting to fine-tune research and starting to say "wow we really have to get more specific with this because music's very powerful".
We just can't sub categorize and say "okay, classical is great for this, heavy metal's not good for this" because within each one of those, there's so many differences. And I think we might be over simplifying a bit when we're looking at genre specific music. For example in classical music, you can listen to the William Tell Overture or you can listen to a Brahms Lullaby.
Barry Goldstein:	Right. What part of classical is it? What part of reggae is it when we're talking about that? What's the tempo of it?
Barry Goldstein:	It's when we begin to realize the power of music that we can incorporate it into a program where we're targeting our own mood states. We're targeting physical challenges. You know insomnia or we're targeting even becoming more emotionally intelligent with autistic children.
Barry Goldstein:	We can talk more about that but there's some amazing studies of how music engages the brain and the emotional aspects of that to create emotional intelligence in autism.
Daniel Amen:	So there's this concept called "entrainment" which means your brain picks up the rhythm.
Daniel Amen:	And so ... Talk about that a little bitt and how people are using your music in different kinds of settings.
Barry Goldstein:	Okay. Well music is a language, so it speaks to us. And just like a language, it creates a rhythm.
Like, you ever hear people say "I'm falling out of rhythm in my life"?. So music has a metronome that it basically utilizes. You know "one - two - three - four" "two - two - three - four". Your heart and our body is also a metronome. And study has shown at 66 beats per minute, they just had people listening to a metronome, and it actually reduced anxiety.
So when we begin to apply that into music as well, targeting different states. If we want to be relaxed at 60 beats per minute, let's listen a piece like we discussed. Where it's really long tones, not a lot of melody that's going to distract you. But your heart has the ability to adapt and that's why when people are working out, they're not gonna listen to relaxation music.
There's been a study, I think it was done by Pandora, that showed people listening to yoga - one of the most important things for them is the music that I played-
Barry Goldstein:	And they're taking you on more of a journey right, because there's several stages of yoga.
Barry Goldstein:	Yeah. It will have slow music, it will have music to move to because your heart's adapting. You're beginning to breathe to it and your breath is beginning to be the conductor as well.
I consider the heart like the orchestra leader that's going on in your physical body and when you're breathing, that's the conductor saying "no let's slow down here, let's speed up here" and then your heart starts to send out those messages we call this coherence.
Barry Goldstein:	So when your heart is beating at these smooth, orderly rhythms right, it's just like the conductor. Wow you can hear the harmonies, you can hear the beautiful sections of the orchestra.
Tana Amen:	So that's one of the reasons it has the power to help us calm down and slow not only our heart but even change our brain state.
Daniel Amen:	Which is the beat-to-beat variability of your heart that is associated with anxiety, depression, memory issues. The more variability ... So it's a myth that when you ... I take your pulse. Or you're a nurse, you know when you take a pulse it should be even. Because, if there's too little variability that's a sign of illness and stress. And after you have a heart attack, if you don't have the variability, you have more than double the risk of dying in the next two years.
Certain kinds of music increase heart rate variability which is heart health, which then goes to brain health.
Tana Amen:	So for people listening, there's not really inherently anything right or wrong with listening ... Because you don't like slow music it's not a bad thing and you like, you know a faster beat. It's just your preference.
Barry Goldstein:	Yeah, I mean there are some great starting points with it that we can plug in. Just like there's some general things in medicine or general things in nourishment right? That we know work really well, like what we're talking about.
But ultimately it's targeting the states you want to be in and I call it "becoming the DJ of your own life". Just like a DJ-
Give us a prescription on ... Here at the Brain Warrior's Way Podcast we talk about ... So here are brain healthy habits, here are things to do and things not to do right? They're general prescriptions.
And then there are prescriptions for "I struggle with ADD", "I have anxiety", "I have depression" and so on. Next podcast we're actually going to go into some of those conditions and talk about different strokes for different folks.
Daniel Amen:	But for now as we finish this one up, talk about what are some general guidelines on how to use music to boost your heart health but also your brain health?
Barry Goldstein:	Okay. So tell me about your day today. How did your day start off? Some things that are going on in your day and let me work with you to create a little music program for the day.
Daniel Amen:	Awesome. I woke up early thinking I'm working on "The Magic Of Memory". A new course with a friend of mine who's a memory savant. And so as soon as I woke up, I went through the forty things I memorized last night, just as an exercise to see if I could remember.
Barry Goldstein:	So let me ... I'll pause you there. With that you're talking about gathering a lot of information right? Waking up excited right? And you basically want to integrate some of that information and just allow it to stew and brew.
So for me I would ... First of all I like to start off my day with a piece of music that connects me to gratitude. Okay.
Barry Goldstein:	Yeah, and just really connecting with my breath, my heartbeat. I call this the "internal symphony". The sounds within me. So I could start off with a piece of music that creates gratitude for me. And sometimes that's a very calming piece of music, or it could be Sly & The Family Stone "Thank You For Letting Me Be Myself".
We're not getting genre specific, we're gearing towards what emotion do I want to target and what piece of music is going to make me feel that way. So that would be my jumpstart for you with that, beginning in gratitude.
Then I would ask myself "what's my intention for the day?" So where do you want to go next? What would you like to achieve in your day?
Daniel Amen:	I love what you said because as soon as my feet hit the floor in the morning, I have a mantra for myself "today is going to be a great day"
Because then my brain finds why it's going to be a great day. So if there's a piece of music that's attached to gratitude and positive emotion that's awesome.
Barry Goldstein:	Yeah and mantra too, that's another great thing to talk about. But what repetitive mantra does, it takes you out of your thinking mind and also it increases cerebral blood flow.
So that mantra, when you're doing it over and over again, you're going to increase that blood flow to get those ideas going to get your day started.
Tana Amen:	So ... You know I adore you. He's the yin to my yang, he's amazing, he grounds me. But he's the poster child for being grounded and like, not getting shaken up that much. That's not me. Let's just talk about people who are a bit more like ... Like I wake up in the morning, had that total same wake up with the gratitude, I want to focus and get myself ... And I do that, I did that. And then instantly my day just gets hectic. Okay? Got really hectic, really fast and then I got off the tracks and got really annoyed at something really quickly.
So grounding right? So if you want to re-ground in your morning. You feel like you're going off-base. For you, thank about the ground.
Barry Goldstein:	So grounding, think of that. You want to go "what does the ground do?" It goes lower.
Barry Goldstein:	[crosstalk 00:18:18]So you're gonna feel yourself more in your body because you can feel the bass.
Tana Amen:	That makes sense because I just like, I literally ... I'll turn the bass up in my car. Because I'm like "I just feel that". You just like ... Feel it
Barry Goldstein:	[crosstalk 00:18:34]Yeah so those are the lower frequencies. Bass are lower frequencies, they are slower moving. They're lower. Lower and slower. If it was the other way around and you want to be in a more creative state, you you want to go higher because they're lighter energies. But grounding back in is going to be all about the bass.
Daniel Amen:	So when we come back, we are going to talk more about how to use music as part of your day. And how different people like, Tana and I can use music in a more targeted way.

Githead's debut Headgit EP and subsequent full length Profile brought angular post-punk at a time when, quite frankly, everyone else was doing it. That Wire frontman Colin Newman served as its voice and postmodern lyricist did surprisingly little to differentiate it from the fresher crop of youngbloods. Both releases had their respective moments of memorable majesty, such as the subdued tech-house of "To Have And To Hold" and the slogan expropriating screed "Option Paralysis," though neither produced the anticipated excellence of a collaboration between Newman, his wife Malka Spigel, and Robin "Scanner" Rimbaud. With Art Pop, their latest for the Swim ~ imprint, the trio (now a quartet) finally delivers, taking their sound to a level that demands attention from indie rock dweebs and PBR-guzzling hipsters alike.
From the opening guitar chug of "On Your Own," an immediate wind of change breezes through, and continues to do so as a jangly pop groove with Newman's unique pipes keeps things in perspective. As expected, Newman's lyrics are still as bizarre as ever, with choruses about overloaded email inboxes seeming just a bit too heavy handed, though his rediscovered sense of delivery excuses him of such habitual excesses. As he did so successfully with Wire in the '80s, Newman consummates the sordid wedding of accessible music and theory-laden message, from the complex spittle-flecked diatribe of "Drive By" to "These Days," a deceptively simple lament of numbness.
Spiegel and drummer Max Franken's rhythm section not only keeps everything in order, but also creates elaborate, brilliant grooves that are impossible to ignore. On "Space Life," Spiegel's bass line bursts through the guitar fuzz with a insatiable vitality, while Franken methodically accents every snare. Even the tracks where Newman takes a backseat still shine, though for entirely different reasons. "Lifeloops" detours from the rock n roll for a plucked guitar ballad awash in dreamy synth, with a coolly monotonous Spigel taking on the vocal duties throughout, as does the vocoded "Jet Ear Game," with lyrics cut-up and reassembled from media reviews of Profile.
The material here is anything but homogenous, ranging from the gravely pastoral and somber "Live In Your Head" to the slow and sleazy psych-funk of "Drop," though it all comes together in nearly perfect unison. Of course Wire fanatics and those who have continuously followed Newman’s solo career will enjoy Art Pop, but additionally it has the potential to reach entirely new audiences as previously mentioned. Finally, Githead has made good on its promise with this essential release.
Miss Autopsy shares a lot of common ground with early Mountain Goats, such as uncomfortably raw vocals and a tendency towards rather wordy narrative lyrics. However, Steve Beyerink has something that John Darnielle does not: a singular propensity for squirm-inducingly soul-baring misanthropy and pessimism that precludes absolutely any possibility of widespread acceptance. While certainly somewhat flawed, this album is not an easy one to forget.

The last time we left you we were happily cruising down the beautiful Oregon Coast. The southern part of the state was no less impressive. In some places it looks like the mountains have literally met with the ocean and started tumbling in to it. There are also spots where the power of the ocean has carved out magnificent features in the rocks, like Devil’s Punchbowl…
All these Devil related names (trust me there were many more) gave me the idea for this blog post, so here it is:
Traditionally it`s thought that pride is the source of most of the other deadly sins, but in the case of a touring cyclist it`s definitely gluttony. That is why I have placed it at the top.
GLUTTONY: A touring cyclist needs to eat about 5000 calories a day. That means a breakfast of cereal, yogurt and a banana. Morning recess is usually some fruit and a Clif Bar and maybe some trail mix. Lunch consists of a couple wraps and some snacks, or a cafe burger or sandwich and fries. Then there’s afternoon recess. After that we usually stop for dinner groceries and have some chocolate milk, chips, ice cream or other sugary goodness (this is like the reward for the day snack). Dinner is the same sort of thing we would eat at home, just in larger quantities and we always finish the day off with a chocolate bar dessert.
GREED: Touring cyclists are usually on a budget, so this means getting anything and everything for as cheap as possible. This is quite evident in the lengths people will go to stay in state parks, which have these great $5 hiker/biker sites. There`s also the act of stealing. Things like peanut butter, jam and honey packets are common casualties. The gluttony also plays a big role in this one.
LUST: I won’t elaborate too much on this one, but we do end up staring at each others spandex-clad butts all day.
WRATH: Two words: broken spokes. For some reason these are occurring at too regular an interval for David at the moment; as in every day. This is a problem we are going to have to look in to in San Francisco.
SLOTH: Although we spend about 5hrs a day pedaling our bikes, we spend the other 19, sleeping, eating and generally not doing much of anything. We usually sleep around 10hrs a day, and don`t even ask me about rest days.
ENVY: You have no idea the torrent of jealousy that takes over when I`m struggling my way up a hill and I see an oncoming cyclist cruising their way down with a friendly smile and a wave. Today we were actually passed going uphill by a pickup carrying two bikes with panniers and blinking lights (meaning they were very recently riding). Don’t get me wrong, I was jealous, but sometimes there’s a certain amount of pride that takes over too…
PRIDE: I`ve got to say there`s no feeling quite like it when I look at a map and see where we are and where we started and think that we made it all that way under the power of our own legs.
I'm not sure even St. Augustine would have seen the pride you describe as a sin... not when it's so well earned. Just be careful, you know pride comes before the fall, (uh, maybe in this case the season rather than your relationship to the pavement). Take Care... JPP

OK we've been able to do the clan quest for lvl 4, Gm assisted since it was bugged, and today i did the quest for lvl 5 and added the academy.
Be sure to add any new chars into the academy for clan points. Also if you want some nice, cheap clan armor the quest is simple to do. If you don't know how to do it, give me a holla. Quest takes about 15-20 minutes to do for a full D grade robe, light, or heavy set.
I've done 1 academy member but we only get 360 clan points, not 400 anymore. I have another one there ready to go at lvl 20. Good news is the clan armor's are tradable atm too.

WHITEGATE native Marie Madden joined Concern Worldwide as their communications officer last October and has spoken to The Clare Champion about her experience working for the NGO, particularly in dealing with the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh.
CONCERN have recently launched the Bangladesh Monsoon Appeal as nearly one million Rohingya people face further catastrophe at the makeshift refugee camp they are currently occupying in the coastal region of Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh.
Marie Madden, from Whitegate, has just returned from a two week trip to Cox’s Bazar where she has seen first hand the conditions these people, primarily made up of women and children, have been living in. She explains how these people have already been through so much pain and suffering and now stand to lose the makeshift homes they have made in monsoon rains.
She explained that the Rohingyas are an ethnic minority based in Myanmar, and despite having been there for generations they don’t have citizenship and are being persecuted. Those living in Myanmar don’t have access to any services such as education and health services.
“They have been victimised pretty much their entire life and there has been sporadic violence over the last decade or so. Up to August smaller groups of Rohingya have been fleeing to Bangladesh and up until then there was about 200,000 Rohingya in Bangladesh. There was a huge outbreak of violence by the military in August/September and since that an additional 700,000 have fled to Bangladesh. At the moment we estimate there are 905,000 in the Cox’s Bazar area of Bangladesh, which is on the coast,” Marie said.
Marie has been to other countries where people have faced similar issues, earlier this year she was in the Democratic Republic of Congo but she said even that experience did not prepare her for this latest trip. “I had heard a lot about how precarious the situation was before arriving in Bangladesh but it was shocking to see it for myself. I travelled to the Democratic Republic of Congo in April and met some people who were in a similar situation in the sense that they had to flee because of conflict but I’ve never seen anything on the scale of the Rohingya camps,” she said.
Marie outlined that what is so unusual about the camp is that Cox’s Bazar is a tourist area where a lot of Bangladeshi people go on holidays. “It is on Kolatoli Beach which is really scenic, so it’s a nice spot of the country but within 45 minutes now you have this huge spontaneous refugee camp with nearly a million people in it that has just shot up in the space of eight months”.
Refugee camps are often planned by aid organisations but the difference in Bangladesh is that this was not planned out in anyway and it has just become an area where “literally hoards of people” are lodging themselves. “We launched an emergency appeal in Cox’s Bazaar in Bangladesh in response to this huge influx of people”.
Over the last eight months aid organisations have moved in and the Government and army have been working to put order on the camp and put better structures in place for people to live in. “Everyone there is living in these small structures made out of slats of bamboo with plastic thrown over it. The army are helping to reinforce them but they are still really flimsy. The initial places where people settled were not planned and that’s why the monsoon threat is so terrifying at the moment,” Marie explained.
The area has little vegetation and the hovel type structures are sitting on what is effectively just sand. The difficulty now is that monsoon rains have threatened the camp. “It’s a race against time now to try and minimise the human cost of the rains. The Rohingya people have been through so much already, it’s unthinkable that more devastation could be around the corner,” Marie explained.
Marie outlined that the Rohingya’s have gone through “horrific violence” before arriving in Bangladesh and explained that because many of the murders and violence were directed at men, the camps are made up of primarily women and children. Currently Concern’s primary focus is on nutrition and it runs eight outpatient therapeutic clinics.
“We focus on severely malnourished children, we screen them and we either treat them or refer them onto hospitals if things are particularly bad. There was a lot of gender based violence [in Myanmar] so they are very vulnerable. A lot of them were walking for up to two weeks to cross the border in very dangerous conditions to try to get to where they are now”.
Marie said from a personal perspective, it’s definitely been the toughest environment that she has ever worked in.
“Many of the Rohingya people that I spoke to had seen their family members killed brutally in front of them, had suffered sexual violence and are now struggling to feed themselves and their family. One woman visited our Outpatient Therapeutic Programme while I was there with a small child, who was clearly very malnourished and ill. It turned out that his mother, the women’s sister, had died during childbirth and she was struggling to raise him alongside her own five children in the camp. His arms were so thin and fragile and he could barely stay awake. I have a four-year-old niece myself who is a bundle of energy so it was just heartbreaking to see the conditions that these children are living in,” she said.
Having talked to the women about their experiences Marie said many are saying rapes were being used as a tool. A lot of the migrants have lost their husbands, parents, and witnessed very brutal violence in their villages. “Many have had their houses burned down and were forced to flee with just the clothes on their back, and many had to leave elderly or sick relatives behind who weren’t able to travel with them, which was very difficult,” Marie said.
She recalled meeting one young girl who arrived to the camp a couple of months pregnant and delivered her baby in the camp. “Her husband was either killed or separated from her in the violence and she not been reunited with him so she is on her own now. She has some extended family there but everyone is worried about the relations that were left behind,” Marie said.
What Concern is hearing is that there were military forces were turning up in villages setting houses on fire and shooting people in front of their loved ones. Marie said these people had no option but to flee.
“Anyone who was mobile and physically capable of leaving, fled and if they had relations they could carry they would flee and try to carry them. People who had money could pay for transport but anyone else were walking for 10 to 15 days. A lot were taking very unsafe passage over the Naff river. A couple of women told me their boat capsized, so they almost died and they had to recover from that and then keep going and try to see if they could get to Bangladesh because they had no other option. For the likes of me it is impossible how you would cope with that. Another man told me how his house was set on fire and his wife died in the fire. He is in the camp with five children and a grandchild, and he is trying to bring them up by himself. His house is in the Kutupalong Extension which is one of the most vulnerable areas of the Rohingya camp and he is worried about moving because he has been through so much and they’ve just started to settle into life again. They are an incredibly resilient people and they are doing their best to make a home for themselves for now in the camp but the monsoon is threatening any progress that has been made now and it could be catastrophic”.
Marie added that many have mental health issues having been traumatised by what they have witnessed. “Your heart really goes out to them. It is just impossible to overstate the trauma that they have gone through whether its women who have been subjected to gender based violence, or people who have lost their loved ones and literally seen them being killed in front of them and then having to flee to an unknown country with nothing and start over and not only worry about themselves but worry about how they will feed their children or what the future holds for them. They don’t have access to food or to healthcare and with the monsoon rains access is becoming a problem as roads are being cut off due to the floods”.
She said the worry is there will be landslides and a lot of these houses will be swept away. Disease will be another major concern. “Sanitation is very poor, as you can imagine with a million people in one place. There are latrines but there is no proper drainage or sanitation so if the rains take hold then there are very real concerns about the spread of disease. There have been deaths already with reports of anywhere from three to 12 deaths from the monsoon in the camp. As the rain intensifies the worse it will get. All of the NGOs are scrambling to help people reinforce their tents and try to move people if they are in low lying areas”.
What is so heartbreaking Marie said is the amount of children running around in the heat, which this month hit 40 degrees with 85% humidity. “They are beautiful innocent children and the road ahead is just so uncertain for them. They don’t have fans or water and in a lot of cases they are not well, and they have no room to move around [in the hovels]. You could have an entire family of eight or nine in one room. It’s like a sauna you can’t imagine how people are surviving in it. You would be in there for an hour and you would be feeling faint, it’s really really tough,” Marie continued.
She said it is very difficult to see how the situation can improve as the funding required to deal with this type of a crisis is “massive”. “At the moment NGOs are running out of money and they can only work with what they have so that is a challenge that’s there too. At the moment we are working on nutrition but we are hoping to scale up our response and that will include sanitation, hygiene and shelter so the more funding that comes in the more we will be able to help people prepare for this monsoon”.
The camp is relying on overseas aid to survive. Many offer labour and services inside the camp and trade this work for food and a bartering system has developed so there is an internal economy in the camp. “What really stood out to me is a lot of them really want to return to Myanmar, it’s home, it is a human instinct because you want to be around your familiar area, and the people you know and your land, but they are just so scared and they can’t go back until they get citizenship, they are not comfortable going back. We’ve heard reports that violence is still ongoing in Myanmar even though it is supposed to have ceased at this stage. It’s very tough to sit opposite someone and they tell you stories like that and not be able to offer any reassurance because the road and future is just so uncertain for them. Even though aid organisations are doing everything they can the scale of the crisis is proving to be a really tough challenge,” Marie added.
The government in Bangladesh is trying to deal with the situation but it is incredibly difficult with such a huge influx of people. “It already has a huge population and they don’t have the resources to sustain this Rohingya population. They have been hugely supportive and facilitated the camps and are working with the aid organisations but from their point of view this has to be a short term measure, they can’t sustain them long term, so the Rohingya’s are caught between a rock and a hard place. Aid organisations are going to struggle to keep up the scale of the response in the long term but they can’t go home because they don’t have citizenship and it is a dangerous place to be,” Marie outlined.

It’s finally feeling like Summer-time, and I must confess as a wedding videographer here in Tipperary, this is one of my favourite times of the year. In terms of filming, I am given much greater scope for filming the outdoors. Filming is made easier by the fact that the bridal party can spill out into the grounds of their wedding venue, at ease and relaxed in the summer heat. I pride myself on filming my wedding parties in a discreet manner, a skill I have been working on for years. When the wedding guests come out into the sunshine, they relax and my job is made that little bit easier and even more pleasurable. When the sun shines, everyone unwinds, their shoulders drop, and they smile and enjoy the day that little bit more. The extra hours of sunlight also mean I have a bigger window to obtain great footage.
Naturally, summer-time is my busiest time of year. If you’ve recently become engaged, now is a great time to start making preparations if you intend to marry in summer 2016. My diary for next year is filling up quickly, so I think it’s best to prepare as much in advance as possible, which will also minimise stress during preparations. Competition for venues and churches is greatest at this time of year, so you will need to start putting plans and ideas together, and make bookings soon. It may seem obvious to most but here are a few great reasons for booking a summer wedding for 2016.
A garden weddingIn recent years I’ve watched many young couples make the most of the summer weather by moving their celebrations outdoors. This is a great way to keep expenses down and can create a wonderfully relaxed and casual feel to the day. Despite it being summer-time, our weather in Ireland is not always dependable. However, having a wedding in summer-time can give you greater freedom in terms of choosing a wedding venue. Outdoor weddings are still not licensed in Ireland, but if you are having a civil ceremony at a hotel or registered venue, you may consider venturing into the grounds of the venue for the entire reception or once the meal and speeches have ended. Summer-time can give you greater creative freedom in terms of choosing a venue. Most hotels will have maintained their gardens well and at this time of year they will be in full bloom and looking their best.
Get Creative!I’ve filmed wonderful family weddings held in the grounds belonging to the bride’s parents. Marquees are becoming increasingly popular and can be borrowed or rented and erected in the back garden. This works particularly well for smaller weddings and is a great way to help keep your wedding under budget. The only possible downside is that the party can go on until the small hours of the morning! And with all that space, you’ll easily be able to accommodate your evening guests as well. When planning your garden, don’t forget you’ll need a generator and lights for the evening-time!
Summer-time weddings tend to have a greater turn-out. More of your guests will be free to book time off work and they will be booking time off work anyway. The kids will off school, so families won’t be tied to the school calendar either. Family members who are living abroad are more likely to travel for a summer wedding and will make the trip their summer vacation. So you will have greater freedom to choose a week-day for your wedding and be less restricted to choosing a Saturday.
Great video and photosHaving your reception outdoors can put your creativity to the test. Recently I filmed a wedding reception in a marquee and the bride had decorated the inside with bunches of flowers called baby’s breath, Bristol fairy, or its proper name – Gypsphila. This delicate flower has been popular for as long as I can remember, but now more than ever it has become extremely popular – now it is used for bouquets and centre-pieces simply on its own. The result was fabulous and an inexpensive option. Summer weddings have a much larger colour palette and so give great freedom of expression in terms of colour – summer wedding really pop with colour, usually the brighter and bolder the better. I’ve also noticed brides and grooms becoming more creative over the summer months by wearing outfits slightly less conventional, for example – brightly coloured evening shoes and jewellery for the bride and coloured braces for the groom.
The summer weather means, we can travel together to great locations for filming after the ceremony and with our incredible landscapes here in Tipperary, we really our spoiled so we should make the most of them. I’ve filmed some beautiful scenes of the married couple walking through a meadow or down a path beside a stream. These are only a few of ideas for filming during summer! If you want to discuss your wedding ideas for filming your wedding, please get in touch and we can have a chat. If you would like to know more about choosing a wedding videographer you can read more about what I do here.

Any lurkers out there? If so, prepare to be outed. Welcome to the lurker Debutante Ball, where you may dress all in white and unleash yourself onto society by answering any, all, or none of the following questions:
8. Have you ever slapped someone in the face? I've always wanted to, in one of those dramatic moments, but I've never had the opportunity.
Also, regular commentators, I expect you to answer some of these too. Because otherwise, when the lurkers chicken out (it's in their nature by very definition... they're lurkers), and nobody comments, I will feel like a loser. More so than usual.
Naming Lurker Names (because discomfort is sorta becoming a blog tradition around here): Suzie S. I know you're out there. And Cousin A, it doesn't count to "phone in" your comment.
What's that you say? You need the proper motivation? How about, a free book of your choosing from Amazon. Taaa Daaa. Anyone who comments today gets entered in the drawing. We haven't done one of these in a bazillion years.
I don't know if you've heard, but vampires are sorta hot right now, a theme which coincides with today's Trashy Mag installment.
Entertainment Weekly is holding a contest (a bi-weekly event) to vote for the hottest vampire (sure to be Edward) in the history of the world (the past two years, really).
Also gracing the cover, looking definitely deader and fangy-er than Edward, is Bill from True Blood.
Okay, they're both hot. Whatev's. But if I was really going for all-time faves, like from the 1900's and beyond, my personal list would start with...
Original Bad-Arse Vamp. Started out very bad. Ended up semi-bad. Always hot, especially with the accent.
I in no way endorse the show he's on, because we are a PG rated blog. (Okay, PG-13, but mostly because of you racy commentators...) And I absolutely do not recall watching the show, or if he's even on a show. (How's that for plausible deniability?)
But, Eric. I love to hate him. He puts the "man" in "Norsman". Okay, I don't really know what that means... but I often lose track of logic when I'm staring at his picture:
Because if you know me, then you know any vampire list has to include good ole Nosferatu. To remind us that vampires were not always considered hot.
I'm Cari from KS. I'd say my most recent favorite book is Collins' Hunger Games. I'm definitely a Twizzlers person. I had no idea who or what Rafa was until I clicked the link, though I do pause on tennis from time to time when flipping channels.
My thing that must go: the crap in the spare bedroom. I really, really need to sort it out and toss some stuff.
I was 17 when I had my first kiss. Wait...or was I younger? No! I blocked it out! I was in 8th grade and it was this horrid slobbery attack. Eck.
Being the metrosexual man that I am, I have no problem in admitting that David Boreanz (Angel) and Erik from True Blood are good looking men.
We have heard nonstop stuff about Twilight, etc...but the 90s were vampire fabulous with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. If people want to see some great vampire stuff, you need to go back a decade and check that stuff out. Long live Buffy and Angel.
Cari- Welcome! Love the Hunger Games too. Can empathize with the slobbery kiss. Slapping your dad? I never wouldve survived. Thanks for saying hi!
6. Thing that must go: cute shoes that you cannot wear for more than 3 minutes. Can't they make comfy AND cute shoes?!?!
I like your list but I think Keifer Sutherland from Lost Boys is missing. Also, for the Edward versus Bill, it should be Edward versus Eric but I'm biased.
I will say the first season was WAY over the top, but by the end it seemed they may have toned down the *ahem* gratuitousness. I haven't bothered with the second season, I'm afraid to see if they have gone back to the evil HBO ways.
book:101 famous poems~ t.v. i am so corny i love The Medium.. most people don't even know what it is!
if your talking about tennis RAFA. isn't he beautiful. if your talking about RAFIA that straw ribbon stuff used in decorating.. not so much. sorry couldn't resist.
i am in a blog slump so i have been writing useless trivia,news articles..etc. i need to keep my blog current or i think everyone will leave me. i am very insecure that way.
5. Do you love Rafa as much as I do? He's hot, but I'm not much of a tennis fan. I'm not much of any sports fan, though.
9. Have you seen Jacob's abs? If so, what do you think? I haven't seen that picture yet, no. Whoa! It's hot! And, he does NOT need to pull up his pants. Hip dents are my favorite part of the male body. *fans myself*
I'm kind of a vampire novice. So, I don't have much variation from the list and, yes, Edward does make the top of the list for me. If we were strictly going with supernatural beings and not just vampires, Jace from the Mortal Instruments would definitely be on my list too.
9. Hell YES BABY!!! It's my screen save on my phone. Bree, that is blasphame...(Again, you really should have put #10 at the beginning)
Una- Thanks for bringing Lost Boys into it. I loved loved that movie as a kid, although I was more in love with Jason Patric's vamp than Kiefer's.
Gramee- welcome to the blog! We need a sophisticated person such as yourself (one who lists poems as their favorite book) around here. And I definitely mean tennis Rafa, not crafty Rafia (which I didn't even know existed until you mentioned it...) When you start blogging again, give us the link and we'll have a looksy.
Jenni- ditto on Bones. And you don't need to like Sports to appreciate Rafa. Also, thanks for bringing up Alex from Moonlight. He didn't get enough time to grace the television world. RIP
Cam- Thanks for putting the "13" in PG-13. #5 gets you kicked off my blog, but #9 gets you back in, and up to blog royalty.
Rob- Welcome, eh? (Sorry, that's the only Canadian phrase I know... except: Hockey. Eh?) Bet you wish you went back to lurking status right about now, correct?
As for #6, if you learn the secret in this current econo-slime, let me know. And #9? Really? I thought they saved that for Edward's abs... oh well. Here's to a healthy suspension of reality.
IF I knew someone named Cousin A, then I MIGHT expect her to respond to question #4 about licorice. IF. :)
Ok, Brodi, given a choice between ONLY Twizzlers and Red Vines, I'd say it's a wash, because the only licorice truly worth celebrating is authentic black licorice. Please tell me that you at least sampled the pseudo-German little black licorice buttons that Grandpa Ashton always had around the house growing up! Ok, technically, they were from the candy counter at ZCMI, but they reminded Grandpa of the good German stuff from his mission, and he got me hooked! Seriously, I know my mom loved that black licorice too, but am I the only Ashton of our generation still carrying the torch? Say it ain't so.
And no, I'm not going to pick a favorite vampire--I'll just remind myself that vampires are totally made-up and look forward to when you start blogging again about putting hair gel in your eyes. Maybe the secret to getting you published is for you to write your autobiography!
I don't remember all the qustions on the list, nor the order. And I'm to lazy to back and look. So here's what I can think of in no particular order:
Amy- so instead of blogging about fictitious beings, you'd rather have me stick hair gel in my eye? Something is seriously messed up about that. And, no, Grandpa Ashton never shared the black licorice with me. He saved that for his favorite grandkids.
Diana- welcome! I, too, love the Hunger Games, and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel Catching Fire next month.
3. Book: hmmm....don't have a favorite, but I love lots of them. Really liked "Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet."
7. First kiss: Ah, but you know this story already....the stuff of romance novels. I was 12, he was 70-80...
8. I've slapped my kids on the mouth for spitting, does that count? Don't turn me in, it was more of a love tap.
Cousin K- I always loved the cover for "Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet." Maybe I'll have to pick up a copy. And you are not the only one who would pick Red Vines... Red Vines all the way!
9. Have you seen Jacob's abs? If so, what do you think? - I agree that he needs to pull up his pants, but he is hot!
6. The tops of otter pop wrappers, dumb pedestrians, and medical school secondary application essays.
Welcome, Paradox. (That sounds like I'm inviting a statement that contradicts itself... which I guess applies to me.)
Amen on #6, although the special Edward Valentine Heart Candies someone left on my porch will always hold a special place in my stomach. I think mostly because those candy hearts have congealed into a mass there. I digress... where were we?
Ruth- is "The Middle of Nowhere" an actual city name? Because that would be cool. You can't go wrong with Bones and Agatha Christie, so kudos to you.
Well darn it, I probably won't have "a chance to win a free book" because technically it's tomorrow. However, since I haven't been to bed yet it's still today for me. I work swing shift which is why I'm still up.
So, I'm one of the lurkers I guess that you're trying to out. My name is Karen and I live in Pleasant View, Utah. You and I are second cousins. My mom is Suzanne Miller.
I have not read a book for a long time, but I do listen to a lot of books on tape at work. I really enjoyed the "Work and the Glory" series. I haven't read (or listened to) a lot of the books you have mentioned on your blog. So I will be looking for those at my local library. As for favorite tv show, I really like "The Office".
I like Red Vines, and Chocolate Twizzlers. My Grandma Tuttle (your Auntie Ferd) always had Callard & Bowser black licorice toffee at her house. I wish I could find those again.
Sorry to say I also didn't know who Rafa was until I started reading your blog. I obviously need to pay more attention to tennis.
My thing that must go would be the gray halo around my face. I look so old when I pull my hair back.
I haven't slapped anyone across the face, but I do like to smack my hubbies bald head when I need to get some frustration out. Luckily he's a good sport and doesn't smack me back.
I just checked out the picture of Jacob's abs and that is very hot. He does need to pull those pants up a bit, becuase I have teenage girls that are going to see that. It's okay for me, but not for them.
Karen- welcome! It's never too late to enter the contest. Well, when Wednesday's blog goes up, then it will be too late. But you are definitely entered in the contest.
I remember Auntie Ferd's black licorice. It seems like every grandparent from that generation enjoyed their specialty black licorice, doesn't it?
Oh Spike! I went through such a Buffy phase; and Spike was definitely he vamp of my choice. I loved it when he was pinning.... where was I?
I'm happy you and Mike have learned to live with your fundamental differences as to tastes in licorice.
8. Have you ever slapped someone in the face? Yes I have. In 7th grade. He was making fun of me and I'd had enough.
I'm amazed, I am not a black licorice fan (I even dislike anise as a seasoning). My father LOVES black licorice as does my hubby. I've always wondered what the attraction is.
Una- I have discovered some people are very attached to their black licorice. I do admit a hankering for Good 'N Plenty now and then.
1. I go by 'J' online, but you know who I am Brodi since we were in the same neighborhood growing up :)
3. By All We Hold Dear (80's book my mother gave me that I will always love). TV Show: die hard 'Alias' fan and really loved Moonlight, even if it was only one season (a bit too vampire danger for primetime)
7. 17 1/2; was at a party at the neighbors across the street from my parents' house. Could see my mom in the kitchen window the entire time!
8. Slapped a kid in the 10th grade during Math class. He wouldn't stop poking my back so I turned around and (excuse my French) bitch slapped him. I was so shocked I had done it, and the kid just stood there, and the all the teacher said was 'you better sit down and leave her alone before she bitch slaps the other side!'. :)
9. I'm not a big fan of Jacob, nor his abs. I still fight his casting and get irritated thinking i have to watch him in the next movie.
10. I was always a true fan of Spike (something about that bleach blond hair) and then when I saw Mick St. John in 'Moonlight' I sort of had to switch my devotion. Plus, I think his fangs are better when they come out then Bill's on True Blood (Bill's are too thin and spikey). How's that for randomness. :)
9. I had to switch sides after seeing that picture. The book and movie are very separate for me so I can feel ok about switching camps.
10. I am reading a book called Shivers. Have you heard of it? I think you'd really like it! It's by Maggie Stiefvater (Scholastic)
Secret J- welcome. I've been waiting for you to comment. I agree- Mick St. John- it's like we hardly knew him.
Debbie- Yes- I've heard of Shiver. It's supposedly going to be huge. Do you like it? Where did you get a copy? You'll have to send me an email and let me know what you think!
8. Have you ever slapped someone in the face? no I've always wanted to, in one of those dramatic moments, but I've never had the opportunity good, don't
10. Free question- anything you want to share! I love your blog. (PG rated please. I'm talking to you, Cam.)
9. Have you seen Jacob's abs? I see them every night. I think they're awesome! What are ya'll doin' lookin' at my hubby's abs?!?!
All you ladies should be happy to hear that the picture in question is actually a fan-made manipulation - i.e., that is not Jacob's bod! His is even better, and the pants are definitely always at a more appropriate level; the actor is only 17 after all, and a very innocent & humble 17-year old at that.
Alissa- you're the only person brave enough to admit to liking Rafa as much as I do... and I would believe it!
Alysa- Of course, now I have to ask for a picture of "Jacob's abs..." And did you slap your sister as an adult, or as kids?
Kristen- thank you for the links. And thank you for reminding me of Taylor's age, although now I feel a bit creepy. :)
3. Favorite book or tv show? Well, one of my favorite books would have to be Echo, by Brodi Ashton ... you might be familiar with it. ;)
5. Do you love Rafa as much as I do? Rafa, as in the king of hotness? I don't know that it's possible to love him more than you.
8. Have you ever slapped someone in the face? Yes, and it didn't make me feel good. And that made me mad.
9. Have you seen Jacob's abs? If so, what do you think? Bree thinks he needs to pull up his pants. Yes, I've seen them. But really, isn't the question have you seen his lovely, long, totally natural looking hair?! Barf.
I've been thinking about that list of craziness you learned at the Writer's Retreat ... and a lot of those are me. How did I sneak in as least crazy? Maybe we're just all the same kind of crazy.
3. I almost never watch TV, the last show I really liked was Eli Stone. Glee looks pretty good from the first episode. There are so many books that I love - all time favorite is probably The Bronze Bow. I re-read it every few years, and To Kill a Mockingbird.
7. 13 I think. It was in the field behind my house and it was slobbery and gross. First good kiss was when I was 16.

Unfortunately old management still has a hold on many people. It's about control and the functions of planning, organizing, directing, controlling. Most people have had enough of this.
Modern leadership is about inspiring, influencing and impacting people. It's about helping people to change, never telling them or directing them to change. As Peter Senge says “People don't resist change. They resist being changed.”
"You can’t change the way people think, all you can do is give them a tool, the use of which will change their thinking."
It’s called the Global Impact Summit and it gets underway on the 10th of November and is LIVE online for 15 days.
All the Summit delivers is impact. And ONLY Impact. No selling of stuff. Just impact, pure and simple.

LinkedIn has added so many features recently that it's easy to get confused about how it works and what to do with it. But if you focus on the things it does best, you can get a lot of value from it.
LinkedIn is one of the oldest social networks. It's often not even mentioned when people talk about social media, but it is a social media platform.
It started life to help you get a new job. You would promote yourself as an employee to future employers and recruiters. You could also broaden your network by asking for referrals through people you know. It's still a powerful job/career network, but that's not important to us as business leaders and business owners. But some of the other things about LinkedIn's past are still relevant:
Use LinkedIn to post your "CV" or "resume", so people who do want to know more about you can find something. This is not a traditional CV you would write when seeking a job. Rather, it's a promotional profile piece that positions you as an expert and authority. It's more marketing-oriented than a traditional CV, but isn't full of hype.
Think about going to a business networking function. The people you hate there are those that are too self-promoting and just interested in taking without giving. The people you love are those who take an interest in you and genuinely look for ways to help you - even without an immediate benefit to them. They do win in the long term, though, because people like them and genuinely want to help them in turn.
LinkedIn is the same. Don't promote yourself too much. Instead, use it to connect with people, answer questions, solve problems, and in general be helpful rather than pushy. Position yourself as a trusted advisor, not a pushy salesperson.
If somebody does a good job for you, you naturally want to tell other people - especially friends and other people in your network. In the physical world, you might write a testimonial (which they use in their promotional material), or bring it up in conversation with your friend. But what if you don't know your friend is looking for that service? And what if the supplier hasn't promoted your testimonial well?
LinkedIn solves both these problems by letting you put testimonials (LinkedIn calls them "Recommendations") right there on the supplier's profile. It also encourages the supplier to reciprocate by writing a testimonial for you as well.
The world works on recommendations, referrals and introductions. If I introduce you to somebody I know, that person already trusts you (to some extent). In fact, wouldn't it be great if the only people we worked with were people who had been referred or introduced by somebody else?
LinkedIn works the same way in the online world. Use it to reach out to people you would like to reach, not just by contacting them out of the blue, but through somebody who knows you both. Because that person in the middle is trusted by you and the other person, the initial connection is far warmer than just a cold contact.
Finally, keep in mind that most of your LinkedIn connections are not your prospects. They are peers and colleagues who are connected to you for mutual gain. Think professional association, not marketplace.
That doesn't mean you won't get any business from LinkedIn. On the contrary, LinkedIn can be one of your best sources of businesses. But think of it as getting business through your connections, not from them. In other words, they are more likely to refer you than to buy from you. But that referral - to a key person in their network - might be worth much more to you than selling directly to the referrer.
Over the past 25 years I have had the honour and privilege to be a mentor to more than 1000 business leaders in over 40 countries. Without exception their journey has been one of doing what they know that they should do that they were not.
In this doing each person (at unique turning points for them) has discovered critical actions that they didn’t know that they must do. Herein lies the key to optimum performance.
My promise to you is that through working together you’ll do what you know you should and discover what you don’t know that you must do. Imagine that.
From now until the 1st February 2015 there’s a window of opportunity for you to join a Maverick Thinkers Farm for a very special fee.
As well as doing what you know you should, and discovering what you don’t know that you must do, you’ll increase the number of your employees bringing their best to their work.
A few years ago, when I switched from Outlook to Gmail, it took me about two days effort (spread out over a week or so) to get back to my old level of productivity.
When I recently switched from MYOB to Xero for my accounting software, again it took me about two days effort overall.
When I ran my "Build Your Web Site In Two Days" workshop, the participants built their Web site from scratch in (surprise!) two days.
Two days sounds like a lot of time, especially in today's busy world. How can you afford to find two days in your schedule to learn a new e-mail system, use a new accounting package, or build a Web site???
According to NASA, the Space Shuttle uses up most of its fuel in the first 8 minutes of its flight. After that, it escapes the Earth's atmosphere and sails along with very little effort.
You might have been putting off something because you know it takes some effort to get started. It's definitely not easy to make the time - especially when you think of all the other things you could do with that time (most of which you're not doing!). But weigh up the short-term pain with the long-term gain.
The two days I invested in Gmail and Xero have repaid me many times over - and usually within the first few weeks.
The good news is that if you do set aside the time, you can get a lot done. Two solid days of work is a long time! You don't have to lock yourself in a room for two days and do nothing else. It's OK to spread out that two days work over a week, and you'll still be amazed at what you can achieve.
The bad news is that if you don't make the time, you might never get around to doing it. And if it's a worthwhile goal, it will cost you a lot more than two days in the long term.
For day three, I decided to dig into my mostly-neglected set of images from the NASCAR Toyota/Save Mart 350, held at Sonoma Raceway back in June of this year. As far as conversions go, this time was all about controlling the viewer's visual attention — getting them to notice certain things, and to pay less or no attention to other things. Many of the the NASCAR teams feature incredibly bright, saturated colors which are designed to attract attention, and the grayscale conversion allowed me to work against that dynamic.
My treatment of this first image was mainly to diffuse the viewer's attention. In the original, the bright colors draw your attention to the crew member's uniform, and from there, to his face, to his hands, to the air hose on his gun, and to the fire extinguisher inside. As your eyes take in the image, it ends up being difficult for them to focus on other aspects of the scene — the tires and other pit-stop paraphernalia surrounding the main subject; the details of the mock hub mounted to the trailer; even the actual expression of concentration on his face that reinforces the dynamic pose of his body.
By contrast, the treatment of the second image was to make the distribution of viewer attention more focused. The bright colors everywhere cause the viewer's eye to bounce around the scene. Whereas in the monochrome version, all of the colors are relatively similar shades of gray, and the strong contrast of the brake components draws the viewer's eye into the wheel well.
This one didn't really work out; but not all experiments turn out how you hope they will. I wanted to focus attention on the different crew-member acts — hands poised to give the car a push start out of the pits; gas can chugging away; new windshield tearoff whipping in the wind; and something with the front-left wheel.
But it's all pretty muddled. The windshield tearoff pretty much disappears when I try to set the curves/contrast for the rest of the scene, and if I set things for the tearoff, the rest of the scene ends up with way too much contrast. The comromise that I'm publishing is really just the worst of both worlds. Oh well. Still more to learn :o)
There were a bunch of options here that all looked reasonable, but in the spirit of pushing outside of my comfort zone, I decided to focus on nuance and subtlety. One of the things I learned (which I already had some idea of) is that my main editing monitor has very poor grayscale rendition at very low luminance levels. The really low blacks tend to go away completely, and the levels that it does display tend to have color casts. By comparison, when I look at the same image on my second monitor, the color rendition is completely neutral.
Even so, I tried to use a light touch with the Tone Curve module to bring out a little bit of shadow detail on the near side of L's face. It's hard to tell if it worked or if it didn't — one one monitor, you can _barely_ see the slightest hint of her large, shiny earring. On my other monitor, I can see the faint hint of the outline of her ear and her haircut, and you can see that she's wearing a pair of earrings. That's about what I was going for, so I'm going to call that a tentative success.
I also used the Monochrome module in an attempt to massage her phone reflection into the other reflections in the bowl. It's still there, but it doesn't draw your attention the same way that it does in the original.
Finally, I tried a bunch of things to pull down the translucent highlight from the edge of her thumb on the bowl, but I didn't find anything that worked. The main challenge was that I _really_ like the stark contrast of her backlit hair, and the levels in the hair are pretty similar to the levels on her thumb. Clearly something I need to keep in mind while shooting.
Two friends tagged me for the Five Day B&W Challenge at about the same time. I'm going to participate, but it's going to be on my own rules.
The canonical rules for the Five Day B&W Challenge are that you post a B&W image every day for five days, and that with each post, you tag someone new to also participate. First and foremost, I have no idea what the original motivation for this challenge might have been, but I will use it as an opportunity for personal growth (see also, Ad Hoc Challenges and Personal Growth).
I will spend more time on each image than I typically do, and I will attempt images that I find difficult to deal with. Hopefully, I will learn new techniques to deal with some of the challenging images that I might otherwise pass over. At the same time, I will not necessarily post a images on consecutive days. If I haven't figured something out, I will invest the time to get as far as I can before posting the result.
Second, I will not tag or nominate anyone. It's not for me to decide who needs what kind of photographic growth. That said, I hope that this post inspires you to challenge yourself somehow. That challenge may be by working up images in B&W, or by working them up in color, or perhaps by not working them up at all — by aspiring to achieve a better image in the camera, and to do less of that work after the exposure has already been taken.
Finally, I will share the original image with each post, and I'll go through the retouching steps I used to produce the final image. So even if you don't choose to participate, hopefully you will still learn some of the same things that I'm learning.
Nearly all of my work is done in some combination of darktable and GIMP, and this series will be no exception. Also note that one of my personal ethical principles, given my coming-of-age in a journalistic environment, is that I don't make local adjustments. Everything I do applies to the entire frame. This means that I also don't dodge or burn, which processes many photojournalists consider to be okay.
First and foremost, when I noticed this moment, one of the things that drew me to it was the inherent symmetry of the chef sitting against the picnic table, with the creases in her jacket mirroring the gaps in the tabletop. I know that I'm no good at nailing the horizon, and I didn't want to miss the moment, so I specifically left some room around my desired composition so that I would be able to get the horizon perfect in post.
In darktable, I first tried converting to B&W with the Monochrome module, but I ended up switching the Color Correction module and just set Saturation to 0. At that point, I found that I had difficulty maintaining contrast _both_ between the chef's left arm and the bright background, as well as between their head/hat and the dark background there. That was the most challenging aspect of working this particular image.
The first half of the solution was to use Tone Curve to blow out the entire sunny area. I put a control point at the top, a little over halfway to the right. This forced all of the lightness values about 60% or so straight to 100%, and gave me some more room for contrast between the chef's jacket and the sunny area. Then I added a control point along the steep upslope (at about 30% input lightness) and tweaked it to adjust the contrast between the chef's head and the medium-brightness background. Et voila!
To finish, I pulled the image into GIMP, sharpened it with the Refocus plugin, added the watermark, and called it a day.
A blog from Bygdsiljum, Skellefteå in the north of Sweden. Opinionated and in English and the views are mine and mine alone.
China focuses on solar energy and apparently creating energy where it's going to be used is the future
Quick post, because when you dig into more than just wind power and try to look at energy production, you learn quite a bit more than you had planned.
First, you learn that when you take away the subsidies, wind power is pretty much last on the list of things that people want to invest in.
And it's not just because it costs to send and when you send you lose energy, it turns out that the future of energy production is something called 'distributed energy generation' which basically means build the source of the energy where it is going to be used.
There is a book called the Wind Farm Scam that basically suggests all the PR and noise coming out about how great wind energy is, is as the title suggests, a scam.
And when this book was first published all the wind energy companies and one country in particular, called the book a scam. It was one side saying the entire industry was a scam and the other side saying the book was a scam. But the book made some predictions.

Two of our cats are sisters. The tortoiseshell is Retsina, the marmalade one is Ouzo; they are named for traditional Greek drinks.
We took them into Volos to be neutered when they were little, confidently telling the vet that Retsina was a girl, and Ouzo a boy. He elected to operate on the girl first as the surgery is more involved. When he came to Ouzo, he called us: “You said this cat is male. Well, Ouzo is a girl, and should be called Ouzaki.” We were stunned.
I know that tortoiseshell cats are almost exclusively female, and that a male tortie is so rare as to be considered a freak, but I also believed that an all-ginger cat (no white at all) is exclusively male. Well, all-ginger females do occur. I must say, in a lifetime of being owned by cats, Ouzo is my first ever female ginger.
By the way, Retsina is a feminine noun, Ouzo a masculine, so yes, Ouzo should be Ouzaki, but her name has stuck and Ouzo she is. The vet still teases us about our knowledge of feline anatomy!
Both cats are highly nervous, highly strung, very timid, which I attribute to their early days as kittens born to a semi-feral cat. In fact, many of our friends have never even seen them as they tend to hide away during the day. It gets quite hectic around here a great deal of the time as both are frightened of the other cats, and it’s often a case of “Shut the bedroom door! Ouzo’s on the bed!” or “Don’t let Raki into my study! Retsina’s in my chair!”
Sometimes they disappear all day, particularly in the summer, and only creep in through the cat flap at night to sleep inside, where they evidently feel safe. There are plenty of foxes about, feral cats, feral dogs, and even European Wildcats which can present a threat to them. But mostly they are intimidated by Raki. That little demon, much adored as he is, torments the poor girls at every opportunity, and their lives have never been the same since he arrived.
Ouzo left the house early on Wednesday night – unusual that she didn’t sleep inside – and no sign of her all day yesterday. I called and called through the early evening, with the wind roaring and the waves crashing. Nothing. She did not put in an appearance. Not a trace of her this morning. She hadn’t come in during the night, and heavy rain had set in. I was extremely uneasy, to say the least. I’ve mentioned that few people remain in the village now, and that many houses are boarded up for the winter.
A ghastly thought began to run through my head. Surely not? I couldn’t put the notion that she was somehow locked in somewhere out of my mind, so I set off in the pelting rain, calling. I walked and called. Called and walked. Suddenly, a faint sound. Could it be? Was it a cat’s cry? I called again. A louder cry seemed to answer me. I stumbled on, confident that I was hearing Ouzo. Yes! Her crying was coming from a storage basement in a closed up holiday property nearby. I couldn’t see her at all, but she was clearly down there, and the owners are down in Athens.
So I did the only thing I could and activated the bush telegraph, which has been greatly improved since the advent of the mobile phone. I called Costa, our marvelous Albanian who is the general factotum of most of the village. He called Elias, our equally wonderful Albanian stonemason, who called I know-not-who, who located Niko, the caretaker, who has a key. He lives on the other side of the Pelion Peninsula, quite a long way to come on his old motorbike and in the rain. Bless the man, he said he’d come.
Meanwhile, my husband walked over to see what he could do. Ouzo beat him back to the house! We found out later that Niko had been at the property on Tuesday, securing it for the winter, and hadn’t noticed that the door to the little-used storeroom wasn’t properly locked. Ouzo must have sneaked inside and the wind blew the door shut. Hence her absence.
Ouzo’s asleep now in my study, well fed and warm, but Niko would not have been back for months. I think I need a drop of ouzo ….

Name: Ojai Chautauqua Panel - Beyond the Whistle-Blowers: What comes next? Power, Gender, and Writing New Rules for the American Workplace
In 2017, a group of courageous women and men stepped forward to talk about their experiences as victims of sexual harassment and assault.

At the age of ten, Ana Cubas moved from civil war torn El Salvador to join her mother in Los Angeles. Her mother cleaned houses and office buildings and her father was a day laborer. After school, Ana and her sister would go to the library to study until her mother finished working. She credits her hours in the library to helping her get accepted at University of California, Berkeley. She was the first member of her family to attend college and she went on to receive Master’s degrees from Princeton and USC. Ana began her public policy career working for the U.S. Department of Education in Washington, D.C., and then for the California Legislative Analyst’s Office in Sacramento. For twenty years, she has focused on public outreach and urban planning solutions in low-income communities. In 2013, Ana ran for Los Angeles City Council on a positive platform of empowering low income communities. She raised $550,000 in campaign contributions -- a record for female candidates in the City of LA. Although Ana advanced to the run off election, she lost to her opponent, a state senator whose campaign funds exceeded $2 million, by less than 600 votes. Had she been elected, Ana would have joined the fifteen member Los Angeles City Council as its second female representative. Undeterred, Ana has founded two initiatives from the lessons she learned during her campaign: the South Los Angeles Political Action Committee that registers voters and the Latina Public Service Academy, a leadership program, which trains high school girls on running for elected office.

If we can develop this essential ability, we can begin to affect a positive change to many aspects of life that can extend far and wide.

In the latest world today, rates of violence are increasing at a very high rate. Many people are therefore seeking for training so that they can save their lives through other means. The martial sessions have been set aside to help people to be able to protect themselves against external violence. You will be able to have a session that is great when you have the training in the right manner and avoid staying idle. Find out the importance of enrolling in the local Martial Arts Classes. When a parent orders his/her kid, and the kid disobeys, it becomes very hard to control them as they are indiscipline. You will raise that when such a kid is taken to the training sessions, he/she will start gaining discipline as the first rule in the sessions is ensuring that a person is disciplined all the time.
If you are poor in socializing with friends and other people, it is the high time that you join the sessions, and you will realize that it will be boosted. People especially who find it hard to talk in front of people are now able to do so. Therefore, with these training parents together with their kids learn the right way to mingle with others. You need to know that you are at the right place to gain knowledge, the martial arts sessions have brought lots of changes to many people. For this reason, you need to embrace participating in these sessions since they are of so many benefits.
Confidence plays a great role in the society and from the time your kids are young, they need to learn this in the right manner. The self-confidence that you gain along the way has ensured that you as a person has skills to be responsible for the family and various ways that offer training sessions are offered in the right manner. That is why as a responsible parent, you should make your child to these sessions for their self-esteem to get boosted. In another way, your kids can do things knowing that they are not failures and therefore enhance their confidence this will make them strong and will self-guard their families.
Many kids in this world can get good morals when they engage in these activities. The kids will be able to know who elders are and what they need to know about them in the right ways. They are taught what it means to be an adult and differentiate with the childhood behaviors.

I remember my first Easter egg hunt. I was three years old, and along with about 30 other tots, had a grand time scouring the woods for the hundreds of brightly colored eggs lying hidden amongst the trees.
It was my first real competition, and if I recall correctly, I came home with eight eggs. I was much better at finding them than at actually keeping them in my little basket. Every time I’d bend down to pick up a new egg, I’d spill the others in the pine straw. My mom, bless her heart, kept running along behind me to make sure I scooped up all my fallen prizes.
Of course, back then Easter was mostly about the eggs, the chocolate, and the Easter dress (always pink), which either came from Sears or Pizitz at the tail-end of a day-long shopping adventure. I always knew there was more to the holiday, but as a little girl, that was what really jumped out. That, and the Easter Bunny.
Today, I reflect on a more meaningful Easter. Life can be tougher for an adult than it is for a child, and I think a lot more about the burdens many friends, relatives, and I, share.
The Gospels tell us Jesus made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem riding up the Jericho road on the back of an untainted beast of burden. He arrived as humble royalty, welcomed by the sound of adoration from many of his followers. Then He met with persecution, sentencing, and crucifixion, taking on a much greater burden as the weight of this world, our weight, came crashing down upon Him.
I realize all the more as time goes by how heavy this must have been. It leads me to thankfulness, worship, and repentance, that the untainted Son of Man would take this on for me… and for you.
Today I know how sweet this holiday is for celebrating His resurrection, how He completes me and restores my relationship with Creator God. I am relieved of, and forgiven the weight of my sin, a child of God with a reason to celebrate, and to love.
I hope you have a joyful Easter, free from burden. We worship a Risen King, who makes all things new for us when we believe and confess Him as our Savior.
This Easter, may you experience new life, and joy like the child I was, chasing after eggs with my mom.
“Because Jesus was raised from the dead, we've been given a brand-new life and have everything to live for, including a future in heaven…” – I Peter 1:3

Is there anyone out there who uses/used or knows someone who used/uses cloth diapers. The new cloth diapers of today? Not the ones my mom used with the pins.
I have always thought that redusing, reusing, and recycling waist is the best way for our lives. It might have started out with my packrat tendencies, but it has evolved since I have been living in Germany. The Germans are ahead of the States in their recycling programs. They have much smaller trash cans here and in place of the large trash bin is a large recycling bin. Depending on where you live you might have to separate plastic from paper. They also have a Bio bin where you place biodegradable products like food waste and yard waste. ITS GREAT!
So of course when I got pregnant I started to think about all the diapers the new baby would use in its short little diaper life. Turns out its hundreds. I think an average of 500 diapers per child till they are fully potty trained. GROSS! Eww.. Diapers take more then the life of the child (*hundreds of years) to breakdown. SO they are just sitting there rotting and taking up space in the overfilled landfills. I know recycling seems hard for lots of people but to me its so easy here. You already have the right bins! YOU DONT HAVE TO DO ANYTHING! Glass is another story.. but still. I can't throw it in the trash either.
I have been researching and reading about all the different ones out there. These ones to the left are Kushies brand. They seem to have good reviews. These are an All in One Diaper. Meaning you shouldn't need a cover and a cloth diaper. They have some that are meant to have the cover over top of the coth to prevent wettness from leaking through. This brand also has a cloth diaper that needs a cover too. They also have this VERY cool disposible insert that goes in the diaper and is easily removed when the baby has a dirty diaper. You just pull it up and put it in the toilet and Viola! Mess is gone. They also have washable inserts to soak up more. There are a few other brands out there like these all in ones.
Since they dont have the expandable beads that are found in throw away diapers I am pretty sure they are not going to keep the baby as dry, however its been stated that this also leads to the baby potty training sooner. You have to be on top of changing diapers too and of course it does create some more laundry to do. The cost overtime is less even with the water and detergent cost. So reasons for wanting to use them also come from the cheapo in me too. It is a larger cost upfront but I feel like its better for my baby and the world in the end.
There is another type called GDiapers that has a disposable lining that is more diaper like in its appearance. They have the disposable insert that you place in the diaper before you put it in the child then when you are done you rip it in strips and flush down the toilette. Then you are just left with the shell to wash when it needs it.
Then there are these diapers that don't sit for years and years before they break down. These diapers break down in much less time. I read on a website a woman who even put them in her own backyard! The outer plastic-like layer is made of a compostable/biodegradable corn Bio film. The corn Bio film is composed of cornstarch and biodegradable polyester. The corn used in the diaper is 100% non-genetically modified. The inner tissue is composed of natural tree pulp. It is also Totally Chlorine Free (TCF). Not all Chlorine Free Diapers are biodegradable though, so do your research if you want that. This diaper seems like a good option for people who don't have a washer and dryer in home or like the convenience of the disposable diaper. I have read that many of the cloth diapers don't fit newborns, so I am going to try these out for my infant.
thanks for making me feel bad for using disposable diapers....the average number HAS to be higher though b/c i buy the jumbo packs (which are over 100) and I KNOW i've already bought at least 5 of those...and my baby isn't even 1!! :-\ stupid wasteful Americans! :) ha!! let me know which you decide to use! I might be up for on the next go round!
I'm going to do this too once we have a baby. My friend Elyse uses them and LOVES them. You can also find ones that are gently used...so keep looking. Another reason I don't want to use disposable is because of the harsh chemicals that are released once they get wet. And seriously if you are planning on more than one kiddo you can reuse them...talk about savings! Great post. :)
Raschel! You can start now, I read about tons of moms who started later with their baby. Actually it might be easier to start later since they start to have less diaper changes. lol. You shouldn't feel bad. There are tons of reasons moms start using cloth and why they don't. The trash factor and fact I can to reuse them are big for me.
Micki which ones does your friend use? Do you know? The chemicals are a good point too. I think there are so many things I don't want my baby to play with.... like Plastic toys. hhaha.. I know I sound crazy and I am sure he will have some, but it still freaks me out.
Elyse got hers from diaperswappers.com and she said you could also check clothdiaperclearance.com. I don't know if you sew but I've found a template if you want to make them too: http://www.chloetoesboutique.com/store/WsDefault.asp?Cat=ChloeToesDiaperPattern

"As Gerald Lang has wisely observed, the computer is not a tool but it is a simulator of tools. One of the things it simulates is a typesetting machine. With the spread of the personal computer, millions of people have found themselves transformed into simulations of typesetters, whether or not they wished to be so." 1
Once "desktop publishing" was mainstreamed there was quantum shift in the role of the graphic designer. Many design support services closed or converted to the digital technology. Graphic designers were forced to take on the roles of typesetting and pre-press production, formerly not their responsibility. The graphic designer's hand skills were surpassed by the need for digital expertise.
Designers were now required to spend thousands of dollars on constantly updating hardware and software. They must continually upgrade their skills --now at the mercy of the industries they helped promote.
“Traditionally production used to be a barrier for designers, but now the computer, a tool for both design and production, has become the gateway.”
As Johanna Drucker has pointed out "The tools of the designer were confused with the skills of the designer...The accessibility of production tools undercut the design profession since "anyone" could make a flier or a brochure." Ellen Lupon during her Visionary Woman Award discussion at Moore College of Art and Design, Philadelphia, 2012.

“DINR solves problems for both diners looking for reservations as well as restaurants looking to fill seats that are empty because of cancellations and no shows,” explains Kyle Nares, co-founder, DINR and also a successful Montreal restaurateur (he co-owns Garde Manger and Le Bremner in Montreal). “I like to describe it as a virtual waiting list.”
DINR launched in Montreal in late 2014 and in Toronto earlier this year; Kyle says the app has already been downloaded (from the iOS App Store, Google Play for Android or online at GetDINR.com) more than 30,000 times and has seated over 14,000 same-day diners. Partner restaurants currently on board in the nation’s capital include Beckta Dining & Wine Bar, MēNa, Supply and Demand, North & Navy, SOIF Bar à Vin de Veronique Rivest, Fauna and Bar Laurel. Kyle expects more to follow soon, though he cautions it’s not about the volume of restaurants; it’s more about finding chef-driven, high-demand, top-quality restaurant partners who also understand the importance of updating the system as their availability inventory changes throughout the day.
The app is easy to navigate – search the curated list for current availabilities at nearby restaurants for that day and you can make a reservation in just four taps. If a restaurant has no availabilities, select ‘Notify Me’ and DINR will send a notification the minute a table opens up. Reservations are free but require a credit card to secure the seats. Diners who fail to show up are subject to a $30.00 no-show charge. The app sends a notification 90 minutes before your reservation time and there is no penalty to cancel up to an hour before your time slot.
Jennifer Wall, co-owner of Supply and Demand, says that their restaurant was delighted to be invited to participate in DINR Ottawa. “We are very old school and chose not to have an online reservation system because we like the personal interaction with our customers. But having met Kyle and his partners at Le Bremner, we knew if anyone could build a system that works, it’s them,” she says. “A few weeks ago we had 19 no shows or last minute cancellations on a weekend night and we immediately thought of all the people we had said no to earlier in the week who wanted a reservation that night. It’s bad for our image and our bottom line if we end up with empty tables; DINR means that if we do end up having tables, they can easily be booked. We encourage people to give the app a try so it will gain some traction in Ottawa.”
This is a fundraising for 79-year-old Gary Kellam (a life long teacher & mentor to many) who protected his colleagues and students against a lawsuit, that according to the judge was “devoid of merit” and was about “causing trouble” for Gary.
After 6 stressful years, Gary overwhelming won his legal case. But he is now burdened with a crushing legal debt exceeding $50,000. Kenda Summers, a former student of Gary’s, upon hearing of Gary’s plight, offered to do a Hypnosis Stage Show for free, to help raise funds for Gary.

Her work has been exhibited in major international exhibitions such as Documenta VIII, Kassel; the 41st Venice Biennale; and the 4th Biennale of Sydney. Liz Magor received the Governor General’s Award in 2001, the Audain Prize in 2009, and the Gershon Iskowitz Prize in 2014. In 2017/18 she was a guest of the DAAD Kunstler in Berlin Program. More recently she has had solo exhibitions at Le Credac, Ivry-sur Seine, France; Peephole, Milan, Italy; the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; The Henry Art Gallery, Seattle; and the Vancouver Art Gallery. In 2016 the Musee d’Art Contemporain de Montreal mounted a 40 year retrospective which travelled through 2017; first to the Migros fur Gegenwartskunst , Zurich; then on to the Kunstverein in Hamburg; and the MAMAC in Nice. The exhibition was accompanied by a publication from JRP/ Ringier, Zurich. In 2019, Magor will open an exhibition of new work at Carpenter Center for Visual Art, Cambridge, Mass. The exhibition will travel to the Renaissance Society in Chicago accompanied by a publication.
Jennifer Macklem, Associate Professor of Sculpture, They were still there the last time, Exhibition at Galerie Eric Devlin, Montréal
Creatures in their shrinking, drying moistness - they are signaling their calling, vocalizing utterances for human ears to receive.
Absence - potential, inferred, actual - can be a hollowing out. Not only are they absent from the green or white or wet spaces of their surrounds, they are gone from inside of us, in that hole inside the chest. Those spaces – shot through with glimmering light, reflections doubling over into darkness – what remains? They were, not long ago, thriving and alert. It's not just memory and the way it fades, it is the sore and raw hollowing out of loss.
Back in the urban world, too much alcohol, materialism and tech-addled attention deficits fray the spirit, layering it with resentment. It treads a weary stomp-circle of blame. We think we are smart and know what is going on. The silver snout of that furry mammal sending electrical impulses to her brain, while her eyes flash and the body vanishes. Translucent wings at the threshold of disappearance, from a multitude to a few to none.
Viewers, the mechanisms of display, reception, discursive dissemination, the production of knowledge, the striations of networking, exclusion: the art world. My human eyes glaze over at the total colonization of wildness via these knowledge systems; a maze of human intrigue, mirrors on all sides.
ARTIST TALK: The Department of Visual Arts at the University of Ottawa is pleased to present PATRICIA REED
This artist talk will look at the relationship between theory and practice, writing and making as distinct, but mutually contaminating activities. Particular attention will be put on concepts and works concerning post-Westphalianism, an idea that addresses the transformation of human organizing structures in a moment of heightened planetary complexity and interdependency.
Patricia Reed is an artist, writer and designer based in Berlin. As an artist, selected exhibitions include: The One and The Many, CUAG, Ottawa; The Museum of Capitalism, Oakland;Homeworks 7, Beirut; Witte de With, Rotterdam; HKW, Berlin; and Württembergischer Kunstverein, Stuttgart. Recent writings have been published in Para-Platforms (Sternberg, forthcoming); Post-Meme (Punctum Books, forthcoming); e-flux Architecture; Xeno-Architecture (Sternberg Press, forthcoming); _AH Journal; Cold War Cold World (Urbanomic); andDistributed (Open Editions). With Victoria Ivanova, she co-curated the 1948 Unbound: Tokens session with the House of World Cultures team, Berlin (2017), and was a theory researcher for Public Art Munich 2018. Reed is also part of the Laboria Cuboniks (techno-material feminist) working group who published the Xenofeminist Manifesto (2015), reissued by Verso books in autumn 2018.

John Ancheta’s thesis exhibition .WAV, explores media spectacles of nuclear proliferation in a burgeoning post-factual America. Ancheta’s multi-channel video installation is a dystopic, near-future vision that foregrounds the optics that are currently being used to normalize fear, polarization, and military force.
MFA Thesis exhibition: Pierre Richardson, What's Big and Small at the Same Time?, Karsh-Masson Gallery
A large scale evolutionary improvisational installation that explores narrative, trauma, and mental health. Using various media to create an overwhelming space, where the viewer can explore and find linkages between the juxtaposition of gallows humour, photography, paintings, doodles, and video.

En effet, les installations de Bell et Taite émanent de décisions communes : elles interfèrent, elles s’imbriquent par des interventions d’additions et de soustractions de matière comme de peinture.

Mirage 2000 is the famous Mirage III’s successor. Using Dassault’s traditional tailless delta wing, Mirage 2000 first flight occurred on March the 10th 1978. It has been since declined into several specialized versions:
-Mirage 2000B (B stands for Biplace= two-seats) is a two-seats fighter used for both interception and training missions. Its first flight took place on October the 11th 1980, and it was delivered to French Air Force from summer 1983.
-Mirage 2000C (C stands for Chasse= fighter) is a single-seat fighter used for interception missions and air police. Its first flight took place on March the 10th 1978, and it was delivered to French Air Force from summer 1983.
-Mirage 2000N (N stands for Nucléaire = nuclear strike) is a two-seats strike fighter used for both nuclear strikes (with the ASMP medium range tactical missile) and classical ground strikes. Its first flight took place on February the 3rd 1983, and it was delivered to French Air Force from April the 1st 1988.
-Mirage 2000D is an extrapolation from the 2000N. It’s a two-seats strike fighter able to use last standard arms in French inventory, including under development Apache / SCALP and AASM. It’s also able to deliver the ASMP nuclear missile. Mirage 2000D is first French aircraft able to lead night/ all weather missions, a need expressed by French Air Force’s staff after the Gulf war. Its first flight took place on February the 19th 1991, and it was delivered to French Air Force from April the 9th 1993.
- Mirage 2000-5F is the last of the Mirage 2000’s series. It’s dedicated to air interception, and was intended as gap-filler between the Mirage 2000B/C and the Rafale. It’s a greatly improved version of the Mirage 2000C, with the ability to engaging several targets at once. It also carries the new missile MICA. Its first flight took place on October the 24th 1990, and it was delivered to French Air Force from April 1999.

Three Antiphons for trumpet and organ are adaptations of Latin motets for unaccompanied choir, commissioned originally by Janet and Douglas Mackay for the Canterbury Chamber Choir and first performed in Faversham, Kent, in April 2004. Regina Caeli, as a motet, was nominated for the Liturgical section in the British Composer Awards, December, 2005 and was performed by the BBC Singers. The re-scoring for this combination was made for Paul Archibald and Leslie Pearson and first performed at the Yoxford Festival in 2004.
..."The three texts I chose for the choral motets address the Virgin Mary. The first movement, Ave Regina, is a gentle and lyrical response to the 'Queen of the heavens . . . from whom the light came into the world.' The Ave Maria, originally written for upper voices, is more intimate in expression with a plainchant like muted opening. In contrast, the final movement, Regina Caeli, is robust and exultant. Each chordal passage (an Alleluia in the motet) punctuates the linear writing of the 'verses' which make use of the plainchant footprints of the Regina Caeli itself. Three Antiphons have also been arranged for trumpet ensemble and organ and have been recorded in this version by the International Celebrity Trumpet Ensemble for the Brass Classics label. The motets are published by OUP."

Owing this recipe to my site visitor, Babette, she asked me if I have Java fried rice last Thursday. So, this dish was cooked specially for her. Of course, we were the ones who got to eat the rice (chuckling).
The Java-style fried rice is spicy flavour. I added curry powder, but it was not where the spiciness comes from. It was the sambal belacan (aka shrimp paste chili) that contributed to the spiciness. You may vary the amount of sambal belacan, to your preference. Both curry powder and sambal belanca made this fried rice an extra flavoursome one!
Javanese fried rice has to go with prawn crackers (translation in Malay: keropok), as their traditional way of eating fried rice. A traditional Java fried rice also includes ingredients of chicken, shrimps, cabbages and bean sprouts. I added squids to make it a seafood version.
1) Heat up wok with oil with high fire. Add garlic and shallot, fry for 30 seconds, or until fragrant.
6) When egg is half cooked, mix well with rice. Toss till well-combined. Heat off, and serve with prawn crackers.
OMG that looks delicious! thanks so much Patricia. It’s breakfast time here and I’d eat that right now if it was served before me. LOL Thanks for the pic of the Sambal Belacan, now I have 2 things on my list (the other one is shrimp paste for the fried chicken wings from another food blog – I think that’s where I saw your link.) How do you say ‘thank you’ in your language?
I see that you live in Singapore, I’ve always wanted to visit your country. I’ve read and heard a lot of nice things about it. Thanks again. :)
Yes, pls visit other interesting sites, too. I have a special pork recipe, too. Share with you next time!
Singapore is rather small but developed country. Nice to spend a few days visit here though. We welcome you. Let me know if you really make your trip here! Maybe we should have a bloggers gathering!
That fried rice looks good! I like the shrimp in it. I am going to have to look for some sambal belacan.

The Inquistadores are a sizeable space faction that concentrates its power on their massive mother planet of Dios and the surrounding systems as well as holds some colonies on desolate parts of the Brikverse that are valuable to its economy. They worship their mother planet and regard it as a god. All of the men are raised into the army, administrative functions are handled by women or those men that are too old or incapable to fight. Slaves, captured on the frequent raids Inquistadores hold across the Brikverse, are responsible for the manual labour. Inquistadores are a highly hostile faction that hardly have any friendly contact with other space nations and are at odds with many of them. Peaches, Brittanians, followers of other religions, atheists and any kind of aliens are amongst their prime targets. Since they only sporadically try to increase their territory, when they have amassed enough slaves to colonize it, they have been managing to keep this up and avoided huge conflicts. Inquistadores are infamous for their outright brutal way of approaching warfare.
Cyborg shock troopers are genocidal maniacs taken from the lowest classes of society and from the criminals. Their minds and bodies are literally programmed to kill and obey, and they also have enhanced aggression. In short, they are more like beasts than men, and used on the frontlines with heavy armour and OTCs to break up enemy formations as well as pulse guns that may either be set to laser rounds or pulse drives to knock over and momentarily stun enemies so they can execute their bloody business...
Regular shock troopers, who form the second wave of an assault, are actually worse than the programmed Cyborgs since they are still able to think consciously about their position in the army. Since all those that can't be of use as slaves are to be killed in an assault, these men and their chainsaws have been responsible for some of the worst genocides seen across the Brikverse.
Space conquistadores are usually the final wave of an assault to arrive, when the expendable shock troops have already taken the brunt of the punishment. These are armed with machine guns and armoured in anti-blaster plate and mail. Their unit also carries the main banner. Note the flag guard with the Brittanian-style heavy laser.
More space conquistadores, this time armed with miniguns. They are heavy troops that can confidently force a breakthrough or hold a position against most opposition.
"Hail. I speak in the name of the Immortal Empire, of which my own empire of the VoL is a part. The Inquistadores are to aid the mighty Immortal Empire as they conquer the Brikverse. Stand against them, and you will be destroyed. Think well, we will only offer you once."
"You can spare me your threats, barbarian. Inform your leader the Inquistadores are willing to fight at the Immortal's side in the coming conflict."
It was a logical choice for the Inquistadores, since they suspected it would mostly allow them to continue doing what they were doing and most of all it should keep the conflict away from their planet of which they are so fond. Even though it would force them to side with some 'less than desirable' allies self preservation outweighs principles with these people and they were certain they would be able to gain the Emperor's favour rather than any of their inferior newfound 'allies'...
Communiqué from: High Lord Warhead wrote: This is indeed most excellent news. I am sure the Emperor will be proud to fight alongside such fine troops as these. An exchange of Emissaries; perhaps a son or daughter, and teams of military advisers is in order so that we both may learn each others ways, all in the interests of integrating both of our great nations in the coming war.
Also, we have found ourselves to be the new owners of a few hundred million freshly subjugated and dispossessed slaves. As you can appreciate this is a drain on manpower at this time. Being new to the Brikverse and as yet unfamiliar with the established Galactic Order of things we are seeking those interested in brokering the sale of such spoils for us. Perhaps further discussion regarding this topic will be of benefit to all concerned.
Im making a small faction called the BrikQuisition to go along with a story I am preparing, they awfully look like the Inquistadores, maybe Ill then send you some pics so we can arrange some kind of link, whadda ya think Brag?

Sure, our administrative department is already at it. You'll find them to be very efficient handling cases such as these. A space vessel has been sent to Immortal territory, amongst them:
His title may not mean a lot anymore but it is his fighting prowess and patriotic mindset that gained him his reputation.
Token to the patriotic ideal is the Inquistadore banner he insists on carrying around. It is a treacherous thing, however, for it actually has a built-in laser he might use in a pinch. However Vinambre loves to settle things up and close above all, and, possessing perfected physical skills as well as a set of heavy power armour little things halt his charge. Armed with a double lightsabre and nova sword, his defence has driven oppenents insane.
Size comparison: Vinambre stands a good deal taller than average minifigs. He was picked not only because of his prestige and how it should keep the immortals happy, or his adequate diplomatic abilities, but mostly because he should be able to hold his ground amongst the maniacs and likely some of the Immortals, as well. Vinambre sees his mission as a 'holy quest to carry out the will and name of our great planet and ensure its prosperity.'
@ BF: Excellent, I was thinking to make them have some loose ties with others (slave traders, space pirates and the like) that are like-minded but didn't have plans for the faction, just make sure they're not anything they would kill and your guys could fill up the gap
Having just purchased some of these Spanish hats I now have all these parts but they are at present already in use and of a low number, just less than a ten man squad. However, I will be happy to include what I do have in later Immortal ventures. Sorry Brag.
Wha? I didn't even know you were copying these guys, tbh. That makes you and Natalya, cool. Turns out they have more potential than I first hoped
Inquistadores! What a great bunch of well constructed and seriously nasty chaps. The Immortals and these chaps are almost made for each other.
I was tired of switching parts around, so I made the Falx and the Inquistadores separate forses. I don't think Sci-fi armies need so many figs anyway.
There's been a little civil war in Dios, and an unexpected faction seems to be emerging as the new leading faction: the Valente family. Through cunning plans and skilled soldiers they have managed to defy all odds.
Valente and his son with commander Tzan to the left (I decided to name him so because the fig happened to have the same face as Tzan's avatar) and the heavy troopers, all armed with miniguns.

A spacecraft propelled by a deuterium-tritium (D-T) nuclear pulse propulsion system can enable fast manned interplanetary spaceflight. The concept involves igniting tiny D-T thermonuclear targets to create a continuous series of thermonuclear micro-explosions. In D-T fusion reactions, the production of energetic neutrons carries away 80 percent of the reaction energy. However, the prodigious amount of energetic neutrons means that large radiators are required to dissipate the heat generated from the absorption of neutrons by the spacecraft body. One way around that is to employ deuterium-helium 3 (D-He3) fusion reactions instead since D-He3 reactions do not produce neutrons. Nevertheless, helium 3 is a rare isotope and can only be obtained in sufficient quantities from the atmospheres of the giant planets in the outer solar system.
For space travel within the inner solar system, a means of nuclear pulse propulsion without requiring helium 3 is much desired. However, an advantage of inner solar system spaceflight is that very high speeds are not required. As a result, a modified form of D-T nuclear pulse propulsion can be used by igniting each D-T thermonuclear target within a sphere of neutron-absorbing liquid hydrogen. Although the propellant exhaust velocity will be much lower compared to a pure fusion reaction, it is already sufficient for rapid travel within the inner solar system. Equally important, this method also avoids the need for large radiators because the liquid hydrogen absorbs most of the neutrons.
To drive the nuclear pulse propulsion system, a continuous series of thermonuclear micro-explosions are required. Before a thermonuclear micro-explosion occurs, the fuel assemblage consists of a tiny D-T thermonuclear target in the middle of a spherical volume of liquid hydrogen with a radius of say 20 cm. The mass of the D-T thermonuclear target is negligible compared to the mass of hydrogen surrounding it. An energetic beam of ions is fired at the D-T thermonuclear target which ignites the D-T fusion process. The surrounding hydrogen absorbs the neutrons produced by the fusion process and gets intensely heated into fully ionized plasma with a temperature of ~100,000 K. At that temperature, the volume of ionized hydrogen contains approximately as much energy as in one ton of TNT.
The plasma is then confined by a magnetic nozzle and released as exhaust with a velocity of ~30 km/s. Such an exhaust velocity allows the spacecraft to attain the speeds required for rapid travel within the inner solar system. The energy output can be further increased by surrounding the liquid hydrogen sphere with a shell of neutron-absorbing boron. When boron absorbs neutrons, highly energetic α-particles are produced which increases the overall energy output. With an exhaust velocity of ~30 km/s, a spacecraft with 90 percent of its mass in the form of hydrogen fuel can accelerate to a final velocity of ~70 km/s. At that speed, a spacecraft takes about a week or so to travel from Earth to Mars. In comparison, conventional chemical rockets take several months to get to Mars.

This past weekend, my family came down to visit! Shara had a scrapbook overnighter up in ogden area so my mom and I kept her kids at my house while she went. We had a blast! This picture is of the morning after Shara left, the two babies were getting a little fussy so my mom got both of them and put them on the couch together. They loved it! It was adorable!
Today I took Talan to the park because it was a nice day and I wanted to get out of the house for a bit. I called my friend Candace and asked if she would like to meet us there. We had so much fun! We walked on the path around the park for a while, then I wanted to see how Talan would like the grass. He LOVED it! I thought he might freak out and hate it, but no, he liked the feel of it. He sat on it and just kicked his legs in excitement. Hilarious!
Trevor and I met in March of 2004, I was still in high school and he was working in Idaho Falls. His cousin set us up on a blind date and we dated ever since. We were married April 1, 2005 (yep, april fool's day) and have lived in Pleasant Grove, Ut ever since. Talan joined the family Dec. 5, 2008 and has been such a blessing!

So it turns out that good-looking furniture pleases me greatly. I already knew this but throw in some Danish ingenuity and I'm left wishing I wasn't living in a one bedroom flat and that I could in fact, furnish a whole house with these wondrous objects.
Promoting quality and longevity, the family-run business Danish Collectables describes itself as offering low prices in order to be able to change stock regularly.
I'm a big fan of Mid-Century Modern design in general and have known about Danish Collectables for a while. When I visited on Saturday I saw objects that tugged at the heart strings and reinforced the ideals I'm sure many of us have of being able to clear out the clutter, ditch the cheap and cheerful and only owning meaningful things that we truly cherish.
I talked with collector Flemming Moberg about how furniture nowadays is not commonly produced to be so long-lasting. Not only are the items in the showrooms aesthetically pleasing but they're made to such high quality that originally, they would have been a wise investment. Sure, plenty of contemporary reproductions are available elsewhere and possibly at (slightly) lower prices, but contending with the standards one can expect of mid-century design is difficult and I always prefer the original. Fellow vintage enthusiasts will understand that there's something so exciting about discovering and owning a piece of the past. These objects represent the passing of time, days that no longer exist and what makes the items at Danish Collectables so special is how well preserved they are. They have been sourced perfectly, they have been loved.
You can view the current collection on Danish Collectables' eBay store or you can visit their showrooms in Margate Old Town. They're currently displaying stock in one of Margate's top galleries, the Pie Factory (until March 5th) and more permanently in the Crown Gallery (both on Broad Street).

On the one hand, Jessica Bell presents, on the floor, an enormous quilt made entirely by hand. Laborious and careful at the same time, it consists of 40 patchworks of muslin fabric meticulously dyed and painted, one by one, at the artist's home. Using a traditional quilt design — Drunkard’s Path — and through means of repetition, Bell constructs, deconstructs and reconstructs her painting gestures into a plethora of pictorial surfaces that behave like sculpture. The distinct forms of each piece converge into abstract patterns subjected to manipulation and transformation and are only temporarily assembled for the moment of the exhibition. In anticipation of possible iterations, the quilt remains formally and physically tangible: manageable, flexible and moreover fragile.
On the other hand, Robert Taite proposes a series of modular combinations that are specifically configured for the architecture — the structure — of the gallery and which pay particular attention to Bell’s installation. A total of 409 rectangular pieces cut from poplar have been wrapped in canvas and painted in several colors of found mistinted latex house paint. The prisms are transposed into the space of AXENÉO7, then arranged both strategically and intuitively to delimit negative spaces by diverting or surrounding architectural elements. Inspired by the abstraction of the 20th century, especially between the support and the surface, it takes a primitive gesture to overcome the traditional support and to deviate or decline the usual surface — material — in various volumes. In this sense, only the essential component remains: painting.
Jessica Bell (Vancouver) received an MFA in 2015 from the University of Ottawa. She has twice been a finalist in the RBC Canadian Painting Competition (2013, 2015) and received a residency at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (North Adams) in 2016. Her recent solo exhibitions are Jessica Bell, curated by Tobin Gibson at Unit 17 (Vancouver), Fits and Starts (Ottawa) and All Things Being Equal (Ottawa). Adding Softly, Hardly Subtracting at AXENÉO7 (Gatineau) is Jessica Bell’s first exhibition with artist Robert Taite.
This free participatory performance is available every Saturday from May 26 to July 14, from 1 PM to 4 PM.

Catherine Richards’ visual and media work points to the after-effects of technology. She has received several awards, including the Canada Council for the Arts’ Media Arts Prize. She is featured in key publications such as Art & Science Now, and discussed by significant theorists including Dyson, Hayes, and Tuer. Richards has exhibited nationally and internationally, including at ZKM Germany and the Biennale of Sydney.
For the OAG's opening weekend, artist, educator and activist Cara Tierney performed in collaboration with Fin Xuan, artist, activist and BFA student, a work on gender interrogation implicit in symbols and systems within institutions. Tierney was instrumental in the OAG's new policy on gender-neutral facilities, while Xuan petitioned and was successful in making these changes to the University of Ottawa Visual Arts Department.
Jennifer Anne Norman’s graphite and mixed-media drawings depict the assemblages she creates by repurposing post-consumer waste to repair and redress fragile tree branches. Norman carefully wraps the knotted limbs of broken branches with pieces of local debris, a tender gesture that invites us to consider our responsibility towards the natural world.

Gillian King, Ghosts of the Schrebergärten, 2017, Cold Wax Medium, Oil, Raw Pigments, Various Plant Materials (including Acorns, Sumac Berries, Oak Leaves, Onion Skins, Tansy Flower, Madder Root, and Wildflowers) on Canvas, 8x4ft
These traces of pigmentation are not the only ghosts in Gillian King’s work. The paintings are evidence of her body moving through time. Beginning outdoors, she gathers raw materials; earth sediments, plants, and flowers. In the studio, she uses her hands to work with the materials in order to gain an intimate understanding of them and her function within local ecosystems.
Meaning becoming-with, sympoiesis is a central idea in ‘Ghosts’. Donna Haraway elaborates on the concept of sympoiesis in Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene. Sympoiesis challenges the human-centric framing of the Anthropocene; a new destructive environmental period thought to be caused by human impact on the natural environment. Haraway’s alternative interpretation is the Chthulucene. Derived from the greek word chthon, meaning “earth”, Chthulucene considers all things that dwell in or under the earth. The focus is on how everything is codependent- Bacteria, plants, flowers, beeswax, King and her canvases are connected. Like Haraway, King is interested in deviating from the idea that our relationships to the environment is without hope. Rather, Gillian King’s gestures are traces that consider sympoiesis, or how to make-with nature’s ecosystems.
The University of Ottawa Visual Arts Department has spaces dedicated for MFA use. The renovated private studios inside the 205 wing are where Graduate students settle in during their first year in the program. Each studio is private with a shared ceiling for full ventilation of the entire space. The wing, only accessible by security code, includes a communal sink, mini-fridge and lounge. In Second Year students move into other, more private, areas of the building as they begin to make their thesis works.
Emma Carney has divided her First Year studio into a painting space, and space for research and writing.

PENNY cousineau-Levine, Professor of Theory, publishes essay on Kent Monkman and the Masquerade in AMERICANA E-JOURNAL OF AMERICAN STUDIES IN HUNGARY
CELINA JEFFERY, professor, curator of these waters have stories to tell, GLYNN VIVIAN ART GALLERY, SWANSEA, UK, 19 JAN – 11 MAR 2018
Artists Shiraz Bayjoo, Julia Davis and Sylvia Safdie present cartographies that are situated and relational – on the shorelines of Tasmania, Cyprus, Mauritius and Swansea amongst them – waters that have at times been polluted, gendered, and colonized. Yet, they are equally interested in traversing their mappings to invite the viewer to bear witness to how oceans, their micro-organisms, climates, and animals are affected by our actions. These are waters that continually alter their routes.
Artists Jaanika Peerna, Alexander Duncan and artist-science collaborators Christian Sardet and The Macronauts, ask us to look again – to be attentive of the material aqueous world in which we live. They focus upon oceanic bodies and beings as both phenomenon and habitats, and encourage us to witness the two interacting and generating force. They invite us to explore how oceanic waters can be embodied in individuals and species throughout time – how water transits and transmits its own stories.
Oceanic waters entangle us through time and place; ‘we’ exist in relation to these waters. These waters are alive and in trouble. Our watery world is a shared one, and these artworks ask us to be responsive to this mutual and intimate relationship.

The Furuya manga currently available in the U.S. don't do justice to his abilities as a writer. Genkaku Picasso is one of the worst works of Furuya I have read, while Lychee Light Club and No Longer Human are both adaptations of works written by others, unlike the majority of Furuya's works. Those who only know Furuya through these works may conclude that he's a poor writer when not adapting someone else, while even those familiar with masterpieces like The Music of Marie and "Book of the Moon" may think he's lost his touch. But in The Children's Crusade [Innosan Shounen Juujigun], one of Furuya's most recent works (the third and final volume has not even been published in Japan yet), which is an original story, his writing is as powerful as ever.
Genkaku Picasso was an attempt to create a shounen manga which avoided the cliches of shounen manga. The Children's Crusade, on the other hand, while not shounen, engages with shounen manga in a different way: it takes a familiar shounen scenario -- a group of teenage boys fights for justice armed with idealism, an indomitable spirit, and the power of friendship -- and shows it leading to disaster.
Based upon a real event, though one about which little is known, The Children's Crusade begins in a town in Northern France in 1212. Nicholas*, an impulsive and hotheaded twelve-year-old, longs more than anything to be a crusading knight like his father, but given his poverty and lack of social standing this seems impossible. To show his determination, he goes so far as to carve a large cross into his forehead with a knife. (He bears the scar prominently throughout the two volumes.) His friend Etienne is also twelve, but their personalities are complete opposites. Etienne is a gentle, devout, contemplative shepherd.
One day while tending his sheep, Etienne finds a letter and an unusual-looking trumpet. Then a vision of the crucified Jesus appears to him and tells him that he has been chosen and that the trumpet's sound will lead him to Jerusalem. When he returns to the town and publicly describes his experience, Nicholas acclaims him as a Savior, and declares that he will accompany Etienne to Jerusalem. Soon Etienne's pilgrimage has become a crusade to "liberate" Jerusalem from the Muslims, led by Nicholas, who declares that nobody over fourteen is allowed to participate, since previous crusades have failed because the faith of adults is too weak.
Spurred by a rumor that those who reach Jerusalem will have any wish granted, a diverse group of boys enrolls, including a puppeteer; an intellectually-minded, skeptical merchant's son; a leper; and one of the bandits who had attacked the village, whom the villagers had captured and are abusing as revenge. These latter two are allowed to come at the insistence of Etienne, who publicly embraces both of them. (To be sure, it's unrealistic that all these types would be found in the same small town, but it helps keep the secondary characters from blurring into each other, a common problem in stories with lots of characters of approximately the same age and sex.)
Soon after they set out, they meet Hugo, a member of the powerful Knights Templar. After he witnesses Etienne perform a miracle, he not only declares the Children's Crusade under the Templars' official protection, but accompanies it himself. From then on, in each town they pass through the Crusaders receive a rapturous reception, in good part due to Hugo's advance work. In each town Etienne miraculously heals the sick and injured. And in each town, they gain both generous donations and new recruits, some as young as eight, whose parents are eager to entrust them to the "miracle boy." Nicholas is living out his dream and practically worships Hugo, but Etienne grows concerned at the increasingly martial tone Nicholas's rhetoric has taken under Hugo's influence.
The crusaders have plenty of friendship and perseverance, the first two parts of Shounen Jump's famous formula. But this won't bring victory, the third part of the formula. Furuya raises the crusaders' and reader's hopes only to crush them. Legend has it that the historical Children's Crusaders were sold into slavery by the ship captains they trusted to carry them across the sea. I don't know how The Children's Crusade ends, but they, too, have their innocence and naivete betrayed. And the end of the second volume promises much worse to come.
One of The Children's Crusade's chief strong points is characterization. With Etienne, Furuya succeeds in one of the most difficult tasks for a writer: convincingly depicting a character who is good to the point of saintliness but not sanctimonious. Nicholas's characterization is also very well done. The other "apostles" receive less attention from Furuya, but he succeeds in giving almost all of them distinct personalities.
The characters' lively, expressive faces as drawn by Furuya contribute substantially to the characterizations. And the art in general is excellent, both in visual storytelling and page design, and is frequently cinematic in scope and detail. Furuya isn't particularly well known for his action scenes, but the ones here are dynamic.
In manga and anime, Christianity is generally treated very superficially (e.g. Evangelion and Hellsing). In contrast, Furuya gives a convincing depiction of a devout Christian in 13th-century France. And in general, even though Furuya takes substantial liberties with the few known facts about the historical Children's Crusade, his setting feels authentic. This makes it all the more disappointing when, in the last few chapters of volume two, Furuya introduces a frequent cliche in modern-day works set in the Middle Ages, the female heretic with modern attitudes. But so far, at least, this is a minor flaw.
I would rank the first two volumes of The Children's Crusade below The Music of Marie and "Book of the Moon," simply because it lacks the soaring imagination of those two works. But it's still an outstanding series.
Like The Music of Marie, the volumes of The Children's Crusade are not numbered, but labelled by the kanji for up, middle and down. Each of the first two volumes is 288 pages long and is published by Ohta Press. Their ISBNs are 978-4-7783-2086-3 and 978-4-7783-2105-5, and they cost 1200 yen each. Their amazon.co.jp pages are here and here.

When Patricia S. Bowne offered me a review copy of A Lovesome Thing, the sequel to Advice from Pigeons, I accepted readily. I'd enjoyed the earlier book and expected to enjoy the second. Just as important, since I'd already reviewed the first book, I assumed that writing a review of A Lovesome Thing would be easy. That proved not to be the case. In part, that's because things usually turn out to be harder to write than I expect. But mainly, it's because A Lovesome Thing turned out to be quite different from Advice from Pigeons in several ways. Most importantly, it's much darker.
Although most of A Lovesome Thing's main characters are academics, it's not really an academic novel in the way that Advice from Pigeons was; the academics appear primarily in their public service role. And most of the main characters of Advice from Pigeons are absent from A Lovesome Thing, the only exception being postmodern feminist demonologist Teddy Whin, who is again a major character here. The other academic protagonists were secondary characters in the earlier book. One of them is Bill Navanax, the angry alchemist from Advice from Pigeons, who is actually happy at the start of the book, because Neil Torecki has become his lover and moved in with him. Neil, also a major character, is happy himself, except for a compulsion to paint pictures of Bill's ex-lover being burned at the stake, a compulsion he has kept hidden from Bill. Cham Ligalla the exorcist also returns, and is summoned to deal with a demon who possesses people and makes the nasty demon from Advice from Pigeons look like Mr. Rogers.
There's a new major character as well, Father Rameau, a priest of the Church of the Sacred Flame, who unlike the others has no connection with the Royal Academy. Through him we learn about religion and the gods in Bowne's world, something that didn't appear in Advice from Pigeons. There are many gods, all of whom are in some sense manifestations of a single divine power, although believers worship only one god at a time. And the gods are tangible, at least occasionally, so that when a murdered woman is found in Father Rameau's church, it's natural for a policeman to ask Rameau "'when was the last time you saw this god?'"
There is actually not much humor in A Lovesome Thing, especially compared to Advice from Pigeons. This may be partly because we're more familiar with Bowne's world, so there are fewer opportunities for the incongruity-based humor that enlivened Advice from Pigeons. But mainly, A Lovesome Thing is a much darker book, as mentioned above. The demon mentioned above likes to make its victims torture themselves, tortures that are graphically described. Much of the action takes place in a truly hellish garden. And while in the earlier book Rho's basic problem was his mix of arrogance and insecurity, A Lovesome Thing explores much darker regions of the human heart.
A Lovesome Thing is well-written, and the characters are complex -- more so than in Advice from Pigeons -- and well-drawn. Conversely, the plot in A Lovesome Thing is weaker than in Advice from Pigeons. Father Rameau's story in particular feels undeveloped and doesn't add much besides an opportunity to convey information about religion in the world of Osyth. The plot in A Lovesome Thing is also harder to follow, and the fact that there are multiple copies of several characters doesn't help things.
A Lovesome Thing's main problem, though, is that after the grimness of most of the book, its happy ending is unconvincing. After Cham has finished expelling a possessing demon from its victim, who was forced by the demon to mutilate himself horribly and is now dying, "She heard the enchanter's voice again, lying to [the victim]. Bad things happened, the voice said, but what mattered was how you faced them. Whether you had been brave and kind. And if you were brave and kind, it said, everything turned out for the best and everyone you loved would be safe." (135)
The book's ending appears to show that the enchanter's "silly lie" (135) is true after all. But looking at the book as a whole, Cham's original judgment seems more accurate.
Despite these reservations, I would recommend the book to those who want to know more about the world of Osyth, or the characters. But don't expect a fun read like Advice from Pigeons.

Following the theme of my current challenge "Deck the Halls" I also chose poinsettias. Krisha in the previous post created a delicate card using poinsettias. I used a little different approach on mine. I chose to make them bold by coloring the poinsettias with Copic markers. The stamp is by PSX and the beautiful gold matting is by Paper Temptress. The tag uses highlighted cuttlebug.

Place the dish with persimmons into the oven preheated to 200 C and cook for about 20 minutes or so, until the persimmon slices got caramelised .
Wash the goose (duck) breasts and then pat them dry with paper towels. Salt and pepper them to taste.
Lay the breasts skin side down a heavy bottomed frying pan and dry them over low heat for about 15 minutes.
Slice the breasts and serve them on top of the roasted persimmons alongside the halved purple potatoes topped with pieces of butter.
I have been recently in Ukraine in Zakarpattia – aka Subcarpathia, very nice place, very friendly people, very good food and vodka.
While I was visiting the city and browsing through the farmers market I found smoked pears, never heard of them before.
So when I came back, I had to try them and add a splash of vodka to keep the Ukrainian theme. And since it’s goose season the meat of choice was of course goose.
Salt and pepper the goose legs and wings and place them in an ovenproof dish. Add the bay leaves and white wine,
Place the dish with goose parts in the preheated oven at 180 C and roast the for about 1.5-2 hours, until done, and the skins are crunchy.
Place the diced tomatoes and chopped peppers in a small pot, add a cup of water, a bit of salt and pepper, and simmer on low heat for about 30 minutes until they are soft and mushy.
In another small pot add the smoked pears and about 1 liter of water simmer over medium heat for about 30-45 minutes until the pears have soaked and soften up.
In the smokey-peary liquid add the dissolved cornstarch, a dash of vodka and the honey, simmer for a minute until thickens a bit.
Server the goose legs with some boiled potatoes, some smoked pears covered with sauce and a spoon of the chili-tomato sauce.
Hogget is a lamb between 1 and 2 years. Therefore it has a very subtle taste in-between lamb and mutton, if you like it more rare (and I cooked it more so) leave it roast less, if the liking si more well done roast half an hour plus.
This is also a meat the I bought from the farmers market, I had another get-together with friends and got to the market to see what the fresh and eye charming meat we found. Therefore hogget was the choice of this time.
In a food processor blend together the olives filled with anchovies, honey, garlic, wine, vinegar and 1 lemon’s zest.
Blend it until it forms a smooth paste thick/thin enough to be spread, if needed add some more wine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
f you have a gas oven, baste with some more wine while roasting. In electric oven you can still baste it but it’s optional.
Roast for about 2-2 1/2 hours depending on the size of the hogget and how you like it – rare / medium / well done. Check with a steak fork to sea the meat’s consistency.
While roasting the meat prepare the vegetables to roast, I had some cauliflower, small white aubergines, wild green zucchinis, yellow onions and potatoes.
Crest the potatoes (in their skins) and place them in the oven first since they need the most time to cook. Spread some salt and pepper and drizzles of olive oil over the vegetables.
After some 20 minute place the other vegetables on the roasting trays an lay them into the oven, below the hogget. Let them roast for another 20 minutes.

Crudo is the Italian word for “raw.” It’s important to use the highest quality and freshest tuna. I like to experiment with building flavors that highlight the quality and pure taste of the fish rather than overpower it.
Sprinkle tuna generously with salt, followed by the shallots, capers, red pepper flakes, and basil. Place tuna in the freezer for 10 minutes; this helps it firm up, which makes it easier to slice. Using a sharp chef’s knife, cut the tuna into slices roughly 1/8-inch thick. As you work, gently press each slice onto the cutting surface with your fingers to flatten it, then transfer to a large platter.
Combine the olive oil and lemon juice in a sealable container, close the container, and shake well until the oil is emulsified. Spoon this vinaigrette over the fish. Serve immediately with noodle salad.
Divide noodles among 4–6 plates, placing them off to one side of each plate. Dot the center of the plate with three dots each of bang bang sauce and wasabi aioli. Place a slice of tuna on the other side of the plate and serve immediately.
1 red or green chile, seeded and thinly sliced 1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips 1 green pepper, seeded and cut into strips
Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and cool. Combine all remaining ingredients and mix well. Finish with enough sauce (recipe below) to lightly coat noodles.
Mix all dressing ingredients together in a cup or small bowl until sugar dissolves. Taste for sour/ sweetness, adding more sugar as desired. Note that the taste of the dressing will be very “zingy” at this point because of the lime juice—it will taste milder when distributed among the noodles.
In a food processor, blend wasabi paste, garlic, ginger, vinegar, and egg yolks. While processor is running, drizzle in oil, slowly at first until it emulsifies, then more quickly.
Spring and summer are great times for this light dish; however, it can be made any time of the year.

Compared with natural stones, artificial stone is more colorful and smooth, stronger but light, and many other advantages. Artificial stones has the advantage of resources’ multiple uses, and can’t be underestimated on the side of energy saving and environmental protection. They already become the first option in modern buildings’ decoration.
The modern consumers are more likely fashionable and have their own ideas about choosing stones in room decoration. So, characteristic stones become their favorites already. The reason why copy wood stone is liked by many consumers is that they are waterproof and wear resistant.
Natural stones like marbles, their colors are different and with heavy weight. As many are imported overseas, the price is very high.
Natural stones as a kind of scarcity natural resources have their own luxury qualities. High class stones cannot even get in market with lots money. So natural stones are pursuited by many loyals.
Artificial marbles are hard and light; there is no difference between the same color marbles in color and radiation. Artificial stones have great potentials and will be the new trend in stone market.

As part of their religious Code, Scientologists pledge “to expose and help abolish any and all physically damaging practices in the field of mental health,” and thereby bring about an atmosphere of safety and security to mental healing.
Accordingly, in 1969 Scientologists established the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a watchdog group that investigates and exposes psychiatric violations of human rights. Today, CCHR is a worldwide force actively working to eliminate brutal treatments, criminal practices and human rights abuses in the field of mental health. It has been responsible for helping to enact more than 150 laws protecting individuals from abusive or coercive practices in the field of mental health.

I think that this forum is a good opportunity for ASEAN to hold discussion on infrastructure investment projects and other needs with major investors from all around the world.
With Cambodia’s long-term vision toward 2030, the Royal Government of Cambodia has developed and adopted, since August 2015, the “Industrial Development Policy 2015-2025” as the National New Growth Strategy. Regarding policy measures to promote Cambodia’s industrial development, we emphasize top priority on “Four Key Concrete Measures”, such as:
1. Reducing price of electricity for industrial areas, including expanding coverage and strengthening reliability of electricity supply.
2. Developing and implementing master plan for the development of multi-modes transport and logistic system.
4. Developing and transforming Sihanoukville into a multi-purpose special economic zone. In this regard, Cambodia’s prioritized sectors include: electricity, transport and logistic system, workforce development and special economic zone development.
To realize this development vision, Cambodia needs a huge amount of financing around 12 to 16 billion US dollars for infrastructure development in next decade. In this context, the promotion of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is one of our key priorities. In fact, between 1990 and 2011, the Royal Government of Cambodia has approved roughly 20 PPP investment projects in various sectors such as power stations, hydropower dams, airport, railway rehabilitation and so on. Recently, the Royal Government of Cambodia starts to review policies and regulations on PPP to facilitate private sector’s participation in infrastructure development.
On top of this, Cambodia still has huge potential in others sectors, therefore, I strongly encourage all investors to conduct investment feasibility study in Cambodia under both PPP and other forms of investment. Cambodia, indeed, is in great demand for physical infrastructure development, especially the transformation of Sihanoukville into a special economic zone with great potential in light industry, manufacturing and agro-industry. The Royal Government of Cambodia always stands ready to welcome, discuss and support every investment project to share win-win situation together.

Iodine and carbon tetrachloride are both nonpolar, so the liquid dissolves the solid. The water layer does not dissolve the iodine because water is polar.
A similar explanation can be used to show why the permanganate dissolves in the water and not the tetrachloride, but it should be sufficient to say that "like dissolves like."
The same principles of polarity also explain why the water and carbon tetrachloride don't mix in the first place.

With the world rapidly shifting forward in terms of knowledge, contrary to the belief of most people, it is of utmost importance that one has his or her very own best university degree. A possible reason as to why people believe why people think that best university degrees are over-rated is the shift from the traditional way of doing business, involving paper work and a great deal of paper work to the simplicity of online working. Here, experience and competence speak loudest.
For those who are used to the traditional form of doing business, or willing to work for the firms that prefer hard copy evidence of qualification, having the best university degree is advantageous. However, it is not entirely given that having the best university degreedirectly assures you for a job. However, it does mean that an individual is at greater security of getting a job. This is in comparison to a simple certificate level of education in ones respective field of study or interest.
A job degree is a great asset to hold in these days. There a wide variety of jobs available to job degree holders that offers competitive remuneration. These jobs can only be snatched by those who have a job degree since they have gained the necessary skills to tackle the job in the right manner.
Campus life, while in the process of obtaining the best university degree, is in no way comparable to an individual who did not go through the same. An advantage of going to campus is the fact that through collective responsibility, as well as community learning, in more ways than one, provides experience in the respective field of study. An example of this is group work. This promotes unity as well as teamwork which are very important in whichever field. Another advantage of group work is that it promotes and develops interpersonal skills that could strengthen your best university degree choice. This helps the learner in various scopes of life such as his or her social life and logic only dictates that an individual with good interpersonal skills is more pleasant to work with than an individual who does not share the same quality. Aside from this, obtaining the best university degree the old fashioned way (by attending campus classes) develops an individual’s sense of time and organization. As is common knowledge, university life is very engaging and in a word, fun but if an individual desires to leave the institution with their very own best university degree, he or she must ensure that he is able to share their time appropriately to every activity. This may not seem important but in the hectic state the world is in, this is a vital and important skill easily obtained in the process of obtaining the best university degree.
Aside from this, attending on campus classes to obtain the best university degree, is advantageous to an individual since the students are able to create networks that help them within their fields and within the entire scope of life in general. You never know, the person you are sitting next to in class on campus could be the next president or prime minister of your country! Regardless, different paths that each individual student decides to follow, it will definitely benefit the next person. All this would not be achieved if either of the people in question never obtained the best university degree by attending classes in their universities of choice.
In addition to this, an advantage of undertaking a campus course that leads to the best university degree is the fact that the students are open to diversity and open themselves to new experiences altogether. Some universities usually offer best university degree opportunities for a wide selection of people, or in other cases, they offer scholarships for students in other countries whereas some offer the same to scholars in entirely different continents. Attending campus classes therefore opens and exposes the students to new experiences and in the process exposure to new ways of thinking and developments in the forward direction.
Moreover, the process of obtaining the best university degree provides a sense of pride for the students that they went to university or college. This is the case especially for the well renowned institutions. They are able to hold up their heads and claim that they obtained one or best university degree from their respective university of choice. So in the end, it may not seem like it is important from afar, but going to campus to obtain one’s best university degree has a myriad of advantages and no disadvantages that I can think of. I therefore strongly suggest that if given an opportunity, every individual who does not already have the best university degree, should reconsider and go back to school to get their very own best university degree. What’s more, is the fact that the developments made in technology have made it possible for students to learn from the comfort of their homes!
An elective represents a unique opportunity for medical students to experience healthcare in a setting unfamiliar to that in which they are accustomed to studying, or in a place or field of specific interest. This is classically in a low resource setting, but may also be to experience a specialist field, a place the student is considering working in the future, or for a variety of other reasons.
Medical Student taking blood pressure during awareness campaign event Medical education is education related to the practice of being a medical practitioner; either the initial training to become a physician (i.e., medical school and internship), or additional training thereafter (e.g., residency, fellowship and continuing medical education).
A placement in a particular specialist setting may allow students insight into a potential career path, or allow students to participate in the research or implementation of new treatments or practices.
For more than two decades, the Obie Award-winning Big Dance Theater has been making uncategorizable, galvanizing work that undermines genre boundaries. The company's latest effort is a portrait of Samuel Pepys, the outlandish 17th-century politician whose obsessive, tell-all diaries are a startling precursor to our own social media culture. The ensemble weaves music, dance, video, and text in an exploration—part celebration, part inquisition—of the moral murkiness of Pepys' legacy as statesman and notorious philanderer, juxtaposing his own writings with the radical feminism of his contemporary, the playwright Margaret Cavendish, and the cult of online annotators at pepysdiary.com.

"Although Margaret is reluctant to celebrate her 65th birthday, the guys take her out to the local club."
"Margaret is surprised to learn that Sid is not out to his visiting son and tries to convince him to come out to him. Meanwhile, Hank stubbornly refuses to admit he needs glasses, and Charlie tries to help him cheat his eye test."
"In the upcoming election for activities coordinator, Hank supports Charlie and Margaret supports Sid."
"Hank and Margaret lose a cornhole competition and miss out on the coveted prize - a new flat-screen TV; the gang attempts to steal the TV, which means breaking into Allison's office after locking her and Sid in the sauna."
So, since all our BPL traffic will no doubt follow LDadsB's demand that they migrate from your beloved Brisbane Ultimate Blog (now in its 7th year of BPL reporting!), we're just going to have to up the focus on BUML to something like 11! Yeah, man. And what better way to do it than get back to our old favourites - interviews with real life people! And few are more 'real' than Mansauce (his real name) and Andy 'Online' L. So here we gooooooo!
One of the ‘foundation’ teams of the Brisbane Mixed Monday night scene, the Dyspnoeics are also one of the highest profile, thanks in part to their perennial placing in the Finals series at the end of most seasons, although some would argue it’s the relentless self-promotion, now into an incredible 17th season.
Still, the trophy cabinet in the ‘Sauce’s boudoir is a little bare, with two championships in 2009 and a third back in 2006. But things are looking very good at the start of 2012, with two wins on the trot and a lack of a stacked super-team in Division 1, so we invited the bluest of the Blue D’s, Mansauce and Coops to the stately Brisbane Ultimate Blog mansion, to talk up their chances.
Brisbane Ultimate Blog (BUB): Thanks for coming in guys. You can put the top hats over here, no need for formality. Let’s get straight to it – are we right to think you’re looking the goods this season?
Mansauce: Thanks for having us BUB, I must say the water feature is looking particularly majestic today. Regardless of what the polls may say, this season is very much a wide open affair. We have started the season well and I put that down to our team having one of the most stable line-ups in the comp. Plus we recruited Chris Brown; and he plays for Firestorm A.
Coops: Cheers BUB, it’s always a pleasure to converse in intellectual diatribe with the likes of yourself, but I’m very honoured to be seated around the BUB drawing room coffee table with yourself and Sauce. To answer your question, yes, we are indeed looking pretty hot this season. With regards to talent on the field however, I’d say we’re pretty much on par with the majority of Div1 teams.
Mansauce: I’m really excited by the new Blues taking the field this season. Molly, Kirstin, Cola, George, Notty and Chris will hopefully add the depth and experience we need to make a strong title challenge. Did I mention Chris Brown plays for Firestorm A?
Coops: As Sauce has indicated we’ve certainly recruited some useful skillsets to our roster this season. Whilst we have certainly lost some talented Dyspnoeics faithfuls to injury-repair and work commitments (Suze, Jimmy, Bec) I was conscious of not stacking our line-up, however Sauce was adamant that we should try to win at all costs, and told me to STFU and get as many ‘guns’ on board as possible.
BUB: Still, Division 1 is looking pretty tight this season – just the six teams, smaller than the eight last year. What do you think, and who will you be watching?
Mansauce: I think any team can get a win on any given week. UQ & Peta’s team/PUD/whatever their name is this week have enough game winners on their rosters to be thereabouts come week 14. My tip for a darkhorse is White Lantern. I like what I’ve seen so far from that group and I expect them to be serious contenders if they can keep Craig Behrendorff fit.
Coops: I don’t disagree with Sauce’s tip re White Lantern, however if you’ve seen the better looking Behrendorff brother with his shirt off you’ll know that him getting unfit isn’t likely to happen anytime soon. Personally however, I’ll be keeping my eye on Poachers, who may have lost their star quarterback Mr Henbest, but have now picked up a relatively unknown, but very talented, rookie, by the name of John McNaughton. On second thoughts, he’ll no doubt roll his ankle at a frisbee party soon, so the team I’ll be watching closely will be UQ Lovers.
BUB: You’ve both played for the Dyspnoeics for a long time – what’s been your greatest Blue D moments?
Mansauce: My top moments are: Winning two trophies in 2009, winning a semi final with only six players back in 2008, recruiting Chris Brown who plays for Firestorm A, Aurelie’s cupcakes and being interviewed by the BUB - I can finally cross that off the bucket list.
Coops: There really are too many to list out during this interview, however one that’s certainly up there for me would have to be the season I decided to hand the captaincy to Sauce, thereby ensuring he did all of the administration and legwork, while remaining the spiritual leader of Dyspnoeics, and so still getting all of the glory. However I’d have to say that the entire journey with Dyspnoeics has been great! Being able to perform a slightly more mentor type role on the team for the rookies amongst our ranks has been very satisfying.
BUB: Who are the players who’ve left Dyspnoeics over the many years that you’d most like to have back one day?
Mansauce: We’ve had a lot of great players don the Blue over the years, it’s really hard to single people out. The first names that spring to mind are Andy & Leticia. Quality on and off the field.
Coops: Yes I agree with Sauce, it was a sad day for Dyspnoeics when Melbourne swallowed up Andy & Leticia. Now that we have Notty (one of the Dyspnoeics originals!) back on the roster, I’ll be focussing my recruiting efforts on trying to rip Blackie away from Poachers, and bring him back home to the land of blue.
BUB: And now many know that Coops has stepped up to join the BUML Organising Committee this season (no hint of impropriety here of course) – but what’s your take on the League and where it’s going Mansauce?
Mansauce: I’m really impressed with direction the league is taking. BUML has really gone from strength to strength over the last couple of years. A few years ago I never would have imagined having 2 divisions, let alone 3. Coops joining the Organising Committee is another step in the right direction. I especially appreciate the way he engineers favourable draws for teams he likes. You’re not gonna print that last bit are you?
Coops: Before joining the BUML OC it was very easy to bunker down in my own little corner of whatever division I was playing in at the time, and not pay a whole lot of attention to the growth of the league surrounding me. It’s very clear to me now just how much growth the BUML has felt over the last couple of years, and no doubt will continue to feel as we move forward. With the emails that are still trickling through to the OC requesting new additions to the league, I’d suggest that in 2013 we’ll have at least 25 teams!
Mansauce: Everything you’ve heard about Chris Brown is a slanderous lie propagated by the nefarious machinations of sources yet to be determined. He is an upstanding character of the highest order. I can personally confirm he has never even been to Coast City nor does he know Maxwell Lord. As for the rumour concerning the goat, I won’t even bother to dignify it with a response.
Coops: Well I’m not sure what your readers have heard about Chris, but most of what Sauce has said is accurate …. By the way, I believe the goat’s name is Gruffy, and rumour has it, he likes tall men with moustaches.
Mansauce: I’m more excited for this season than redheads at a sunscreen sale. I won’t go into clichés, but needless to say we are taking it one game at a time and I’m sure Ultimate will be the real winner. Also Trevor Lovering.
Coops: Thanks for the tea and scones, it’s been lovely catching up here in the BUB mansion. I’m also very excited, but that’s mainly because I’ve just heard word of a sale on sunscreen, WOOT! Apologies for having to dash away, but I’ve got a very important phone call to make to Blackie, regarding Dyspnoeics 2013.
BUB: So there you have it folks – Coops and Mansauce of the Dyspnoeics, talking the talk – will they walk the walk? They’re in the match of the round next Monday, against White Lantern, and good luck to them!
Can't believe you missed the obvious question, BUB. What is up with those nicknames? Mansauce and Coops?
Kudos to Mansause and Coops for taking Dyspnoeics from strength to strength. And more Kudos to Coops and the BUML OC, it sounds like the BUML has really taken off since I left 2 years ago. "I bleed blue" My highlight would be the come from behind win in the Div 1final 2009 (i think).
BUB - perhaps a BUB poll might be in order to answer the question of the hour, how DID I get my nickname??
Back at it again with a mix of new songs that we’ve enjoyed this week, there is, unfortunately, not as much Drake this week. But not to fear, because what we’ve lined up for you instead will more than satiate your appetite for new music. Let’s start shall we?
First up this week is Exeter-via-Bristol noise makers Skeleton Frames with a song that will burst your eardrums. ‘Quicksand’ is the first song off the five pieces debut EP and it sets a pretty high marker. Heavy as lead guitars compete with haunting vocals in a perfect mix of grunge and shoegaze.
God how we’ve missed Kathleen Hanna. The Julie Ruin is Hanna’s project that she started in 2010, and ‘I Decide’ is the first song off their upcoming record. It’s exactly what we all expect/want from Hannah; a huge punk song, but with drums lifted straight out of Le Tigre. So yeah, basically amazing. Plus the video stars Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield.
These four yung (sorry) Danish boys have been attracting a lot of attention over the last year but have slowly building their sound. They’ve grown from the brash punk that typified their first EP and ‘Uncombed Hair’ finds them exploring a more tender side. Not that any of their energy has left them. The frantic guitars and heavy use of reverb puts the band firmly alongside Eagulls and Ice Age.
There’s very few people who possess voices that make me cry. Not like a proper cry, but just like a silent one. A single mournful tear. A tear shed for a voice that is just so delicate, special and honest that I can’t help myself. Bristol’s Tamu Massif possesses a voice that can do this to me and ‘Holding Back’ is, even by his standards, intimate and stripped back, featuring mostly just his voice and his guitar. And it’s wonderful.
Weaves never seem to stand still. ‘Candy’ is yet another insane three minutes of Pixies and Sonic Youth inspired weirdness. I know what a guitar should sound like, but the noises that the band make just don’t sound like they came from the same instrument that I know. Vocalist is again onpoint in using her amazing voice to take the madness even further.
Sunface is the bedroom pop project from 18 year old Daniel Longmore and somehow he’s released three fantastic songs in the space of a month. All three are woozy, lo-fi sunkissed pop, but new single ‘(In My Dreams) I Have It All’ is easily his best yet, it’s easy melodies and charm putting you in mind of Jaws.
I’m not sure Witchita signee Oscar has even written a song that isn’t insanely catchy. I don’t think I’ve ever heard an artist who so consistently plants a chorus in my head for days on end as the slacker-pop prince. Pair that with his gorgeous baritone and you’re onto a winner every time. ‘Good Things’ is slightly less upbeat than normal, but is still fantastic.
The other half of the split 7” that Bristolians Something Anorak are sharing with Gorgeous Bully. It’s less introverted than their usual offerings, with a driving drum beat and melodic guitar, shaking off the usual reverb that soaks their songs. As usual though it’s brilliant.
Skaters came away from their major label experience pissed off and looking for something new, and with their new track they’ve definitely made a leap towards it. Gone is the more sedated Strokes like sound of their debut and in it’s place is some heavy rock’n’roll. ‘The Loner’ feels like the band have a point to prove, and with a more raucous sound, they definitely prove it.
Oh James, James, James, how you tease us so. It’s been what feels like a lifetime since the mysterious producer/singer/genius released his last album and I can’t take it anymore. Luckily he’s feeding us little bits to keep us amused, and ‘Timeless’ which was premiered on his BBC Radio 1 show, more than does that. It’s a minimal, threatening garage song, full of clicks beeps and a thumping synth with his angelic vocals layered on top. He still hasn’t announced a release date for his album though, so he isn’t forgiven yet.

John Sterpe says, well, I was sleeping in my tent, I remember seeing flash's of light in my closed eye lids, Then John Messina woke me up, it was around 1:00 AM. Hay John, he said a couple of times, John, water is lapping against your tent, I think you need to move it, I was like huh, what do you mean? I got up and looked outside, and WOW, there was water everywhere, we were on this strip of sandy beach with no place to go but to the highest ground. I was very much awake now, and John keep asking me, what's going on, what are we going to do, I felt a little guilty, being that I was on this island so many times, I found this place and felt responsible for taking the group here. So I said, we are going to move our tents and we are going to tie them together, the water keep getting closer, the lightning in the sky was like a spider web of flashing light, but the lightning was not touching down to the ground at this time. Right after we moved the tents, we had to move them again, this time we tied the kayaks to the tents too. So here are the two Johns, the tents are tied together, the kayaks are tied to the tents, the lightning was getting worst, now the wind is picking up, Hay John, what are we going to do said John M., well says John S. we are going to stay low, very low, and throw these chair away from us, why says John M. So we don't get hit by lightning, says John S. At this time lightning was touching down into the water a distance away, and there was this huge, great black arch in the flashing night time sky. We were running out of dry tent space, but John S. was staying optimistic, the camp fire was still burning, it must be the highest part of the beach, John M Says, John we are running out of beach, not to worry says John S, the fire is still burning, when that fire goes out, then we can worry.
Suddenly, poof, the fire went out , the water came up from under the fire pit we made earlier, now we can worry, lets get to the tents now, OK lets go, now what says John M. well, we look for our wet suits and put them on, it was getting cold and rainy and windy and all the stuff that comes with a storm. John M got his wet suit on, he had a good one, I put mine on so fast that it ended on me backwards, so I could never get it all the way on.
So in the tents we were, holding onto the tent door and also onto the two kayaks, everything tied together, at least we were together, not really knowing what's going on with the rest of the group. Everything was happening very fast, Suddenly we felt something move, it was like a warm rolling feeling under us, the two Johns look at each other, and say, what do you think that was?, gee, I don't know, but I hope it was the wind John S. says, if it happens again, I don't think it to be the wind, its probably to be the water, now John M. is starting to get very sentimental, he said to me, Hay John, I just want you to know that you have been a very good friend, we have had really good times together, you helped make a difference in my life, I realized he was saying his last good bye, and I said we are not going to die.
just then, that rolling under the tent feeling came back again, along with stronger gust of wind and rain and I am like, yep, that's the water alright, we are most likely going to start to float away, so when it happens, just hold onto the kayaks, a few seconds later, the next rolling feeling and off the beach we went, we are now in the bay, we are now on our way.
Around this time we start thinking back on other trips I took with John Messina, one of the trips I talked him into going, he would say, John, I don't have any gear so I really don't want to go, and I would say, don't worry about it, I'll take care of you, after we got to the place we camped at, John M would say, hay John I need this and that and other things, after awhile, I gave in and said, John your on your own, which surprised him, I just kept saying, your on your own. Its one of those inside jokes
So here we were again out in the bay with all our stuff floating away, we would see tents going by, gee, John M would say, I hope no one is in that there tent, and then he said to me, what are we going to do, and jokingly I said, John, your on your own, we laughed in the mist of this total disaster, I said, this is going to make a great painting, oh god there goes another tent, there goes a cooler, we were wondering where we were going so I wanted to look out the tent door, so we both worked up the tent door while holding onto the kayaks, just for a little peak, when swooowoosh the wind got into the tent, so now what was a barge is now a barge with a sail, and we are peeking our heads around to see what we are going to crash into, behold is the land directly behind, into the mangroves we are entering, the wind pushed us into the trees, when we landed, we helped pull our selves as deep as possible into the mangroves, not knowing what was going on and we didn't want to be swept out to sea with the next tide, so we got into those trees and tied down in there. It rained, thunder, lightning, wind, all that kind of stuff that goes along with a storm, I got so cold, hypothermia was setting in, I still couldn't get that darn wet suit on right, I could tell John M. was doing alright, Hay John M. we need to get to Marco Island, and call the rescue or someone, and I need to get a hotel to get warm, that was the closest place around, that's where my head was at, John M. said we should wait here, but we were considering it, now we started to wonder what happened to the rest of the group. John M his heart would sink every time he saw something campy float by.
The storm started to pass, its finally stopped raining, I kept thinking of Marco Island, and a warm bedroom, then in the distance, I saw a light, a voice of someone calling out from the mist, Hello out there, is anyone out there, are you guys out there, it was that muscle man Mark from South beach, Hello we called back, We are here, we are OK, but John S. seems like he's getting hypothermia, John S, yells out, Hello, we need to go to Marco Island, NO, says the voice in the distance, I am coming to get you, OK, as Mark kayaks up to my rescue, take John first says John, thanks John, boy this John and John stuff sure can get confusing.
Boy it sure was good to see that strong and handsome man, he picked me up and swept me from my feet out of the cold waters and the thicket of the muddy mangroves, took me back to what was left of camp, where all the girls helped me to what was now called the brick tent, the only tent from the group that held up, they stripped me out of my wet clothing and gave me what only dry clothing that was left on the island, girls cloths, but I was grateful they put there warm bodies to mine to bring warmth and life back to me, they did the same for John M. when he arrived at the brick tent. We all stayed in that tent like sardines, back to butt, back to butt, I think it was like eight of us in a three man tent. But after all it was the brick tent. As life came back to our bodies we told the stories of our adventure over and over. Somehow, the sun has arisen, Mark light up a blazoning camp fire, I was the first out of the tent to find the warmth, to become dry. The other John soon followed. So this is the two Johns version, an experience that changed our lives for ever, to bring us all closer , only a memory away.

The All-New 2019 Ram 1500 turned many, many heads when it was unveiled in January at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit – and for good reason. With six dynamic trim levels to choose from, ranging from the all-business, work-ready Tradesman to the no-nonsense, ready-for-anything Rebel, truck enthusiasts can now drive not just the most powerful, most technologically advanced Ram 1500 ever, but one perfectly suited to their needs.
Take the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn Edition, for example. Salespeople, business owners, real estate agents, basically any professional who requires top-of-the-line luxury need look no further than the truck that has earned accolades and high praise from journalists and others for having just that.
“The All-New 2019 Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn is a no-compromise luxury truck that delivers what buyers want most: strength, durability, technology and efficiency,” said Mike Manley, head of Ram brand. “Wherever you look, whatever you touch, the Laramie Longhorn is filled with more craftsman-like details, including wood surfaces and 100 percent full-grain leather seats, than any other truck in the segment.”
The Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn Edition is distinguished externally by its standard two-tone RV Match Brown trim or monotone paint, premium LED headlamps and taillamps and unique wheels and grilles. Inside, the truck exudes quality thanks to a hand-wrapped, 100-percent full-grain leather dashboard and Southwestern-design-inspired door-panel and armrest coverings. Throughout the cabin, a new embossed alligator-skin leather pattern covers the center console, instrument panel, seats and door panel inserts. Other unique details include satin chrome accents, a brushed-nickel metal badge flush-mounted on the console lid and a new “Longhorn” branding mark burned on the wood-trimmed upper glove box door.
Layered with premium materials, the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn features iconic design cues inspired by relics of the Southwest, including antique pocket watches and hand-tooled leather cowboy boots. Real barnwood accents are used throughout the cabin. Wood tandem doors on the center console reflect the heightened attention to detail and provide closed storage.
Complementing the Laramie Longhorn’s interior appointments are numerous advanced technology features that make the truck even more appealing. The features include but are not limited to (far from it) available 4G Wi-Fi hot spot connectivity1 to go along with the award-winning 4C Uconnect® system and its massive 12-inch touchscreen.
The All-New 2019 Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn Edition is scheduled to begin arriving at BusinessLink dealerships in 2018.

Music is one of my absolute favorite things about life. Ask anyone who knows me, I don’t go anywhere without earphones in except for class, and only because I haven’t found an effective way to listen to both music and my lecture (though I have tried)! My taste in music is all over the place and changes with my mood, but I always have alternative type sounds on all my playlists. My all time favorite band is Imagine Dragons, and I LOVE Halsey, Catfish & the Bottlemen, Glass Animals, Lorde, Twenty One Pilots, Coldplay, and The Neighbourhood. For things like workouts I love the Chainsmokers, Tove Lo, Ellie Goulding, Fall Out Boy, Calvin Harris, anything high energy. I like really calm music for studying, like Ed Sheeran, Kaleo, whatever. All music is good music to me!

Instead of mincing or crushing garlic, try slicing it. When you crush garlic, a molecule named alliin comes into contact with an enzyme known as alliinase. The strong odor associated with garlic is released when alliin and allinase come in contact with each other. If you slice garlic, you'll get the wonderful flavor without the bad breath.
If you need to crush garlic and don't have a press, place some cloves inside a resealable plastic bag and crush with the back of a knife. You'll keep your cutting board and your hands from smelling like garlic.
Peeling cloves of garlic can be a complete pain. The next time you need to peel a bunch of garlic, microwave the unpeeled cloves for 15 seconds. The skin will then come off quite easily. If you want to shell out $7, OXO makes a silicon garlic peeler. It's absolutely amazing.
To get the garlic smell out of your hands, rub them vigorously on some stainless steel for about 20-30 seconds. A metal spoon or the edge of your sink will do just fine. If you want to get fancy, you can even buy a metal "soap bar" made specifically for this purpose. This also works for onions too.
Always use fresh garlic. If your garlic cloves have been sitting around for a while or have green shoots growing in the center, toss them. Fresh garlic has a "sweet" flavor to it. Old garlic is bitter. Also, you should *never* buy the bottled garlic available at supermarkets. It might save you a few minutes in the kitchen, but it's overpriced and tastes awful. This stuff is nothing like fresh garlic.
The next time you're cooking with garlic, be sure to try these 5 tips and you'll make the most of this mighty little vegetable.
Making perfect hard boiled eggs is trickier than you might think. While undercooking typically isn't an issue, overcooking is much more common and leads to a dry, blue yolk and a tough, rubbery white. Yuck. Here's a simple foolproof method that will produce perfect hard boiled eggs everytime.
Place eggs in a large pot and cover with an inch of cold water. It's important that there's enough room for the eggs to be arranged in a single layer.
On high heat, bring the water to a boil. Once the water reaches a boil, remove from heat, cover, and set aside for 10 minutes.
While the eggs are resting, prepare an ice bath consisting of equal parts cold water and ice. Transfer the eggs to the ice bath and let sit for five minutes. Peel eggs and use. Or, store for up to 5 days.
We love using this method because it's almost impossible to overcook the eggs. Try it and you'll see!
Yesterday, New York Times food writer Mark Bittman published a compelling commentary titled "Which Diet Works?". In it, the notion that all calories are created equal is challenged. "Big food" would have you believe that your body treats 100 calories of Cheetohs is the same as 100 calories of spinach. When consumed, highly processed carbohydrates cause dramatic spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels.
A recent study from JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association compared the results of three diets. The first was a standard low-fat diet. The second, a low-carb diet similar to the Atkins diet. And the third, a low-glycemic index diet consisting of mostly unprocessed foods. And the results? The 12 week study showed that the low-glycemic index diet stood the highest chance of improving health in the long run.
Mr. Bittman's article and the JAMA study had a simple takeaway: compared to other diets, a low-glycemic index diet consisting mainly of unprocessed foods has numerous health benefits because of the nature of the calories being consumed. In other words: all calories are not created equal.
We're adding new recipes and features to FoodPair everyday. It's our mission to make it very easy for everyone to find recipes. Many people have dietary restrictions or preferences, and sometimes this can make it a pain to find recipes. We recently added five new dietary filters that we're really excited about. FoodPair users now have the option to limit search results to show dairy-free, gluten-free, pescatarian, red meat-free, and shellfish-free options.
In addition to our new filters, users can still filter by vegetarian, vegan, low-carb and, low-fat diets. You can also combine filters to get even more specific results. For example, clicking both "gluten-free" and "shellfish-free" will show you over 100,000 recipes that meet both requirements.
Since dietary restrictions typically don't change from search to search, we also make it easy to save these preferences. When you set the diet filter, you'll see a padlock appear at the bottom of the menu. Click the icon and you'll lock this filter until the next time you change it.
Over the last several years, olive oil has found its way into the mainstream. Once an ingredient mostly associated with Mediterranean cooking, this healthy and tasty ingredient is now a staple in many kitchens.
Rich in Omega-3 fatty acids and anti-oxidants, consumption of olive oil is linked with a reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. But we're not here to sell you on the health benefits of olive oil. In fact, we're going to try to get you to stop buying olive oil -- the kind you find on the shelves at a typical supermarket. If you're buying your olive oil at a chain supermarket, there are a few potential pitfalls:
Most store bought olive oil is overpriced for the quality you're getting. It's not uncommon to pay $10 for a 375ml bottle of mediocre olive oil. More on this below.
Selling olive oil that has blended or adulterated is an underhanded trick pulled by some bottlers. While a bottle may be labeled as "Olive Oil" or "Extra Virgin Olive Oil", you might find in small print that what you are buying is a mix of oils including olive oil. Price is usually the biggest giveaway here. If you find a bottle of olive oil that is priced exceptionally low, it's probably too good to be true.
Olive oil has a shelf life of about a year under ideal conditions. Most olive oils found in supermarkets are sold in clear glass or plastic bottles and are being bombarded by fluorescent lighting 24/7. It's a bad combination that leads to a shorter shelf life.
We're big proponents of buying olive oil in bulk. The benefits are many. Stores like Whole Foods are starting to offer a variety of high-quality olive oils sold in bulk at very reasonable prices. At $5-7/lb, you're getting a superior product at a much better price. Most bulk oils are stored in metal canisters, preventing exposure to light and extending the oil's shelf life. Bulk oils are also being restocked on a regular basis, so what you're buying is most likely a lot fresher than bottles sitting on a shelf.
An added benefit of buying bulk is that you get to try before you buy in many cases. If freshness or quantity is a concern, going bulk means you can buy in smaller quantities, more frequently. At stores like Whole Foods, you can even bring in your own containers. Give it a try and let us know what you think!
The folks at CHOW recently teamed up with food writer and kitchen scientist Harold McGee to show us a clever way to prepare pasta in less time.
The traditional way of cooking pasta (spaghetti in this case) goes something like this: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt, add pasta, and then cook for 9 minutes. Pretty standard stuff. But, according to Mr. McGee, there's a better way. By using a frying pan instead of a pot, and by placing the pasta in the water from the beginning, you're able to save time, energy, water, and a little bit of salt while getting the same results.
We placed 4 quarts of cold tap water into a 6 quart stock pot and brought it to a boil. On high heat, it took 22 minutes. Then we added 2 tablespoons of sea salt and a standard two ounce portion of spaghetti and cooked for 9 minutes. From start to finish, it took 29 minutes.
For the frying pan method, we placed 1 quart of cold tap water, a standard two ounce portion of spaghetti, and 1.5 teaspoons of sea salt into a 10-inch frying pan and cooked on high heat for exactly 15 minutes.
Both methods produced perfectly cooked pasta. Given the identical results, it's a no-brainer: the frying pan method is the way to go. You end up using 75% less water and salt, and get the job done in half the time.
A few notes: We only used single portions of spaghetti in our trials, but there was plenty of room for additional pasta. Also worth mentioning is that you can use other types of pasta. Cooking times vary by shape, so be sure to adjust accordingly.
One of my favorite cookbooks is Thomas Keller's Ad Hoc Cookbook. In case you're not familiar with the name, Thomas Keller is the proprietor of The French Laundry, which is consistently rated as one of the top restaurants in the world. He's also the chef/owner of Per Se, Bouchon, and Ad Hoc.
While reading through the Ad Hoc Cookbook I was blown away by the attention to detail paid during the preparation of even the most basic of dishes such as salad. It occurred to me that little things can make a huge difference. Here are 4 simple tips from Mr. Keller. that you use to take your salad making to the next level:
Rinse your greens then spin - When cleaning your greens, place them in a bowl of cold water, but do not drain into a colander. This reintroduces the dirt you just washed off. Instead, place the leaves in a salad a spinner to properly remove excess moisture.
Season each ingredient - Apply salt and other seasonings to the ingredients separately before combining. Each ingredient is unique and requires a different amount of seasoning.
Dress your salad evenly - When dressing your salad, apply the dressing to the sides of the mixing bowl instead of pouring it on top of your ingredients. Then, toss the greens lightly. Doing so ensures your salad is evenly coated with dressing.
Pay attention to weight - If your salad contains many components, consider using a shallow serving dish and placing the lighter ingredients on top. This makes it easier to try all the ingredients in the salad.
A common problem I see companies – both old and new to Scrum – face is an understanding and execution on the idea of cross-functional teams, and the associated idea of holding a team, not individuals, accountable as a unit. Struggles in this area commonly lead to:
Individuals remaining highly specialized, often identifying themselves as their role (“I’m a tester, so I [should do x] and not [do y]”), instead of as a team member. This problem is even worse if this is how they are incentivized (e.g., coders are rewarded for slinging code, not for making sure done, quality software is releasable as soon as possible, testers are rewareded for finding bugs, etc.).
Sprints looking like miniature versions of a waterfall project – do some design first, then code, oh, and the testers obviously couldn’t do anything until the coders are done…
These first two naturally lead to activities with heavy phase gating, where “throw it over the wall” is the method of (non-)communication between gates.
Teams remaining in a lot of wait states, because they’re waiting for [specialty x] to handle [job y], because they’re “obviously” the only one qualified (or even worse, “authorized”) to do that. Oh, and since the specialties are so strictly defined, it doesn’t make sense to pair up to tackle a problem. For example, “As a coder, I can’t start working on this bug until the analyst has told me exactly how to reproduce it.”
By contrast, where I’m working with a team that is effective as a unit here are some of the ideas and activities I see:
Individuals are respected for their specialties, but they are also expected to go beyond their comfort zones. They identify as team members, and are willing to do what it takes for the team succeed – whatever that might be. Yes, a coder might help with testing, and a database specialist might proofread the technical writer’s copy. And yes, that happens even if their individual functional managers are obsessed with “correct utilization” – because that’s what the team needs at the moment. Ultimately, stakeholders want working software (not “done but not tested” or “done but not ‘done done'” stuff). That may or (usually) may not have anything to do with some line manager’s idea of “correct utilization.”
Even Alex Rodriguez, generally accepted as one of the most selfish and detached baseball players of all time, “contributed where needed” by moving from Shortstop to Third Baseman…
Here’s a little story to demonstrate this principle. Even Alex Rodriguez, generally accepted as one of the most selfish and detached baseball players of all time, “contributed where needed” by moving from Shortstop to Third Baseman when he was acquired by the Yankees, where Derek Jeter was already established as Shortstop and team captain. “Correct utilization” in Rodriguez’ case could have looked like, “the money spent on Alex must go towards his contributions as a Shortstop, because that clearly is his best / most experience-backed defensive position…so if we don’t have a need for a Shortstop, it’s not the best use of our money, so don’t acquire him.” I’m guessing Yankees fans were pretty happy that wasn’t the rationale and allocation / utilization strategy that was actually used.
Did the Yankees expect Rodriguez to be the best Third Baseman ever? Better at Third Base than at Shortstop? More comfortable there? I hope not, at least not initially. Third Base is about playing the “hot corner” of sharply hit balls (hand speed), long throws to first, and knowing when to bare-hand slow-rolling grounders. Shortstop is about range, leadership, and working in tandem with the Second Baseman. But whatever his shortcomings may have been at his new position, they knew that having him playing at a less-than-ideal defensive position was better for the system (which would include offense, not just defense) than not having him at all.
The diminished focus on specialist roles allows more natural interaction between the different specialists, where testing informs coding, coding informs architecture, architecture informs testing, testing informs analysis, etc. – any and all possible permutations. There is no waterfall of phase-gated activities – there are the right interactions at the right times with the right sequence – where “right” is determined empirically by the people closest to the work, not by a process or dictate. This is how software is actually built in the real world, even if you pretend to have strict phase gates – the difference here is we’re going to acknowledge and optimize for that, instead of insisting that separation exists and treating any lack of separation or any need to iterate back over ideas as “problems.”
With more natural interaction between specialties, the “throw it over the wall” and “not my problem” phenomenon start to fade away. Where there were things that were treated like strict, detached handoffs in the past, we now see at the very least informative walkthroughs between specialties, if not outright collaboration in building the artifacts at hand.
This sort of collaboration – pairing, swarming, mobbing – eliminates handoffs, because multiple people have their hands on something at once. There are far fewer wait states, because the team as a whole relentlessly focuses on the most important work at hand. No analyst available? What can we learn on our own to start? Who can we talk to? How can we leverage the inherent low risk of our small batch (determined by Sprint length) to do something that makes a reasonable amount of sense, even though we still wish we had someone with this specialty around? Asking these questions become both a cause and an effect of a team who feels empowered, motivated, and accountable.
Team members start to realize that underneath, they’re all doing the same thing – discovery, experimentation, and building something to satifsy users. Designing the right architecture involves understanding the user’s needs and the product’s vision (Architect <-> BA <-> PO). Coding is judged by whether it works and whether it solves the user’s problem – i.e., the cornerstones of testing, verification and validation (Programmer <-> Tester <-> BA <-> PO). Good architectures allow for the testing of the most granular structures to the most coarse (Architect <-> Programmer <-> Tester). Test cases start out very abstract and declarative, and move towards detail and imperativeness – just like the implementation of a feature in code itself (Tester <-> Programmer). We’re not only on the same team, we’re all doing the same thing. Our specialties are merely dimensional views of the same thing, with the same goals. We have more in common than we do in difference. We are discovering, experimenting, and building valuable, high-quality solutions to delight users. All of us. Together.
We’re not only on the same team, we’re all doing the same thing. Our specialties are merely dimensional views of the same thing, with the same goals. We have more in common than we do in difference. We are discovering, experimenting, and building valuable, high-quality solutions to delight users. All of us. Together.
Again, the value or breakthrough here isn’t that idea itself, because that’s always been true – the value and difference is acknowledging and optimizing for that fact, instead of pretending it’s not true.
In the future, I plan on writing some posts that talk about specific, detailed expectations that can be set for team members, regardless of specialty, and the sort of behaviors that these expectations engender. Stay tuned…

This series will talk about the WHYs behind a commonly used, misused, and abused concept in Scrum: the Sprint Burndown. A Release Burndown is an entirely different thing, with different goals and a different audience, which these posts will not cover at all. The confusion between these two burndowns, especially understanding the different audiences, is one thing that leads to misuse of the Sprint Burndown.
Last time, we talked about the basics and the core why behind the Sprint Burndown. Now, let’s talk about the Sprint Backlog in more depth, and at the same time move towards the bigger picture of metrics and audience.
This post answers questions like, “Can I, as a manager, use the Sprint Burndown to gauge the performance and progress of the team?”
Understand that a burndown is a crude, single metric – so there’s a lot of conversation that needs to come along with it. That is, just having a Sprint Burndown, even if it’s accurate and up-to-date, is rarely enough to-know-where-you-are (see the previous post about why this is an important need). For an example, enter the Daily Scrum – if the SB looks good today, but Jimmy is totally stopped on a huge, key task, for example – the team should hope they’re not just looking at the SB and saying “looks great, moving on…”, and they should hope Jimmy is speaking up (or at the very least, the Scrum Master is helping facilitate that), because things are not “great.” That’s not where they actually are, regardless of what the SB says.
That said, the SB is useful all by itself as a trigger for explicit adaptations – “we’re not where we thought we would be, even a crude metric like the Sprint Burndown can show us that – what are we going to do?” If you’re not using it as a trigger to adapt, and just looking at a drift from the ideal trend line and saying things like:
– then I actually recommend you stop using it immediately, because you’re not doing anything with it that’s intended – you’re not really believing it (you might say you’re not actually inspecting it), and most importantly you’re not using it to adapt. You’re wasting your time, and you or someone else is likely drawing conclusions from it that are very dangerous because they’re so detached from reality.
This “problem” (it really isn’t a problem, it’s just the nature of the thing) – that the SB isn’t all that useful by itself, other than as a trigger for more granular discussions around adaptations made in response to its inspection – is much greater, with even more implications for the outside (of the team) observer of the SB. Anyone outside of the team should be very careful about drawing any conclusions without additional information from the entire team. “Don’t draw sweeping conclusions from isolated metrics,” is one cliche that applies here. You can probably start to guess where I’m taking this…
The SB, when used, or any other how used to meet need-to-know-where-we-are, is explicitly for the team, as one tool that will help guide them to meeting their Sprint Goal. Outside observers don’t have enough context for it to mean anything of value to them by itself, and for the team to add the context would involve so much time on their part (it would go well beyond just observing the Daily Scrum) that you may as well put the outside observer onto the team – which is impractical for all sorts of reasons, and not what the outside observer is after, anyway. Even so, I oftentimes see managers and others outside of the team trying to use one simple thing, like a Sprint Burndown, to draw conclusions that have nothing to do with what’s being tracked, or the actual goal of the artifact in question.
The questions and conclusions I see these outsiders trying to understand – whether the team is successful and performant, whether they need help and what kind of help, whether medium- or long-term goals are in jeopardy, whether we’re happy with the return on investment of this team in the context of building this product – are all very good things which I encourage you and them to understand. A Sprint Burndown, quite literally, tells you none of these things. Let me repeat:
Trying to use it for these means will be very frustrating for people outside of the team, because it just won’t work. Trying to use it for these means will be very frustrating for people on the team, because that inevitably comes across as (and most often actually is) micromanagement.
OK, so I’ve said that the SB is not the tool for understanding these things, but also that these things are still valuable – so, what are some good tools to understand these things?
Next time we’ll talk about the answer to that question, which will also actually help us understand more about the Sprint Burndown.
Posted on April 6, 2017 May 4, 2017 Categories Scrum and Agile1 Comment on The Sprint Burndown – WHY? Part II
This post answers questions like, “I feel like the Sprint Burndown is a waste of time – we don’t use it for much – can’t I just stop using it?” and “If this is all about remaining work, where do I track the hours I actually worked today?”
A Scrum Team needs a way to understand where they are in relation to their Sprint Goal and the work they forecasted for the Sprint (what’s on the Sprint Backlog), at any and all times during a Sprint.
Without this transparency, there is no opportunity for valid inspection, and therefore no opportunity to successfully adapt. There’s a reason the team meets at least once a day, in the Daily Scrum, and it is not about individual team member status. It is about understanding where you are as a team, and as a team figuring out what to do next to achieve the Sprint Goal. If where-you-are isn’t where-you-thought-you-might-be, what are you going to do about it? Inspect and adapt, inside a 24-hour window, to get to the right place in the 1 to 4 week window (the Sprint) – that’s what we’re after. Without a transparent sharing and understanding of where you really are, and the ability to respond to inevitable uncertainty even in a window as short as a Sprint, you will never get to where you want to be. All of this is the why behind the expectation in the previous point, and that’s always important (I’ll talk a lot more about this throughout this series of posts, as the title suggests 🙂 ).
The Sprint Burndown is about tracking only the team’s current understanding of the work remaining, so the members can adapt based on that reality. It’s about reflecting current learnings and truth of the work in the Sprint, and keeping focus on, “What’s left? How do we complete this and deliver value?” The “actual” or “burndown” line of the SB (as opposed to the “ideal trend” line) does not reflect how much work has been done. Doing work, putting in hours, tracking the hours you worked – those things are somewhat interesting, and you may need to track them (I get it, I’m a consultant), but they have literally nothing to do with the Sprint Burndown. I may have worked 8 hours on a task I originally thought would take 4 hours, and still have 6 hours left by my current estimation and understanding. So, “6” goes into the remaining work field of that task (A corollary to this is: a team with burndowns that never burn up, day after day, Sprint after Sprint, is telling itself a lie – building software is in the complex domain, and estimates will inevitably be wrong at times, even in time horizons as short as a Sprint or a task). The fact that I worked 8 hours might be interesting to a manager or accountant, especially if we’re capitalizing the work I’m doing, but I should completely ignore that in regards to the Sprint Backlog and any tasks contained within. If you have to track this, I’d strongly recommend you track it in another system to avoid confusion and maintain focus on what each activity and tool is for.
A Sprint Burndown is a common way in the Scrum world to satisfy this know-where-you-are need – most every tool supports it (not that that makes it a good idea per se, but it does make it easy), and it kinda-sorta-used-to-be an official Scrum Artifact. It is no longer, because an SB is but one way you might achieve the goal – so “knowing where you are” is the expectation, how you do that is up to your team. (That is not the same thing as saying the team could choose not to meet the expectation (and be unable to inspect and adapt inside a 24-hour window), or use something that is not accurate or useful, either – enter a good Scrum Master who can set expectations about what is needed and why, without having to prescribe any particular how.)
One example of a different how than a Sprint Backlog: some teams size their tasks to be no larger than x (oftentimes, a single day / 6 to 8 hours), and simply use the count of tasks in the Done column vs. the count in the To Do and In Progress columns of a task board to tell them where they are (a simple count drives things, not hours/effort/size as in the y-axis of the most common type of Sprint Burndown). No Burndown is built – just take a quick glance at the board – how does it feel, now that all task post-its are roughly equal? Sure, go ahead and count them if you need to. Good enough. Note that without the explicitly small/bounded task sizing, and instead with a huge range in task sizes, this rarely works – it tells you very little about where you are.
Another example is using test reports (usually focused on Acceptance Tests) and comparing passing and failing tests – the context with this one is a truly test-driven environment (beyond just unit tests via TDD – thinking about “test-driven” in a holistic, comprehensive way work is approached). This often means there are test(s) for each Acceptance Criteria, shelled out (and initially failing) directly inside of Spring Planning, etc. – in this case, “done” for a Sprint Backlog Item / story is a report where all of its tests are passing (functional side, roughly), and it meets the Definition of Done (non-functional side, roughly). This is an incredible place to be, when an entire team is focused on making something work exactly as the customer is expecting / would accept – and the focus is continuously, relentlessly on that. It helps teams not lose focus on minor technical debates, etc. But I digress.
Next time, we’ll talk about the Sprint Backlog in more depth, and at the same time move towards the bigger picture of metrics and audience.

Sometimes teams, and now well-accepted frameworks, misuse and misunderstand agile estimation concepts at a deep level, to the extent that all of the potential value of the practices is stripped away. This series will talk about theory, whys, and whats behind some of the concepts and practices, and allow you and your teams to take back the power and value of agile estimation techniques!
Both of these statements fall victim to multiple misunderstandings regarding Story Points. I’ll call the two scenarios described here “normalizing Story Points,” as that’s a reasonable umbrella term to cover them both. They are slightly different, though, so I’ll also cover some of the differences below.
There are fundamental issues with normalizing Story Points that remove the advantage of, and any possible need to use, Story Points – that is, normalizing Story Points also neutralizes Story Points – it makes them useless.
The documents required for freight shipments varies, depending on whether you are shipping via air or sea.
An airwaybill is required for all air freight shipments. This is the most important document, as it contains vital information including sender and delivery addresses. A copy is usually attached to every seperate piece in your consignment.
A shipping label must be attached to all sea freight consignments. It contains important information about your shipment including sender and delivery addresses.
A Bill Of Lading is required only for sea freight shipments. It entitles a named party to receive the shipped goods at the destination port.
We prepare Bills Of Ladings for you once the vessel has departed, we send Bills Of Lading’s to client ‘s who have opted to clear their own goods.
A packing list/customs invoice is a document that details the contents and value of your goods for customs purposes. ALL shipments must be accompanied by a packing list. We can prepare these for you if required.

A federal appeals court Thursday said prosecutors cannot force U.S. companies like Microsoft to turn over customer emails and other data stored on servers overseas — a ruling the government suggested could hamper national security investigations.
The three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned a lower court's contempt finding against Microsoft for not handing over a customer's emails stored in Ireland. Federal prosecutors wanted the material for use in a drug trafficking investigation.
The ruling in the closely watched case was a victory for high-tech companies in the burgeoning "cloud computing" business, in which data is kept not on personal computers but on giant and sometimes distant servers. Microsoft stores data from over 1 billion customers and over 20 million businesses on servers in over 40 countries, the court noted.
The court said prosecutors went beyond what Congress intended when it passed the Stored Communications Act in 1986.
"Neither explicitly nor implicitly does the statute envision the application of its warrant provisions overseas," the court said in a decision written by Circuit Judge Susan L. Carney. She said allowing prosecutors to enforce a warrant outside the U.S. would "jettison ... centuries of law" and "replace the traditional warrant with a novel instrument of international application."
In a concurring opinion, Circuit Judge Gerard E. Lynch said an attempt to apply U.S. law overseas could cause tensions with other countries, "most easily appreciated if we consider the likely American reaction if France or Ireland or Saudi Arabia or Russia proclaimed its right to regulate conduct by Americans within our borders."
Microsoft called the ruling a "major victory for the protection of people's privacy rights under their own laws rather than the reach of foreign governments."
"We hear from customers around the world that they want the traditional privacy protections they've enjoyed for information stored on paper to remain in place as data moves to the cloud," said Brad Smith, Microsoft president and chief legal officer. "Today's decision helps ensure this result."

As an independent curator I only work for artists and artist teams. I can provide all the creative-scholarly services needed by the professional artist. My experience of working in close cooperation with galleries, collections and museums will ensure the long-term success of our joint endeavor.
Gerhard Storck was the Director of the Krefeld art museums when I first worked there as an intern in 1992, which was also when I started to find my way into the contemporary art scene. One day I asked him what he thought of Martin Kippenberger. To my astonishm ...
Bruschetta Grilled Chicken. A perfect summer meal. Simple to make, healthy and bright fresh flavor. Grilled chicken topped with juicy sweet tomatoes, lots of fresh basil, some garlic, olive oil and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.
I don’t know about you but when it comes to summer we are busy and I am not looking to spend hours in a hot kitchen. This dish right here, Bruschetta Grilled Chicken is perfection! The flavors are so bright and fresh and it really doesn’t take much time at all to throw it all together.
I seasoned 6 chicken breasts very simply with a little drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper. Grilled until cooked through and some nice grill marks have developed. For the bruschetta component I diced up some big juicy tomatoes, garlic, lots of fresh basil, some olive oil, salt, pepper and a bit of balsamic vinegar. Throw on top of the chicken and you are done!
I made this for a family BBQ so I actually cut each chicken breast into halves or thirds after the chicken was grilled and have some time rest. This can be served hot or cold and is really great over top a salad or tossed with pasta! You all have got to try this one, its AMAZING!
Drizzle a little olive oil no the chicken breasts and season with a bit of salt and pepper. Grill on a hot grill for about 4 minutes per side {cooking time will vary because of thickness of the chicken breast and the temperature of the grill}. Cook until the juices run clear and the meat is just cooked through. Set aside.

Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor broke her ankle this morning in an airport stumble, then boarded her flight to Washington as scheduled and made the roughly hourlong trip to Washington to meet with senators who will vote on her confirmation. The federal judge, who has been keeping up a busy set of appointments on Capitol Hill, tripped at New York’s LaGuardia Airport and sustained a small fracture to her right ankle, the White House said.She was keeping her six appointments with senators despite the injury. She entered the Capitol for a meeting with Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, on crutches, wearing a white cast covered at the foot with a black soft bootie. Asked how she was feeling, Sotomayor said, “I feel fine, thank you.”
Sotomayor has set a relentless pace since her Capitol Hill debut last week. By day’s end today, she will have met with one-third of the Senate in just four days of visits.
The White House is pressing for her quick confirmation, and Sotomayor wasn’t pausing much for distractions, even her own trip-up. She even stopped at the White House Monday after her arrival in Washington, before heading to a local medical office for an x-ray.
The George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates treated and released her, according to a White House statement.

Remember Y2K? For the years leading up to it, dire predictions and trepidation filled many minds, and when it finally arrived most of us woke up the next morning and our lives went on exactly as before. The tech guys, whose world was actually affected, made the necessary adjustments in preparation and their lives weren’t blown up. As the 2016 golf year approaches, the end of the anchor putter is upon us and for many it’s starting to feel a lot like Y2K. But what does it really mean for golf?
First of all, belly putters, broom-handle putters, or whatever falls into the category of “long putters,” are not being banned. All of those clubs are still legal. What IS being banned is the practice of anchoring any club to your body during the putting stroke. No more using the chest, or the stomach, or the arm to interfere with the free-swinging motion of the golf stroke. Here’s an example of what “anchoring” looks like:
This is not the first time a putting stroke has been axed from the game by the powers that be, as over 45 years ago standing astride the ball and making a croquet mallet-like stroke was also banned. Sam Snead famously worked around this prohibition in his later years by using the croquet swing from the side, so you can still wield your long putters on the green – you just can’t aid your stroke by anchoring them to create anything that resembles a hinge-action in your swing.
The idea of taming overactive hands and wrists in the putting stroke with an anchor is hardly a new one, as golfers have been trying such tricks since the days of hickory shafts. Former U.S. Open champion, Orville Moody, more or less introduced golfers to the “long putter” back in 1989 when he jammed an oversized putter into his chest and won the U.S. Senior Open. From that point on, the long putters began showing up in the bags of professionals.
Still, none of the professional tours were overrun with the elephantine putters. PGA research estimated that only about four percent of all pros used the non-traditional putting method. But around 2010 notoriety increased as Keegan Bradley, Ernie Els, and Adam Scott all captured majors with anchored putting strokes. The number of practitioners had swelled only to about 11 percent, but officials at the Royal & Ancient Golf Club, which governs the game everywhere outside of the United States, became alarmed that the trend would continue to grow and that the anchored stroke was being embraced by instructors in whose hands the future of the game resides.
