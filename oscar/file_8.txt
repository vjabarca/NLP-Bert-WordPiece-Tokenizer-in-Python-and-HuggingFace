After Steven Duggar earned a leadoff walk, he would steal second. Devin Mesoraco would get out of his croutch slower than an old man reaching for a walker, and he would make a lollipop throw to second Travis d’Arnaud thought was bad. Duggar found himself on third after a Joe Panik groundout, and he would score when Mesoraco just missed a pitch, which would go back to the backstop.
Now, Home Plate Umpire Tony Randazzo was horrendous on the day, but despite Mesoraco’s complaints otherwise, Evan Longoria did not foul tip that ball. No, Mesoraco, who is showing himself to be a really poor catcher, flat out missed it. Mesoraco also failed to frame any number of pitches which would aid Randazzo in being a horrendous umpire.
The key call came in the fourth inning. With two outs and a runner on, deGrom threw an 0-2 pitch which led everyone in the ballpark to believe Nick Hundley just struck out looking:
Perhaps because he was frustrated, deGrom would walk Hundley, and then he would allow an RBI double to Bumgarner. At that point, it was 2-0 Giants, and with Bumgarner pitching, there was little to no hope the Mets would win this one.
Overall, this was an off-day for deGrom as he needed 108 pitches to get through six innings, and he would have a season high four walks. Of course, these struggles are indicative of just how great deGrom has been all season. In fact, a struggling deGrom limited the Giants to two runs (one earned) on four hits while he striking out 10.
As good as he was, Bumgarner was more dominant against a Mets lineup which featured Jeff McNeil batting sixth and Michael Conforto batting eighth.
The Mets would not even threaten Bumgarner until the fourth. There were two and two out, and McNeil hit a hard liner, but it was right at Panik.
It seemed as if the Mets may finally break through and get deGrom off the hook in the seventh. Todd Frazier led off the inning with a homer making him the first ever Met to homer off Bumgarner at Citi Field. Jose Bautista would get hit by a pitch, and McNeil would single. The rally would sputter as Kevin Plawecki, who had come on for an injured Mesoarco in the sixth, hit into a 6-4-3 double play.
That brought up Conforto. He battled back from 1-2 to draw a full count in a nine pitch at-bat. On the ninth pitch, Bumgarner beat Conforto inside with a well placed fastball to end the rally. Given how Gary Cohen, Keith Hernandez, and Ron Darling were harping on the false narrative Bumgarner ruined Conforto’s 2016 season, we should see more of the same for any poor play Conforto makes the rest of the year.
In the bottom of the ninth, the Mets had a chance to rally back from 3-1 against Tony Watson, who they had already gotten to in the series. The only problem was Tony Randazzo wasn’t going to have any of it.
It appeared Wilmer Flores drew a four pitch walk to start the ninth. Instead, Randazzo called an obvious ball a strike. Flores then went the other way as he has been doing so well lately only to line it directly at Panik. Like with deGrom earlier in the game, Flores had some choice remarks for Randazzo, who, again, was terrible.
The game would come down to McNeil, who both Randazzo and the third base umpire ruled did not check his swing leading the Mets and perhaps more importantly deGrom to a loss. Looking at this game, you really see just how much deGrom has working against him as he tries to win games. Ultimately, if he does not win the Cy Young, there should be a line of people offering apologies. On that line, we should see Mesoraco and Randazzo.
Game Notes: Dominic Smith sat against Bumgarner the day after hitting a home run. The Mets are now 19-41 in games Mesoraco has played.

Mexico is the land of the master craftsman, the very first glass made in North America was produced in Puebla Mexico around 1535 to 1542 by artisans brought by the Spanish from Europe.
For hundreds of years, with nothing more than a blob of molten glass, a long hollow pipe, and some old tools, these artisans have produced glass items in a variety of shapes and sizes.
Although these original glass works were short lived, glass blowing was reintroduced into Mexico hundreds of years ago and flourished, due largely to the simplicity of the ingredients and the ingenuity of the Mexican Arts and Crafts Tradition.
The General Assembly of Maryland, as the legislative body directly representing the electorate, passes public general and public local laws, raises revenues and appropriates funds to pay for State government services, and oversees the operation of State executive agencies. In much of this activity, the legislator plays a major role in helping to develop the public policy of the State.
The state is divided into 47 legislative districts, with each district represented by one senator and 3 delegates. Some districts are wholly contained in one county and some districts contain multiple counties.
The General Assembly is divided into two houses: the 47 member Senate and the 141 member House of Delegates. Each member is elected to serve a four year term. The next election will occur in November of 2018.
The organizational arrangement of each house results from a combination of constitutional requirements, rules adopted by each house, and legislative custom. The General Assembly is further organized into standing, statutory, special, and select committees, the latter usually known as local delegations.

With both the United States and China doubling down on a trade war, and heated electoral rhetoric giving way to full fabrication, it’s time to write a bit about China. Today and well into the future we should all understand some of the economic and security issues that form our relationship. To do so, we must also untangle some of the fabulist lies told about the Chinese economy.
I will begin with some bona fides on the topic. Most readers will know I am an economics professor, but for most of my life, I was also a soldier. From 2003 through 2009, I served as a reserve infantry lieutenant colonel on the operations and planning staff of U.S. Army Japan and the UN command in Korea. I cannot say more than what should be obvious that both North Korea and China were much on our minds. It is worth noting that I squared off against Chinese tanks and faced fire from Chinese rockets in Iraq in 1991, so my experience is a bit different from that of marginally informed citizen or detached academic. I am a fierce but realistic critic of China, but that isn’t the same thing as fearing them.
China may ultimately prove a significant strategic threat to the United States. The nation is poorly led, and so wholly ensnared in the failed dogmas of Lenin and Mao that we must view it as a potential long-term adversary. The reason we must view them as a security concern is not that they are an economic dynamo, but rather because their economy is so desperately bad and likely to remain so throughout this century.
China is a poor nation, which exaggerates their economic performance. By some measures, their GDP per capita is now at levels last seen in the U.S. before our civil war. I suspect conditions are a bit better, with standards of living more like ours at the turn of the 20th century. That is still bad, and means crowded, disease ridden, densely populated tenements, and factories like those described by Sinclair Lewis in "The Jungle," and lived by the victims of the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Fire. Chinese workers die on the job at more than three times the rate of the developed world, if they are telling the truth.
Like all Leninist-Maoist nations, China can put on a show. Bright gleaming factories, cheerful workers and efficient transport systems are hallmarks of Chinese propaganda. To get these shiny factories, and raise their standard of living to that of late 19th century Europe, the Chinese have been crushingly authoritarian. Though they try to avoid any visible semblance to the Maoist debacles, they have purged entrepreneurial spirit and succumbed to the worse examples of central planning. In a nation living in cramped, multi-generation apartments, newly constructed cities capable of housing one million workers sit empty.
Their recent reforms have largely failed. For anyone who was a college student in the 1980s and early 1990s, Chinese graduate students were feared for their unequaled preparation. Only the top students from the world’s most populous nation came here to study. Today, it is mostly the children of the party elite who fill American schools, and the change is obvious.
Let me say it plainly. China is a large, poorly led nation with a military that is decades away from the expertise of Saddam’s army and an economy that is more than a century behind ours.
When you hear a politician telling you that China’s economy is just a few years away from surpassing ours, he is simply lying to you. No one living now will see the Chinese standard of living catch up to ours, and I would wager they won’t equal America’s current standard of living in the balance of this century.
To be clear, China’s weak economic performance is not a good thing. In the short term, the U.S. and China share many common concerns, not least among them the special sort of crazy known as North Korea. We would be better off if they had a more robust capacity to deal with that problem.
Over the long run, continued poor economic performance likely increases rather than lessens the risk of conflict. A growing economy and a growing middle class are the most helpful antidotes to Chinese aggression in decades to come. Any movement towards modernity in China will come from within. This won’t be possible until its economy has made more gains.
Our challenges with China aren’t easy, or primarily commercial. In fact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was the ideal platform from which to challenge a China unconcerned with property rights and worker protections. Instead, we descended into an irrational and counterproductive trade war, which is precisely the wrong approach. It won’t make us safer, wealthier or stronger. Perhaps the only good thing to say about it is that the unfolding economic disaster of tariffs will teach the current generation a lesson in the cost of trade wars.

Starting a career in real estate isn’t as easy as you’d think. It’s essential to take into consideration that you’re not just becoming a real estate agent but also a business owner. You have to keep track of your income and expenses, develop a marketing plan, display excellent communication skills, manage your resources and so on. Joseph Sheehan, a successful licensed real estate broker at Bond New York, who also has his broker’s license in Florida, joined us on the “Michael Meier Show for Real Estate Rockstars” to tell us what he’s learned from his five-year journey in the business thus far.
Joe, who lives in the same building as Michael Meier — principal broker and owner of MEIER Real Estate, comes from a detail-oriented, accounting background where it was imperative he implemented certain processes to monitor data. So to him it was essential to transition into the industry with a plan. A two-year plan to be exact. Joe recommends that aspiring agents raise enough funds to last at least two years, if possible, due to the slow start most new agents face in generating income.
Whether it’s on social media, at the coffee shop, through another agent or at the airport, your first transaction opportunity can happen at anytime. Joe got his first deal in a more traditional fashion by being on floor duty and converting a walk-in customer into a client. Always be prepared. Always be ready.
To keep business coming in after your first transaction, take a look at your marketing and advertising strategies. At MEIER, we encourage our agents to use social media to generate brand awareness, send out monthly videos to their personal network and distribute mailers and postcards. Other strategies to consider: investing in a lead generation platform, like Zillow, and cold calling.
The goal here is to keep going, even when times are tough. There’s a reason the real estate industry has a high turnover rate, and that’s because a lot of agents give up when they experience a stale period in generating business. If you just stick with it and be ready, you’re bound to get your big break.
The core values we discussed on the show were that agents should maintain a very professional character on and off the job as you never know when you could meet a potential client. As licensed real estate agents in New York, we also have to abide by certain laws and ethics in our daily lives as well — honesty, for example, and being respectful of certain processes. Some other tips: Practice good time management skills, look polished and keep your wits about you.
Your clients will come to you with questions and advice on the market. Teach your clients what to expect from searching for a home to closing a transaction. Be mindful of their time, but also remember that your own time is very valuable. When your clients show signs of shopping around without a purpose, consider focusing more time on another client with more motivation. Also, think before you speak and remember that the home buying process can be an emotional one. Be understanding.
There are so many benefits to joining a team at a real estate firm. You will not only get to learn from experienced and successful agents, but also take on an automatic revenue stream, as these agents are already known in the industry and have developed a portfolio of clients. You will learn to avoid certain pitfalls and distinguish serious clients from not-so-serious ones. The time you save there alone is better spent on business practices that will help grow your business, like lead generation.
At MEIER, our Accelerator training program fosters a collaborative team environment where agents can learn from the successes and challenges other agents are facing. We do this to help bypass the steep learning curve and develop a more established presence as a team. After all, we encourage everyone at MEIER to assume the successes of our team as their own.
Be aware that it can take around four months for you to close your first transaction. Create a plan for two years with no income and standard business expenses. Also, make sure you dedicate time and a set budget for promoting and advertising your business. Joe had a nest egg, or as he likes to call it: a “transition fund.” Really grasp onto the fact that you’re starting a business and sometimes you will have to invest in it.
Be smart about your business and plan ahead. If you’re committed to the industry and love what you’re doing but just can’t get that first deal, you have to figure out what you can change to do more business. Some of the most successful results come from stepping outside of your comfort zone. Ask yourself the following questions:
Have any questions about the industry or looking for advice on your social media goals? Want to recommend someone you think could add value to our show? We’d love to hear from you! Contact us at Info@MeierRealEstate.com or visit our website at www.MichaelMeierNYC.com.

Multi-Award winning artist, Micky Cruz was born in Nicaragua, Central America, but his ancestry is Filipino and Mayan Indian. He was orphaned at the age of two when his family was killed in the Nicaraguan war in the late 1970s.
He then raised himself on the streets of Central America and Mexico. Micky is a self-taught musician and composer who writes and produces all of his own music. His musical career began at the age of seven as a survival tactic due to the conditions of a third world country. He never thought that music would become a full-time career but people enjoyed his voice so much that it seemed to be the natural thing to do.
Micky Cruz has performed extensively for many years in the USA as one of the premier acts taking the stage at the hottest clubs in the southwest , Casino nightclubs, and the big stages like Legends theatre and Las Vegas, Nevada. Micky Cruz is an award winning Latino musician having received the coveted Los 15 Grandes award several times in past years, including one in 2010! He has conducted many TV interviews, and well as several hits on Radio!
Micky's music is best described as Cumbia, Salsa, and Reggae with an interesting, refreshing twist where Micky has combined styles together and invented "Cumbegue" music. Totally unique, cumbegue music takes the best elements of cumbia-salsa-reggae and combines them into a very strong and danceable beat coupled with great melodic hooks and harmonies, then capped off with exciting soloing throughout the band.

There are still open spots for this year’s Root Tour to Korea! We have extended the registration deadline to Monday, March 18th.
The Roots Tour is a twelve-day guided tour through some of Korea’s most important cultural and historical destinations. It is a chance for Korean adoptees and their families to reconnect with Korea, broaden their understanding of Korean society, and observe its dynamic culture firsthand. An important part of the Tour is the opportunity for adoptive families to visit the SWS office and tour their facilities. Your family may have the opportunity to make arrangements to meet foster family and visit birthplaces. If your child was not adopted through the SWS, we will help you in making contact with the appropriate agency during your visit in Seoul.
This year’s Tour will take place from July 3rd to July 15th. Major destinations include Seoul, Busan, Seoraksan mountain, and Gyeongju, the historical capital city of Korea.
Prior to departure, there will be a full orientation for Tour participants. Homeland preparation sessions are also available to traveling families through the Adoption Resource Center here at Spence-Chapin.
If you are interested in participating in this year’s Tour, please visit the Summer Programs page and fill out the registration form. You can also contact Ben Sommers, the Korea Program Coordinator, at BSommers@spence-chapin.org
Spence-Chapin is proud to offer several opportunities for adult adoptees and adoptive families to visit Korea.
The programs available for adult adoptees include language study, volunteerism, and an exploratory immersion trip through SWS. Each of these programs provides a chance for adult adoptees to experience various aspects of Korean society and its unique cultural makeup.
Adoptive families can reserve their place on this summer’s Roots Tour, which takes adoptive families to three of Korea’s major cities as well as several beautiful historical landmarks along the way. The Roots Tour is a wonderful way for adoptive families to experience Korea with their children as it is a comprehensive tour of Korea’s most famous destinations. Families will also have the opportunity to visit SWS and meet with their staff. The chance to visit SWS helps to provide adoptees with an additional piece of the framework through which to understand their adoption.
If you are interested in learning more about the 2013 summer programs available through Spence-Chapin, visit us online.

When Erin Cerise steps off her plane in Christchurch, New Zealand, she is focused intently on her mission: do something unique that will erase the mess she made of her life on her 17th birthday. She’s already lost her swim team captainship, her boyfriend Ben, and her reputation. Her mother is certain studying abroad will regain Erin’s chances of a good future. Once Erin sees her uninspiring host family and city, though, she’s not so sure.
Before Christchurch, Erin wasn’t always intense and focused. Years ago, a mission sounded like a fun adventure, and the only ivy she cared about was the stuff growing around her grandparents’ back porch at their peaceful Upper Peninsula home. When had her priorities gone upside down?
Now Erin balks at NZ’s itchy school uniforms, cold houses, and her hosts’ utter inability to pronounce her name correctly. Christchurch does boast amazing rock climbing, gorgeous scenery, and at least one guy who could make her forget Ben if she lets him. With months ahead of her, Erin slowly begins to draw on the years behind her, one step back into her memories at a time.

When you’re seriously delinquent on your tax payments, the IRS may go to extreme lengths to collect what it is owed. One common penalty for excessive back taxes is wage garnishment. The government may withhold a portion of your monthly wages to put toward your tax debt. While wage garnishment will put you on the path toward IRS compliance, it can cause financial hardship. Without complete use of each paycheck, you might find it difficult to pay your rent and utilities, buy groceries, and generally care for yourself and your family.
Luckily, Taxation Solutions, Inc. is standing by to step in and help you stop wage garnishment and resolve other tax penalties. We’re the Milwaukee area’s best choice for effective tax help, tailoring our tax resolution services to your specific situation and circumstances.

We won’t rest until your tax problems are a distant memory. Ready to get started? Taxation Solutions, Inc. is just a phone call away!

Yearning for the days when work was falling from the sky into your lap? The new “normal” is a lean organization that has cut costs to the bone. Businesses that continue to provide the same services that are no longer in demand are starving to death. Reinventing your business is easy to say but what does it really mean?
I’ve found that many successful people are good at saying “NO”. Its what they refuse to do that opens the door to better opportunities. Directing time and resources toward more viable business prospects and away from “same old, same old” is a simple and effective strategy. Thought before action can help you choose what to do and what to avoid.
Constantly evaluate what defines and motivates your customers. First ask, “Do I want them as a customer?” What makes them a better customer? That’s the defining part. Study what your customers want. You can guess but its better to just ask them what they want. That’s the motivation part.
You are now armed with this the results from this process. You know who you want to do business with and how you might address their needs. Now the challenge that sets businesses apart is making your offer more attractive than anothers. That is if they even notice your offer.
Have you ever felt invisible? Have you ever stopped to figure out why you felt that way? Remember what successful people do, say no. Saying NO to what is keeping you invisible can help you become visible. Waiting for the phone to ring = invisible. Picking up the phone and with your pitch rehearsed start calling people you know. Now you are becoming visible. It does not happen overnight. It is a long road that discourages most people. Persistence in your tasks, in your beliefs, in your actions gets results. Re-evaluate your strategy and change direction if things appear to be stalled. Stay visible.
You are good at what you do. Give your desired customers a taste of what you can do for them. Give them free samples. Become valuable by providing what your customers want, when they want it, in as convenient a manner as possible. With persistence on your side you discover you have become both visible and valuable and are getting the work you want.
The selfish motive behind this post should be obvious to you now. If not, I’ll be blunt. If your business is starving it won’t do me any good. If your business improves we all win. I will have a better chance of working with you to help you make your business even better. Why? Because I have become visible and valuable to you.

A diagnosis of mental retardation is made if an individual has an intellectual functioning level well below average, as well as significant limitations in two or more adaptive skill areas. Intellectual functioning level is defined by standardized tests that measure the ability to reason in terms of mental age (intelligence quotient or IQ). Mental retardation is defined as an IQ score below 70–75. Adaptive skills is a term that refers to skills needed for daily life. Such skills include the ability to produce and understand language (communication); home-living skills; use of community resources; health, safety, leisure, self-care, and social skills; self-direction; functional academic skills (reading, writing, and arithmetic); and job-related skills.
Mental retardation varies in severity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition, text revision ( DSM-IV-TR ), which is the diagnostic standard for mental health care professionals in the United States, classifies four different degrees of mental retardation: mild, moderate, severe , and profound . These categories are based on the person's level of functioning.
Approximately 85% of the mentally retarded population is in the mildly retarded category. Their IQ score ranges from 50–70, and they can often acquire academic skills up to about the sixth-grade level. They can become fairly self-sufficient and in some cases live independently, with community and social support.
About 10% of the mentally retarded population is considered moderately retarded. Moderately retarded persons have IQ scores ranging from 35–55. They can carry out work and self-care tasks with moderate supervision. They typically acquire communication skills in childhood and are able to live and function successfully within the community in such supervised environments as group homes .
About 3–4% of the mentally retarded population is severely retarded. Severely retarded persons have IQ scores of 20–40. They may master very basic self-care skills and some communication skills. Many severely retarded individuals are able to live in a group home.
Only 1–2% of the mentally retarded population is classified as profoundly retarded. Profoundly retarded individuals have IQ scores under 20–25. They may be able to develop basic self-care and communication skills with appropriate support and training. Their retardation is often caused by an accompanying neurological disorder. Profoundly retarded people need a high level of structure and supervision.
The American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) has developed another widely accepted diagnostic classification system for mental retardation. The AAMR classification system focuses on the capabilities of the retarded individual rather than on his or her limitations. The categories describe the level of support required. They are: intermittent support; limited support; extensive support , and pervasive support . To some extent, the AAMR classification mirrors the DSM-IV-TR classification. Intermittent support, for example, is support that is needed only occasionally, perhaps during times of stress or crisis for the retarded person. It is the type of support typically required for most mildly retarded people. At the other end of the spectrum, pervasive support, or life-long, daily support for most adaptive areas, would be required for profoundly retarded persons. The AAMR classification system refers to the "below-average intellectual function" as an IQ of 70–75 or below.
The prevalence of mental retardation in North America is a subject of heated debate. It is thought to be between 1%–3% depending upon the population, methods of assessment, and criteria of assessment that are used. Many people believe that the actual prevalence is probably closer to 1%, and that the 3% figure is based on misleading mortality rates; cases that are diagnosed in early infancy; and the instability of the diagnosis across the age span. If the 1% figure is accepted, however, it means that 2.5 million mentally retarded people reside in the United States. The three most common causes of mental retardation, accounting for about 30% of cases, are Down syndrome, fragile X, and fetal alcohol. Males are more likely than females to have MR in a 1.5:1 ratio.
Low IQ scores and limitations in adaptive skills are the hallmarks of mental retardation. Aggression, self-injury, and mood disorders are sometimes associated with the disability. The severity of the symptoms and the age at which they first appear depend on the cause. Children who are mentally retarded reach developmental milestones significantly later than expected, if at all. If retardation is caused by chromosomal or other genetic disorders, it is often apparent from infancy. If retardation is caused by childhood illnesses or injuries, learning and adaptive skills that were once easy may suddenly become difficult or impossible to master.
In about 40% of cases, the cause of mental retardation cannot be found. Biological and environmental factors that can cause mental retardation include:
I always advise every couple to prevent child birth with mental retardation. If you take proper care you can prevent it.
2.. I advise every couple to follow healthy food to minimize your body consumption and sufficient oxygen to your unborn child's brain development.
Eating a Healthy food like Vegetables, Grains, pulses,fruits etc... in pregnancy will help you to get all the vitamins and minerals you need. There are some vitamins and minerals that are especially important. It is best to get vitamins and minerals from the food you eat, but when you are pregnant you will need to take some supplements as well. Do not take vitamin A supplements, or any supplements containing vitamin A, as too much could harm your baby. You can get supplements from pharmacies and supermarkets, or your doctor may be able to prescribe them for you. If you want to get your folic acid or vitamin D from a multivitamin tablet, make sure that the tablet does not contain vitamin A (or retinol). 12...

While 96 per cent of pregnant women surveyed were aware of general nutritional recommendations for them, only 12 per cent were aware of iodine-specific advice. Unborn children and young infants are entirely reliant on their mother for iodine supply, making babies and pregnant or lactating mothers the most vulnerable group of the population.
The study estimated the median intake of iodine during pregnancy was 190 micrograms per day, with 74 per cent consuming less than the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended intake of 250 micrograms daily. "Women aren't receiving the message about the importance of iodine in pregnancy, meaning they cannot make informed choices to ensure they get the amount they require," said Dr Emilie Combet, who led the research at the University of Glasgow.
Listeria infection in pregnancy often goes unnoticed due to lack of awareness. For the study, four pregnant rhesus macaques were fed doses of the listeria comparable to what one might encounter in contaminated food. According to the results published in the journal mBio, none of the monkeys showed obvious signs of infection before their pregnancies came to abrupt ends. But the tissue samples taken after each monkey experienced intrauterine fetal death, the researchers concluded that listeria had invaded the placenta (an organ which connects fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake) as well as the endometrium, the lining of the uterus. Researchers believe that the inflammation caused by the maternal immune response to the fast-moving listeria also affects the placenta, keeping it from protecting the fetus. The results sugge…

With many of us living longer, it's important that we are financially prepared for the possibility of requiring long-term care. Traditional health insurance and Medicare do not cover the costs of many long-term care services, such as services in your home, personal care, as well as care in a variety of facility and community settings. Long-term care insurance, on the other hand, will cover the costs of long-term care services. It can help protect your assets by providing daily or monthly payments to cover the costs associated with home health, assisted living, or nursing home care, which are the leading cause of bankruptcy in seniors.
We represent the top long-term care insurance companies in the country and are committed to providing you with coverage that best meets your needs.
Just when you thought, "it can't happen to me," consider this: 3 in 10 workers entering the workforce today will become disabled before retiring.
Over 36 million Americans are classified as disabled; about 12% of the population. More than 50% of those disabled Americans are in their working years, from 18 – 64. Maniaci Insurance Services can help you select a long term disability plan, providing you with income replacement if you experience an illness or injury. The coverage can help with every day bills, such as mortgage or rent, that continue when you can't work – expenses that health insurance won't cover.
For many Americans, retiring in this new century is a mystery. Individuals are living longer, more active lives. Getting started today will help you put time on your side. We offer a simple, bottom-line approach to developing a retirement solution.

The North Carolina State AFL-CIO released the following statement from President James Andrews in response to yesterday’s ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in Chicago that football players at Northwestern University qualify as employees under federal law and are thus eligible to form a union.
“This is a historic victory for college athletes everywhere, including here in North Carolina, where they generate tremendous wealth for college athletics programs and conferences that have treated them as little more than assets.
“That ends now, as it should, because the simple fact of the matter is that the only ones in the NCAA not getting paid are the athletes who make it all possible. It is greed and exploitation, pure and simple.
“College athletes have legitimate interests at stake – including the safety of their sports, providing medical care for injuries, keeping their scholarships, and graduating with a quality education. Simple fairness should dictate that they have the right to organize to defend and advocate for those interests.”
Brian Bennett writing for ESPN.com said that NLRB Regional Director Peter Ohr “cited the players’ time commitment to their sport and the fact their scholarships were tied directly to their performance as reasons for granting them union rights.”
“This ruling is a tremendous victory, not just for the athletes at Northwestern, but ultimately for all college athletes, many of whom generate tens of millions of dollars each year for their institutions, yet still are in constant danger of being out on the street with one accident or injury.”
College Athletes Professional Association (CAPA) President Ramogi Huma told ESPN.com that “the NCAA invented the term student athlete to prevent the exact ruling that was made today.”
“For 60 years, people have bought into their notion that they are students only. The reality is, players are employees and today’s ruling confirms that. The players are one giant’s step closer to justice.”
Until now, decision-making in college athletics has been largely the domain of coaches, athletic departments, and the athletic conferences to which colleges and universities belong.
Now thanks to this decision by the NLRB, college athletes will have the right to get organized and have their voices heard as well. College athletics can only be made stronger by giving voice to the athletes who make it all possible.

Bitcoin mining is the process through which bitcoins are released to come into circulation. Basically, it involves solving a computationally difficult puzzle to discover a new block, which is added to the blockchain, and receiving a reward in the form of few bitcoins. The block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009; it decreases every four years. As more and more bitcoins are created, the difficulty of the mining process – that is, the amount of computing power involved – increases. The mining difficulty began at 1.0 with Bitcoin's debut back in 2009; at the end of the year, it was only 1.18. As of April 2017, the mining difficulty is over 4.24 billion. Once, an ordinary desktop computer sufficed for the mining process; now, to combat the difficulty level, miners must use faster hardware like Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), more advanced processing units like Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), etc.
Volatility. This very reason many speculators are attracted to Bitcoin is the same reason many potential users are hesitant to get involved. Users that look at Bitcoin as a speculative investment option are essentially gambling on the process, and the future price of Bitcoin is largely unknown. There are estimates that Bitcoin will both be worth pennies in a few years, while some predict that a single bitcoin will be worth $500k in three years. As new investors continue to invest and the market cap grows, Bitcoin’s price could become more stable.
Bitcoin's price is also quite dependent on the size of its mining network, since the larger the network is, the more difficult – and thus more costly – it is to produce new bitcoins. As a result, the price of bitcoin has to increase as its cost of production also rises. The Bitcoin mining network's aggregate power has more than tripled over the past twelve months.
The concept of a virtual currency is still novel and, compared to traditional investments, Bitcoin doesn't have much of a longterm track record or history of credibility to back it. With their increasing use, bitcoins are becoming less experimental every day, of course; still, after eight years, they (like all digital currencies) remain in a development phase, still evolving. "It is pretty much the highest-risk, highest-return investment that you can possibly make,” says Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group, which builds and invests in Bitcoin and blockchain companies.
By December, Bitcoin was on track to hit its all-time high thanks to a dramatic and steady increase in price. On Dec. 17, 2017, it reached $19,783.21, the all-time high that has yet to be broken. Unfortunately, that high was followed by a drop of about 30 percent, with a market correction that brought it down to under $11,000. The price did recover, reaching $16,000 again on Dec. 27.

Venture capitalists, such as Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, which invested US$3 million in BitPay, do not purchase bitcoins themselves, but instead fund bitcoin infrastructure that provides payment systems to merchants, exchanges, wallet services, etc.[150] In 2012, an incubator for bitcoin-focused start-ups was founded by Adam Draper, with financing help from his father, venture capitalist Tim Draper, one of the largest bitcoin holders after winning an auction of 30,000 bitcoins,[151] at the time called "mystery buyer".[152] The company's goal is to fund 100 bitcoin businesses within 2–3 years with $10,000 to $20,000 for a 6% stake.[151] Investors also invest in bitcoin mining.[153] According to a 2015 study by Paolo Tasca, bitcoin startups raised almost $1 billion in three years (Q1 2012 – Q1 2015).[154]
Legal Gray Area. Major governments have largely remained on the sidelines, and this has created both a sense of potential and apprehension for Bitcoin proponents and critics respectively. Bitcoin isn’t backed by a regulatory agency and a government would technically be ceding power by supporting a decentralized currency. This has been largely officially unaddressed. Bitcoin’s price, however, tends to be very sensitive to any news concerning the US government’s opinion of cryptocurrencies. For example, when the SEC denied the approval of bitcoin-based exchange-traded-products—essentially bitcoin-backed assets on the stock market—in 2017, Bitcoin’s price dropped 18%. Yet while the price and adoption of Bitcoin would be affected by government action, governments are unable to criminalize Bitcoin. In fact, governments such as the United States and China have invested in it at some capacity.
Bitcoin’s first mover advantage, popularity, and network effect has cemented it as the most popular cryptocurrency with the largest market cap. Rivals like Litecoin may have numerous technical advantages over Bitcoin’s algorithm (see more about that here), but they only hold a fraction of Bitcoin’s market cap and their dwindling communities largely consist of loyalists, speculators, and antagonistic anti-Bitcoin buyers.
If fewer people begin to accept Bitcoin as a currency, these digital units may lose value and could become worthless. There is already plenty of competition, and though Bitcoin has a huge lead over the other 100-odd digital currencies that have sprung up, thanks to its brand recognition and venture capital money, a technological break-through in the form of a better virtual coin is always a threat.
Speculation drives numbers. Many Bitcoin users are holding onto their bitcoins in hopes of selling them off for an enormous profit one day. With news articles portraying Bitcoin millionaires as lucky kids who got in early, you can’t really blame them. For example, if you had spent your $5 latte money on 2,000 bitcoins one morning in 2010, they would be worth about $5.4 million today. Makes you really wish you’d managed your Starbucks budget better, doesn’t it?

Football fans in Lagos had a fulfilled day as they were offered a rare chance to watch a match with Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry, at the Landmark Event Center courtesy of Guinness Nigeria PLC.
When asked who was the best African player he played with while at Arsenal, Henry picked Kanu Nwankwo. He explained that Papilio’s technical ability stands him out.
“Don’t forget about Lauren I also love his game but when it comes to techniques I will give it to Kanu. I am not saying this because I am in Nigeria even if I was in another country I will say same. Kanu was very good, but he is underrated, he is so humble, nice guy, you never hear any bad thing coming from him, just positive things,” Henry told journalists on Sunday.
The Arsenal legend said he was thrilled with his maiden visit to Nigeria. He commended the huge interest in football by Nigerians.
“I first learned about Nigeria when some players came over to play in the French League like Victor Ikpeba and the late Stephen Keshi. Then I saw them at the USA 1994. I think Nigeria is a nice place and I am here to enjoy myself with the fans,” Henry stated.
The French striker also played for clubs like Monaco, Barcelona, and Juventus, but his time in London is fondly remembered across the world.

The Africa Head of the Royal Commonwealth Society John Apea has welcomed the readmission of Gambia into the Commonwealth.
Mr Apea believes the return of Gambia is a testament to the Commonwealth’s commitment to democracy, equality and rule of law.
Gambia under its former leader Yahya Jammeh pulled out of the Commonwealth in 2013, describing it as a neo-colonial institution.
With a new leader, Adama Barrow in place, the West African country is seeking to rebuild stronger ties with the international community and with institutions which had a strained relationship with Gambia as a result of the despotic leadership of Jammeh.
Reiterating the relevance of the Commonwealth to the current generation of leaders across the world, the Africa Head of the Royal Commonwealth Society said the share numbers of members within the Commonwealth provides a great opportunity for networking between member states.
Ahead of the Commonwealth biannual get together in April 2018, John Apea has written a piece reiterating the importance of the Commonwealth.
“There is a practical and ethical imperative – despite differences in terms of geographic proximity and/or economic development levels – to discuss the possibility of enhanced formal intra-Commonwealth economic and trade cooperation,” he said.

Support sought for, NO PIPELINE Benefit Concert By Peggy Mackenzie On Sunday, June 14, a No Pipeline Benefit Concert has been organized to bring needed support to oppose the Mountain Valley Pipeline&apos;s planned route through Monroe County. Much of the organized opposition to the route centers on the perceived threat it poses to the pristine springs of Pe- ters Mountain. Described by hydro- geologist Rick Eades as "the most challenging portion of the pipeline's path in the state," this benefit concert seeks to support an important cause for all Monroe Countians. The concert, which will run from 2 to 5 p.m., will be held at the gra- cious Salt Sulphur Springs Resort, just three miles south of Union on Route 219. A great lineup of music is prepared to entertain, including Rush Run Philharmonic, Squawkin' Henry, Robin & Doug, and Hans Creek String Band. Be ready to en- joy a range of music, from country, folk and bluegrass to Americana har- monies and blues in a beautiful set- ting at the resort. Stuart's Smoke House will supply smoked brisket, burgers, hot dogs and pulled pork. A bake sale will fill that sweet tooth with homemade goodies, iced tea and lemonade. Sweet Springs Water will also be available. Pipeline information and maps will be on hand for disbursal. Donations appreciated.

The characters, with their cold de- termination and cut-throat attitudes, prove to be interesting roles for the actors. "I love Roxie because she is hope- ful, gritty, has so much gall and is determined to find happiness," said Lilly Tobin, who will portray the ambitious murderess Roxie Hart. The two leading ladies of Chi- cago are based on Belva Gaertner and Beulah Annan who were on trial for murder in the 1920s. Prominent lawyers William Scott Stewart and W.W. O'Brien were the inspiration for Billy Flynn, the smooth talker hired to free the accused murder- esses. Reporter]X, laurine Dallas Wat- kins covered both murder trials for the Chicago Tribune and wrote the play Chicago in 1926. Bob Fosse, Fred Ebb and John Kander adapted Watkins' work into a musical. They modeled the show after vaudeville acts or characters. The music they created and their ad- aptation of Watkins' play truly stand the test of time; Chicago has been entertaining audiences ever since its first performance in 1975. Kim Morgan Dean has been pre- paring for her role as Velma Kelly by learning as much as she can about the man who made Chicago what it is today. "Chicago has such a distinct style so I spent time researching its direc- tor/choreographer/ co-author Bob Fosse. He had such a specific vision for this musical, and the choices he made inform so much of how the material is handled even today," said Morgan Dean.

On accomplishing additional analysis in the Fagor line I notice I was not even finding up to appropriate tension though using it. I place the Fagor on most affordable heat setting right away once the indicator pops up, I never ever waited for steam, and I by no means have steam coming out on the tension cooker while it truly is cooking when I thought it was at tension. My recipes seemed to normally cook great nevertheless- I created the clam chowder twice previously (it absolutely was astounding!
November 19, 2010 at eleven:fifty nine pm Canning is good, storing rice, beans and various staples are excellent. But Let's say You will need to go away you house or the area quickly?

Because the boy scouts say, “Be Prepaired” and equilibrium your food items storage solutions looking at all senarios.
For any person who has not tried this, canning meat is truly the simplest canning you might do. The jars would not have to become sterilized initial Whilst I do run them from the dishwasher just to be sure that they're clean. The flavor of canned meats is luscious - moist and tender. Quickly foods of the very best good quality!
Kellene, you gave me the courage to can meat And that i thanks. But I anxiety I did anything Improper. I made use of wide mouth pint jars, sterilized and heated, full of meat, added barely enough sizzling h2o to fill and processed to the required 90 min at 15# strain. My canner only retains 5 vast mouth jars and one of them was lying on its facet Once i opened the canner along with the h2o as well as other jars had been all greasy on the perimeters.
I'm in the identical posture as with regards to comprehending several of the science of strain cooking. My experience is quantity plays a large section. less air should have significantly less steam. Extra h2o will consider extended to succeed in stress. So it seems like a smaller Personal computer will arrive at pressure a lot quicker and launch faster.

I’m not aware of that recipe, but when it’s roux primarily based you can make the roux individually and add it later, to thicken.
Hi there, I've canned meat prior to and have never had any troubles. This very last time while, the chicken on one of the batches arrived out While using the broth a tiny bit brownish. the county extension Business calculated my psi being 13 on my canner.

Many thanks for sharing your unpublished analysis, Laura. I did try out pulling up the force valve this morning. Whew, big steam and hissing, out of the blue. I made a decision far more gradual release of steam isn't automatically a nasty factor. I’ll transfer my inquiry towards the Kuhn Rikon forum, as you suggest.
My issue pertains to the presto’s inferior ability to keep up tension. The fagor functions superbly, after I get it to strain I'm able to put it on the lowest heat placing and also the indicator will never fall. The stress indicator pops up effortlessly And that i am really confident it’s At pressure.
Another question. Is canned meat grey seeking? My husband would not like "grey" meat. I cooked some pork in the crock pot when, and he would not try to eat it since he didn't such as way it seemed. I'm certain he'd eat it rather then starve, but we are going to must rotate as a result click for more info of our inventory.
I am able to’t picture what it has to be like cooking more than a Stay fireplace while in the kitchen area even though I grew up having an old fashioned Wooden stove used day-to-day and from the kitchen. We didn’t make a roaring fire in it in the summer.
Laura, re the modest, 2-3 qt cookers: have you ever examined how considerably quicker they attain tension? ‘Coz I’m believing that – if some time preserving is substantial – These may very well be seriously handy for cooking dishes in minimum liquid, dishes that might scorch in the bigger pot.

UVA President James E. Ryan’s first major address departed from past practice in confronting last summer’s hate march on Grounds. Andrew Shurtleff
University of Virginia President James E. Ryan (Law ’92) is a distance runner, an eight-time Boston Marathoner, but he also moves fast.
On his first day in office he took a stand on the political controversy that prompted two history professors to sever ties with the Miller Center.
At the Board of Visitors’ annual August retreat, rounding out Week One on the job, the new president recited a heady to-do list for his first 100 days. It includes delivering a fully baked vision statement on which he wants to build a 10-year strategy.
Informing it will be his “Ours to Shape” listening campaign, for which Ryan had already done enough fact-finding to identify three recurring themes for discussion.
“I had eight months of transition,” he explained at the Board retreat. “I was also on the faculty here for 15 years. So, it seemed to me inappropriate to show up and just ask an open-ended question of, ‘Well, what would you like to see at UVA, and what should we be doing better?’”
Within his first two weeks, Ryan took on last August’s neo-Nazi torch march on the Academical Village. Using the anniversary for his first major address as president, he took two marked departures from past practice. He made a point to acknowledge that two of the organizers were alumni, and he apologized to the students who had been terrorized on the Rotunda’s north terrace without police intervention. Said Ryan, “We do nothing more than recognize our common humanity to say to those who were attacked around the statue last year: I am sorry. We are sorry.”
Getting down to business, Ryan has made a series of personnel moves, accomplishing most of that work, too, before taking office. At the Board retreat he buttoned up hiring approvals for two of the three executive vice presidents who run the University—Mary Elizabeth “Liz” Magill (Law ’95) to be the chief academic officer (the provost) and Jennifer “J.J.” Wagner Davis as chief operating officer.
As provost, Magill will be Ryan’s second in command. The two have lived their adult lives in parallel. Both graduated from Yale in 1988. Both have UVA law degrees, though hers came three years later than his, after she worked on the Hill for her home state’s U.S. Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.). Both clerked at the U.S. Supreme Court, Magill for Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Ryan for William H. Rehnquist, also three years apart.
They spent 14 years together on the UVA law faculty, where Magill had provost-like responsibilities as vice dean. She left in 2012 to become Stanford University’s law dean, one year before Ryan left for his Harvard University deanship. Both were rumored as prospects to succeed UVA President Emerita Teresa A. Sullivan.
Davis will start as COO by Jan. 1. She’s wrapping up five-plus years as George Mason University’s senior vice president for administration and finance. She held a similar position at the University of Delaware, following her tenure as director of Delaware’s Office of Management and Budget. She grew up in Virginia and earned undergraduate political science and graduate policy analysis degrees from Pennsylvania State University. She will succeed Patrick D. Hogan, UVA COO since 2012.
Ryan has formed a high-powered support team, starting with Chief of Staff Margaret Grundy (Col ’06, Darden ’15). She left the business world to join the Student Affairs office six years ago, spending the last two as chief of staff to Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer Patricia M. Lampkin (Educ ’86). While on staff, the former Jefferson Scholar earned an MBA here and an education doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania.
To see big ideas followed through, Ryan created a post for education consultant Margot M. Rogers (Law ’92, Grad ’92), who takes the title of special presidential adviser for strategic initiatives. Rogers served as chief of staff to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and, before that, was a deputy director at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
To craft his messaging, Ryan recruited Kyle O’Connor (Col ’08), a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama and, more recently, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. For digital communications, Ryan brought with him from the Harvard Graduate School of Education Matt Weber, its Emmy Award-winning multimedia director.
One headline from the organizational changes is that UVA will have its first women as provost and COO. The bigger story may be the ascendance of the law school in University affairs. The University’s board chair (the rector), president, incoming provost and strategy czar all took law degrees here. So did the development chief, following Ryan’s earlier positioning of mentor and former Law Dean John C. Jeffries Jr. (Law ’73) over the Advancement Office and the upcoming capital campaign.
Law school or not, the moves repopulate the leadership ranks with UVA alumni. Until Ryan’s arrival, none of the recent top academic officers—from president to provost to the deans of the schools—had gone to school here, except Dean of Libraries John M. Unsworth (Grad ’88).
Ryan reported some 15 top-level hires at the Board retreat, and he’s only getting started. On that 100-day to-do list are searches to fill previously announced vacancies for Batten School dean, School of Nursing dean and chief diversity officer.
In August, Tommye S. Sutton became UVA’s chief of police, replacing Mike Gibson, who’d held the title for 13 years. Sutton, 40, came to UVA from Northwestern University, where he was the deputy chief of police. He brings more than a decade of law enforcement experience to Grounds.
In mid-June, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam appointed C. Evans Poston Jr. (Darden ’17) to UVA’s Board of Visitors. Poston, who has worked as Norfolk’s commissioner of the revenue since 2014, replaces John G. Macfarlane III (Darden ’79). Gov. Northam also reappointed Rector Frank M. “Rusty” Conner III (Col ’78, Law ’81) as well as members Barbara J. Fried (Grad ’04) and Dr. L.D. Britt (Col ’72).
Congratulations to James Ryan from those of us as far away as Australia. His plan is impressive and suggests good things ahead for the University. The choices of Provost and COO are excellent and indicate that sound people are being chosen to implement the strategy. Give this some time and we will all be proud of what is being achieved. (Darden, Class of 77)
As an alumnus of the Darden School, Class of 1969, I am disappointed that President Ryan has hired Mr. O’Conner, a former speech writer for former President Obama. In my opinion, when serious historians examine the Obama Administration fifty years from now, they will conclude that it was the most corrupt and incompetent administration in the last 100 years. To have an individual with a connection to that administration as part of the leadership of the University of Virginia is very troubling to me.
I think President Ryan will be a credit to the University. I wrote him a note welcoming him, and recommending a couple of excellent books (I remembered he is an avid reader) and despite a no doubt hectic schedule he took time to reply. Best to you, Sir.
and moving. a man of actions , not just words. Thomas Jefferson would be honored. Jefferson, a man who appears to never had idol feet and did not speak without knowledge.

After the passing of Stanley Pranin, founder of Aikido Journal, we organized a survey to get to know the aikido community better and learn more about its priorities. We’ll soon share more data, but the community voiced a clear interest in putting more focus on addressing important challenges facing the world of aikido today. One such issue is the perception of aikido in the broader martial arts world.
When asked to identify the biggest problem or challenge faced today as an aikido practitioner or instructor, 40% of almost 700 open-ended responses focused on relevance, effectiveness, and the perception of aikido by the public. The community listed a number of important challenges but this theme was overwhelming in its dominance.
I was recently contacted by Roy Dean who had concerns that resonated closely with the aikido community’s survey responses. He’s a Brazilian jiu jitusu instructor who was the first aikido shodan to ever receive a black belt in BJJ. (If you’d like to see Roy’s jiu jitsu, you can watch his 3rd degree black belt test here.)
On the occasion of the passing of Stanley Pranin, Roy found himself contemplating the future of aikido. Believing public interest in aikido is declining, Roy reflected on an episode of The Joe Rogan Podcast in which aikido was discussed.
In 2015, Joe Rogan hosted a guest on his podcast who engaged in a discussion about the art of aikido. The guest, a cognitive neuroscientist, was invited onto Rogan’s show to talk about his work in enhancing cognitive performance. Near the end of the show, the conversation transitioned to the art of aikido (the guest was a practitioner).
While the guest showed enthusiasm, he was ill-equipped to discuss the art with a host who has a lifelong passion for the martial arts and decades of experience in the competitive martial arts world. Rogan, a BJJ black belt, left the interview skeptical of aikido, its relevance, and its effectiveness. The Joe Rogan podcast has 16 million monthly downloads. It’s clear this was not a victory for the world of aikido. If you’d like to see the dialogue, start this video at 2:30:00.
Roy believes the art of aikido is dying. Moved by the passing of Stanley Pranin, he felt motivated to produce a video to serve as an open letter to Joe Rogan. He wants to go on the Joe Rogan podcast and talk about aikido as a proponent of the art. He’s asked me to join him on the show should Rogan wish to have a second conversation about aikido.
I believe Roy speaks honestly, from a place of respect and love for the art of aikido. You may not agree with all of Roy’s points, but I believe all aikidoka should watch his 6 minute video and reflect on his perspective.
Roy sees the art of aikido at a critical inflection point. He believes that any martial art will become increasingly diluted with each passing generation unless there’s a movement to employ the scientific method to rediscover effectiveness. Roy thinks now is the time for aikido to engage in this endeavor. He believes aikido has a great deal to offer the martial arts world and wants to see it become as successful, relevant, and valuable to the martial arts world as possible.
This quest to revitalize the practice and teaching of aikido has increasingly shaped the direction of Ikazuchi Dojo over the last few years. With Matsuoka Sensei as a role model, we’ve embraced the difficult and often painful process of “rediscovering effectiveness”, not only with our technique, but with instructional methods and dojo management.
Being realistic about the strengths and limitations of the art (and our own capabilities) has freed us to focus on how we can make aikido more relevant, valuable, and effective: more effective as a self-defense system; more effective as an experiential learning tool; more effective as a movement performance system; more effective as a health practice.
We’ve committed ourselves to self-criticism, sincerely seeking advice from outside experts, and taking action to improve. We believe this effort has fueled our students’ enthusiasm, dedication, and development.
Just as important as the technical, instructional, and management improvements we’ve made are the friendships and mutual respect we’ve built throughout the broader martial arts community. We’ve received advice, support, and encouragement from leaders in arts such as kali, karate, tai chi, and now Brazilian jiu jitsu.
We’re not the only ones. There are many aikido dojos and instructors with great stories of exploration, innovation, and success. However, the aikido community is telling us that it’s not enough. Over 1,000 instructors and practitioners have spoken and overwhelmingly agree that more needs to be done to elevate the art. The consensus of the community is that it needs to focus on two things:
Becoming better at communicating with the public about the purpose, value, and story of aikido, and its place in the martial arts world.
Roy sees Stanley Pranin’s passing as an inflection point for the art of aikido. What do we do at this critical juncture?
Do we maintain the status quo? Do we slowly decline and gradually fade into obscurity? Or do we make a cultural shift to become our own harshest critics, examine the most important flaws in our technique, culture, and training methods, and take action to transform them?
Is it possible for a global aikido community to work together as a coordinated team to identify and solve the most pressing problems in the aikido world? Does the will exist in the community to allow this to happen? Can we build the communication and organizational infrastructure to make it happen?
I am Executive Editor of Aikido Journal and co-founder of Ikazuchi Dojo. I began my aikido journey in 1991 under Haruo Matsuoka and am honored to have been his direct disciple for the last 27 years.
I came to Aikido from another martial art. In that art I obtained a 4 th degree level. Now that I started over again and reached a Shodan level I have an appreciation for others opinion. The one topic that always gets me is politics and the power it has. Even in the beginning politics almost destroyed Aikido and it was over a difference of opinion. Let’s face it all martial arts will change. Traditions always fade in society. Aikido is no different. I had a quick disagreement with another student over how to tie a hakama. At the end I simply stated I am here for the art. Not some much for tradition. I feel that is aikido’s problem.
There are many techniques out there as there are Sensei’s. I realitythis is good. And that is the challenge in today’s fast past Aikido world. The days of spending hours in meditations in seize are coming to a end in my opinion.
Ego and politics are two things that have no place in Aikido, or other martial arts, but it seems as if misplaced passion sometimes turns into one of those.
Well put, we must allow Aikido to grow, therefore change. I respect the direction of the Ueshiba family and other senior teachers, but there must also be a grassroots change allowing influnce from other sources to create a revitalised Aikido.
Wonderful. This is a urgent topic in need of a unified and effective response, not only from yudansha in the American community, but throughout the various organizational hierarchy. Here is a link to a video response to this same JRE podcast a few years back addressing these same issues: https://youtu.be/jWXm0wEA13c
I am RokuDan in Daito-Ryu Aiki-Jujutsu , I have 52 years of training in 3 forms of Martial arts and have stayed with Aiki for the last 36 years.I make a living as a Bouncer , so trust me , it works .I invite Rogan to come to my Dojo and we shall see . I have an open mat policy , so what do you say Rogan?
I think all martial arts taught today have weaknesses in their systems. Gracie Torrance or Barra both have critical flaws to their systems. Fighting in the UFC ring is not the benchmark for survival on the street or battlefield. Having trained in several arts including Aikido, I understand what Joe Rogan is stipulating as a majority of Aikido practitioners that I have worked out with cannot go “toe to toe” with a BJJ practitioner, especially if the rules favor the BJJ practitioner. So does this mean the art is flawed?
I do not know if Aikido is dying in America as Roy Dean has stated but if it is then I would hold the Aikido community and it’s instructors to fault. It is the responsibility of the Aikido community to maintain it’s standards and self promotion. If Aikido is dying because it is not evolving, then maybe it should. Evolution in combat arts is a natural progression and history has shown the arts/styles that fail to evolve are no longer. That is the nature of things.
If you want evolution, practice a self defense system. Or if you want an art to evolve, found a new one with a new name. E.g. American Kempo etc.
I disagree, like the book Saotome wrote “Aikido and the harmony nature” nature is always changing, adapting, flowing, evolving never stagnate we shouldnt be either…based on that thought alone, aikido should change and adapt. If you want to preserve study a koryu or daito ryu.
Thank you very much for honoring the passing of Stanley Pranin. I first came into contact with Sensei Stan Pranin in the early 70’s while attending college in Monterey, California where he was giving a demonstration of Aikido. I had a strong back ground in gymnastics, Karate and Judo and after viewing and being called from the audience to participate in the demonstration by attacking Sensei Pranin it was at that moment when he threw me and pined me in a matter of seconds that my heart was opened or introduced to the amazing art of Aikido. I asked Stan after his demonstration to become one of his students and he accepted me and gave me his phone number and address and what time to attend my first work out. I was surprised to find that the dojo at that time was Stans two car garage with mat on a concrete floor. As the Aikido interest grew in Monterey the dojo moved into a larger building along with Stan who had given up his home to live in the new rather expensive dojo he created in Pacific Grove. The classes were two hours a day 7 days a week with a very dedicated group of students a lot of whom are still practicing to this day, people like Pat Hendrix and Tom Gamble had just started in the art, Stan was a 3rd degree black belt at that time. We were taught Japanese along with the history and beginning of Aikido which started out as Aikijutsu. Sensei’s Sunday classes were for weapons training, jo, bo and tanto. Stan’s teachings at that time stressed the importance of atemi to first separate the mind from the body in order to use an Aikido techniques. He also constantly pointed out that Aikido was created from bo (sword) techniques with a very strong jujutsu background the founder O’Sensei had before his enlightenment and creation of what we know as Aikido today. It was called several names before the war such as Aikijutsu, Aikibudo etc. After the war during martial law in Japan it was actually taught in secret and a person had to have an introduction and be at least a shodan in another art before they were allowed to start training in Aikido. I can tell story upon story but I need to cut this short so I don’t take up too much of your time. Sensei Pranin was such a dedicated teacher and student of the art it saddens me in one respect to learn of his passing but in another respect I know he is with O’Sensei and all the other great Aikidoist’s that have passed so he can truly say “Now I am the Universe”. Sensei had many teacher’s he admired in Aikido and several other martial arts but I did ask him one day that since he was a teacher now who did he consider his teacher is?? He just smiled and said O’Sensei. He followed O’Sensei through books and films along with others who had actually studied with him. He became the historian of the Art which he dedicated his life to.
Aikido is a way of harmonizing energy. It is silly to call it “unrealistic”. Individuals can be unrealistic and fighting in a cage in front of a cameras and a mob is not realistic, nor did it ever happened to me. I train aikido for almost 20 years and, thanks to aikido, I managed to avoid conflict more times than I can count. Few times conflict was inevitable, and thanks to specific aikido phylosophy and years of training nobody was seriously injured. As far as more realistic aikido (aiki-jutsu) technics,I recommend Serbian based Real Aikido style.
Joe Rogan, Roy Dean, Edward Glasheen, Ed Graney, Michael Tan and others have a valid point. I began my training in aikido in 1988. Since then, I’ve always heard from other people that aikido did not work.
As I continued my training, I discovered that my aikido needs to evolve – much like the other aikido masters (Senseis Chiba, Kanai, Saito, Nisho etc) – their styles of aikido are different from each other. They evolved. How do we know that these aikido masters stayed with tradition? Some did but others changed the aikido that O’Sensei showed them – just observe their style.
Aikido alone may or may not work but it all depends on the situation. Are we talking about aikido vs BJJ? Are we talking about Filipino Martial Arts vs BJJ? Are we talking about Aikido v Filipino Martial Arts (FMA)? Are we talking about just scoring points?
Let’s look at a scenario. Many people carry pocket knives. A BJJ practitioner gets into a fight and pulls guard. The person in the guard panics and pulls his knife out of his pocket and begins stabbing. Another scenario is an assailant pulls a knife or a machete, can aikidoka disarm the assailant who is wildly swinging at full speed.
Many of us have put in equity sweat on the mat. We’ve put in our time and continued to do so. We discover that training is a journey. For my journey in aikido, I decided that MY aikido needs to evolve to be effective. So, in 2008, I began my training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. A few years later, I also started training in FMA.
Now, most of my students cross-train in either Aikido and BJJ or Aikido and FMA. For over a decade now, I host an aikido seminar with an eye towards incorporating elements of BJJ and FMA.
Many aikido purists ridiculed and/or scoffed at the seminar. There are many aikido groups that are closed-minded. I advocate on cross-training on other martial art discipline and discover how it can contribute to the growth of my aikido skills. I was delighted to see a video of Ikazuchi Dojo hosting an FMA group. “Finally, another aikido group is looking into FMA to understand aikido.” For my training, I’m discovering aikido’s limitations and its effectiveness through BJJ and FMA.
What Joe Rogan concluded in his interview stings. What Roy Dean said rings some truth in it. I asked myself “what am I prepared to do?” I put on a white colored belt and cross-trained in other arts to discover and begin to understand the ever changing landscape of the martial arts world and how my aikido can stay relevant.
Thank you so much for your input and support. I think you’re showing great leadership, not just in your dojo, but in the broader martial arts community. We are proud to have you contributing to the discussion.
“They did a tremendous amount of work in their lifetime being able to disseminate information to their students.”
Being a champion IS a tremendous amount of work. The aikido pioneers truly did champion the art throughout the world, often giving up their homes to carry and plant the tree of aikido on foreign soil. Being a champion is rarely a part-time avocation. Did the tree bear fruit? Undoubtedly, even if most of it fell to the ground and spoiled or was eaten by the birds and bugs, there are new trees growing to take the place of the old.
Not only does each generation need to rediscover effectiveness and relevance, each student (especially those who would also teach) must individually rediscover effectiveness and relevance. That is learning the art. Without that, we are learning an aikido-shaped shadow-dance.
I do think if we are to have a global conversation within and without the art form, we must be clear on what we mean by the words “effectiveness” and “relevance”. I think that while O’sensei talked long about the spiritual significance of his art, his students who went to pick fights with the dock workers may not have been finding it relevant even as they were discovering their own conception of effective.
Cage fighting MMA, nor boxing, nor any other art gets to automatically claim more relevance, or effectiveness, than another art. The “art” is in the teaching, and the learning, and the practice. The “effectiveness” is in the individual. No match,or contest, or fight, or critical defensive situation is art-on-art. It is always individual on individual (or small group). The art does not bleed, only the individual bleeds. That is why contests never end, there is always the next match, there is always a next champion.
Aikido will live while there are dedicated people to carry the art into their lives, to champion it, to disseminate it to others. It will struggle if it tries to sublimate its own art for the art of another and compete on a field shaped by a different set of values.
Aikido is not designed to be a cage fighting sport, and it has no need to move that direction. The aikido world is huge and effectiveness should be considered from the perspective of self-defense, but also from other perspectives as well – as a self-improvement system, etc. Even from the perspective of us becoming more effective at teaching and communicating about the art.
Same thing with relevance. As long as we aikidoka understand the strengths and limitations of our art, we will be better able to communicate to others how aikido’s strengths and areas of specialization deliver relevant applications, whether in the form of a martial art focused on asymmetric threats (multiple attackers, a larger attacker, etc.) or even in terms of using it to teach falling or as an experiential learning tool.
I think the more we can move the conversation away from apples to oranges comparisons and more towards understanding the context and respective applications and tactical basis for various arts, the better off we will be and the better aikido can serve everyone. Thanks for joining the conversation.
First of all thank you for honoring Pranin Sensei’s significant journalistic contribution to Aiki. Over the years I came to rely on him for historically accurate information about the way.
I find comparisons about martial arts and the overall dismissive attitude towards Aikido ludicrous. Of course Aikido is less than effective in the ring with mixed martial arts. Everything about that ring and those cameras and the drunk mob and the rules by which that sport is governed favor the style which founded it. And rightly so. O’Sensei found competition abhorrence and antithetical to the study if Aiki for a very good reason. Competition is diametrically opposed to the principles of Aiki.
O’Sensei and Takeda ysensei before him understood that the world simply did not require another codified system for destroying people. Instead with the world required was a method for improving people. Aikido is such a method. It combines Martial traditions, effective techniques and spiritual philosophy to provide a path for a lifelong pursuit of excellence and achievement. It incorporates cooperation, the one thing that makes us most human, and compassion for each other to facilitate self growth. It has the unique aspect of being applicable for people regardless of age or level of fitness and strength. That is an incredibly valuable attribute.
If you have personal security challenges go buy a had glock and a box of ammunition and train at a shooting range. If however you want to experience a deep sense of community, accelerated personal growth, spiritual enrichment And a connection with historical martial arts, than I invite you to study Aiki.
Thanks for your input and for joining the conversation. I for one, agree with you. I think there are too many apples to oranges comparisons between arts when it would be healthier and more productive to instead focus on understanding what each art specializes in and the context for its techniques and training methods.
I think that’s what Roy is trying to get at with his video and his conversation. Helping people understand that BJJ, MMA, etc. are designed for different purposes and instead of being directly compared to aikido (in the context of a cage or grappling match), we should better understand how aikido fits into the larger landscape of the martial arts world.
I also think you bring up an excellent point in that one huge value aikido provides to the martial arts world is a practice system that functions well with practitioners of any age, large or small.
I think talking with Joe Rogan about aikido is a good idea, but as an avid listener of his podcast, the many of the arguments presented in this thread are unlikely to get our man a place at the table. Joe Rogan, and much of his audience, are steeped in MMA history and equate “effectiveness” with “having been tested against all comers”. Therefore, in my view, the persuasive argument to get a seat at the table isn’t about how effective sankyo can be, but rather how aikido could fit into the making people who are masters of multiple martial arts better fighters.
If I think about the evolution of mma as a continuous test against all comers, it looks sort of like this: in gen 1(submission grappling movement), bjj dominated because most people couldn’t defend takedowns and those that could, went to the ground by choice and for the most part lost via various submissions. In gen 2 (wrestle-boxing movement), everyone learned the basics of submission wrestling and bjj, allowing top-level kickboxers of various styles a chance to start knocking out pure grapplers who never learned high level striking. In Gen 3 (movement movement), the latest generation, everyone is an expert grappler or striker, and also proficient in whichever platform they aren’t an expert with the differentiating factor between an elite fighter and an great fighter being, more often than not, their ability to flow efficiently between techniques and ranges.
In my opinion, mma is still in gen 2 for the most part, as the majority of current fighters are still wrestle-boxers, albeit extremely high-level. It won’t be until the ability to expertly flow between attacking and defending across all the ranges is a prerequisite that gen 3 mma will truly exist. Aikido excels at teaching fighters how to flow with attacks and move effectively between ranges. It is in helping to usher in the next generation of mma, that aikido can stay relevant in the public conversation about “effective fighting”.
Fantastic feedback and guidance. I’m going to share this directly with Roy via email. The insight and perspective of your comment is unique among the hundreds of conversation threads we’ve seen on this article.
You make some great points. In fact many of the responses here make great arguments. The irony of this whole thing is that aikido is supposed to be the next step in a person’s jujitsu. It is a concept of jujitsu of which their are many styles that emphasize different things. BJJ is really judo that emphasizes the wrestling. Other styles emphasize weapons, etc. But they all share the same basic techniques or throwing, projecting, taking down, striking and weapons (sword, knife, staff, baton) Aikido ‘techniques’ are your standard jujitsu techniques, with less emphasis on grappling, due to the danger of being killed or maimed during battle while wrestling on the ground with your opponent. There are number of videos that show what happens to soldiers and police officers while they try to wrestle a person in a combat situation. It is in the practice that makes the difference. O Sensei was known for taking on all comers. He could break your bones with his strikes, crush you wrist with his grip, project you a couple dozen feet, he was an expert in weapons, etc. And if you read his two instructional manuals, Atemi, or striking is supposed to be 70-80 percent of aikido techniques! And in his demonstrations, he was so stable, people could not grapple him or take him down standing or while on the ground! Remember, jujitsu and judo fights in O Sensei’s days were often lethal, or you got maimed. There is a reason that the top jujitsu, judo, karate, etc. students sought him out. He faced swordsman, marksmen, boxers, kick boxers, etc. He was a combat vet who trained special forces and dispatched bandits in the rugged wilderness of Hokkaido while carving out a community with his bare hands. There are no MMA fighters of this caliber or ability. One of the earlier posts mentioned the purpose of studying aikido and was correct, to paraphrase O Sensei, ‘aikido is not a method or vehicle for the destruction of others…’ so the conversation with Joe Rogan in regards to aikido was out of context. But, I think it would be important for a discussion to happen so that real practitioners of aikido who have crossed trained in other arts can give a fuller perspective on its effectiveness.
By the way, some of the Gracies are complaining about the effectiveness of BJJ and the way its practiced for sport verses self defense. The Jundokan Goju Ryu expelled many dojo a few years ago due to the difference between sport karate and tradition self defense. In Shin Gi Tai Jujitsu under John Saylor Sensei, you have to choose between the sport or self defense track as your focus. MMA is limited to rules just like BJJ which change the techniques and the effectiveness of the art. MMA students tend to wash out quickly because of injury and do not develop much martial skill, but usually are in great shape, tough, and willing to fight.Traditionally, this was called a white belt! It takes many years to develop into an athelete and there are consequences! Thai boxing, boxing, kickboxing, full contact karate, judo, jujitsu, MMA, etc all come at the cost of destroying your body and mind (brain). So their has always been a constant tug of war between what is and is not effective training. Traditional students no longer train good kicking/punching/grappling skills required in any effective martial art. Traditionally, in most disciplines, open challenges between students, schools, and strangers coming to schools to challenge was normal. This allowed you to constantly test and modify your art, regardless of its name or origin.
Lastly, and sorry this was so long….but their is aikido all over MMA. When you see clean, effortless technique, whether it was a strike, a perfect throw or takedown, smooth ground movement, effortless, flawless technique…this is aikido. Traditionally, top jujitsu practitioners like O Sensei in Daito Ryu Jujitsu, could demonstrate Aiki. So when you see fighters like Anderson Silva, you are seeing this concept demonstrated in MMA.
I don’t say much on this topic as to me the philosophy is a very personal journey, however, you heartfelt request compels me.
My personal view is the we need to firstly understand the nature of what is meant by “martial art”. A martial art is not about fighting….. in its crudest form, it is about achieving your outcome by succeeding your opponent.
The most raw and narrow example of this is, in hand to hand combat, submitting the opponent. The most complex example is politics. There is obviously many levels in between, graded on distance and effect on opponent, from obliteration to win-win.
Roy, as you have said, each has its arena, and only through an open approach to understanding each arts baseline (I.e. Minimum a Black belt with reputable Sensei) will you appreciate the real reason for each arts existence.
My personal journey is about developing my mind to be comfortable in conflict and reacting calmly to achieve a beneficial outcome. To develop an approach that blends during conflict rather than one that believes that having superior physical skills will achieve the best outcome.
Unfortunately, I also believe Aikido is on the wain, mainly due to societies evolution into a mindset of quick win, capatalistic, dog eat dog thinking. This approach is a disposable mindset which is very “effective” in the middle section of our lives for aggressive approaches to conflict, however, as we age and over the long term, it reduces its effectiveness due to many factors.
In general, I believe Western society, and it appears more recently, Eastern societies, are beginning to loose an understanding of the the big picture. This is cyclical. Read about the cycles of economic depressions aligning to the ages of those who lived through them. I feel that we need to bolster the rationale associated with the fundamentals of why the art exists and why it came to fruition.
It was born out of the need to find a viable alternative to physical conflict and fighting mind. By evolving from war era, an environment that was raw relating to physical conflict to hurt someone, to an training that used the physicality to represent an alternative to managing conflict.
His legacy may reduce in popularity over the short term, however as time does cycle, it will be there when society rediscovers the true nature and purpose of Aikido and what it was trying to achieve.
I applaud your passion surrounding Aikido and the message, however, We need to be very careful that we do not get drawn into a fight through ego to “prove” Aikido has a place. Let’s all take up Staleys lead and make sure that it’s true purpose is well understood so that its value amongst the “martial arts” is recognised.
Until the art of aikido embraces what Aiki-do was- with the power generation practices of is founder, Ueshiba- they will never, in this life time, understand what aiki-do was meant to be.
They know nothing of it’s one true treasure;unusual power: how a punch is devastating and measurably damaging over a normal person, how your balance is remarkable and makes you very difficult to take down, how you can be very difficult to lock up.
Aiki-do’s one true strength didn’t have a damn thing to do with ANY of is ridiculous techniques. This…is why Aikido is dead and increasingly irrelevant as a martial art in the modern world.
I travel the world teaching hundreds of Aikido teachers from sandan to shihan, in rooms with Bjj, MMA, Wing Chun, CMA, FMA people present.
Ueshiba- was known for unusual power. I have not met a single aikido teacher in the world who has any unusual power. So, for them Ueshiba’s aiki…do, is dead. They don’t have a single idea of What they are doing and how to correct it. Much less what they are missing.
Aikido’s technical syllabus is not the answer. It’s founder became a legend…for skills no longer present in the art.
Gotta agree here. I’ve been in Aikido 22 years and knew Pranin Sensei since the first Aiki-Expo. Its said that O’Sensei said that no one was doing “his” Aikido. It does seem with each generation/transmission/transition/division we keep losing something, and I agree its perhaps that unusual internal power. Very few people I have seen train with it or even know they are missing a valuable part of the art. Yet, Aikido like any thing else is subject to that normal bell-shaped distribution curve of some people not getting it, the majority getting to mid-range of technical competence, and only a few searching out more. But like Harden said, there does seem to be more and more Aikido teachers/practitioners acknowledging we don’t have it and are beginning to look for it and train in that direction … this give me some hope for future of Aikido … it will always be dead/unobtainable for some and for a very others it will be a destination that gives direction to the daily discipline …
I began aikido around 1970 in the UK. My teacher was a student of Shigeho Tanaka and affiliated to the Shiseikan Dojo in Tokyo. Since then I trained with K Chiba, M Kanai, M Kanetsuka and since moving to Japan, with the Aikikai instructor in Hiroshima. I am now independent and directly affiliated with the Aikikai.
I met Stanley Pranin many years ago, probably since coming to live in Hiroshima in 1980, and began writing for Aikido Journal. Stan and I became good friends and we used to meet regularly in Tokyo at the All-Japan Aikido Demonstration in May. Actually, one of the main reasons for going to this demonstration was to meet Stan and talk. On one occasion we interviewed Sadateru Arikawa in my hotel room after the demonstration, but it has never been published. Arikawa Sensei said it was “too soon.” Probably it is somewhere in the AJ archives. I got to know K Chiba quite well, well enough to have quite severe arguments and we often debated the ura side of aikido and aikido organizations.
Chiba Shihan strongly advised me not to come to Japan for aikido alone, so I taught English and later language philosophy at Hiroshima University in order to have an independent base for living here. This meant that I had to become fluent in Japanese, especially the written language, and this formed the opening to the study of Japanese history and culture. Before retiring I moved to another campus and taught comparative culture and rhetoric to Japanese company employees and government bureaucrats in the graduate school.
On one occasion Stan sent me the Budo volume, produced in 1938. He took the trouble to make a good photocopy of the Japanese original. The present Doshu had showed me the sole copy they had in the Aikikai archives.
I do not think that aikido is dying. However, it is certainly somewhat different from what was being taught in the Kobukan Dojo from 1931 onwards and I believe that World War II was a major watershed. Actually, I am in two minds about whether what was being taught in the prewar Kobukan Dojo was actually worth saving — and I think Kisshomaru Ueshiba saw this, also.
One way of putting this is that it has ceased to be a personal plaything of Morihei Ueshiba, who was up there on the floating bridge of heaven with his deities and pretty well remained there until he died.
I live in Hiroshima and this city is a very good location to study the shackles that have been imposed on the study of recent Japanese history and how the history influences local culture. I happen to be a director of the Atomic Bomb Museum, which is undergoing repairs, and have a ringside seat to watch the intellectual gymnastics undertaken by those who are deciding how much to present Japan’s militaristic past in the exhibits put on display.
The similarities with aikido are sometimes quite painful to see. Just as the Hiroshima government wants to emphasize the special uniqueness of Hiroshima as city dedicated to world peace, the Aikikai wants to emphasize the uniqueness of aikido as a ‘spiritual’ martial art, also dedicated to world peace etc etc.
I recently retired as Chairman of the IAF after 20 years in office and the great value of being in this organization for so long is that it has given me many insights about how a supposedly ‘spiritual’ martial art, dedicated to the ‘improvement’ of the individual and supposedly ‘non-cultural,’ in the sense that it can be practiced with benefit by anyone, regardless of gender and culture, has been transformed into a loose grouping of ‘national’ aikido cultures, each with a different view of what aikido should be. And these views are somewhat different.
So, though no criticism or offence is intended here, I think the discussion above is rather ‘American’ in tone, in the sense that it would leave most of my Japanese dojo members unmoved. Some members might remember the late Fred Wagstaff, who used to be the caretaker of Kanai Sensei’s New England Aikikai dojo in Cambridge. I gather that Fred used to go out to test his aikido on the street. If he did that here, he would soon be deported, or imprisoned if he was Japanese.
Of course, you can make judgments about this, such that aikido in Japan is atrophying or becoming a sham, or like a kabuki play, the implication being that aikido outside Japan is more ‘authentic’ as a martial art. However, for this debate to be of any value to my Japanese dojo members, I think we need to be more precise and define a few terms more precisely.
You’ve raised some very good points of cultural distinctions that are by and large assigned to Aikido by the Japanese. I think it equally important to question why anyone should care what the Japanese have assigned to define an art who’s majority membership exists “outside of Japan?”
The same can be said for many cultural practices that have been transported outside of their original cultural underpinnings. Case in point-Yoga. Yoga as it is known and practiced around the world has little to do with its origins. In fact what is seen and practiced -just like Aikido-is a westernized corruption. Moreover, both arts; Aikido and Yoga had the seed of their corruption sown within their own country in order to best suit the foreigners who came; Aikido for the hippies who came in the late 60’s and 70’s and Yoga with the influence of German and Swedish contortionists who arrive in India in the early 1900’s.
As for Americans? We can definitively state that it was Americans who uncovered the truth about Aikido and Daito Ryu and Ueshiba’s real history. Likewise it was Americans who uncovered the truth about Yoga and the Indian yogis who adopted the popular circus contortionists poses and fed it back to the foreigners.
Questions remain; Why should those same foreigners care what those same cultures did to corrupt their own arts? Why should they care Japan’s decisions to foist upon them a watered down, insipid and ever increasingly marginalized art? Why would they care when the methods needed to correct those same arts now lie outside their own country?
While I accept your comments about how we sound so “American” and how our arguments would leave your Japanese dojo mates “unmoved,” I would say “Why should we care about that?” What are the benefits of caring about what the Japanese think? They are most assuredly not the best practitioners of it. Nor are they the best teachers. Other than Westerners sophomoric tendencies to worship all things Asian-what do the Japanese possess that would compel people to care about their thoughts regarding Aikido?
To reverse this -Americans lost their edge when it came to vehicle production mostly based on a production methodology that we invented and then rejected. The Japanese accepted it whole heartedly and took away “our” cultural edge.
The thrust of the discussion was on the future of Aikido. Every generation has to address the relevance of their practice in any given age. The relevance of an art form can be martial or it can be health or it can be spiritual. I think very direct questions can be posited for each of those aspects of an art. Those question should be asked. Do the Japanese have any meaningful answers beyond…”More practice and it will come?”
While our American verbal and written “arguments” may leave the Japanese unmoved…I can state beyond any doubt that when we who -seriously pursued and achieved some measure of accomplishment in Ueshiba’s methods- meet ANY Japanese Aikido practitioners; Shodan to Shihan…they are most assuredly “moved.” As the physical skills and methods forwarded by the founder of Aikido are simply beyond their intellectual and physical understanding. These practices when added with the current generation’s practices of more stressful testing, like Bjj and MMA, leave the Japanese influence, and their opinions increasingly irrelevant. By their own choosing.
One small correction I would make: I have been asked to teach a seminar of Japanese Aikido Shihans in Japan. So there are at least “some” who have been moved by both written argument and foreign students showing Ueshiba’s teaching while in Japan.
The person talking to Joe rogan seems to be a beginner in Aikido? He said there’s a video of O’Sensei in the 70’s?? I don’t think there’s any point getting a senior Aikido teacher like Matsuoka Sensei or the Hombu Shihan on Mr Rogans podcast as he appears closed minded about any martial art that isn’t used in MMA.
I’ve been a student and teacher of Aikido for close to 46 years and currently hold the rank of GoDan. I also have a 3rd degree black belt in karate and a purple belt in BJJ. When I first began to learn BJJ I was surprised as to how similar BJJ is to aikido in its philosophy and aplication of technique and how both arts fit together seemlessly. As a former police officer, I have to tell you that my go to art has always been Aikido. I couldn’t round house kick a guy or do a fancy spinning wheel kick but I sure could apply nikkyo and versions of kokyu throws while apprehending a suspect. Aikido has so much to teach that can be applied effectively in a “real life” self defense situation. BJJ as good at it is, in many cases it’s not very practical for self defense. No martial art as a whole is perfect.
Joe Rogan is a Tool. He had that guy on his show so he could put aikido down. If he was a serious martial artists and really interested in aikido he would’ve had a more experienced person on his show period. He won’t have an experienced person on his show because it would expose him for the idiot he is. You know what they say about opinions? No one cares about his.
Hi Tom! Nice to meet you here. On the Joe Rogan show, the guest was actually on to speak about cognitive neuroscience and only near the end of the discussion did the guest bring up aikido. I don’t think there was any intention on Joe’s part to have the guest on just to bash aikido. Joe definitely knows and loves the competitive martial arts world, but I don’t think he’s openly hostile towards traditional arts. I just think the guest was ill-prepared to end up in that discussion.
When one begins to take a martial art, they should first determine why they are doing this- is it to learn to defend themselves, is it for exercise, stress relief,sport competation etc. If it is for defense, especially defense against more than one attacker, then Aikido can be very useful, but it does have its limitations, for it is more effective when the attacker is two arms lengths away and has to advance to attack you and may have others to help them. Another limitation is if the attack goes to the ground. But since the early forms came from Dato Ryu, Jujitsu can play a part, with the concern that with a multiple person attack this is the last place you want to be. To be really effective using Aikido, muscle memory is really important. To program muscle memory you have to mostly see a technique, think about the technique or actually do it and this adds up to 5,000. That is why to so-call master the movements of Aikido you have to do it for ten years or more. After this period you begin to focus upon the attackers energy and flow with it in a very relaxed manner. At 76 this works for me. I still practice Uechi-ryu, the three original (well mostly the first two) katas that came from Pangainoon. I find that this style blends very will with Aikido and adds to the close-in techniques that are sometimes needed. The martial art of Aikido, may not be important to you now, but if you want to continue in martial arts after 60 or 70 this style fits me. It may fit you sometime. Phil Porter,O’Sensei to some of us in USMA, who was my teacher and mentor saw great value in the blending of these two styles (his major style was Judo) I hope you do to. The passing of Sensei Pranin was a great loss, he gave us so much. Hopefully what he leaves behind is preserved.
John – fantastic points. Thanks so much for sharing. A great perspective and welcome addition to the dialogue. We are also very thankful to Stanley Pranin Sensei for all he did for the aikido world. We will do everything we can to preserve that which he left behind.
First of all, my condolences and prayers go to the family and friends of Stan Pranin, who was a true Aikido giant, and whose columns/writings brought me much joy over two decades. Second, thanks to Josh and Roy for looking forward and sponsoring this column about the future of aikido. I have been studying aikido since 1989, and hold a 4th-dan (under Sensei Bill Sosa and Sensei Rick Sosa in Dallas, TX) and have studied in other dojos (e.g. ASU Shobukan Wash DC; Aikido of New Delhi; Kurai Aikido London, and currently, Aikido of Dallas) I am also a student and certified Systema instructor under Mikhail Ryabko and Vladimir Vasiliev (since 2010).
I was very fortunate in that both Sensei Bill Sosa and Sensei Rick Sosa emphasized not only aikido’s beauty (especially the flowing ‘dojo’ techniques), but also its ‘street’ effectiveness and martial aspects. Both were pioneers not only of aikido in Texas and Mexico, but were also early proponents of cross-training involving boxing, ground work, karate, knife work, and working with Filipino Kali sticks, [plastic] guns, and other implements. They did this in order to highlight our limitations and to expose us to other martial arts. Tests in their dojo involved not only traditional aikido arts, but also ground defenses, defenses against kicks, weapons defenses, and defenses against various types of chokes/restraints. This allowed students to learn humility, respect, and honesty in their training.
Systema training in Moscow under Mikhail Ryabko – for 3 years! – opened my eyes to a different, and I believe, highly-useful pedagogical approach. While Systema (like aikido or tai chi) is a very deep, internal martial art as practiced at the highest levels, its pedagogy allows new students – even those without any martial arts experience – to learn quickly, because of its emphasis on breathing and on overcoming fear (e.g. of the ground, of being hit). I once had a Systema student who was an overweight, unfit, 51-year old lady, who had never done martial arts or any other exercise. Within 6 months, she was able to roll comfortably on the floor [without mats], and easily able to immobilize two larger, more experienced, knife-wielding (!) attackers, one of whom was a former Marine police officer and combat veteran. Per Systema’s Konstantin Komarov (one of its leading teachers and also a Russian GRU psychologist), the ground is a natural teacher and helps students reach their ‘psyche’ and tap into their natural potential quickly. I have seen similar progress with aikido students who cross-train in BJJ, Judo, Tai Chi, Filipino arts, and other styles of wrestling and jujitsu.
I share Roy Dean’s worry that aikido will become further diluted, less martial, and even – sadly – more politicized. Aikidoka wishing to expand their own, as well as its larger boundaries often find themselves amiss, and sadly, many leave aikido, even after decades of training. O-Sensei famously said, “I leave the further development of this art to others.” Aikidoka who embrace such a philosophy, and reach out to others as in the example of Stanley Pranin and like-minded practitioners, will not be disappointed, and can look forward to future learning and development as students and teachers of aiki — a truly wonderful martial art and “a way to unite the world.”
Thank you for your thoughtful and insightful response. It’s great to meet you and have you as part of our extended community.
This is a very interesting and important subject and I’m glad it’s been brought up for open discussion.
The Guy being interviewed (Andrew Hill) has a Ph.D . degree but clearly no idea about martial arts, I say that based on the following:
– He doesn’t believe in the system he is trying to defend, saying he would get his @ss kicked but a high level exponent of the art can make it work, thus delegating to others to prove that Aikido is effective.
-He doesn’t even know the founders name, this alone proves clearly that he has no idea about Aikido and his point of view and opinion about the art is poor.
-He said there is a video from the 70’s that shows the founder doing an “exposition”, but the founder passed away in 1969, this guy doesn’t know even the most essential chronology of the art.
-He has unrealistic ideas and expectations about the way techniques work in real life, which means he has never been in a real or even simulated situation to test his knowledge.
The way Aikido is practiced in most Dojo now days is not meant to and would not work against an experienced or trained or seasoned attacker. This does not mean the techniques and tactics of the art don’t work, but the training method that is being currently used is not going to provide the tools for an effective self-defense action.
In order for these techniques to work, they must be practiced against realistic attacks, and drill them over and over testing them with uncooperative partners, and get as close as possible to what could be a real confrontation.
For a real attack or street confrontation, the avoidance, prevention and resolution of a violent encounter can follow the next steps (force continuum):
The goal is to AVOID violence from happening at all costs, and if the attack is imminent finish it quickly to avoid further damage to the parties involved.
If the tools are used in the wrong level, the result is either the use of excessive force for which we can be liable, or non-sufficient force which can cause us serious physical damage or death.
Aikido techniques would fit in the 3rd category Empty hand submissions, this works the best before the aggressor starts a committed attack.
To deal effectively with the higher levels of force it is necessary to cross train to obtain the required tools.
Taking as base the MMA competitions where most techniques are allowed, as we all know no single art on itself would provide the tools required to make a trainee proficient in competition.
Some techniques learned in Aikido, share a common origin with those of Judo and Jiu Jitsu, so they could be used in MMA competition
But in order to acquire the skills to have a chance at victory in a sports match it is necessary to cross train.
I have been with the martial arts for almost my entire life. There was a point in time when I had no where to train and had just moved to a new city. I found an ad for Aikido and decided to jump in. Never have I left a martial arts class feeling as “at peace” as I did that day.
When it was time for my daughter to start her journey, we went to Aikido and we stayed there until the Dojo had to move out of town.
There is a side of the economics of the Dojo that makes surviving in certain places really hard. That said, Aikido was priced well over the market rate before everything in my area grew more and more expensive. I would probably choose Aikido as my go to martial art, given the opportunity… but in this time period it is priced so high, that the average person just can’t afford to do it.
Even when I just been practicing for 3 years I came whit the same dilema; is this effective on the streets? This is my conclusion: im 47 years old and I think I been on street fight about 10 or so times. Mostly in my teens ( my chances to be in one again aré very low) I been watching a lot and i mean a lot of videos of commun people fighting and saw one or two for real and I can tell against a 90% of Your adverarsaries wich they dont know how to fight we aikidokas have a very great chance of prevail. So why not practice and art that helps transform people in a very positive way. Help our grow spiritually. Be more fit and give us real chance to defend our selves in the case is need it. I agree Aikido maybe will be a lot better art to defence if mixed whit judo or Jj but if we can comunícate the real use and escence of our art I dont see why it have to die.
practicing Aikido is a choice,moving like an aikidoka needs practice,working or not working is not the goal,ending a fight when it’s occur is the results.
If you meet a Sensei who can teach you to fight or prevail the fight on the street,you will know that aikido can be efficient in any situation,until then you will still in doubt,if you are still at this step ,please continue to train,you will reach your apogee,thanks for reading this
When I hear people argue about the effectiveness of aikido, judo, bjj or other martial art in real life, on the streets, i wonder what exactly do the mean the real street. If someone is pointing a 9 mm pistol at you on the street, what skill will save you? If a 3rd degree BJJ BB faces 3 opponents with baseball bats on a parking lot, will his skills help him? Would You you want to use Krav Maga or Система in a drunk bar fight and seriously injure or kill your opponents? I think that every martial art is more or less useful depending on the setting. If you are a bouncer, aikido is perfect for you, if you are a MMA fighter then BJJ may offer advantages, if you are a commando, then a more deadly skills will be used.
Another example of useless arguing what is better : a hand gun, AK 47 or a sniper rifle? The answer also depends on what you using it for.
Excellent points. We agree with you 100% and actually so does Roy Dean. One of the problems in the public perception of aikido is that people tend to make apples to oranges comparisons.
Roy’s intent is to help people outside the aikido world to understand the benefits of aikido, where aikido’s strengths and specializations fit in the larger fabric of the martial arts world, and to inspire us to reflect on how we improve ourselves, the art of aikido, and how we communicate about the art in order to make a better future for aikido.
All the examples you cite and excellent and a great way to communicate about aikido. Thanks for joining the conversation!
Although I did not get to participate in your survey, I agree with its findings. Your question to the Aikido community at large is truly pivotal: Can we revitalize Aikido together? If so, that would be a great demonstration of the effectiveness of the Aiki concept. I have loved Aikido since my first moment on the mat in 1999. I think the world needs Aikido desperately. I hope I will be able to help in some way.
Thank you for your feedback Jonathan. Aikido is a fantastic art and if we can elevate it further, it would be an excellent demonstration of the aikido philosophy as you point out. I also hope you can help in some way. Just joining the conversation is a start and hopefully we can find ways to take coordinated action together in the future.
Create a cooler podcast than ‘The Joe Rogan podcast’, one that has more than 16 million monthly downloads. Theres one common thread in all the responses here, save for one or two, and that is our Love of Aikido. Start there. Love. I’ll download it! …as long as it’s cool 😉
I did Judo as a kid then got hooked on Aikido in my late teens. It was more the ideas therein than the art. To me, even way back then, 37 years ago, it was obvious Aikido was not realistic, but I knew it had something, and that something was lost, and it was my job to search for it. Knowing it was not realistic I continued with Judo, then Jujutsu, but kept up my practice of Aikido throughout. My conclusion is that Aikido has lost what it was supposed to be … but that is, now, to me, what makes it all the more interesting. I feel sorry for those that have only ever experienced Aikido, typically through its list of waza – the grading syllabus, and it is a fact that they will just never get the idea to search for something that might be missing.
If Aikido could get itself on track and research, study, and teach aiki, people would come flocking to Aikido , even BJJ, wrestlers, boxers … everyone.
I agree entirely. Most of aikikai practice now is Colluded Dancing.. This is not how I practice nor how I will practice with others.. When I teach the juniors I always give them the martial and kuzushi perspective.. My practice feels more alive with Martial Sense to it. I am very unhappy when I partake in Dryland Swimming type of Flowchart aikido practice. Aikido deserves better.
Thanks for sharing this post. BTW from Toronto to Irvine CA I visited your dojo last April. I loved the class. I will visit again next time in LA. PROMISE.
I have practiced/experienced a number of styles over the 30 years I’ve been in Aikido now and only two styles really measure up, Iwama and Nishio Styles. I have not experienced the Chiba Style. I heard and and read too many really poor stories about Chiba Sensei, so I decided not to explore his style cause I felt he had a poor spirit.
Stan Pranin wrote that he thought the Nishio Style was the future for Aikido, but it is little known in the U.S. I’m probably the only direct/close student of Nishio Sensei east of the Mississippi River. I’m known in the Tokyo-Yokohama vicinity in Japan and by Nishio practitioners in California, and longer practicing Iwama practitioners in the U.S. but otherwise unknown.
I think I can safely say I’m probably the most proficient in Aiki-weapons in the Southeast cause I know two styles where most practitioners only know one style.
Aikido is dying because so many teach by wrote without looking for realism. So many tests are not really tests. Hardly anyone fails. There is not a real grading system for tests.
The Aikikai has instituted the Shidoin certified teacher and certified teacher of teachers system which is already being watered down, so it’s really another income stream (tax) for the Aikikai.
Having actually used it in “real fights” (as opposed to sports match fighting), it depends who the teacher is and what the student seeks. Suggest as a starting point, reading the last 4 chapters of Aikido in Japan and The Way Less Traveled. (Yes; I wrote it. Borrow one rather than buy, if you like.) Much if not most of what’s being taught is exercise for personal development ….not necessarily a bad thing …. but it’s become/becoming principally a kind of “martial yoga” watered down to maximize participation and achieve other objectives, which while beneficial and even noble socially possess no/slim relation to applied martial arts skill. But not everyone is doing this ….. some seek to sustain it as an applied martial art from which all the other many benefits flow. https://www.facebook.com/Aikido-in-Japan-479935155448401/
I trained at the Aikikai in the 90s and enjoyed it very much but have done quite a few martial arts since then. I enjoyed my time training and I met some amazing teachers, including legends like Yamaguchi sensei and Endo sensei etc as well as O Sensei’s son, the first Doshu (I was honoured to get a Dan certificate from him). I think in terms of effectiveness, it’s a rather curious debate. If you approach Aikido as a form of budo, well, nobody criticises Iaido (which I practice) or Kyudo as not being ‘practical’ enough. I am sure in a real sword fight circa 1600 most modern Iaido ‘masters’ would get sliced and diced. So maybe Aikido people shouldn’t worry what BJJ people think as BJJ is coming from a different place and different mindset. However, it’s when Aikido people start talking about self defence and effectiveness that problems tend to arise; in conventional Aikido, I do think the lack of training in different kinds of strikes and the assumption that ‘atemi’ will just work is a problem, for example. I think, with the greatest respect to the Ueshiba family, it would be good to adapt to the times and encourage some more innovation or possibly older techniques from Aiki Budo maybe. If you look at O Sensei, he was all about innovation and adding what he needed over the years, his approach changed massively over the years and wasn’t static. Or maybe you should all stop worrying about what other people and just practice your Budo art! You can always go to extra classes in grappling or striking, there are plenty of schools away from Japanese martial arts. Anyway, big respect to you guys, and Pranin sensei’s passing was a tragic loss.
3. The ground is appropriate for “rolling” (i.e. not an asphalt parking lot with broken glass, and used syringes or condoms laying around).
Joe Rogan, being who he is, will only accept Aikido if it holds its own in a one-on-one match between a skilled Aikido Kai vs. an equally skilled BJJ practitioner.
Greetings! I agree 100% about your thinking on the strong points of BJJ and the areas where it’s not well suited for self-defense applications. However, I’m not fully convinced yet on the second point regarding Joe Rogan. Some have expressed the same feeling as you, both others think that he is open minded enough to give aikido another look in an impartial way and perhaps have a healthy dialogue around the differences between competitive/sport based arts and traditional martial arts. I think it might be possible to use some examples (like some of the great ones you use above) to highlight some of the strengths and areas of specialization of aikido. Thank you for joining the conversation!
In 1987 I start Aikido aside of my Karate teaching.my Sensei Aytan ben Meir come from boxing into Iwama style.and this combination gave us the students unique view on real Martial art call AIKIDO.the way I see martial arts is like the word .”if you want peace prepare for War”.
I move to Japan and face many direction or I must say understanding of O’Sensei Teaching.to any direction….the biggest problem start by the leading group of teacher that talk about Aikido as LOVE PEACE BEUTY and so on.
In many dojo I visited ATEMI is almost taboo .no one do..no one talk….and this student grow without knowing this .NISHIO well said in is legendary book Aikido without Atemi is not Aikido.and other Fukakusa Shihan said if you want only BEUTY better study Ballet.
I don’t have solution under my sleeve ,but it’s needed to organize what call BACK TO ORIGEN .and I hope that person will show up and for sure I will be on his/her side to make it .
Thank you for posting this, Mr. Dean. I have been concerned for some time that aikido is marginalizing itself, and it is doing so from within out of neglect for martial integrity and politics. It has degraded so far as to give aikido the reputation as a laughing stock among many. Aikido is certainly not the only art to suffer from this problem, it is one of many which has been diluted over decades.
There are those of us out there who practice, teach, and have our own dojos who have dedicated ourselves to the martial effectiveness of aikido and are contributing to the positive future of aikido. If there was only a way to network ourselves so we could help one another. I’d be delighted to connect to any instructors or students who wished to take action to further this cause.
How we will accomplish this is through honing our own skills, both in the art and how we teach so that we can create solid competence and capability in our students. We do this through honesty about ourselves, our training, and our art. You have contributed honesty, and I thank you.
of all who replied above, i’ve only practiced with sensei tristan chermack, at one of our fellowships at shuurin aikido dojo in omaha, ne. so, i’m grateful for that and giving this bow.
i began aikido practice in ’99. i’ve come to this practice from having studied and practiced taekwondo, fencing (western, not kendo), and tai chi ch’uan since the early and mid 80’s.
i’m still learning the muscle memory of the basics. (i also stopped practice in ’99, not taking it up again until ’14.)
what i love about the potential future of aikido is its application to the so-called bouncer’s arts or bodyguard’s arts. i come from an active pacifist background. i understand that the one who attacks is not always an enemy, but sometimes only a drunken brother or friend.
aikido offers a range of response options that are non-lethal. this is to uphold that even any particular aggressor’s life is worthwhile, however misguided by some certain circumstance.
i practice with the mindfulness that not only is my own life valuable (self-defense), but that also, much aggression is simply misdirected. if the aggressor had but a moment to consider, they might not pose themselves in such a way.
how could i, from a simple misunderstanding, destroy such a person, or destroy their capacity for a livelihood (as would be involved in the breaking of arms, knees, backs, …)
How could anyone in their right mind disagree with what Joe Rogan said? What specifically he was talking about and that dumb video they were watching?
I agree with Roy Dean and think he would be able to show aikido in a positive light with so much negativity surrounding it within bjj and mma communities…. I also believe crosstraining in other arts is essential for aikido to move forward and survive.
Im a nidan I started aikido in 1997, my sensei encouraged me to train FMA and ironhand in 2004 earning a blackbelt in that system, also trained some kali, judo (mostly newaza) and kung fu for a few years each and it has helped the aikido tremendously..but the aiki also help me be relaxed and flow on the ground. Will probably continue with judo or bjj in the future to gain more understanding in those arts.
Peoples negative opinion of Aikido is coming from a place of ignorance or overthinking..If you understand the true essence and principles of aikido and train with sincerity..it does not matter what ufc commentators think…the people who know are not posting here..
thank you and please keep on. you’re making the day of average folk everywhere who want to train and learn well. at least as well as we can. thank you.
Thank you for the encouragement. None of us are really average though. Everyone really brings something unique to the community. We’re glad to have you be a part of it!
The question is, in the context of self-defense ( it is not a sport ) does Aikido develop physical and mental posture that reduces the probability of the practitioner being a likely target for a predator or does it develop sufficient peace of mind and confidence to increase the probablility of the practitioner being able to avoid or defuse a situational bomb or not themselves become one. In the end, self-defense is defense against the self. If you want to fight others, always use a weapon and have others on your side. So, if that is the question, then the answer is “yes”. So which is the best martial art? The one you’ll practice.
This is an admirable approach and Aikido will, I’m sure, get back to it’s roots and thrive again. In my humble opinion we, as an Aikido community, would also greatly benefit by exploring Aikido’s Daito Ryu (DTR) lineage as it is the very essence of combat effectiveness.
I had the privilege of attending a mainline DTR class a few days ago and it was immediately apparent how devastating the techniques could be, while still employing the same principles that we know and love from Aikido.
Aikido applications when applied swiftly and with precise timing can be very devastating there is no doubt about that.
Training this timing and this ability to act swiftly is where most fail I believe, as it’s difficult to train this way without getting seriously hurt.
Learning the basics takes immense personal time which is also where most fail as they don’t see the relevance of the basics until they reach high level, before reaching these levels most quit.
This guy is absolutely right. I’m someone curious about Aikido and it’s possible benefits in providing self defense training. I work in mental health where the likelihood of being assaulted by patients is very high.
I’m drawn to aikido because of the ability to subdue an attacker without really hurting them. I feel like this ability to gain leverage over an opponent without leaving them black and bloody would appeal to many people.
Unfortunately aikido doesn’t seem like an effective form of self defense and more of just a highly coreagrated art form. This is where Krav Maga succeeds and Aikido falls short. Krav Maga banks on it’s practicality and isn’t partial to incorporating elements of other fighting styles into it’s program. I feel like Akido needs to evolve to stay relevant.

Many Americans (68%) think there is intelligent life on other planets, up from 52% in 2005. Nearly three in four residents with that belief (74%) say those extraterrestrials are at least as intelligent as human beings. In fact, this includes a plurality (46%) who think the intelligence of extraterrestrials exceeds that of the human race. These results have changed little in more than a decade. But, are these otherworldly beings coming to get us? A majority (55%) say they will find us before we find them.
Interestingly, Americans under the age of 45 (74%), including 79% of those under 30 years old, and men (72%) are more likely than older Americans (62%) and women (64%) to assert there is life on other planets. Younger Americans (60% of those under the age of 45) are also more likely than older residents (51% of those 45 and older) to think interstellar beings will discover human beings before we find them.

Médecins Sans Frontières valuable work into Sudan is under threat after the Sudanese government issued an arrest warrant for the head of MSF in the country:
"KHARTOUM, May 30 (Reuters) - Sudan has issued a warrant for the arrest of the country head of aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) for publishing a report on hundreds of rape cases in Darfur, the attorney-general said on Monday.
"We have issued a warrant for the arrest of the head of the organisation after speaking to the (governmental) Humanitarian Aid Commission," Mohamed Farid, Sudan's attorney-general, told Reuters. He said it was for publishing a false report on rapes in the Darfur region in March.
MSF Holland released the report in March, saying its doctors working in Darfur had medical evidence of about 500 rape cases over a period of about 4 1/2 months in the region in the throes of a rebellion in its third year. Sudan denies there is widespread rape in Darfur.
Tens of thousands have been killed in the fighting in Darfur and more than 2 million forced form their homes to makeshift camps around the region. Reports of rape are widespread in the conflict, and a U.N.-appointed commission of inquiry found evidence of mass rape during the conflict.
If you listened to some of the political anti-Zionists you'd believe that every Israeli is a gun toting 'settler' hell-bent on murder and mayhem. The truth not unsurprisingly is a deal great different as Lisa in Tel Aviv shows in your latest entry: Learning about coexistence
Wine is a program which allows the operation of DOS and MS Windows programs (Windows 3.x and Win32 executables) on UNIX operating systems such as Linux. It consists of a program loader, which loads and executes a Windows binary, and a set of libraries that implements Windows API calls using their UNIX or X11 equivalents. The libraries may also be used for porting Win32 code into native UNIX executables, often without many changes in the source. Wine is free software, and its license (contained in the file LICENSE in each distribution) is the LGPL. "
Small wonder over the years that I have become increasingly dissatisfied with the attitude and content of the Guardian newspaper.
This exchange is on a serious subject (AUT blacklist) and yet receives a flippant response from the Guardian.
It is frightening that alleged committed trade unionists (Sue Blackwell, etc ) don't take the elementary approach of knowing their union rulebook, off by heart, and therefore do not moan when legitimate rules are enacted. It is very clear that the previous AUT discussion on the blacklist was faulty and limited. So a widespread discussion of the issues surrounding the AUT blacklist should be welcomed by all committed trade unionists, but clearly not by the political mavericks and obsessives with a chip on their shoulder.
The days of smoke-filled rooms are long gone and so should be back handed dealings, issues such as academic freedom, selective boycotts, the Middle East and anti-Semitism need inclusive deliberations not posture politics.
Norm sums it up : "Anyone who doubts that what begins with Sue Blackwell will end with Arbeit Macht Frei is simply refusing to listen to the sad, eternal klezmer music of history. Weigh my words-- every last one of them."
"No one dares make a move. The Dresden student body made a declaration today and the honour of German students forbids them to come into contact with Jews. They are not allowed to enter the Student House. How much Jewish money went towards this Student House only a few years ago!"
The good news is that the AUT blacklist has been overturned, although there is predictably sour grapes from the likes of Sue Blackwell.
In this time of heated and acrimonious discussions concerning the Middle East and anti-Semitism, there is a frequently asked question: “can a Jew be anti-Semitic?"
Self-evidently the answer is yes, however, this strange phenomena is worthy of greater discussion and analysis, I will hopefully returned to it at a later stage.
For the interim articles from the Southern Poverty Law Centre, Frank Collins/Cohen and Andrew Greenbaum, AKA the Spam Nazi will suffice.
As an example of up-and-coming technologies SKYPE is very promising, with the ability to extend IP telephony to the desktop.
Although it is best with broadband and a fairly decent PC (>1 Ghz) SKYPE is usable even on dial-up or lower end machines (500 Mhz Celerons).
Students Waving Placards' Journal is always worth a weekly read, and the comments recently on the AUT blacklist with Sue Blackwell's reactions are telling.
The response to AUT blacklist have been most interesting, and none more so than Sue Blackwell's comments recently, as detailed at Engage:
“I’m not very optimistic about the outcome,” she added “We are up against a backlash, being promoted by a well-organized, well-funded pro-Israeli lobby.”
"Sue Blackwell does not understand what is going on right now. She thinks that when Israel is on the agenda, something particular happens. The whole world goes completely hysterical, she thinks, a special case is made, and a well-organised, well-funded Zionist lobby rises up and defeats good, honest leftist trade unionists."
"That was why we organised Engage; we wanted the authentic left to have a voice with which it could intervene in the struggle between Palestinian and Israeli nationalisms.
A couple of days later, Jon phoned me again, having found a copy of AUT’s rulebook. A Special Council could be called, he mused, if 25 Council Members ask for it. Why hadn’t it been organised then? Should we do it? Yes. Lets do it. So we put up a call for Council Members to contact us on the website . We argued that the decision had been undemocratic, terribly wrong, it had put AUT in legal jeopardy and we couldn’t wait a whole year to undo the damage."
Harry has spotted that this gem from Christopher Hitchen, someone I rarely ever thought I would agree with, but his comments on George Galloway are spot-on:
"Indeed, he was a type well known in the Labour movement. Prolier than thou, and ostentatiously radical, but a bit too fond of the cigars and limos and always looking a bit odd in a suit that was slightly too expensive. By turns aggressive and unctuous, either at your feet or at your throat; a bit of a backslapper, nothing's too good for the working class: what the English call a "wide boy."
Perusing the web revealed that one of the opponents of the AUT blacklist is Sari Nusseibeh, Professor of Islamic Philosophy at Al Quds University
"We are informed by the principle that we should seek to win Israelis over to our side, not to win against them," said the university, which is headed by Dr. Sari Nusseibeh.
"Therefore...we believe it is in our interest to build bridges, not walls; to reach out to the Israeli academic institutions, not to impose another restriction or dialogue-block on ourselves."
We are lucky to live in the age of the Internet: information can be accessed at the touch of a button, Webcams allow us to check the weather in the remotest of cities and electronic books allow people to freely read historical literature.
Yet there are many people, invariably politicians or dictators, which fear freely accessible information and the ability of ordinary people to recall historical facts (previous statements, reports, etc), and therefore hold them to account.
The recent appearance of George Galloway at the Senate sub-committee may prove that words will come back to haunt him.
Irrespective of our view on Galloway, he gave a strong performance and bettered the weak questioning from the senators, but issues concerning Miriam's appeal will not go away.
See his comment " Using their statutory powers they recovered all money in and all money out ever received or spent by the Mariam Appeal. "
I am always forgetting those wonderful videos of George Galloway and his expressions of admiration for Saddam Hussein.
A picture is certainly worth more than a thousand words, and these videos convey George's true intent.
In a speech recorded by the BBC monitoring service, he lavished praise on the Iraqi dictator, calling him "Sir" and addressing him as "Your Excellency, Mr President". "I greet you, in the name of the many thousands of people in Britain who stood against the tide and opposed the war and aggression against Iraq and continued to oppose the war by economic means which is aimed to strangle the life out of the great people of Iraq," he said.
"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability. And I want you to know that we are with you until victory, until victory (sic), until Jerusalem."
Earlier, Mr Justice Eady, who is sitting without a jury, was shown a video clip of Mr Galloway's meeting with Saddam in 1994. During a 10-minute speech Mr Galloway said: "Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability. And I want you to know that we are with you 'hatta al-nasr, hatta al-nasr, hatta al- Quds' [until victory, until victory, until Jerusalem]."
The people at Mozilla.org have just released Firefox 1.0.4, currently only US but more localised versions will follow.
Iraq from the safety of Europe and viewed on TV looks disastrous, daily suicide attacks, kidnappings and beheadings.
Phil Lenton's comments in the Guardian letter page on the 10th of May 2005 demonstrate an immense loathing of genuine trade union organisation or incredible idiocy:
"He tells us that the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU) wants negotiations with employers and strike action. Well, they'll have to do the same as us and risk their jobs and livelihoods when they strike, just as we do."
Self-evidently trade unionists in the war-torn Iraq face insurmountable problems and daily dangers: the proliferation of guns combined with the existence of ex-Ba'athist and hostile fundamentalists, by comparison Europe is tranquil and problem free.
Such condescending comments from Phil Lenton are indicative of crass stupidity, which is occasionally exhibited towards ordinary Iraqis dealing with very genuine hardships in a war-torn country.
I doubt few living trade unionists have ever setup or organised in the conditions that the Iraqis in , the IFTU find themselves and I wish them well.
"Firefox 1.0.4 includes security fixes for the two security flaws that can lead to arbitrary code being executed."
I hope that the violence, which marred the 2005 General Election in the East End, does not impinge on her expressing her views.
Irshad Manji is an interesting person and I think we should all welcome her views on pluralism and Islam, for more information see in the news at www.muslim-refusenik.com
I am getting old but I do worry about poor David Bellamy. His attitude to Global Warming seems a bit strange:
"555 of all the 625 glaciers under observation by the World Glacier Monitoring Service in Zurich, Switzerland, have been growing since 1980."
"I don't think the response would have been published in Nature, but it had the scientific virtue of clarity: "This is complete bullshit."
"there you have it  a 16 year old article that was never written, fraudulently cited by a climate skeptic, re-printed in a publication owned by Lyndon Larouche which was cited by a former architect, and finally misrepresented by a credible scientist. One can only wonder what Bellamy was thinking."
Don't believe something just because it is published on the Internet or agrees with your own inclinations. Verify the facts on an issue and do your own research before making up your mind.
Good to see that Googlenews has removed the neo-Nazi site 'National Vanguard' from its list of sources.
"While some might criticize Google for banning National Vanguard even though that publication's writings are protected speech under the First Amendment"
Clearly, they are not been banned, just excluded as people don't wish to read their neo-Nazi filth. National Vanguard can still, sadly do, publish the putrid mutterings but people are not obliged to accept them as a valid new source from Google.
Would anyone sensible accept Hitler's speeches as a valid news source? No, therefore we should make a critical distinction between the rantings of neo-Nazis and legitimate news sources. Dragging out the US Constitution to defend the proliferation of neo-Nazi ideas is as unworthy as it is bogus.
Sheikh Al-Qaradawi believes that women have the right to cover their heads if they choose to fullfil what Islam asks them to do. To claim that he calls for forcing women to wear Hijab is simply a lie. He told the Protection of Hijab conference at City Hall on 12th of July this year” Although it (Hijab) is not a pillar of the religion, it is a requirement, it is a duty and it is required of every Muslim woman … If a woman wants to cover her head, she is free that is part of her choice.
Reading some of the enthusiastic reactions to George Galloway's win in Bethnal Green and Bow I am left wondering what the excuses will be when Respect falls apart?
The respective elements: MAB, SWP and the George Galloway Fan club are strange political bedfellows with diverging views and although the quest for power, money and kudos will keep them together for a period my gut feeling is that they will break up with recriminations.
Strange given its stances on the boycott one would assume they might rectify that, or maybe attacking Israel is important to some people than the reemergence of the extreme right.
A piece in the Sunday Times covers some of the issues on the AUT boycott and the climate of fear amongst some Jewish students.
This issue is truly frightening for anyone with a grasp of history, but I wonder in the contemporary world, given the unhealthy preoccupation with soundbites, gesture politics and the seeming attention spans of goldfish, if the implications of AUT boycott will really sink home.

Technology has for the last 150 years increasingly penetrated the lives of ordinary people, resulting in changing working practices to more latterly changing methods of communication (mobile phones, high-speed Internet, email, etc) and yet I wonder if our ideas and humanity keep pace.
I am reminded of Omar Bradley’s comment “The world has achieved brilliance without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. If we continue to develop our technology without wisdom or prudence, our servant may prove to be our executioner.”
I hope to comment in this blog on humanity and all our endeavours, as imperfect and volatile as they are.
My interests are varied and my curiosity endless but more importantly the blog will record my judgements and comments over time. Readers and future generations can judge the accuracy or otherwise of these comments.

To be honest, I had really good intentions about writing some super awesome posts for the 4th of July. Sometimes (aka a lot of times) my procrastination catches up with me & I spend a weekend in Tennessee.
So rather than attempting to reinvent the wheel, I figured I would compile the best fourth of july inspiration for all you other procrastinators out there! Whether you’re throwing a party, attending one or just going to watch fireworks – there’s an outfit and some inspiration here for you!
Start your day off with the spirit of red, white & blue! Toast, cream cheese, jam, blueberries & bananas make for an easy patriotic breakfast.
For a twist on the classic hotdog… make rocket dogs! They are a great addition to usual barbeque fair.
A super easy dessert option: sugar cookies, frosting and fruit. You may even be able to pull these off as good for you!
No 4th of July is complete without a classic blueberry pie! Use star cut outs on the crust for a festive flair.

I choose to start this style board out with an accent chair as the focus piece. Often times you’ll have room for some extra furniture in your room – many will choose a couch or chair. The big key to a successful and cute dorm room is accessories!
I always tend to choose accessories and accent pieces in neutral styles that will go beyond the room. It can be easy to fall into the trap of matching all of the colors in your room (or your side of the room), but then you become stuck to the color palette until you replace pieces. Keeping accessories in neutral or metallic tones will make it easier to transition from one style to another.
When I moved to college, I picked a bedding with lots of different colors – it’s blue, pink and green. It allowed me to accent different colors and change up my style without a major cost. If you’re picking a statement piece – like a chair, pick a bedding and accessories that can be adapted easily so you aren’t stuck with the same style all four years. College is a time of growth and adaptation, you don’t want to get yourself stuck in something and grow to hate it!
It’s usually best to keep accessories small and to a minimum when you first move into a dorm room. Simply is always a good option – you don’t want your room to become too busy or overcrowded. You can always add in new accessories as time goes on.

I taught a workshop on found footage and hand painting July 29 and 30 at the FAC in Montevideo. A wonderful group (from a professional projectionist in his 60's to a teenager who had no previous experience in film) sat around the table and bleached, painted and scratched on 35mm, 16mm and Super 8 film. We taped the strips to the window overlooking the vibrant street. Later we went to the roof to bleach whole rolls of film and let it dry in the wind-- we could hear the boats in the port a few blocks away.
I have been making films and videos for the past 20 years. For many years I worked in 16mm, sometimes attacking the surface of the film with paint and bleach to create abstract visuals. In the mid 90's I started to explore the line between fiction and documentary, and I made several films that depict characters wrestling with their place in the world. In 2000 I completed my first character based narrative work, At Home and Asea, about racial, geographical and class tensions in Baltimore, MD. I continue to work in the long form, and to also make shorter more experimental works. I have presented imagery in gallery contexts, as well as in conjunction with performance groups and musicians. I am always exploring how far I can stretch moving images.

PHOENIX — A new indictment in Arizona against operators of Backpage.com alleges the classified ad site gave free ads to prostitutes and cultivated arrangements with others who worked in the sex trade to get them to post ads with the company.
The indictment filed Wednesday repeats allegations in an initial round of charges and adds six new money laundering charges against founder Mike Lacey and 50 charges of facilitating prostitution against chief financial officer John Brunst.
A total of seven people were charged in an indictment in late March alleging the site ignored warnings to stop running prostitution ads, sometimes involving children, after the site brought in $500 million of prostitution-related revenue since its inception in 2004.
The new indictment said Backpage.com employees would identify prostitutes through Google searches then call and offer them a free ad. It says the company used the strategy in Nashville and other cities and planned to expand such efforts in Los Angeles and New York.
The document also said the classified site had a business arrangement in which it would place ads on another site that lets customers post reviews of their experiences with prostitutes.
Backpage.com is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation. Its principal place of business is in Dallas and federal officials say it keeps its bank accounts and servers in Arizona.
Prosecutors say Backpage.com was warned by an internet safety firm in April 2011 about the phrase "New In Town." a code term used by pimps who shuttle children to locations where they don't know anyone and can't get help.
"Nevertheless, Backpage continued for the next seven years to permit ads using the phrase 'New In Town' to be published on its website," the indictment said.
Paul Cambria, an attorney representing Lacey, said his client will plead not guilty to the new charges.
Lacey "is confident that he violated no laws — federal, state or otherwise — and intends to vigorously defend himself," Cambria said.
Gary Lincenberg, an attorney for Brunst, said in an email that his client is innocent, and that the federal charges have unjustifiably damaged his client's good reputation.
"We hope the community will withhold judgment until he has an opportunity to prove his innocence," Lincenberg wrote.
Another employee of the site, CEO Carl Ferrer, has pleaded guilty to a separate federal conspiracy case in Arizona and state money laundering charges in California.
In addition, the company pleaded guilty to human trafficking in Texas and in a money laundering conspiracy case in Arizona. Ferrer has agreed to testify against others.

Surveys are just a small piece of the puzzle. The best part about the surveys is that the qualification questions are typically short, there to confirm you're not breezing through it, and you can still earn points if you don't qualify. You will not answer 30 questions and then get denied, with zero to show for it. As of May 2017, they've paid out $191.5 million. They give out 7,000 free gift cards every single day.
This is where it can all go downhill quickly.Â In the pressure to make as many pennies out of a nickel, a lot of research corporations will not just sell your answers but the data associated with it.Â Details that you provide when taking paid surveys such as your name, address, age range can all be attached together quickly to fulfill a lot of larger companies' requests for information (RFI).
Global Test Market is a decent standard of what you're getting yourself involved in.Â Their practices are not any more or less shady or reputable than almost any online venue â€“ survey or otherwise.Â Just like Facebook, when you identify yourself accurately with Global Test Market, you can expect them to use that information in any way possible to make a penny.Â The great news is they inform you and ask for consent first.
Rewards are paid out in cash and PayPal, but the catch of having short surveys is reflected in the pay, which can be miniscule per survey. As you need to earn $50 before you can withdraw anything, thatâ€™s a lot of low-paying surveys before youâ€™ve made your money! Some people have complained online that once you get close to the withdrawal amount, the surveys dry up. One way around this is to refer a friend as youâ€™ll receive a bonus when they sign up and youâ€™ll hit your target to withdraw your funds. Itâ€™s a bit of a downside, but there are hundreds of very happy consumers who love the site, so itâ€™s worth a shot, especially if you get fed up with the boring or repetitive nature of some of the quizzes elsewhere.
Survey Club has been offering online paid surveys since 2005, and in the fast paced every changing world of the web thatâ€™s a reassuringly long amount of time. They are a bit of an acquired taste, in that they specialise in long, detailed surveys for high end clients rather than the quick and cheerful consumer surveys that you may be more familiar with. Whilst this does mean that you may have to commit a bit more time, it does mean that if you have the patience to persevere with them they pay more money than most survey and reward sites. They also offer local taste tests (see what I said about â€˜an acquired tasteâ€™?), and secret shopper opportunities.
Watching video ads: Video ads certainly aren't uncommon in the online world. While generally they're a hassle getting in the way of the content you want to watch, many paid survey sites have turned them into a way for members to make money. It's pretty easy to make a tab, set a playlist of paid ads going, mute it, and carry on with browsing the internet or taking surveys.
Playing games online: if you like playing games, why not turn the hobby into a moneymaking activity? There are tons of websites out there that reward their loyal fan base with points when the complete a game or play for a certain amount of time. These points can then be exchanged for real money. Sites are able to do this by sharing the profit they make from ads as an incentive for users to visit the site.
It requires patience, as it can take some time, but can often be a quick way of making some easy dollars whilst watching television or listening to music. Surveys are not a get rich scheme â€“ hourly rates are never going to reach anything like a regular wage â€“ but many people manage to turn idly filling in online forms into tidy sums to put towards holidays, home improvements or their new wardrobe!
By only sending you questionnaires you are already qualified for, Pinecone wastes far less of your time than many sites which require you to fill our qualifying questions before starting each survey. However some users have said they donâ€™t receive very many surveys, which could be a consequence of their careful filtering. Equally the site retains the right to remove you from their panel if you no longer fit their desired demographic, so make the most of your membership while you have it!
I also have used Synovate Global Opinion Panels, which is now I-Say by Ipsos. They send you surveys pretty frequently and the points you accumulate can turn into actual money! You can receive an actual check from them, or choose to redeem for a gift card. I havenâ€™t cashed out with them since they changed into the new system, just because Iâ€™ve really stopped taking the surveys because Iâ€™m lazy ðŸ™‚ Hereâ€™s the link: http://i-say.com/Rewards/RewardsProgram/tabid/203/language/en-US/Default.aspx
MintVine is a cool looking paid survey site that makes it easy to complete a survey, without having to spend too long learning how to do it. One of the things I liked most about MintVine is that they offer a huge amount of ways to get paid: thereâ€™s the old favorite PayPal of course, but you can also choose Starbucks cards, Amazon and other gift cards, and even restaurant cards. Your surveys can pay for your next meal, and itâ€™s easy to rack up points here. Some users have reported delays in receiving payments however, but this isnâ€™t a scam and MintVine are working hard to speed up their process and iron our any glitches. If they do, they could be heading into the Survey Cool top ten in 2018.

Surveys can be super quick and take just a few minutes to fill out, or require around 15 minutes of your time. Five minute surveys pay $0.50 and surveys range from $0.40 up to the higher â€“ and rarer â€“ ones at $10.Paying out by the usual methods, Crowdology does PayPal and also vouchers. Most importantly, the minimum reward threshold is low so when youâ€™ve earned $8, you can cash it out, unlike other sites which make you wait until you have earned much more money. The site offers prize draws from time to time for things like cinema tickets and surveys can be expected weekly.
Scammers use a diverse variety of methods to allure and dupe unsuspecting victims. Some ads and offers look so real that even the most seasoned internet veterans can be tricked. However, many scams target people new to the market who may be more susceptible to â€œget rich quickâ€� schemes because they're unaware of what you can reasonably make taking surveys. It is incredibly uncommon to be offered more than $10 to complete a 20 minute survey. Not that one offering that or more is definitely a scam, it's just important to be cautious. While some experienced and well credited survey takers receive legitimate offers paying that pay big money, if you're new to survey taking you should definitely steer clear of anyone offering you hundreds to complete a survey.

Not one to let a perfectly good event pass by without a sale, Vizio has put together a Slam Dunk Deals page to help kick off March Madness, which starts with Selection Sunday this weekend and ends with the Championship game on April 2.
Whether you’re rooting for the current favorites Villanova or Duke, Vizio is offering discounts on more than two dozen TVs — some quite respectable, like the high-dynamic-range-enabled 80-inch E80-E3 4K TV, which has been marked down to $2,600 — 800 bucks off its list price of $3,400.
An even bigger 30 percent discount is offered on two high-dynamic-range-enabled 75-inch 4K sets — the E75-E3 and E75-E1. Both feature Chromecast built-in and are now available for $1,400 — 600 bucks less than their original $2,000 list price. Apart from the latter model having lower power consumption, good luck figuring out how these two TVs differ.

Investigating the design approach of designers-by-assignment: A learner analysis of workshop facilitators
Over the past decade organizations have increasingly relied on designers-by-assignment to develop instructional materials and facilitate learning experiences, largely in part due to the rise in self-service technologies and the perception that professional instructional designers are not needed. Merrill (2007) estimated that up to 95% of all instructional design products may be created by these individuals who generally participate in instructional design activities as only a small part of their job and lack formal training in the instructional design profession. Despite this reliance on designers-by-assignment, organizations generally do not provide adequate support or professional development opportunities. The present study investigated the learning needs of a specific population of designers-by-assignment – workshop facilitators for a national environmental education nonprofit – for the purpose of collecting data to support the design of a future online professional development program for this network. The learner analysis consisted of three instruments in addition to demographic questions: Design Approach Self-Assessment (based on Gibbons, 2003); Learning Design Skills Questionnaire (based on MacLean & Scott, 2011); and Online Learner Self-Assessment (modified from Watkins, Leigh, & Triner, 2004). The data were analyzed from the perspective of four position types (formal educators, natural resource professionals, nonformal educators, and university faculty) in order to assist in the development of persona profiles. Findings suggested that workshop facilitators across position types prefer a message-centric design approach, have distinct interests in developing their instructional design skills, and are ready to learn in an online environment. Recommendations focused on the practice of instructional design, specific design features to be included in a professional development program, and implementation of this program.

My header was comprised of a few things that are quite meaningful to me. My porcelain doll, she stands 3 feet tall, given to me by a long time friend and the Victorian Metal Box belonged to my mother who sadly, is no longer with us. The tassel, I bought in an Antique Shop which hangs on the switch of my standing lamp. I use PSP, exclusively, and numerous Filters. Owner of versions 4, 6, 8 and 10. Out of all, I use PSP 8 the most.
Showing their lives from birth until now, but more importantly with my journaling, words from a mother's heart to her child(ren).
I have never been gifted with verbalizing things, but I am able to convey my feelings and thoughts in writing. And so it is with that - that I am thankful I stumbled across Digital Scrapping- and can finally say all the things that I want my kids to know.
Not until I had made coffee etc, etc and sat down at my computer did I (as I habitually do) look at my clock in the taskbar and saw 3:00 staring back at me!
I can not believe I forgot to set my alarm or that I had even forgotten about the change whatsoever, AT ALL.
The repercussions will be felt through-out the day, I will feel it's force especially tonight - when I crash-n-burn at 8:00 o'clock.
Now, on to the scrappin' stuff- I'm working on a couple of things, I should have some kind of freebie up tomorrow.
Then tonight I came across this site that offers Scripts for PSP, but it works along with AV Bros. Page Curl Pro 2.1
The Demo keeps sample imprints on the image so you need to purchase in order to get beyond that. I recommend it. I've been playing for hours and here is one I felt worthy enough of being a Freebie...
Look what I did today... I tubed my Crocheted Crinoline Doll last night, my gosh but that was ..::ugh!::.. TEDIOUS work!!
Eventually I would like to become a designer and sell my kits, I'm just not there yet... I don't think.
Here's the goodies I promised. Only the beige flower is in the zip, I colorized it, thus getting the other 2- just for decoration on the sample. :P
Links Renewed for Frames~ ... I saw today that the files had reached their limits, thank you for letting me know. ;)
3 Tier Crochet Frame~ I worked on this yesterday, it's my own crocheting, and the rest was made in PSP excluding the bow, which is mine, scanned in.
The one child who I thought would never ever leave home, flew far. She was attached to my hip all her life then suddenly severed the attachment- I was shell-shocked left wondering how it happened?!? When it happened?!?
She at least gave me an inkling, I ::silly me:: just didn't pick up on it, she flew to Brazil with her Church. I kept waiting for the frantic call "I wanna come home", but, it never came...
Should you desire to crop off the hanger, feel free, otherwise I prefer she stay as she was created. ;)
New Frames~ I made these up today, thought I'd get them posted tonight since I'll be going back to work tomorrow. My work days are 11 hours long so it's pretty good odds that it wouldn't be happening tomorrow!
I took a picture of a piece of antique furniture that we own, went into my program, took part of the image and created these frames, I ended up with 2 styles that I liked.
Though they're all together in my "sample" image they are in fact each an individual separate file at eSnip.
Fish tank needs cleaned, laundry needs done, vacuuming, dishes, organize my "I'll get to this later" piles...::sigh::
Typically though, on my 2 days off during the week one day is spent on doing nothing, chore\house-wise.
Check back later for more Freebies, I think I may share the glasses that's in my parent's LO up yonder. I found that too in my mother's belongings.
Too, I'll upload the Victorian Paper that I made from the Vic. Metal Box, I have the soft muted version and the regular toned version.
Let me remind you that long time ago, we have been using the metric system. Haha. Need to convert from miles to kilometre to find out the exact distance. So, based on the result by Nike apps I need to improve the pace. GO! GO! GO!
We pay tribute to him for the intense struggle he waged in the preparatory period of our democratic revolution against the Chinese reformists, taking the clear-cut stand of a Chinese revolutionary democrat. In this struggle he was the standard-bearer of China's revolutionary democrats.
We pay tribute to him for the signal contribution he made in the period of the Revolution of 1911 when he led the people in overthrowing the monarchy and founding the republic.
We pay tribute to him for his signal contribution in developing the new Three People's Principles from the old Three People's Principles in the first period of co-operation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.
Save for a handful of reactionaries, the people of contemporary China are all successors in the revolutionary cause to which Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated himself.
We have completed the democratic revolution left unfinished by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and developed it into a socialist revolution. We are now in the midst of this revolution.
Things are always progressing. It is only forty-five years since the Revolution of 1911, but the face of China has entirely changed. In another forty-five years, that is, by the year 2001, at the beginning of the 21st century, China will have undergone an even greater change. It will have become a powerful industrial socialist country. And that is as it should be. China is a land with an area of 9,600,000 square
kilometres and a population of 600 million, and it ought to make a greater contribution to humanity. But for a long time in the past its contribution was far too small. For this we are regretful.
However, we should be modest -- not only now, but forty-five years hence and indeed always. In international relations, the Chinese people should rid themselves of great-nation chauvinism resolutely, thoroughly, wholly and completely.
Dr. Sun was a modest man. I heard him speak on many occasions and was impressed by the force of his character. From the way he applied himself to the study both of China's past and present and of foreign countries, including the Soviet Union, I knew he was a man with a receptive mind.
He worked heart and soul for the transformation of China, devoting his whole life to the cause; of him it can be justly said that he gave his best, gave his all, till his heart ceased to beat.
Like many great figures in history who stood in the forefront guiding the march of events, Dr. Sun, too, had his shortcomings. These shortcomings should be explained in the light of the historical conditions so that people can understand; we should not be too critical of our predecessors.
My background in community organizing combines with art practice to fuel a strong interest in engaging with people and media in what I term aesthetic action.
Mapping, storytelling, dialogue, guided walks, video, sound, music, dance, printmaking, sculpture, and performance are media we have combined with intentionally designed experiential processes aimed at inviting people to engage, interact, participate, and express themselves.
I think often these days about how artist, educator, and writer Ted Purves defined social practice art: that which produces a space of encounter. I am most interested in framing experiences for people to connect – with themselves, each other, issues they care about, their places.
With this aesthetic of relationship at center, our work goes further, pointing to action participants might choose in response to changes in thought or feeling that relational experiences may bring.
I’d love to hear what you think – about the work on this site, and about art as a way for artists and communities to engage toward positive change!
On Time and Voice: thoughts on “rules” for artists working in and with communities November 18, 2015
I’m the only real estate agent in the area with 30 years past title insurance experience. That experience has been extremely helpful for both buyers and sellers. I know about access, easements, legal descriptions, chains of title, reservations and probate matters. I worked daily to resolve title issues in order to get buyers and sellers to the closing table, for residential sales to complicated commercial developments. It has proved invaluable, in heading off or solving problems that sometimes arise during a real estate transaction.
Since moving to Ponderosa Realty in 2008, I am so happy to work with buyers and sellers with “boots on the ground” rather than mostly paper at the title company. By far, it has been the best part of my real estate career. I’m passionate about providing the best service possible and truly love what I do!
*Utilize up-to-date market information to let you know what your property might sell for based on market reports, Comparative Market Analysis and current market conditions.
*Go above and beyond- I have taken sellers out with me to view the comparable cabins for sale – this way they could see the competition first hand and price their property competitively. I’ve checked on vacant cabins for out of state sellers, provided and escorted vendors for repairs when necessary, and even helped sellers move.
*Market your property- Because 95% of buyers are looking online, photos are critical in presenting your property, I strive to have the best photos available and make sure that your listing is marketed online on several internet sites as well as in print to ignite interest and ultimately get it sold.
*Utilize up-to-date market information so that you know what comparable properties have sold for and feel confident in your offer price, based on market reports, Comparative Market Analysis and current market conditions.
*Help you get the facts: What if you don’t know anything about mountain living, water wells, septic systems, pine beetle, covenants, association rules, dues, area schools, average utility bills, where to get the mail…? I have many of the answers and professional references for you contact so that you will have all the information necessary to make an informed decision before you buy.
*Follow-up with you, during the searching process as well as after you have purchased your mountain property, cabin or home. Our relationship does not end after the sale, I’m there should you have any questions or concerns- I want to build lasting, lifelong relationships with my clients.

Revenue Participation Notes (“RPNs”) are debt instruments that entitle the holder (i.e.; lender) to receive a share of top line revenue from a company rather than a fixed periodic payment based on a percentage of the monies loaned to a company.
The percentage of revenue that is received by note holders is set by the entrepreneur as a fixed term of the note, but the size of payments each period (month or quarter), will be variable as it is tied to revenue for the period. (The payment stream can be very variable if the entrepreneur’s business is seasonal.)
Revenue Participation Notes generally have a maturity date of seven years from issuance; however, they also have a payout cap that is set by the entrepreneur at 1.5 to 2.0 times the initial investment. The payment obligation of the note is fulfilled at the earlier date of when the payout cap is reached or the maturity date. The length of the investment will vary based on the performance of the company.
As an example, say a company issued $300,000 of Revenue Participation Notes with a 5% revenue share and a payout cap of 1.5 times the investment or $450,000. Given the following revenue projections, the RPN payment stream would be as follows:
If revenue growth was stronger, the RPNs would be paid off sooner. If revenue growth was weaker, the RPNs may not be paid off until the maturity date.
Liquidity is achieved much earlier than with equity as payments begin flowing back to investors when revenue starts flowing to the Company.
An investor can have a direct effect on the return to the investment by working to increase Company revenue. It significantly reduces investor-management conflict that can arise when returns are tied to a Company’s bottom line.
Due diligence is simpler than with an equity investment as there is no concern about the Company’s valuation or exit strategy.
Investor payments are tied to Company revenue rather than an amortization schedule reducing cash flow concerns. The incentives for the investors and the Company are aligned with revenue growth. Investors have a direct incentive to promote the Company and increase its sales.
Company stock is preserved for later funding rounds. – A capitalization table’s investors do not change with issuance of RPNs.

Pick up a mass-marketed lager and you might find that the beer won some award at some pompous 19th-century event. Now imagine that one of these 19th-century awards had continued to this day, surviving world wars and changing tastes in beer to remain a significant prize in the 21st century.
You’d be describing what is now called the International Brewing Awards, which are a brewer-judged contest held every two years in Burton-on-Trent in England. Michael Jackson, who served as one of the few nonbrewer judges in the early 1990s, described the awards’ significance in 1994. “It is all very well for a brewer to decorate a label with grand-looking gold medals from the 1909 World’s Fair in Ruritania,” Jackson wrote, “But a brewer would rather win in Burton.”
Brewing Champions (£9.99, Brewing Technology Services Ltd.) is a corporate history of the International Brewing Awards, with 125 pages of text by Adrian Tierney-Jones describing the award’s history and over 200 pages listing the award winners. Tierney-Jones is a good writer and a diligent researcher, and Brewing Champions is a significant addition to beer history.
The awards began in 1888 as part of The Brewers’ Exhibition, a trade show held at the Royal Agricultural Hall. They were scheduled to be held every two years, but after the second awards in 1890, the contest was not held between 1890 and 1901. It’s not clear why, but one reason could be that the judging was open to the public, who demanded too much free beer. An 1895 editorial in Brewers’ Guardian denounced rowdy “sightseers” to the exhibition who were given “complimentary passports” and got out of control. “Should some of these devotees become over-vehement in their devotions,” the magazine declared, they may “require to be gently coerced into a restriction of their libations.”
After 1901, the award has been given regularly, with three exceptions. Judging was suspended between 1914 and 1919 because of World War I and between 1939 and 1950 because of World War II and postwar rationing. In 2005, the awards were moved to Munich to be held as part of the DrinkTec exhibition. The move to Germany strained finances and caused the awards to be reorganized. They returned to Burton in 2011 and have been held there three times in this decade.
The evolution of the International Brewing Awards helps mark changes in brewing history. Lager began to be judged in the 1960s. The foreign competitors, originally limited to breweries in the British Empire, became British Commonwealth awards in 1968 and international awards in 1972. “Mini breweries” made an appearance beginning in 1983.
Another substantial change occurred after 1983, when the awards split from the Brewers’ Exhibition (which had been renamed “Brewex”). The trade show subsequently folded, while the awards continue to thrive.
Today, Tierney-Jones reports, the International Brewing Awards are very friendly to American breweries. New Glarus’ Wisconsin Belgian Red was a champion beer of 1996, an early recognition of that brewery’s excellence. At the 2015 International Brewing Awards, held this past February, Deschutes won seven medals, while Alaskan and Samuel Adams won two and Firestone Walker won one. (An additional gold medal was given to Samuel Adams Boston Lager, which is made under license by Shepherd Neame in Britain.)
Brewing Champions is a thoughtful look at one of the brewing industry’s oldest and most important awards.

Soil & "Pimp" Sessions are a Japanese jazz combo who play music inspired by the sound and style of classic bebop, Latin jazz, and cool jazz, but with a funky undertow and the passion, aggression, and force of rock & roll. The group features five musicians -- Josei on piano, Tabu Zombie on trumpet, Motoharu on sax, Akita Goldman on double bass, and Midorin on drums -- as well as Shacho, credited as "agitator and spirit," who prowls the stage as the group performs and occasionally offers gravel-voiced encouragement. The group first came together when Tabu Zombie and Shacho began appearing at dance clubs featuring jazz nights; as DJs spun groove jazz sides, Zombie would jam along on his horn as Shacho worked the crowd, and the response was strong enough that they eventually formed the band to play full live sets without the DJs. As Soil & "Pimp" Sessions' reputation on the Tokyo club scene grew, in 2003 they became the first unsigned band invited to appear at the Fuji Rock Festival, and in 2004 they released their first album for JVC Victor, Pimpin', which was followed by a steady stream of albums and EPs. Giles Peterson, the British DJ who launched the Acid Jazz label, took notice of Soil & "Pimp" Sessions, and after giving them steady airplay on his BBC radio show invited them to play London in 2005. The combo signed with Peterson's Brownwood Records label for Europe and the U.K., and soon became regulars on the international festival circuit, impressing audiences with their energy and instrumental skill. In 2008, Soil & "Pimp" Sessions struck an American record deal with Koch Records, and Planet Pimp became their first U.S. release. ~ Mark Deming

If you want to compare two columns, a simple way would be to create a calculated column. However, SharePoint doesn’t let you use Person fields (columns) in calculated column.
Say you add an extra column to a task list, called “OriginallyAssignedTo” and you want to check if the “AssignedTo” column matches the “OriginallyAssignedTo” column.
The variable $TaskDelegated will be false if the two person fields are the same and true if they are different. Comparison is being made based on the ID parameter which is used in the /_layouts/userdisp.aspx page.

That's unless your smartphone runs Android, because Google will keep tracking you even if you've disabled location services, when you're on Wi-Fi only, or when there's not even a SIM installed in the device. All the device needs to grab a user's location is a cellular data or Wi-Fi connection, the investigation found.
The spokesperson said that the Cell ID data was required to enhance the speed of message delivery, but the data collected was "immediately discarded" and the network sync system was recently instructed to no longer request it. And if your Android phone has been hacked in any way, others may be able to tap into that location data stream without your knowledge - and without Google's knowledge. This practice has been in place since the beginning of the year and, according to Google, these addresses have been used in the same system used it uses to manage push notifications and messages on Android.
There is nothing you can do at this time to stop it other than wait for Google to stop doing it at the end of this month as they promised.
Some researchers have said that although the data is encrypted, it is possible to send the data to third party services if the handset is affected with spyware.
As a result, Google's parent company Alphabet whose original moto was "Don't be Evil, ' has access to consumer data that is at odds with users" privacy expectations. The search giant has said that the Android phones have been collecting the data and sharing it with Google even when the location services are switched off.
The disadvantage of Google Maps Timeline is that anyone who gets access to a user's Google login information can see a complete record of their movements, potentially going back for years. It works by finding the address of the nearest cellular towers, and while it's not possible to pinpoint your location based on only that, it can be triangulated down to a quarter-mile radius.
However, it does seem to broadly comply with Google's privacy policy, which warns that "When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location".
One source claims Google started collecting location data after a change in early 2017 to the Firebase Cloud Messaging service.
It is unclear how identifying the nearest cell tower could be used to improve Google's message services. Each phone has a unique ID number, with which the location data can be associated.

Sisters Nancy Chiarelli and Sarah Differ were co-tenants of the house in Quincy that they grew up in. Sarah lived in the house with their mother, her daughter, and her husband Marc and his daughter; Nancy lived in Florida with her husband and family. In 2006, Sarah asked Nancy to convey her ½ interest in the house to Sarah so that she could refinance; Sarah promised to return Nancys ½ interest after the refinance was completed. After getting the promise in writing, Nancy agreed, and that transaction went smoothly. In 2008, Sarah made the same request. Nancy agreed without getting anything in writing, and conveyed her ½ interest to Sarah. Sarah reneged on the agreement and did not return Nancy as a co-tenant. This action followed, in which Nancy brings a variety of claims, each of which seeks a return of her ½ interest, as well as a claim for partition that has been stayed pending the resolution of her other claims. As discussed below, while Sarah did not commit fraud (she intended to return the ½ interest to Nancy at the time of the 2008 agreement), she did breach an enforceable contract with Nancy, entitling Nancy to specific performance of the promise to reconvey her ½ interest to her.
The plaintiff Nancy Chiarelli filed her verified complaint on January 5, 2012, naming as defendants Sarah Differ, Marc Differ, and Lowell Cooperative Bank. The verified complaint asserted the following claims: Count I, Intentional Misrepresentation; Count II, Fraud in the Inducement; Count III, Breach of Contract; Count IV, Promissory Estoppel; Count V, Specific Performance; Count VI, Creation of a Constructive Trust; and Count VII, Partition. Plaintiffs Motion for Judicial Endorsement of Memorandum of Lis Pendens was allowed on January 11, 2012. Defendant Lowell Cooperative Bank filed its answer on February 1, 2012. A case management conference was held on February 23, 2012. Defendants Sarah Differ and Marc Differ filed their answer on March 15, 2012. On April 17, 2012, the Plaintiffs Motion to Transfer Case to Superior Court was denied, and Count VII of the verified complaint, for partition, was stayed until resolution of the other claims.
On May 24, 2012, plaintiff filed her amended verified complaint, in which Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., as nominee for Branch Banking and Trust Company (MERS) was substituted as defendant. MERS filed its answer, counterclaim, and crossclaim on June 18, 2012. Plaintiff filed her reply to the counterclaim on July 10, 2012; defendants Sarah and Marc Differ filed their answer to the amended verified complaint and their answer to the crossclaim on August 30, 2012. The pretrial conference was held on October 2, 2012. The Stipulation of the Parties was filed on December 3, 2012.
Trial was held on December 11 and 12, 2012. The court heard testimony from Nancy Chiarelli, Marc Differ, Sarah Differ, Mark Reenstierna, and Douglas Mercurio. Exhibits 1 through 34 were marked; the Parties Statement of Agreed Facts was marked as Exhibit 1. The Defendants Motion for Required Findings on Tort Claims and Breach of Contract Claims was heard and denied without prejudice.
Plaintiffs Post-Trial Memorandum of Law was filed on February 21, 2013. Defendants Sarah Differ and Marc Differs Proposed Findings of Fact and Requests for Rulings of Law were filed on February 22, 2013.

6. Nancy and Sarah are sisters. They grew up at the Property with their parents and their brother Greg. Exh. 1; Tr. I-21.
7. Their father passed away in 1982, and their brother passed away in 2002. Their mother, Elizabeth McCann Mills, passed away on May 3, 2011. Each of them was living at the Property when they passed away. Exh. 1; Tr. I-22, 69, 208.
9. By a deed dated March 9, 1984, and recorded in the Norfolk County Registry of Deeds (the registry) at Book 6355, Page 587 on March 9, 1984, Elizabeth McCann Mills conveyed the Property to herself and Nancy as joint tenants. Exhs. 1, 8; Tr. I-69-70.
10. In or around 2000, shortly after separating from and divorcing her first husband Robert Perch, Sarah and her daughter moved into the Property with her mother and her brother. Exh. 1; Tr. I-207-208.
11. Sarah and Marc met in 2000 when Sarah got a job at Marcs office. The two began a dating relationship some time in 2001. Shortly after September 11, 2001, Marc moved into the Property, and Sarah and he have continued live at the Property up through the present time. Exh. 1; Tr. I-208.
12. Marc was divorced in 2000. He had two children from his first marriage, with continuing weekly child support obligations of $380-400 for both children in total that began in 2000 and ended in 2009. Exh. 1.
13. In 2001, Elizabeth McCann Mills and Nancy gave a mortgage on the Property, as joint borrowers, to Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation, as lender, in the amount of $165,100.00 (the Chase Mortgage). The Chase Mortgage is dated December 4, 2001 and is recorded in the registry at Book 15904, Page 262. Exh. 9.
15. By a deed dated October 14, 2005 and recorded in the registry at Book 23010, Page 345 on October 17, 2005, Elizabeth McCann Mills conveyed all of her right, title and interest in the Property to Sarah. The deed provides: The intention of this deed is to convey one-half interest that I own in the above described property based on a deed dated March 9, 1984, whereby I had transferred another one-half interest to Nancy Ann Mills (i.e., Nancy, the plaintiff). The deed further provides that Elizabeth McCann Mills reserves for herself a life estate in the above described property. Exh. 1; Exh. 10.
16. On February 21, 2006, Sarah telephoned Nancy at work and said that she wanted to refinance the Chase Mortgage with a new mortgage from Value One Mortgage, the company at which Sarah worked at the time, to take equity out of the property. The outstanding amount due on the Chase Mortgage was $165,000; Sarah wished to refinance in the amount of $210,000. Sarah told Nancy that the purpose of the refinance was to fund repairs on the Property. Exh. 1; Tr. I-23-25, 188, 209-211.
17. The lenders attorney, Douglas Mercurio, had fedexed a deed to Nancy on February 15, 2006. In the February 21st conversation, Sarah told Nancy that she needed to sign this deed beforehand, to facilitate this refinance. Sarah said that the deed would have the effect of Nancy transferring her one-half interest in the Property to Sarah without Nancy having to fly up from Florida to Massachusetts to sign documents. Nancy said that she did not want to relinquish her interest in the Property forever. Sarah told Nancy that after the refinance, Sarah would execute a quitclaim deed to restore Nancys one-half interest in the Property. Nancy told Sarah that she did not understand the process, could not discuss it at work, and wanted to think about this request before agreeing to it. Sarah was upset. Exhs. 1, 33; Tr. I-30-31, 188, 211, II-21-22, 24, 27-28.
18. That evening, Nancy and Sarah spoke by phone. Sarah asked Nancy if she would agree to sign the deed. Nancy asked Sarah to put in writing Sarahs intentions about obtaining the deed for the purposes of the refinance and the putting Nancy back on the deed, and to fax them to Nancy. Nancy did not completely trust Sarah; she had a gut feeling that something just wasnt right. Moreover, she had no intention of giving up her interest in the Property after having lived there with her husband and done renovations before they moved to Florida. Sarah was upset, saying, Dont you trust me? but agreed. Exh. 1; Tr. I-31-32, 34-35, 188, 213-215.
19. The next day, February 22, 2006, Sarah prepared and faxed a letter to Nancy. In the letter, Sarah stated:
This has turned out to be a very sad day for me, when I was trying to help Mom with this burden that was left to her. And to help make repairs, that she has complained about for such a long time. I gave you my word that you were going to be placed back on the Deed today. You are going off for the recording of the new mortgage, at the same time of the recording you are going to be placed back on. I even asked [attorney] Doug [Mercurio] to send you a letter explaining this. He said he faxed it to you. I was able to get a low rate and was locked in for 15 days. I explained that we needed that quitclaim for this morning. Doug did say that if we knew you were defiantly [sic] going to have it in the mail today, that we may proceed with the loan. Why cant you trust me? What did I ever do to you? Are we sisters? Why dont you trust me, because Jack doesnt? Why dont you follow your heart? If you can let me know if youll be able to mail this today, we might be able to refinance at 4:30 today. After this is over we can talk about what you want out of the house, and take care of that down the road. Please call me. 781-986-6900. Your Sister, Sarah.
20. The same day, Nancy telephoned attorney Mercurio and expressed her concern about executing the deed without any assurance that she would be restored to her status as title holder. In response, attorney Mercurio faxed her a letter confirming that she would be restored as a Property owner after the new mortgage was signed and recorded. Exh. 34; Tr. I-74, II-28-30, 33.
21. Also on the same day, February 22, 2006, Nancy telephoned Sarah and accepted Sarahs offer and told Sarah that she was sending attorney Mercurio the signed deed. Nancy sent the signed by overnight mail to attorney Mercurio with a handwritten letter. The letter states:
I am signing this Quitclaim deed for the purpose of the refinance of the property at 29 Shelton Rd, Quincy MA, that Sarah Differ is executing in consideration that I will be put back on the deed to the property (as stated in your letter) at the time of the closing as it was prior to this refinance.
22. At this time, Marc was aware that Nancy wished to be restored as co-owner of the Property after the refinance transaction was completed. Tr. I-117, 119-120.
23. The deed that Sarah signed on February 22, 2006 was recorded at the registry on February 27, 2006 at Book 23430, Page 321. Exhs. 1, 12.
24. Sarah and Elizabeth McCann Mills as borrowers entered into a mortgage with HomeComings Financial Network, Inc., whereby Sarah borrowed $210,000 against the existing equity in the Property (the HFN Mortgage). The HFN Mortgage was recorded at the registry on February 27, 2006 at Book 23430, Page 323. Exhs. 1,14.
25. The HFN Mortgage refinanced and discharged the Chase Mortgage, the sole existing mortgage on the Property. The Discharge of Mortgage, discharging the Chase Mortgage, was recorded in the registry on March 21, 2006 at Book 23497, Page 90. Exhs. 1, 13.
26. At the closing of the HFN Mortgage, attorney Mercurio telephoned Nancy and told her the deed restoring her as co-owner of the Property had been signed. By a deed dated February 27, 2006, and recorded in the registry at Book 23430, Page 339, Sarah restored Nancy as an owner of the Property as joint tenant with Sarah. This deed also repeated the life estate held by Elizabeth McCann Mills. Exhs. 1, 15; Tr. II-43.
27. Sarah withdrew $46,239.11 in equity from the Property as a result of the 2006 transaction and deposited these funds in a joint savings account at Quincy Credit Union that she shared with Marc. Sarah and Marc intended to use the money from the 2006 transaction to consolidate debts and cash-out equity for home repairs. The debts included credit card debt that both Sarah and Marc had. Sarah did not tell Nancy that the money would be used for anything other than home repairs. Exhs. 1, 2, 3; Tr. I-115, 210-211.
28. Between 2006 and 2008, Nancy and Sarah did not have any discussions about the Property. Tr. I-36.
29. In May 2008, defendant Sarah telephoned Nancy and proposed another transaction concerning the Property. She told Nancy that she wanted to take out an equity loan for the sole purpose of making repairs to the Property, that she wanted Nancy to execute a quitclaim deed, and that attorney Mercurio was preparing the deed and would send it to Nancy to sign so that she would not have to fly up from Florida to sign the documents. Nancy replied, Oh, the same as last time? You are going to put me back on the Deed when this transaction is over? Sarah said, Yes. Sarah did not tell Nancy that she was not going to convey Nancys interest back to her after the transaction was completed. Nancy trusted Sarahs promise, based on the 2006 transaction in which they had done the same sort of exchange of deeds, and did not ask Sarah to put this promise in writing. Exh. 1; Tr. I-36-40, 215-217, 219.
30. Sarah had attorney Mercurio prepare a deed (the 2008 deed). The 2008 deed conveyed Nancys and Elizabeth McCann Millss interests in the Property to Sarah, thereby extinguishing the life estate of Elizabeth McCann Mills and vesting 100% of the interest in the Property in Sarah. In reliance upon Sarahs promise to reconvey a ½ interest in the Property to her after the refinance transaction, Nancy signed and returned the 2008 deed to Sarah. She then telephoned Sarah to let her know that she had received the 2008 deed, signed it, and sent it back. During that conversation, Nancy again said, You are going to put me back on the Deed as soon as you get the funds? Sarah replied, Yes. Exhs. 1, 16; Tr. I-40-41, 59-61, II-53-54.
32. At the time of this 2008 transaction, Nancy had no intention to give up her ½ interest in the Property forever for nothing in return, because she had lived there for 11 years, renovated the Property, and paid the mortgage and taxes. Also at the time of the 2008 transaction, Sarah did not believe that Nancy was relinquishing her ½ interest to Sarah forever. Tr. I-37-38, 220-221.
33. Marc was aware of the 2008 conversation between Sarah and Nancy, and was also aware that the conversation resulted in the 2008 deed. He believed that Sarah intended to put Nancy back on the deed and restore her interest. Tr. I-121, 140-141.
34. At no time has Nancy ever told defendant Sarah that Nancy desired to relinquish her interest in the Property to Sarah forever. Exh. 1.
35. The 2008 deed was recorded at the registry on June 2, 2008 at Book 25807, Page 215. Exh. 1; Exh. 16.
36. On June 24, 2008, Sarah and Marc (as co-signor on the note) entered into a subordinate mortgage with Quincy Credit Union for $40,000 (the Quincy Credit Mortgage). They withdrew the $40,000 as equity from the Property and deposited the funds into their joint account at Quincy Credit Union. The Quincy Credit Mortgage was recorded at the registry on June 24, 2008 at Book 25860, Page 148. Exhs. 1, 17, 18; Tr. I-166, 233.
37. Sarah and Marc refinanced the Property and gave the Quincy Credit Mortgage in 2008 in order to consolidate debts and cash-out equity for home repairs. They used the money to pay for some repairs to the Property. They also paid approximately $10,000 for an electric chair that would lift Sarahs mother, Elizabeth McCann Mills, up and down stairs, paid $13,000 for dental work for Marcs daughter, and paid down some credit card debt. Exh. 1; Tr. I-166-167, 233, 248-250, 252.
38. Sarah was laid off from her full time job at Waste Solutions in 2008. Since that time, she has worked, part-time 2 days per week, at Royal Spring Chiropractic for which she is paid $100/week. Marcs base salary in 2008 was $40,000; between 2008 and 2010 his commission income fell. Marcs annual child support bill was $20,000, so the majority of his income, after taxes, was absorbed by child support payments that were garnished from his wages. As a result, in 2008 Sarah and Marc were struggling to pay their bills. Exh. 1; Tr. I-163- 165, 229-232.
39. Approximately two weeks after she signed the 2008 deed, Nancy checked the registry online and saw that no deed restoring her interest in the Property had been recorded. She telephoned Sarah and asked Sarah why she had not yet been placed back on the deed to the Property as a joint tenant with Sarah. In response, Sarah said: Mom wants to talk to you when you come up in July. Sarah told Marc of this call. Exh. 1; Tr. I-42-43, 191, 224.
40. Nancy and her husband visited Massachusetts between July 11 and July 21, 2008. On July 20, 2008, Nancy and her husband were at the Property. Nancy, Sarah, and their mother, Elizabeth McCann Mills, had a conversation. In that conversation, Sarah and their mother told Nancy that Sarah was not going to restore Nancys interest in the Property. The reason, expressed by Ms. Mills, was that Nancy was not contributing to the Property, that she had left the house and hurt her, and that Sarah would leave the house in the family. Sarah said that she felt it was her turn, that she did not want to have to call Nancy every time she wanted to refinance, and that she had only restored Nancys interest in 2006 because Marc had told her to. Nancy responded, I trusted you. I signed this. You said you were going to put me back on. I never would have signed this had I known you were going to do this. Sarah said, Yeah, I know, Im the bad guy. Exhs. 1, 32; Tr. I-45-48, 67, 79, 80-82, 193, 198-199, 206.
41. This conversation upset all of them. Shortly after the conversation, Nancy and her husband left the Property. Rather than spending the night at the Property as they had planned, they stayed at a hotel before making their return flight to Florida the next day. Exhs. 1, 32; Tr. I- 48-49, 74, 199-200.
42. The next day, Nancy telephoned Sarah the next day and asked Sarah to restore her as a joint tenant owner of the Property. Sarah refused. Nancy also telephoned her mother that day. In that conversation, her mother told her that Sarah was going to put her back on the deed. Exhs. 1, 32; Tr. I-84-85, 88.
43. After those conversations, Nancy had some further conversations with her mother but did not take any further action with respect to the Property until 2011, because she did not want to upset her mother. Tr. I-85-87, 90.
44. Nancy did not speak to Sarah again about the Property until April 2011. Their mother was in the hospital. When Nancy was visiting the hospital, Sarah mentioned that she thought that Nancy and their mother still owned a parcel adjoining the Property called the beach property. Tr. I-50-51.
45. The next conversation that Nancy and Sarah had about the Property was in July 2011, shortly after their mother, Elizabeth McCann Mills, passed away. When Nancy was in Massachusetts to bury their mothers ashes, she told Sarah, We need to do something about this. Tr. I-51-53.
46. By a deed dated July 29, 2011, and recorded at the registry at Book 29007, Page 401, Sarah conveyed the Property to Marc, for a listed consideration of $570,000. The HUD settlement statement lists a Gift of Equity from Seller to Buyer in the amount of $300,000. Sarah did not obtain Nancys consent to perform this conveyance of the Property. Exhs. 1, 21, 23.
47. That same day, Marc executed a note and took out a mortgage on the Property for $270,000 through Lowell Cooperative Bank, as lender, and MERS, as mortgagee/nominee (the MERS Mortgage). The MERS Mortgage was recorded at the registry on August 1, 2011 at Book 29007, Page 403. Marc did not obtain Nancys consent to encumber the Property with the MERS Mortgage. Exhs. 1, 22, 26, 29.
48. Later that same day, Lowell Cooperative Bank executed a Notice of Assignment, Sale or Transfer of Servicing Rights transferring its interest in the MERS Mortgage to Branch Banking and Trust Company with MERS remaining as the mortgagee/nominee. As part of this transfer, Branch Banking and Trust Company and Lowell Cooperative Bank executed an allonge of the note on August 2, 2011. Exhs. 1, 27, 28.
49. Most of the money borrowed under the MERS Mortgage was used to satisfy the two prior mortgages on the Property, the 2006 HFN Mortgage for $210,000 and the 2008 Quincy Credit Mortgage for $40,000. A Release of Mortgage, releasing the HFN Mortgage, was recorded in the registry on August 8, 2011 at Book 29022, Page 484. This instrument served to release the mortgage entered into on July 22, 2006. A Discharge of Mortgage, discharging the Quincy Credit Mortgage, was recorded in the registry on September 16, 2011 at Book 29123, Page 349. Exhs. 1, 19, 20.
50. Marc took approximately $18,000 in equity out of the Property in 2011, which was used for repairs and debt consolidation, including paying off approximately $5,000 in credit card debt. Exh. 1; Tr. I-168-169, 245-246.
51. Nancy did not know about this transfer or the MERS Mortgage before it occurred. She discovered the transfer to Marc and the MERS Mortgage when she had a title search performed in August 2011, after her mother had died. Nancy called Sarah in August 2011, and told Sarah that she knew that Sarah had transferred the Property to Marc. Sarah said, I could sell this property for $800,000.00 today if I wanted to. Nancy replied, Well, so much for keeping it in the family. Sarah then said, Well my kids cant afford this place, and your kids are going to get your property, referring to Nancys property in Florida. Tr. I-53-59, 65-66.
52. Sarah admits that Nancy has never communicated to Sarah in any way at any point in time that Nancy wanted or was intending to relinquish her one-half interest in the Property to Sarah and/or Marc forever. Exh. 1.
53. As of July 2011, Sarah and Marc continued to use two accounts at Quincy Credit Union for all of their cash deposits and cash purchases. These accounts included the same checking account and savings account that they had used in 2006 and 2008. As of July 2011, just prior to the 2011 transaction, the defendants checking account balance was $147.53, and the defendants savings account balance was $12.98 as per Quincy Credit Union records. Exh. 1.
54. Sarah and Marc used proceeds from the HFN Mortgage, the Quincy Credit Mortgage, and the MERS Mortgage to make the following repairs and improvements to the Property:
Nancys amended verified complaint has seven counts. Count I is for intentional misrepresentation. Count II is for fraud in the inducement. Count III is for breach of contract. Count IV is for promissory estoppel, in the alternative to breach of contract. Count V seeks specific performance. Count VI seeks the establishment of a constructive trust. Count VII is for partition. Consideration of the partition claim was stayed, and it was not part of this trial. Based on the findings of fact set forth above, I treat each count in turn.
Intentional Misrepresentation. To recover on her claim of intentional misrepresentation, Nancy must prove that Sarah or Marc made a false statement of material fact in order to induce Nancy to agree to the 2008 transaction and execute the 2008 deed, and that Nancy reasonably relied on this false statement to her detriment. Masingill v. EMC Corp., 449 Mass. 532 , 540 (2007); Zimmerman v. Kent, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 72 , 77 (1991). Sarah or Marc must have known that the statement was false when either of them made it, or the statements truth or falsity must have been susceptible of actual knowledge. Id. The statement that Nancy alleges was false is Sarahs promise to restore Nancys ½ interest in the Property after the 2008 refinance was completed and her statement that she would use the money from the refinance for repairs to the Property. The evidence establishes that Nancy relied to her detriment on these statements, as she executed the 2008 deed surrendering her interest in the Property. The evidence further establishes that her reliance was reasonable, as the statements suggested that Sarah was proposing the same arrangement that they had made and completed in 2006. In fact, Nancy confirmed with Sarah that the 2008 transaction would be the same as the 2006 transaction. The evidence does not establish, however, that these statements were false when Sarah made them. Rather, the evidence establishes that Sarah did intend to restore Nancys ½ interest in the Property and to use the money for repairs when she made those statements in 2008. It is only after Nancy gave the 2008 deed and Sarah and Marc completed the refinance transaction that Sarah changed her mind and reneged on her agreement. Because neither Sarah nor Marc made a false statement of material fact in the 2008 transaction, Nancy has not proved her claim for intentional misrepresentation. Count I is dismissed with prejudice.
Fraud in the Inducement. Fraud in the inducement is a form of misrepresentation. It is contrasted with fraud in the factum.
The term fraud in the factum typically refers to the rare case when there has been fraud as to the essential nature of [a legal] instrument or an essential element of it. Frederico v. Brockton Credit Union, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 57 , 63 (1995). Fraud in the inducement, by contrast, occurs when a misrepresentation leads another to enter into a transaction with a false impression of the risks, duties, or obligations involved, Blacks Law Dictionary 686 (8th ed. 2004), but there is no fraud as to the essential nature of the transaction.
Suliveres v. Commonwealth, 449 Mass. 112 , 117 (2007); see Frederico v. Brockton Credit Union, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 57 , 63-64 (1995). As stated above, I find that Sarah intended to restore Nancys ½ interest in the Property and use the money from the refinance for repairs when she made her statements to that effect, and therefore did not fraudulently induce Nancy to agree to execute the 2008 deed. Count II is dismissed with prejudice.
Breach of Contract. To recover on her breach of contract claim, Nancy must prove that she and Sarah had a valid agreement, that Sarah breached her duties under the agreement, and that the breach caused Nancy damage. See Monadnock Display Fireworks, Inc. v. Andover, 388 Mass. 153 , 157 (1983); Daddario v. City of Pittsfield, 301 Mass. 552 , 555 (1938); Loranger Constr. Corp. v. E.F. Hauserman Co., 1 Mass. App. Ct. 801 (1973), S.C., 6 Mass. App. Ct. 152 (1978), 376 Mass. 757 (1978); Arthur D. Little Intl, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp., 928 F. Supp. 1189, 1201 (D. Mass. 1996). For a purported contract to be valid and enforceable, the parties must have reached agreement on all material terms and have had a present intention to be bound. Situation Mgt. Sys., Inc. v. Malouf, 430 Mass. 875 , 878 (2000); McCarthy v. Tobin, 429 Mass. 84 , 87 (1999).
Nancy and Sarah reached an enforceable agreement in 2008 on all material terms. The terms to which they agreed were that Nancy would convey her ½ interest in the Property to Sarah for the purpose of Sarahs refinancing the HFN Mortgage and taking out equity for repairs. In exchange, Sarah agreed to convey a ½ interest in the Property back to Nancy after the refinance was completed. Nancy and Sarah explicitly discussed these terms in their May 2008 telephone conversation and Sarah explicitly agreed to reconvey a ½ interest in the Property to Nancy. To the extent any of these terms were not made clear in their conversations, they were incorporated into the agreement by Nancys asking if this 2008 transaction would be the same as the 2006 transaction and Sarahs confirming of that understanding. See Simons v. American Dry Ginger Ale Co., 335 Mass. 521 , 523 (1957) (contract enforceable if meaning of its terms can be ascertained in light of attending circumstances). This agreement is hereafter referred to as the 2008 agreement.
Contracts quite similar to the 2008 agreement were held enforceable in Hurtubise v. McPherson, 80 Mass. App. Ct. 186 (2011), and Barber v. Fox, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 525 (1994). In both cases, the plaintiff conveyed a property interest to the defendant upon the defendants promise that he would convey property back to the plaintiff. See Hurtubise, 80 Mass. App. Ct. at 187; Barber, 36 Mass. App. Ct. at 526-527. In Barber, the agreement was between siblings and concerned family property, in that case the family farm. Id. In both cases, the Appeals Court found that the agreements were definite enough to be binding. Hurtubise, 80 Mass. App. Ct. at 190-192; Barber, 36 Mass. App. Ct. at 531.
Sarah breached the 2008 agreement with Nancy. She did not perform her obligation to convey a ½ interest in the Property to Nancy. The time for the reconveyance, based on the 2006 agreement whose terms were incorporated into the 2008 agreement, was to be as soon as possible after Sarah gave the Quincy Credit Mortgage which refinanced the HFN Mortgage. Sarah expressed her intent not to perform, thereby repudiating the 2008 agreement, no later than the July 2008 meeting at the Property between Sarah, Nancy, and their mother. This breach caused Nancy damage. Specifically, it deprived her of her ½ interest in the Property that she had conveyed to Sarah only in the expectation and agreement that it would be returned to her.
Sarah and Marc raise two affirmative defenses against Nancys breach of contract claim. First, they claim that the statute of limitations bars the claim. Leaving aside whether they properly preserved this defense in their answer, the breach of contract claim is not barred by the statute of limitations. The limitations period for contract claims is six years. G.L. c. 260, § 2. Sarah breached the 2008 agreement in July 2008, and this action was brought in 2012, well within the six-year limitations period.
Second, the Differs raise the defense of the Statute of Frauds. Under the Statute of Frauds, a contract for the conveyance of land is not enforceable unless it is set forth in a writing executed by the person to be charged. G.L. c. 259, § 1, Fourth. The 2008 agreement is a contract for the conveyance of land, namely the ½ interest in the Property, and it is not in writing. On its face, it is subject to the Statute of Frauds.
There is, however, an exception to the Statute of Frauds that applies to this case. A plaintiffs detrimental reliance on, or part performance of, an oral agreement to convey property may estop the defendant from pleading the Statute of Frauds as a defense. Nessralla v. Peck, 403 Mass. 757 , 761 (1989); see Andrews v. Charon, 289 Mass. 1 , 5 (1935); Hickey v. Green, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 671 , 673 (1982). Here, Nancy performed her obligation under the 2008 agreement by conveying her ½ interest to Sarah, and relied to her detriment on Sarahs promise to convey the ½ interest back to her. This exact reliance was found to be reasonable and to take an oral agreement out of the Statute of Frauds in both Barber and Hurtubise. In Barber, the Appeals Court held that the oral agreement in that case was not barred by the Statute of Frauds because
[a] contract for the transfer of an interest in land may be specifically enforced notwithstanding failure to comply with the Statute of Frauds if it is established that the party seeking enforcement, in reasonable reliance on the contract and on the continuing assent of the party against whom enforcement is sought, has so changed his position that injustice can be avoided only by specific enforcement. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 129 (1979), quoted in Hickey v. Green, 14 Mass. App. Ct. 671 , 673 (1982). This rule applies with particular force where the plaintiff had already provided consideration consisting, at least in part, of an interest in land.
Barber, 36 Mass. App. Ct. at 530. In Hurtubise, the court explained that the application of the equitable exception to the Statute of Frauds relied upon in Barber, has depended upon the degree of reliance on the oral agreement by the party pursuing specific enforcement. Hurtubise, 80 Mass. App. Ct. at 189. While earlier Massachusetts decisions laid down somewhat strict requirements for an estoppel precluding the assertion of the Statute of Frauds, . . . more recent decisions . . . indicate a trend on the part of the Supreme Judicial Court to find that the circumstances warrant specific performance. Id., quoting Hickey, 14 Mass. App. Ct. at 673- 674.
Nancy is in the same position as the plaintiffs in Barber and Hurtubise. She conveyed an interest in the Property to Sarah in reasonable reliance upon Sarahs promise to convey that interest back to her after the refinance. This conveyance constitutes part performance of the 2008 agreement, made in reliance on the agreement to Nancys detriment. Nancys change in position means that injustice can only be avoided by enforcing the 2008 agreement. Nancys conveyance takes the 2008 agreement out of the Statute of Frauds and renders the agreement enforceable. Id. at 189-190; Barber, 36 Mass. App. Ct. at 530-531.
Promissory Estoppel. Promissory estoppel is an expression not used in Massachusetts, since it tends to confusion rather than clarity. Loranger Constr. Corp. v. E.F. Hauserman Co., 376 Mass. 757 , 761 (1978). The doctrine to which the term refers is that an offer or promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance, and results in the other party reasonably acting or forbearing in reliance upon the promise, will be enforced as a contract. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Natl Bank v. Varadian, 419 Mass. 841 , 849-850 (1995); Loranger Constr. Corp., 376 Mass. at 760-761. The reliance substitutes for consideration, id. at 761, so that an action based on reliance is equivalent to a contract action, and the party bringing such an action must prove all the necessary elements of a contract action other than consideration. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Natl Bank, 419 Mass. at 850.
Sarah knew that Nancy was conveying her ½ interest in the Property in reliance upon Sarahs promise to convey that interest back to her after the refinance was completed. Nancys action in reliance upon Sarahs promise created an enforceable contract which, as described above, Sarah breached.
Specific Performance. Nancy has sought as a remedy specific performance of the 2008 agreement, that is, a judgment ordering Marc as owner of the Property to convey to her a ½ interest in the Property. [Note 1] Whether specific performance should be granted is within the sound discretion of the judge. Greenfield Country Estates Tenants Assn, Inc. v. Deep, 423 Mass. 81 , 87 (1996). Specific performance is a proper and usual remedy in disputes involving the conveyance of land. McCarthy, 429 Mass. at 89; Raynor v. Russell, 353 Mass. 366 , 367 (1967), and cases cited. Specific performance is favored because [i]t is well-settled law in this Commonwealth that real property is unique and that money damages will often be inadequate to redress a deprivation of an interest in land. Greenfield Country Estates Tenants Assn, Inc., 423 Mass. at 88. Sarah breached her contractual obligation to convey a ½ interest in the Property to Nancy. Nancy is entitled to specific performance of that obligation.
Sarahs 2011 conveyance of the Property to Marc does not prevent specific performance of Sarahs contractual obligation. Marc is a defendant in this case. He took title to the Property with full knowledge and actual notice of the 2008 agreement between Sarah and Nancy. Moreover, Marc did not provide any consideration for this conveyance. Marc gave the MERS Mortgage for $270,00, which satisfied the 2006 HFN Mortgage and the 2008 Quincy Credit Mortgage, and took $18,000 in equity out of the Property through the MERS Mortgage. The remaining $300,000 of the purchase price recited in the deed is listed in the HUD settlement statement as a Gift of Equity from Seller to Buyer. In other words, no money changed hands between Marc and Sarah as part of this 2011 conveyance. Given Marcs actual knowledge of the 2008 agreement and the lack of consideration, the conveyance of the Property to him in 2011 does not bar specific performance of the 2008 agreement. McCarthy, 429 Mass. at 89-90.
The MERS Mortgage is not an obstacle to specific performance, either. All parties, including the mortgagee of the MERS Mortgage, have stipulated that whatever the outcome of the trial in this action, the MERS Mortgage will remain a valid and enforceable lien in first position on the Property, and the parties will execute any necessary documents to confirm the validity of the MERS Mortgage in first position.
Nancy is entitled to specific performance of the 2008 agreement. A judgment shall enter ordering Marc to convey a ½ undivided interest in the Property to Nancy.
Constructive Trust. Nancy seeks the establishment of a constructive trust as an alternative remedy to specific performance. Because I am ordering specific performance of the 2008 agreement, there is no need to establish a constructive trust.
Partition. Consideration of Nancys partition claim was stayed pending the outcome of the other foregoing claims, which would determine whether she had an interest in the Property entitling her to partition. I am ordering specific performance of the 2008 agreement and the conveyance by Marc to Nancy of a ½ undivided interest in the Property. This conveyance will entitle Nancy to seek partition.
No final judgment shall enter at this time, as the conveyance to Nancy must be made and the partition claim adjudicated. As part of the partition, a commissioner needs to be appointed and a sale conducted. After the sale, the distribution of the proceeds and the allocation of proceeds from the various mortgages on the Property must be determined. In other words, further proceedings in this action are necessary. A status conference is set down for June 18, 2014 at 11:30 a.m. to discuss the next steps in this action.
[Note 1] The Land Court has jurisdiction to order the specific performance of contracts for the sale of land. G.L. c. 185, § 1(k).

Just picked up ME3. Want to import my Career from ME2. Was having issues with my hard drive and a guy at best buy told me I could transfer them over to a 16g usb and load them from there so I did. I MOVED them from my hard drive to my usb and loaded it up. worked great, played ME3 for a few hours and went to bed. next day after work tried loading it again and the USB is BLANK. All of my saved files and all of the work from the last 2 games are friggin gone. Tried downloading a PC save from the net that had most of the same decisions made that I had in my career, converted it to an x box save and tried transferring that to my (new) hard drive but the x box isn't recognizing that there is anything on the usb to transfer even though it shows up plugged into my laptop. Any ideas? I really don't want to go through ME3 with the default story line. i worked hard for 2 games and I want to play out the story that I started. Please Help!
Hi dude. I have the same problem, but also with the ME3 saves.

In Lost Light: An Interpretation of Ancient Scriptures (published in 1940, and available here for reading online in its entirety using the top link in the left-hand column which says "read online" or for download as a pdf using the link just below that one), Alvin Boyd Kuhn spends an entire chapter (entitled "Weighed in the Balance," beginning on page 480) discussing the concept of "judgment day" or the "judgment of the soul" found in ancient sacred texts and traditions.
On page 490, he specifically addresses a tradition that "the dead are summoned before the divine tribunal to be judged upon the day of doom, which occurs each New Years Day!" But he cautions, as he does throughout the book, that these kinds of ancient traditions are misinterpreted if we try to understand them literally.
What this ancient tradition really means, according to Kuhn, is that those of us in a current incarnation in the physical world (whom the ancient texts refer to as "the dead," in that the soul's descent into a physical body is a kind of "death" or "entombment in flesh," but which is only a temporary condition) are undergoing a kind of judgment day year in and year out (that is to say, "constantly" during this incarnation). Further down on the same page, he explains: "If the Day of Doom came once each year on New Year's Day, it was set only as an annual commemoration of a fact which was perpetual, constant, persistent throughout life."
He then goes on to explain that the famous depictions of the "weighing of the heart" in the "Hall of Judgment" or the "Hall of Two Truths" in the scrolls that have collectively come to be known (somewhat incorrectly) as the Egyptian Book of the Dead do not actually refer to an event that takes place in some other realm in the afterlife: just like everything else in the Book of the Dead (in Kuhn's interpretation) it has to do with things that we need to know about here and now, in this incarnation (this life)!
As argued in an earlier chapter, the Spiritual Guides of humanity gave the race a code of religious instruction that was meant to apply to the world in which it was given, not to a succeeding one. The seers were not concerned with teaching mankind about the supervening consciousness of the discarnate life. They taught humanity how to live in the world in which the teaching was imparted, well assured that philosophic behavior of life here would put them in favorable condition to meet the exigencies of the life of rest following the day on earth. They were vastly concerned to instruct mortals in what it behooved them to learn here, as this was the only realm in which progress could be made, -- unless it be contended that one makes greater progress in sleep at night than in one's waking life by day. 481.
And again, on page 484 Kuhn avers that the sojourn of the soul on earth during each incarnation is in fact the Hall of Judgment: "The horizon line between the two cherubim is the place of the Great Balance. The two Horus forms or lion gods are the two pillars of justice, and the judgment is the long series of decisions which the man himself renders as he journeys across." (Italics in original).
Man has entered the Gotterdammerung; he stands within the twilight. He stands on the mounts both of crucifixion and transfiguration, with the shadow of the two beams of the cross or the scales falling athwart his body. Every act, word and thought of his causes those arms of the scales to move up or down, according as he gives an impulse to spiritual or to sensuous expression. In their motion they write the scroll of his book of life, alternately upon outward feature and inner character. Every movement of the bars is a decree of judgment for him. Taht-Aan, the scribe and recorder, is filling the pages of his book. 496.
This passage certainly makes the whole process sound dreadfully ominous, as if the Book of the Dead taught the impossible doctrine that every sin would have to be avoided in order to avoid having one's heart tossed to the dreadful demon, Ammit, to be devoured. But Kuhn elsewhere explains that the process of passing through the scales in each incarnation was seen as the essential part of the progress towards overcoming incarnation:
To come forth guiltless from the scales may now be seen to convey the deep significance of the soul's emergence from earth life between the two horizons, washed clean and gloriously spiritualized. If the judgment had been adverse, the soul would have been cast to the monster Am-mit, which only means, however, return to animal incarnation until final purification. 491.
It is clear from explicit statements and analysis elsewhere in the book that by "animal incarnation" Alvin Boyd Kuhn here does not mean incarnation in the form of what we call "an animal," but rather he means that the soul would incarnate again as a man or a woman -- taking on a physical body again -- as part of the process.
As he says all the way back on page 41, "As the Egyptian most majestically phrases it, the soul, projecting itself into one physical embodiment after the other, 'steppeth onward through eternity.'" And again on page 251 he writes that the Egyptians believed that, "The soul is as the bee gathering sweet honey of immortality from the flowers of life experience on earth."
And yet again on the same topic, Kuhn writes on page 273 that "In this light it may be seen that the whole of the negative and lugubrious posture of theology as to 'sin' and 'death' as its penalty, might be metamorphosed into an understanding of the natural and beneficent character of all such things in the drama." That is to say, in Kuhn's analysis, because "sin" describes lessons that can only be learned as an incarnation of the divine spark of a soul united to the animal body of the flesh (a pure spirit cannot sin, and neither can a non-human animal -- only a man or woman, who is a combination of the spirit and the animal together can do so), and because by "death" the ancients meant "incarnation of the spirit again," the whole process is transformed from being a fearful one into a positive or beneficent one.
In light of all the forgoing discussion, and the point made way at the top that all this was metaphorically said to have taken place among "the dead" (that is to say, those incarnated right now) on New Year's Day, it is interesting to speculate as to whether the famous "negative confessions" which are found accompanying the scene of the weighing of the heart in the Hall of Judgment (the Hall of Two Truths) in the scrolls of many ancient copies of the Book of the Dead might have some relationship to our ongoing tradition of the "New Year's Resolution."
The so-called "negative confessions" were often forty-two in number, and are associated with Spell 125 of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Professor Raymond O. Faulkner (1894 - 1982) said that the name "negative confession" was self-contradictory, and that a better name for it would be "the declaration of innocence." Here is a portion of the forty-two declarations, as translated by Professor Faulkner (on pages 31 and 32 in this edition of his translation, published posthumously in 1990):
Those of us who try to make New Year's resolutions each year might do worse than to select from among the "declarations of innocence" in Spell 125 of the Book of the Dead any that personally resonate. Some of the confessions that are most compelling to me personally include:
O Disturber who came forth from Weryt, I have not been hot-tempered [see discussion in this previous New Year's post].
Alvin Boyd Kuhn's insight that subject matter of the Book of the Dead applies to our sojourn in this life is indeed revolutionary, and worthy of careful consideration.

Today I have Carlton Berkley, an ex-New York Police Detective, as a guest on the first hour of the show.
I came across Carlton's YouTube video where he tells the young people in the audience never to speak to a cop. That intrigued me and I found myself liking the matter-of-fact way in which Carlton talked to his audience.
I have a great distrust of police officers (or policy enforcers as I have come to learn that this is what they are) in America due to my own experiences and found it refreshing to hear Carlton talk. I endeavored to invite Carlton on to the show in my segments on Law and after a bit of digging eventually talked to him and invited him on to which he agreed.
If you didn't get with the program (behave the way they wanted you to behave - treat the pubic as the enemy or as us and them attitude) you would be considered an enemy of the police dept.

So many common garden plants can easily be steeped in hot water to make the most wonderful tasting, health-giving, refreshing tea.
I first experienced this phenomenon when Longrain in Melbourne first opened in 2006. The kitchen was headed by the fabulous Martin Boetz. After one of the most glorious, unbelievably delicious meals I have ever eaten we were served fresh lemongrass tea. It was a perfect way to conclude an outstanding experience.
There is a very important trick to making a good herbal tea – use hot water NOT boiling. Allow the kettle to cool for 5 minutes after it has boiled. I learnt this when developing a granita for classes when fresh mint seemed to be the essential ingredient. I made simple sugar syrup, then as it was simmering, dropped in a big handful of mint. The temperature was too much for this soft leaf herb and the whole complexity of flavours altered and stripped the freshness from this freshest of herbs.
When making mint tea in our Mystique of Morocco class adding tea leaves seems to render the mint flavour acceptable. Adding other plants such as rose geranium (I’m now growing for just this purpose) and lemon verbena lend more complexity and make it truly delicious.
Staff at The Agrarian Kitchen in Tasmania (pictured left) have over the years, nurtured a herbal tea garden into maturity.
Now of course, these herbs can be cooked with as well, but steeping tea is a sensible additional use for the quick-growing, softer herbs, who like being picked often. Many different mints are thriving here, tasting one after the other was a great lesson in the subtleness (or not so) of the minty flavours. Spearmint, apple mint and peppermint are the 3 that I would advise to plant. Beware though, they can overtake a garden bed, so if your space is limited plant in a pot!
Pick herbs as needing to use fresh for the simplest way to make tea. Or dry stems or flowers in shallow layers on a tray in a warm airy place. Turn a couple of times a day. After 4 to 8 days (depending on the weather) once dry, strip leaves and store in snap lock bag omitting as much air as possible. Store in a dark cool place. But not for long, herbs will lose flavour and aroma over time.
Only use flowers and leaves from a known source. Drinking tisanes that have had been sprayed is not such a healthy option.
So try infusing these few combos or individual herbs. Allow to steep in the hot water for a few minutes before drinking. Length of time is dependent on strength of tea you prefer. Serve with a touch of honey if you like, but deliciously refreshing without…

Over the last year, Rogers and Shaw, the two largest cable TV suppliers in Canada, have lost a total of 200,000 subscribers. That has enormous repercussions for TV producers, including animation studios.
YTV is one of the major outlets for Canadian TV animation. It is part of the basic cable package, which means that everyone who has cable TV in Canada automatically receives YTV. YTV receives money for each cable TV subscriber, and it has lost the fee from 200,000 people in the last year. In addition, it earns money from advertising and its ratings must have suffered by some amount, as some of those 200,000 people must have watched YTV.
Teletoon is part of a cable bundle, but surely some of those 200,000 people were paying for Teletoon. As Teletoon also sells advertising, the smaller audience has cost Teletoon income on two fronts.
The cable companies are rapidly diversifying away from TV. Rogers and Shaw have partnered in Shomi, a Netflix-like service that makes content available on demand. Rogers has now partnered with Vice, which will produce content for them. The money quote that justifies the deal is that there is a “dramatic shift in Canada’s media landscape which sees young people increasingly consuming news and entertainment from their mobile and digital devices.”
What are the repercussions for Canadian animation? It means that broadcasters such as YTV, Teletoon, and Family Channel will have less money to spend on new programming. Either they will buy less or buy the same amount but provide less money for each. Either way, the TV market for Canadian animation is going to get tougher. The future is online and the cable companies know it. The animation studios that grasp this are the ones most likely to survive.
Some studios seem to be diversifying, making deals with Amazon while also working on shows for their the traditional channels. I wonder if Netflix and Amazon will become the major players in the global media economy. That would give them some crazy bargaining power and screw with any attempts at Canadian protectionism.
Until now, the internet has only been a theoretical market. It's been a place to show your work, but not a place with an economic model that could sustain a studio.
Now with Netflix, Hulu, CBS. iTunes, Amazon and HBO in the U.S. and Netflix, Rogers and Shaw in Canada all migrating to the internet, the dam has burst. TV as we knew it is disappearing before our eyes.
Who knows how much animation these companies will be interested in or how much they'll be willing to pay?
The internet has disrupted the music, newspaper and publishing industries. It's about to disrupt television and the TV animation industry. In all disruptions, there are winners and losers. The winners are generally the ones who can ride the wave of change.
The animation industry in Canada has always been conservative and under-capitalized. There's been little desire or resources to experiment or to pursue new markets. How many Canadian studios have approached these internet TV companies?
Guru, Arc, and DHX are forging into the online market. I don't know what Nelvana or Mercury is doing.
I think as long as the Canadian government keeps up some subsidies, the work will stay in Canada. If they drop the subsidies though there's a good chance it'll all go to India and China, and like a lot of French animators, Canadian animators will have to move there to follow the work (lots of French guys working at Oriental Dreamworks and at Dreamwork's satellite studio in India.)
Way back in ONCE UPON A TIME, time - animation was for theatrical release - shorts playing between features. The coming of TV brought a sea change to the theatrical market - people were staying home to watch the box in their living rooms. As a result, many animation units/companies shut down. What's happening today is no different.
1 Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
3 And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.
6 Be anxious for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.
11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.
12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
While designing this sweet little thing for Keith and Casey, I came this close to finally knowing what a Hunger Game is. Not close enough, but still, this exists now.

I think we might clear 500k views by the end of the day and we *may have* added a tiny chance that you can win the Hunger Games that you participated in this afternoon, so let me know if you’re one of the lucky ones!

My outfit from a few days ago. I love Actual Pains baggy tank tops! They're so comfy and easy to coordinate. I have this one, their "Pentangled" tank and the "Sympathy for the Devil" tank and I love them all!
I also was wearing my white Docs for once. I've had them for years but hardly ever wear them because they don't have a zipper so it takes forever to put them on and off and I am too lazy for that. Its such a shame though because they are so cute.
You should wear them more they are awesome! I never tie my docs propperly, just loosely and then i put the laces through the last hole twice. It's faster to jump in and out :-)
Hmm maybe I'll have to try that out X3 I really do love them, I never broke them in enough to be very comfortable either. I should probably just suck it up and wear them XD
This is a personal fashion blog run by me, Jenna. I live in Portland, Oregon and love alternative fashion, cosplay, lolita, video games, anime, cats, art, pizza, skeletons, hair dye and platform shoes.
Welcome to Mobilized, the latest All Things Digital blog devoted to all things mobile. Mobilized will cover the wireless world from cell phones to tablets, as well as the networks they run on (or drop calls on).
If you are reading this on your Apple iPhone, Amazon Kindle, BlackBerry from Research in Motion, Google Android or other non-PC device: Congratulations, you are already Mobilized.
But, if you are sitting in front of a laptop or desktop as you are reading this–you might be a little behind the times, although on the plus side, you don’t have to squint nearly as much.
In any case, I am hoping to cut through the jargon and the hype, so that this will be a spot that both the early adopters and the merely curious will be able to find items of interest.
And whether you are a mobile geek or not, mobile technology is poised to reshape your life. Cell phones aren’t just mini-computers and tablets aren’t just notebooks with their keyboards cut off. These products are reshaping not just how we consume media, but also the ways we interact with each
For those that don’t know me, I spent the last decade at CNET, covering everything from Apple and Microsoft to ill-fated products from the Audrey to the Foleo.
While mobile hasn’t been my full-time beat, I have always been a device junkie. I owned a Windows CE 1.0 device and several of the first attempts to marry a phone with a Palm Pilot. Most recently, I have spent the past several years covering Microsoft full-time and recently did a three-part series on the birth of Windows Phone 7.
I am passionate about technology and telling the stories about the people making the products that are changing the way we live. I hope to find room to tell all kinds of different stories in these pages.
I plan to start things off with an interview I did last week in New York with Acer CEO Gianfranco Lanci. I also had a chance to catch up there with multitouch pioneer Jeff Han, who is beginning to shift some of his work from giant touchscreens to mobile devices.
Meanwhile, next week is the inaugural D: Dive into Mobile conference. I’ll be providing lots of coverage, of course, including backstage interviews with many of the speakers.
So, that’s my spiel. Be sure to sound off in the forums, whether you think I am right on track or completely off base. You can also drop me a note at the easy-to-remember email: Ina@AllThingsD.com.

This is the index page of plugins Emily Ravenwood and Ken Irwin have written or written patches for.
Please understand that most of our plugin work is done to fix a specific problem on one of our own sites. These are provided as-is, without support or any guarantee of continued development. That said, we wanted to share the fruits of our problem-solving, and I do hang out on the Support forums now and then. If I see something I can help with, I'll lend a hand.
Dialogue HTML Notifications sends html formatted email notification to the author when there is a new comment or trackback to a post. In addition to the usual comment and meta-information, the text replied to is included.
DHN is designed to work with 2.7 and later native threaded comments. It rewrites the existing post-author notification function so that email notification of new comments quotes the post (for top level comments) or the parent comment (for threaded comments) as well as the new comment.
Notifications preserve the standard information (commenter name, email, IP, url) and the standard links (delete, mark as spam, view entry), plus an extra (view comment thread). They are also html formatted for ease of reading.
Pingback/trackback notifications are formatted similarly, but they do not quote the post in question.
Note! Because any native function can only be rewritten once, DHN will not work if another plugin is also re-writing wp_notify_postauthor. In particular, DHN will not work if Spam Karma is running. Spam Karma can be hacked slightly to remove the conflict, but I do not really recommend this.
To install this plugin, unzip it and load it to your plugins folder, and activate it in the plugins management Admin panel.
Thread Email Notification sends an email notification to the parent-comment author when a reply is made to a threaded comment.
TEN is designed to work with 2.7 and later native threaded comments. It allows comment-conversations to go on without commenters needing to subscribe to a post's rss feed or re-check the page frequently.
Both parent comment and new comment are quoted, and the notification is html formatted for ease of reading. A link to the comment thread is provided for ease of replying. Only the replier's name is disclosed; the email is sent from the WP default address and no other personal information is included.
If the parent comment is by the post author, TEN will not send a notification but leave that to the native author notification function, so as to prevent double notifications. (If you wish to have post-author notifications that quote both parent and new comment, try the Dialogue HTML Notifications plugin.)
This is a plugin to load and display local user avatars (as opposed to an avatar from a central service like Gravatar) in WordPress. It allows registered users with Author or above capabilities to load an image of their choice to use as an avatar on a WordPress installation.
LUA works on top of the get_avatar() function native to 2.5 and later. Your theme must include get_avatar in the comments template in order for LUA to have an effect. In 2.7 and later, this is automatically included in the wp_list_comments function, and will not need to be added as long as your theme uses that function.
To add avatars to earlier versions, open the comments.php file of your theme and paste in <?php get_avatar(); ?> where you wish the avatars to appear.
Warning! Like any file upload function, LUA is a potential security breach. To secure it as best as possible, the upload form cannot be accessed directly, it is set to accept only files with recognized image-type extensions and to be accessible only to users who have file uploading privileges (Author and above). This code can be altered to apply to Suscribers by changing 'upload_files' to 'read', but I do not recommend it unless you personally vet every subscriber and make sure they are a) human and b) trustworthy.
Note: If your theme uses get_avatar to produce post author avatars, this will also affect those. You may, in fact, wish to use this plugin for that purpose. To do so, make sure <?php get_avatar(); ?> is pasted into your theme next to the post author name in archive.php, index.php and single.php.
To install this plugin, unzip it and load it to your plugins folder, and activate it in the plugins management Admin panel. Make sure avatars are enabled, in the Discussion panel.
Go to the Users admin panel and look for the Local Avatar submenu. This page will let you upload, change and delete your local avatar. Your local avatar will take effect immediately upon upload.
This plugin fetches a default LJ-clone icon to use as a commenter's avatar. If a commenter has an LJ-clone account, commenting with username@service (janeuser@livejournal, for example) in the Name field will retrieve their default icon and cache it locally for future use. If they are logged in with OpenID, using an LJ-clone account, that will also work. If none of these is true, the native Gravatar function will go on as normal.
ALA works on top of the get_avatar() function native to 2.5 and later. Your theme must include get_avatar in the comments template in order for ALA to have an effect. In 2.7 and later, this is automatically included in the wp_list_comments function, and will not need to be added as long as your theme makes use of that function.
You may wish to include a note, in your comments.php form, informing commenters that entering username@service as their Name will fetch their LJ-clone icon. (If they happen to use @service.com by reflex, this is not a problem, the plugin will still handle it.)
ALA extracts the avatar size defined in your theme, if any. If none is defined, then avatar size is set to 80x80 pixels.
This plugin is the rewrite of User Icons: LJ and Gravatar, which simply patched Tim Werner's Gravatar and Alexander Bishop's LJ icon-finding plugin. With the advent of a native gravatar function, OpenID, and the proliferation of LJ-clone services, we decided to rewrite this one almost completely. Only Bishop's LJ-icon-fetching code is still included.
Note: If your theme uses get_avatar to produce post author avatars, this will also affect those. This should only happen if the author has entered their LJ-clone account url as the website in their profile.
Admin Overlap Fix fixes the layout bug in 2.7, wherein setting your browser for any font size larger than 12px causes the top level admin menu items to overlap the page content.
AOF inserts a line of CSS into the admin header that rewrites the faulty line of original code. Your menu should then conform to the width of the longest item.
If you require a font size larger than 20px, it is possible that even this plugin will not be sufficient. If that is the case, you may wish to explore the possibilities of the Fluency admin layout plugin or, if you write CSS yourself, the Add Admin CSS plugin.
Folding Archives is a template page that will display your all blog's posts in a collapsed list by year, month and day.
FA is the answer to the problem of WP's inflexible archive display options. Each year and month can be expanded and collapsed to show the months and days underneath them, so your entire blog archives can be browsed on a single page that remains reasonably short.
Unzip archives.php.zip and place the file in your theme folder. The file is compatible with the Default theme, so you will probably want to customize it to your own theme.
To do so, open your theme's page.php. Copy everything except the comments at the top. In archives.php, starting on line 140, replace the code with what you copied from your page.php. Underneath the_content, add the code:
This is what creates the list. You may wish to paste your page.php code in above the existing code and then compare them before deleting the existing code.
If you have not done so already, go to your admin interface and make a new page (page, not post) with a suitable title and any text you wish to appear above your archive list. Select "Archives" from the template dropdown.
The native WordPress function for listing categories comes with an option to show parent-child relations. This involves a lot of repetition, however, so that instead of just X > Y > Z it shows X, X > Y, and X > Y > Z.
SC will take effect anywhere the function the_category() is called, which is most likely to be in index.php, archive.php and single.php, depending on your theme.
By default, the separator between strings of categories is a line break. If you wish to use something different, open up sleek-cats.php and look on line 21, where it says: $sep = "<br/>";
Change <br/> to your prefered separator (a comma or a pipe or anything else you prefer). Make sure that any spacing you want is inside the quotes, for example ", " or " | ".
This plugin generates a form to send a brief, set message, rather than an individual comment, in response to a post. It is designed for fiction archives, though it can be adapted for other uses. Each quick comment generates an email notification.
There is also an option to include a count of quick comments recieved in the post metainfo, in archive view, though this requires you to paste a short line (see readme.txt in the zipped folder) into archive.php.
Place this code in comments.php where you wish the quick comment form to appear (e.g. just before or after the regular comment form:

This plugin was written as a companion for OpenID registration. Some sites that support OpenID also support Simple Registration, which passes on such information as email addresses, but some don't. LiveJournal, for instance, does not. Because I use threaded comments with emailed replies on most of my installations, I needed some fairly unobtrusive way to prompt OpenID LJ visitors to enter their email addresses. This plugin was the result.
If a user is logged in but does not have an email address entered, a form will come up just above the comment form, prompting them to enter an email. Once entered, the email is written to their profile and the form goes away.
This plugin needs to be unzipped and placed in the plugins folder. A brief section of code (see readme.txt in the zipped folder) needs to be placed in comments.php just before the comment form.
This is a slightly altered version of Evan Broder's wonderful LJ Crossposter plugin. The plugin takes posts you make on WordPress and crossposts them on LJ, according to a variety of options you can set and alter individually. It's really a work of art.
It adds on-off switches to all options, so that, eg, you can post with no header/footer at all, if you perfer.
This plugin works straight out of the box. Unzip the file, place it in your plugins folder and you're good to go.
This file contains several patches that can be added to the LJXP plugin. Adding these will require opening the LJXP php file and copying and pasting code into it. Directions are included in the comments of the file.
To prevent crossposting before or after a specified post. If you want only only posts before or after Entry X to be crossposted, use this.
To strip commas from categories. Because LJ's tag separator is a comma, any category that has a comma in it will be broken in two when crossposted. This removes the commas.
To make Hide or Cut Text cuts appear as LJ cuts when crossposted. This is the patch in the patched plugin above.

McSherry & Hudson has been in business for over 100 years. One principle has stayed consistent, our commitment to providing the best service and advice for our clients so that they can protect and grow their business for future generations.
The oldest of 5 brothers, Eugene McSherry, was forced to quit college while attending Stanford University and return to Watsonville due to the death of his father in 1911. His father had a small business which included insurance, notary public service, and a bookkeeping service which had been started in 1905.
While at Stanford, Gene roomed with Fred R. Hudson, a Watsonville native born in 1890. Fred graduated from Stanford in 1913, majoring in business with an emphasis on insurance. One of his instructors was instrumental in writing the first workers’ compensation law that the state legislature put into law on July 1, 1913.
After Fred had graduated he came to Watsonville to help Gene McSherry with the new law requirements and a working partnership began. Fred began to provide workers’ compensation for many of the Pajaro Valley business.
He told of sitting on the front porch of the Mansion House on Main St. with clients, writing up policies to meet the yearly deadline. A “special agent” (salesperson) from one of the insurance companies was on hand to sign the policies.
McSherry & Hudson became a business center providing not only insurance, bookkeeping, and notary public services, but also real estate appraising, fresh fruit brokerage, and apple packing supply sales.
McSherry & Hudson has been ingrained in Central and Northern California for well over a century, continuing to form relationships built on trust, knowledge, and sound advice. Here is to the next 100 years.

The Honda Fury nonetheless just takes the lunch of the Raider in every conceivable aesthetic parameter, when you aspect in these somewhat modest style spots. The Securing Erect ceiling bicycle stand for vehicles is a perfect option Tandem Bike Rack if you eventually have crossbars on the roof of the vehicle currently. What's more, this can be cheap, roof-mounted bike holder for automobiles, sedans, section wagons and SUVs that lets you preserve the wheels on your own drive (many other programs need you to remove the front wheel). For most of us, problem or rear door mounted bike racks for vehicles are the smartest choice: they're more easy to load and unload.
The very best cycle racks built for automobiles make use of one's vehicle's outside capabilities, solidly keeping your cycle on the exterior of the auto and enabling you to mount them beyond your car, properly. Each one features of connecting an unique means, and goods that are different may suit an alternative kind of auto determined by what design you've, or your real capabilities.
It is a bit more costly, but this problem mounted choice is among the best and best cycle racks for some cars, hatchbacks. I would suggest it to those who have a heavier cycle and it is focused on stability (downhill mountain bikers, this means you!). That is another of the problem centered tray techniques, so you'll need-to ensure your car has one. It is a 2 2 program, meaning it may be easily altered to be always a 2 or a 4 bike service. There's likewise a-2 bicycle car hitch rack version accessible, follow the hyperlink and it should be listed.

TMI’s Science and Exploration program has strengthened our climate change, conservation, and sustainable development programs through using integrated, applied field research. We developed applied climate change and conservation research programs, higher education resource materials, international photo exhibits, and public presentations. The Science and Exploration program co-managed the High Mountains Adaptation Partnership (HiMAP), funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). HiMAP was initiated in March 2012 following the successful 2009 “Adapting to a World without Glaciers” workshop in Peru and the 2011 “Andean-Asian Mountains Global Knowledge Exchange on Glaciers, Glacial Lakes, Water & Hazard Management” in the Mt. Everest region of Nepal. Created and implemented by The Mountain Institute (TMI) and the University of Texas at Austin (UT), HiMAP has actively strengthened scientific, social, and institutional capacity for climate change adaptation and resilient development, along with disaster risk mitigation. A specific focus has been management of potentially dangerous glacial lakes and other climate-related disasters in glaciated regions of Peru, Nepal, and elsewhere in the high mountain world. The Partnership has implemented a series of innovative and inter-related activities, including:
State of the art rapid reconnaissance methods for the evaluation of potentially dangerous glacial lakes. These have been developed and applied in Nepal and Peru, where they link the best of modern technologies with traditional on-the-ground field methods.
South-south collaboration and exchanges. HiMAP has connected Asian and Andean countries with similar needs in climate adaptation and glacial risk management.
Local Adaptation Plans for Action (LAPAs) for the Khumbu region of Nepal and the Cordillera Blanca of Peru. These local-scale climate-change adaptation plans are based on the principles of full community participation, climate smart development, ecosystem-based adaptation approaches, risk mitigation, and disaster management planning.
A high mountain glacial watershed “community of practice.” The HiMAP community of practice is actively sharing knowledge internationally between high mountain scientists and practitioners, undertaking comparative analyses, implementing climate change adaptation projects, and influencing high mountain policy.
A new generation of mountain-scientists. The young scientists supported by HiMAP are fluent in climate change and adaptation issues, field as well as laboratory methods, integrating traditional knowledge, active community engagement, and climate-smart development in high mountain glacial watersheds.
A portfolio of peer reviewed and popular publications, videos, public, and professional presentations.
Global awareness of the critical importance of high mountain glacial watersheds. Donors, international agencies, and governments are now more familiar with mountain issues thanks to HiMAP.
An Everest Alliance. A collaborative organization of Khumbu residents and visitors has been initiated that will help solve the social and environmental problems of the Mt. Everest region—and later of other iconic mountains worldwide.

In general, banks prefer to have judicial system that apply clear rules and have a well established jurisprudence.
Nevertheless, in emerging economy, banks suffer from the lack of understanding of the judicial system of the banks operations. The specificity of the banking contracts are disregarded by judges. Moreover, the Islamic banks systems are totally ignored.
To avoid the risk of the legal and judicial system in the countries of emerging economy, Arbitration becomes a necessity. Then, the advantages of the arbitration should be kept and solutions to disadvantages should be found. The solutions are at three levels: drafting arbitration clause, establishing an institution of arbitration within the Central Bank and given the arbitration awards the same effect of judicial judgments.

On Sunday, and Saturday actually, Alfonso had descended upon UK thanks again to The Weekend Workshop once more to impart his knowledge of colors and painting upon us unsuspecting people! Quite the cast and crew appeared once more for this class, many familiar faces from previous classes appeared!
However, due to the family returning from Turkey on the Saturday I was unable to attend.... the whole thing that is!
I dragged Junior along with me for a day out to see the painters and do some bonding time before school begins once more. We even brought some of junior's Lizardmen models, and he had a crack at them over the day..
Which lasted all of 30 minutes before he switched over to legos, or coloring, or more legos, or back to painting or, or, or.. yeah.. you get the picture.. but considering that he was there for the whole day he was quite well behaved ( told by others, not just his old man here! ).
Which as you can see was important as the store began to fill up with painters for both Alfonso's class, and also John's fundamentals class.
But the main purpose of the trip was to see the 2 main guys do their thing, and see what kind of information I could glean off of them.
As you can see from the huddle here, the techniques being taught were highly secretive! And thus held in great esteem and close attention by the attendees there... except Peter. Seems he didn't sleep much and thus was yawning the entire day.
Luckily I was able to sneak a shot of the test piece, and some of the instructions laid out from Alfonso here in the class... the rough sketch of light and shadows was the main focus for the NMM aspects.. and how to break a model into parts was also clear from random paintings on the white paper..
Craziness as always in a painting class.. but with all the teachings, you can see how the students got right down to work here.
Of course Mike was there again, and as always the only thing I could understand from him was his tattoo..
Though while all this was going on, John was also running a beginners class on the fundamentals of painting on a separate table. One that Sam sat on as well, and was looking on with fascination..
Quite the group appeared here to learn how to make paint flow better, where to put highlights and shadows, and general painting theory. Was a unique little class structure that also included a figure ( Hordes Troll ) and 3 Army Painter brushes. Plus John explaining things to you in proper scouse fashion.
No idea how or why John had blue and white paint on his lips, or the black smudge on his face, but junior couldn't stop pointing at it and asking if he should stop painting maybe to clean up.
Though jokes aside, the group learned quite a lot from John, and I think we can see some great looking gaming pieces coming from them soon! Watch out tournaments and local clubs as these guys are aiming for the Best Looking Army awards!
At the end of the event though, we all said our goodbyes. Thanked the teachers. Thanked the owner of the store for letting us take it over for the weekend. And picked up our loot from the weekend of shopping ( I mean we are in a gaming store.. who can resist that temptation? ).
Alfonso also graced the Lee Family with his presence after the workshop and spent some time around the Lee Studio giving some advice on composition for a few pieces. Thanks again for the time spent, and the good chats after what can only be described as a long tiring but successful weekend of teaching!
And I am smiling.. just have too much epic beard to show it properly! Until the next encounter and adventures in painting! Enjoy the day before the end of the week...
That is so cool. Spending time with your junior AND your hobby in the same time is just great. And seems he quite liked it too.
Life long dream mate.. getting to combine the 2... best thing for Junior is when he grows up I will most likely still have plenty unpainted so he can pick and choose what he wants to work on! :D
Having just attended some painting classes...I highly recommend them. It's great you can enjoy them with junior!
Yup. That is my philosophy for the most part. Join and learn from as many sources as you can, while you can! And yes, all the better when I can take junior with me indeed!
Well I have come to the point where I need to call this beauty finished. At least for now. My energy levels are already quite depleted ...

Have you ever been through a series of weeks in your life when you feel like everything is going wrong and you’re being pecked to death by angry chickens? Maybe your work life is insanely busy, or your family’s schedules keep colliding, or you just need to simplify. Perhaps, like me, your kids have been ill and all your appliances decided to break at once. It’s been fun around here, let me tell you. I wrote about ways to connect with your sanity here when things get nutso.
Staying chill in the face of chaos is important. When life goes crazy, though, it’s critical to keep the family ties pulled tightly. Last fall, I had the chance to speak to mothers at my school through the iMom program about shortcuts that will simplify your chaos so that you will have more time left over to connect with your family. Here are a few of the highlights.
Since I have never started, this one is delightfully easy for me. That’s what dryers are for, right? If the thought of letting your iron collect dust gives you heartburn, then only pledge to put your ironing board away until things quiet down. Get yourself a bottle of spray wrinkle remover if you aren’t pleased with your dryer’s de-wrinkling skills. If you’re super-cheap like me, the brand from your dollar store does just fine. I swear that stuff has saved me hours of work and really helped me simplify. This wonder-spray does not work on the stress wrinkles folding in on your face, though. Just sayin’. No, I didn’t try it. Seriously.
Pick up your clutter and stick it in a box or basket until you have time to sort it. You can hide the container of random junk so that your house doesn’t appear completely destroyed. Limit yourself to those couple of chores that will drive you nuts if left unattended. For me, I need to keep the toilets clean and sweep the kitchen floor. Dusting and vacuuming can wait. Febreze will keep the stink under control. Just don’t spray this on your kids in lieu of baths. I haven’t tried this either.
No one ever died from eating a chocolate Pop-Tart for breakfast for a few days in a row. Lunchables won’t kill anyone for a few days either. Throw in a few raw veggies here and there, and you’ve got it made. Now is the not the time for carefully packed Bento Box lunches or gourmet dinners. Hit the local drive-thru and move on. Chicken nuggets never hurt anyone.
Venting to friends is great, but it can be a time suck if neither of you can come to any solutions. Take that time you might usually spend griping to meditate. Sitting quietly and slowing your thoughts down for fifteen minutes is good for the soul and your overall health. You might even come up with a solution or two. Busy times end eventually, but venting uselessly can prolong the agony.
At the end of a long day, I love to aimlessly scroll through Facebook. Spying on everyone reading nice articles on social media has its perks, and watching funny cat videos can soothe a worn-down mind. Limit your time on-line, though. This time-waster can really stymie your productivity. Besides, now isn’t the time to drool over Pinterest projects or look at pictures of beautifully organized Pinterest-y homes. It’ll just make you depressed. Save that luxury for calmer times—like, never?
Now that you’ve simplified by wearing wrinkly clothes, eating junk food, and Febrezing your way to a clean house, take time to really be present with your spouse and your kids. Discuss their days, make something, color, or play a game. It’s amazing how little time an Uno match will take, but your kids will benefit greatly from that fifteen minutes of uninterrupted time with you.
This craziness will pass. Trust me. Life will get back to normal eventually. But while you’re waiting for things to slow down, your kids are growing up. Your job, schedules, and other obligations don’t deserve to take these years away from you. So head to your nearest fast food joint, load up on some fries and shakes, and head to the prettiest place in your town for a little picnic. It only takes a few minutes to make a memory!
So simple. yet so true, Jennifer. Your lighthearted suggestions to a simpler life are funny, helpful and important. When all is said and done, I’m sure your children will think back on many wonderful times making happy memories with family. Thanks for reminding us what is important! Wish I had done a better job. Enjoy your bogs.

In today's "I need it yesterday" marketplace, many security firms are forced to put their client's need above our own. Security companies spend so much time protecting the assets of others that they neglect the protection of their own valuable assets. Here are two simple steps to make sure you've got a handle on protecting your own property:
Take an inventory. How long has it been since you updated your inventory records? If tools or protective devices were stolen or damaged, would you have the necessary information for the police or insurance company? Keeping an accurate list of all of your equipment, including the acquisition price, date of purchase, manufacture model & serial numbers will speed up claim payments and may assist law enforcement in returning your property.
Determine the value of your property. When was the last time you calculated how much you spent on your furniture, fixtures and equipment? It is essential to take into consideration not only what these items originally cost, but also how much you will need to get your operation started again, should you suffer a loss.

Since schizophrenia is a brain disorder, it is usually treated with antipsychotic medications. In addition to the medication, it may also be treated with therapy. This disorder needs to be managed with medication but there are also substitute options that you can pair with that. New studies show that cbd gummy can help in treating some health conditions like schizophrenia.
It is said that people who suffer from schizophrenia have low levels of folic acid or B9, so taking these supplements can help reduce the symptoms of the disorder. It could also be beneficial to start taking vitamin C, E, and D supplements.
Fish oil is packed full of omega-3 fatty acids. These are known to help reduce inflammation in parts of the body and many mental illnesses are caused, in part, by inflammation. Schizophrenia is included in this. Another thing is this helps heart health and people with schizophrenia are at higher risk of suffering from metabolic syndrome, which can cause heart issues.
Glycine is an amino acid and it works with glutamine, which helps enhance the functions of the brain. High doses of glycine might help antipsychotic drugs to treat this disorder. There are some drugs, like clozapine, that glycine might actually make less effective.
While diet change doesn't work for everyone, there are people who have benefited from it. The diets that have been shown to help are: the ketogenic diet and a gluten free diet.
Since medication is needed to help with this disorder, don't just stop taking your meds and decide to do some of these treatments. Make sure you discuss to your doctor before starting anything because some of these might make your medication less effective. Ask your doctor what he or she recommends and see what else you can do to help your specific needs.

The Media Research Center is reporting ABC openly admitted this past Sunday to having published “fake news” about the Trump administration “losing” 1,500 migrant children, a debunked story that quickly caught fire and spawned countless hashtag campaigns and anti-ICE protests across the country.
Now, according to MRC, well after the myth has been permanently ensconced as fact in the brains of millions of rapid anti-Trumpers nationwide, ABC's admitting the entire thing was false – but, in a stunning feat of mental gymnastics, they claim the bogus story ended up being a good thing.
In an article actually entitled, “A fake news story helps expose a real crisis,” author Lauren Pearle admits the Trump administration was unfairly accused of having “lost” 1,500 kids who’d crossed the southwest U.S. border illegally – a claim I’d disputed in a video roughly four weeks ago, only to be accused of Nazism by radical progressives.
But by ABC’s own admission, the administration didn’t “lose” anyone; they’d simply placed these kids with sponsors, usually a family member, who didn’t respond when the government tried to check up on the child.
The network suggests the “fake news” ended up being a great thing because it blew the lid off the Trump administration’s family separation policy. Here's an actual excerpt from ABC's piece:
“But all the digging had uncovered a separate issue that had also been reported, but had not yet captured the nation’s full attention: the Trump administration’s practice of separating migrant children from their parents at the southern border, which accelerated under the ‘zero-tolerance’ policy announced in April.
“...That outcry, which reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, took months to unfold. And it largely began with a search for children who probably weren’t missing after all."

Originally released in the 70's, the API 525 is a "feedback" type compressor, such as the 1176 and 660, etc. An input (threshold) control and output (make-up gain) control are provided. An additional "Ceiling" fine tune function modifies threshold and make-up gain for precise changes in compression without changes in output. A compression/limit switch sets ratio at either 2:1 or 20:1. Attack time is as fast as 15u/s. Four auto release modes are offered via two switches, 0.1s, 0.5s, 1.5s, & 2.0s. A De-Ess function inserts an inverse vocal energy curve filter in the detector for effective sibilance/p-pop reduction. The 525 is an identical re-issue of one of the most popular API products ever.
The API 527 takes it's place alongside the family of API VCA based compressors, the 225L and the 2500 Stereo Bus Compressor. Anyone familiar with those units will immediately be at home with the 527. Features common to the line like "feed forward" (NEW) and "feed back" (OLD) gain reduction methods selectable on the front panel, provide a choice of "that old way", or "the new way" of compression, for the highest level of flexibility in signal gain control. The "old way" or Feed-Back method is what most of the classic compressors used for the gain control circuit. The "new way" gain reduction is more typical of the newer VCA type compressors that rely on RMS detectors for the gain control voltage.
4 bandes paramétriques / 4 unités configurables avec préamp et / ou EQThe API 550 EQ played a major part in the history of music recording in the USA during the 60's and 70's. Originally conceived for use in API's consoles, this latest 550 "B" version is a continuation of the original 1967 550 through the 550A with one additional filter band and several new frequencies. Incorporating API's exclusive circuitry and proprietary components (such as the legendary API 2520 op-amp), the 550B artfully blends the past with the present. So many hit records still depend on the unique 550 sound, that the 550B will be an invaluable tool you will turn to again and again. The API 550B-unlike any other you will ever use.
10 bandes graphiques / 4 unités configurables avec préamp et / ou EQ Originally conceived for use in API Consoles of the 60's and 70's, the API 560 re-issue is a unique device designed to accomplish tasks that no other EQ can do. It delivers that "one-of-a-kind" API sound, precision easy set filtering, and high headroom in a very small package. Extremely fast to set and reset using accurate zero detents, the curve shaping potential of the 560 is unmatched. At home both in field recording and the studio environment, this "new-old" version is a re-issue of the original 560 with improved resolution in the critical area of ±4 dB. Incorporating API's exclusive circuitry and proprietary components (such as the legendary 2520 op-amp), the re-issue of the 560 artfully blends the past with present-...

Need creative ideas for summer? The first week or two is always a blur, but once optimal routine sets in you may find yourself fresh out of ideas for the summertime. When you need a quick, fun activity you don’t want to get sucked into hours on Pinterest; you need something to do with your children to keep things lively and creative. So, here you go–30 ideas for 30 days worth of fun and creativity.
You can use this list/calendar as a guide by doing one of the activities daily. Or if you want to spread them out, you can choose to pick an activity a day Monday through Friday lasting for the next 6 weeks. If you want to get crazy, you can mix all the ideas up and then allow your children to pick one a day. Make yourself a “creative jar” so you can be spontaneous. It’s entirely up to you.
For preschoolers keep it simple and use markers to draw pictures. Have them find something blue, something brown, something round, something sharp, something soft and something hard. For the elementary school aged child, use more complex ideas such as something that tastes good, something you would feed your dog, something that starts with “T.” Keep it fun and straightforward.
Take some water bottles (the kind with the squirt lid) fill with water and have a contest to see who can “paint” the most creative image on your driveway or blacktop. Keep it even more interesting by saying the picture is completed when the bottle of water is gone…no more water refills.
Use some fresh fruit, blend with a small amount of water and then put into popsicle molds for a wonderful afternoon treat. Our favorite is 2 bananas, 6 strawberries and ½ cup water blended and poured into molds. If you don’t have popsicle molds, you can use old yogurt containers and freeze the delicious fruit blend with a fork stuck smack dab in the middle.
Find a fun meal; it can be anything you want, and learn to use chopsticks together. Use them for an entire day. If your child is very young, take your chopsticks and a small bouncy ball and secure the bouncy ball between the chopsticks at one end so your child can master it with more control. If you didn’t know already, you could also buy trainer chopsticks.
Using a vegetable peeler and long carrots (not the mini baby carrots) slice off long shreds of carrot and then make into a fresh “spaghetti” of sorts allowing your child to eat their vegetables with their fingers. For added fun, dab a bit of ranch dressing over the top and have them eat their “spaghetti” with chopsticks!
Grab a stick of chalk and a few rocks, the rules are simple, and the game is quick. Simply draw out your squares, put numbers in them and when you roll your rock, you have to skip the square where the rock landed while you are hopping on one leg down the row of blocks.
Put all ingredients (except food coloring) into a saucepan and stir over medium heat until a solid forms, add food coloring and cool before enjoying with your children. You can even add 1 drop of essential oil for a scented play dough experience, like having an aromatherapy sensory toy!
This can be done running, jumping, talking, singing, counting, whatever you do, do it backwards. Kids seem to enjoy it if this also translates to meal time and they get to eat dessert first!
Beyond handprints, use your fingers and some non-toxic paint, and then have fun. It is best when you can do this activity outdoors so clean up is a breeze. If you are not brave enough to endure the finger paint, or if it is a rainy day, use Q-tips and call it painting with stilts.
This can be done as a scavenger hunt where you look for a flower that is white, one that is yellow, one that smells good, one that smells bad, etc. What makes this activity even more fun is if you save some of your treasured finds and then press them in a book. After a week or so, when the flowers dry out, you can make bookmarks by ironing the flowers between layers of waxed paper.
Pack up something simple and grab a flat sheet then head out. You can make this one as elaborate, or as simple as you choose. Go to a park you have never been to or sit in the middle of your yard and do be sure to lay on your back for a quick game of cloud shapes afterwards.
This can work for girls or boys, boys can turn their “crown” into a chain, and every little girl wants a flower crown. Simply find the longest stem dandelions you can and begin by braiding the stems together, add more dandelions as you braid until you start a chain. (Similar to French braiding but much simpler). You can finish off the crown with a bread tie or allow the chain to go on for as long as you like.
Every child should have the experience of running barefoot in the summer through a sprinkler, be sure your kids don’t miss out on this nostalgic childhood experience.
Use waxed paper to cut out a shape (heart, circle, square) and then use Elmer’s glue to add scraps of colored tissue paper. Once hung in the window your waxed paper shape (circle, square or diamond) will look almost like a stained glass window with the colored tissue paper and light shining through.
This is almost a scavenger hunt in itself because first you need a “Y” shaped stick and a large rubber band. Once you have found two of these items that work well together, watch out, and be sure to have eye protection available. It works really well to take your invention to a nearby water source (pond, creek, lake) and shoot the rocks into the water. If not available, use marshmallows as your shots.
A balloon, newspaper strips, some flour and a little water is all you need. Mix equal parts water and flour for the glue and dip the strips of newspaper in them before laying in thin layers over the inflated balloon. Let each layer dry thoroughly before adding the next. After drying overnight, check for any remaining wetness and then either layer some more or stick a pin inside to pop the balloon so that you now have a hollow shape you can paint, fill with candy for a homemade piñata, or make a hot air balloon craft.
If you don’t have fresh lemons to squeeze you can use 1 cup lemon juice, 2 cups sugar and fill a 2 quart pitcher full of water. If you want to do it like the carnival and fair workers, add ¼ cup sugar and 1/8 cup lemon juice to a plastic cup, fill with ice and water and invert a second plastic cup over the top, then shake for a lemon shakeup.
Using a sandwich baggie add 5 cotton balls saturated with water, 3 bean seeds and seal the bag. Tape it to a sunny window and watch as days go by and sprouts start to grow.
You can buy a packet of these at your local dollar store and plant them inside in a sunny spot or outside in a container, water often and enjoy the beautiful colors that spring up.
You need to visit a creek or a pond for this one, but a rock skipping class can last for quite a while. Look up rock skipping on youtube if you are unfamiliar with techniques, this is definitely an entertaining way to spend an afternoon.
Ask your child what their favorite breakfast items are and make dinner out of it. This is even more fun if you let your child help with the meal prep. Your toddlers can put the eyes and nose (using chocolate chips or raisins) onto a teddy bear shape that you make too.
This can be as entertaining as you like, depending on the age and daring nature of your child. The challenge is to guess what is placed on the tip of your tongue and the experimenter can choose whatever they like from the refrigerator, watch out, this can bring lots of laughter, and again this is one that mom should join in on!
A unique sensation, and if you don’t have mud, simply add water to the dirt and make some fresh mud to do this one with. Join in with your child if the mood strikes you, definitely a fun activity everyone should try at least once.
Take a banana (peel on) and slice from one end to the other, slightly open the slit to add chocolate chips and nuts and then bake the “banana boats” at 350 for approximately 20 minutes or until soft and melted. Eat by scooping out the cooked banana and toppings with a spoon.
It’s a rite of passage for any child to have climbed a tree. For the younger ones, find yourself a sturdy pine tree (the branches are lower to the ground). For the older ones just give some tips about sturdy branches. Now let them turn into the little monkeys you have seen them be.
If you can’t remember any of the jump rope rhymes from your childhood, just look up a few on the internet. Bonus points if you can teach them to double dutch!
Another youtube opportunity if you don’t already know how to play string games. All you need is about 3 feet of string tied into a knot to form a continuous loop. Even little ones can get in on this and it helps with fine motor skills.
These can be used for decoration or turned into bookmarks when folded. Take a coffee filter and some markers, then have your child make dots or lines with the marker before misting with water which creates a tie-dye pattern.
This one requires a bit of forethought as you need to take a small toy (Lego man or mini toy) and put it in a small amount of water in your refrigerator. For each of your children, you’ll want some little Dixie cups or other small containers filled with water. The object is to melt all of the ice off and free the item trapped inside. You be the judge to see who can do it first.
Summer is such an amazing time in our children’s lives, the weather is usually beautiful, there is little to no school happening and time is plentiful. Enjoy the days with your kids and be sure to let them see mom having fun and being silly right along with them. Enjoy, they don’t stay little long.

There is something to be said about old fashioned hospitality, the kind of days gone by where ladies in dresses visited for tea and always had a gift for the hostess. This is no longer an expected form of politeness, in fact, if you arrive at a friend’s home and present her with a hostess gift, she may well be taken aback. It is no longer a well-established custom in our fast paced culture. However, as with many of the older ways of doing things, it is worth bringing back. The next time you are invited to the home of a friend, be it for a barbecue or a family game night, try one of these awesome hostess gifts that are sure to make you a favorite guest.
Nothing says I thought of you like a monogrammed gift. You know that the giver didn’t re-gift it and they actually gave some significant thought into what they did for you. The nice part is that you can often find monogrammed boards and other monogrammed gifts at places like Hobby Lobby.
Think Godiva, Harry & David or some other delectable, with chocolates you really can’t go wrong. It would be a rare gal who would not delight in a fancy box of high-end deliciousness. If you are feeling extra creative, how about chocolate covered blueberries or coffee beans?
Not every girl is a writer, but many of us are list keepers. Just having an unscathed and clean slate to use for whatever you desire is a luxury. There are so many beautiful versions of blank journals you can get as fancy or plain as you like.
Something tasty and foreign is always a good choice. Imported coffee or flavored coffee is like a piece of paradise in a vacuum sealed package. Bonus points here if you can come up with something she has never tried before, and if she is not a java princess, go for some unique tea samplers.
If not monogrammed then pretty blank cards, a handwritten note is almost as wonderful as an old-fashioned hostess gift. Provide her the carrying device for a beautiful note to a friend or loved one.
Find her a statement piece, one that is functional yet showcases her personality. We all like to look beautiful, even if we are trying to protect our clothing underneath while whipping up a fabulous meal for guests. If you need inspiration check out some Etsy finds in the apron department.
Whichever the gift, a sweet note of thanks for her hostessing talents presented with a thoughtful gift can go a long way in letting her know just how appreciative you are and how special she is.

Great gift ideas for hostesses! I would be more than happy with any of these especially the chocolates and gourmet coffee!
As a family of 12, we would use the money for Christmas gifts or to help our oldest fly home to see us!!
A friend gave me a beautiful, monogrammed cutting board a few years ago as a Christmas/hostess gift… I have enjoyed using it so much.
I hope all is well with you and yours this Christmas season. 🙂 I know it can be difficult trying to keep the budget in line around Christmas.
With the extra $420, I would buy a special gift for my husband. We rarely exchange gifts for Christmas because we are always focused on gifting others.
How awesome! We’ve been working on teaching our children about being a blessing to others and focusing on what we can do for them.
Thank you so much for offering this $420 Paypal giveaway! I would use half of this money to gift a family in need in my community and the other half to provide my family with a gift each person really wants.
I pray all goes well. I often mention our children with special needs and sometimes I wonder if we will get caught up. We always do, but it can sure feel like a challenge sometimes.
I make homemade hot pads and always give them as a hostess gift for a party or any invite.Practical, pretty, and easy to both make or buy.
I always tell the hostess to be sure to throw away her ugliest pair when adding the new ones to her drawer. Everyone always laughs and says they know exactly which ones they will throw out! We are a family with 12 children , so I decided long ago that if anyone was brave enough to invite us they ought to be thanked in a special way!!! : )
I’m so sorry to hear this. 🙁 We had some unexpected expenses come up recently ourselves and so many unexpected changes around the holidays can make it difficult. I hope things work out for you.
An extra $420 this Christmas would be such an incredible blessing! We live with my in-laws & I would use it to help us all get on top of & ahead of bills!

I think I am quite the copy cat sometimes. I do think of my own ideas (sometimes), but I like to copy what others have done because it's oh so cool. I love reading all of the great ideas out there on the web. What did I do before this? Was I more productive because I wasn't on the computer as much or less because I wasn't as inspired as much which leads to creating? Intersting thought. Well, I have seen these lounge pants made all over the web (check out the cute ones at Linaloo here) and I had the Amy Butler "In Stitches" book with the pattern so I thought I would try them out with the thrifted sheet I found at a garage sale for .50 cents. I only ended up using half, so basically these lounge pants were .25 cents (.27 if you add a bit for thread!). You can't beat that or their comfort. Yeah, I am on the hunt for more fabric to make a few more pairs of them whether that be a thrifted sheet or whatever. Anything that is comfortable will do! Love em.

Puerto Rican migrants have resided in the United States since before the Spanish-Cuban-American War of 1898, when the United States took possession of the island of Puerto Rico as part of the Treaty of Paris. After the war, groups of Puerto Ricans began migrating to the United States as contract laborers, first to sugarcane plantations in Hawaii, and then to other destinations on the mainland. After the Jones Act of 1917 extended U.S. citizenship to islanders, Puerto Ricans migrated to the United States in larger numbers, establishing their largest base in New York City. Over the course of the 1920s and 1930s, a vibrant and heterogeneous colonia developed there, and Puerto Ricans participated actively both in local politics and in the increasingly contentious politics of their homeland, whose status was indeterminate until it became a commonwealth in 1952. The Puerto Rican community in New York changed dramatically after World War II, accommodating up to fifty thousand new migrants per year during the peak of the “great migration” from the island. Newcomers faced intense discrimination and marginalization in this era, defined by both a Cold War ethos and liberal social scientists’ interest in the “Puerto Rican problem.”
Puerto Rican migrant communities in the 1950s and 1960s—now rapidly expanding into the Midwest, especially Chicago, and into New Jersey, Connecticut, and Philadelphia—struggled with inadequate housing and discrimination in the job market. In local schools, Puerto Rican children often faced a lack of accommodation of their need for English language instruction. Most catastrophic for Puerto Rican communities, on the East Coast particularly, was the deindustrialization of the labor market over the course of the 1960s. By the late 1960s, in response to these conditions and spurred by the civil rights, Black Power, and other social movements, young Puerto Ricans began organizing and protesting in large numbers. Their activism combined a radical approach to community organizing with Puerto Rican nationalism and international anti-imperialism. The youth were not the only activists in this era. Parents in New York had initiated, together with their African American neighbors, a “community control” movement that spanned the late 1960s and early 1970s; and many other adult activists pushed the politics of the urban social service sector—the primary institutions in many impoverished Puerto Rican communities—further to the left.
By the mid-1970s, urban fiscal crises and the rising conservative backlash in national politics dealt another blow to many Puerto Rican communities in the United States. The Puerto Rican population as a whole was now widely considered part of a national “underclass,” and much of the political energy of Puerto Rican leaders focused on addressing the paucity of both basic material stability and social equality in their communities. Since the 1980s, however, Puerto Ricans have achieved some economic gains, and a growing college-educated middle class has managed to gain more control over the cultural representations of their communities. More recently, the political salience of Puerto Ricans as a group has begun to shift. For the better part of the 20th century, Puerto Ricans in the United States were considered numerically insignificant or politically impotent (or both); but in the last two presidential elections (2008 and 2012), their growing populations in the South, especially in Florida, have drawn attention to their demographic significance and their political sensibilities.
A number of gas furnaces have a lower amount of operational issues compared to burners which depend on oil to work. Typically, difficulties in reagrds to furnaces involve the thermocouple, pilot light, or a part of the electrical system.

The 111th Congress is now in session, and the first order of business is a massive economic stimulus package. President-elect Barack Obama has been vocal about his intention to devote part of the money to broadband infrastructure as one way to boost the economy. According to a 2007 study by the Brookings Institution, a 20 percent increase in broadband adoption -- putting the U.S. on par with a country like Denmark -- would create 3 million new jobs.
As the Obama transition team shifted into high-gear last month, S. Derek Turner, research director of Free Press, put forward a proposal to make world-class, high-speed broadband available to all areas of the country, bring new competition to the broadband market -- which will help keep prices down -- and boost America's slumping standing as a global leader in technology.
Derek Turner -- There is a sort of intersection and a unison between what is good telecom policy and what is good stimulus policy, and I think we found that. And the way we achieve this is basically, since things are moving so fast, we tried to use off the shelf ideas, policy options that have already been debated or programs that are already in place and essentially tweak those a little bit, boost the funding, and get them out the door as fast as possible. And so we think this is something that is realistic and can be done as soon as possible and start getting new jobs created this year -- and for the years to come.
Turner wants a high-capacity broadband infrastructure across America, including rural and low-income areas. The $44 billion proposal is a mixture of federal grants, bonds, tax incentives and credits. Funding would only be awarded for new projects and faster speeds that wouldn't happen otherwise. Accountability, Turner says, is the cornerstone of the package.
Derek Turner -- We can't simply be writing blank checks to companies and get nothing in return. Money's not going to be used to give companies funds to do things they were already going to do. We only propose supporting new investment beyond what would have already have taken place. And there are checks and balances in our proposal to make that happen. That's something we absolutely have to be aware of. Unless the accountability and oversight is there, there's no point to doing it at all. We shouldn't use the money for broadband if there's no accountability or oversight -- we should use it for something else. Our proposals are designed to lead the deployment of next generation, truly robust, fast broadband networks -- broadband networks that we're not seeing deployed in the U.S., but are commonplace in places like Japan and South Korea.
Since job creation will only come with people actually using broadband services, Turner also includes proposals to stimulate demand, like subsidies for installation, discounts on monthly subscriptions, tax deductions for home computers for children, and a program to purchase laptops and build Wi-Fi networks at schools and libraries. Rural development, health care and public service programs are also covered, along with improved broadband data collection and public access to that data.
Turner's is not the only plan that's been given to the Obama transition team. Some have merit and others are much more industry-friendly.
Derek Turner -- Some of the other plans that are out there are well-detailed and good. Fiber-to-the-Home Council -- their plan is one for bonds for building fiber-to-the-home. We think that's a good plan. There are some plans that I would be a little cautious about. There's one by an industry-funded think tank that on the surface seems to be reasonable -- it's got some good speed goals and it's a tax credit program. But when you drill down, you actually see that this plan would not actually lead to any new broadband investment and could essentially just be a big gift to the incumbent phone and cable companies. So we need to only work with plans and only adopt plans that are open, transparent, and that have real measurable end goals and there's real accountability and oversight to make sure that those end goals are reached.

Exactly what’s the reason for the rise in use of Godly dating services? The answer is truly simple: Numerous Christian songs are satisfying their dating matches online.

Somewhat related to the ice cream analogy (by the way, Mint-Chocolate-Chip is my favourite; oh wait, or is it Chocolate-Chip-Mint?), the big search databases of some dating online websites like Christian Mingle, now Relationships.com permits Christians dating online to “put in their order” utilizing such variables as age, denomination, occupation, race, appearance and the local area of where one wishes to find prospective soulmates. Best of all, your prospective dating match is likewise trying to find the same thing.
A Jehova dating service can save time for busy songs (like Christian single moms and dads, etc) who do not have the time or energy to discover a date in more standard ways. Single Christians who turn to a Christian online match making service have the convenience of meeting someone out of the comfort of their own houses, 24/7. And let’s be genuine, with the average size of the common evangelical church hovering at around 90 souls, the pickin’s are typically slim at finest. And just how much time have you spent primping yourself to go out to singles activities only to be dissatisfied at the close of the night?
Consulting with other single people on a dating service helps you refine your conversational abilities. It’s likewise an outstanding possibility to reveal real ideas by means of Christian chat rooms, e-mail and instant messaging, without feeling uncomfortable as one might personally. By the time the Christian dating site couple finally does meet, they will be far more comfortable with each other, having laid down a strong psychological foundation.
Just recently, I read a few of the charming letters President John Adams composed his partner, Abigail. When they were separated by 100s of miles. In those days there were no telephones, and pony-delivered mail took days to obtain to its destination. But oh, the charm, enthusiasm and depth of those letters! Okay, we’re not in Colonial America, and I might be a charming idealist, however communicating through an online Christian dating site can assist songs experience a little of this magic.

The dating world can be a disturbing place for those hoping to hang on to strong Christian convictions. When you find somebody that triggers your interests you might discover that dating while living according to your faith and beliefs takes a little work. It can be done though and here are a few methods to hold on to your Christian faith while dating today.
This goes deeper than shared faith. You have to be dating only someone who shares your level of dedication to your faith in Christ. Someone who has similar goals and perfects when it comes to household, praise, and commitment to Christ is going to be a better match for you and will be more understanding of your desire to live and act according to your beliefs
As your Christian dating relationship advances there will come a time when you will both have to sit down together and discuss your limitations, your desires, and your goals regarding intimacy and the physical nature of your ongoing dating relationship. You would be surprised at the number of dating-and married– couples are supposed to love each other deeply but understand very little about the hopes and imagine their partners.
Open communication is the key to any effective dating relationship but is extremely important when you are trying to live and date above the ways of the world. When you have a Christ-centered relationship you will still deal with the very same temptations that other dating-couples experience. The difference is that you will remain in a better position to resist temptation if you are in contract on firm dating boundaries.
There is a smart old saying: “The family that hopes together, stays together.” This is likewise real for couples, whether dating or already married. Hoping together strengthens your union, strengthens your commitments to one another, and verifies your collective commitment to God. Any recipe for relationship success when it pertains to Christian dating relationships have to include God as an integral part of the relationship. Remember that long hours of praying alone together can introduce physical temptation. So keep your prayers together brief and in a semi-public location for the sake of dating purity before marriage.
Make one of your regular dates participating in church services together. Take part in Bible study groups together. Build a relationship collectively within the safety net of your Christian faith. As you end up being more dedicated to one another and to God you can expand your dating experiences to more secular activities if you would like but there is nothing incorrect with keeping a Christ-centered relationship as your primary focus. After all, a Christian dating relationship is like a triangle with God on top and the man and female at each corner of the base, the closer a man and woman get to God, the closer they get to each other as they go up the triangle. Christian Single Men in Cumberland College 40769 KY
There is very little that can as compare to fellowship with other Christian couples who share your dedication to Christ when it pertains to assisting you stand your moral ground while dating. There are numerous temptations that you will face as a Christian couple dating in today’s world, a fallen world that views dating and morality far differently than Christians do.
The secular world where we live might not be ideally matched for Christian dating in Cumberland College 40769 KY but it is still possible to apply to Christian ideals and set yourself apart from worldlier dating practices. End up being beacons of life for one another and reflect your commitment to Christ by your dating deeds as well as your words.
Perhaps you have not yet fulfilled the one that God desires you to marry. Do not permit anxiety or desperation to put you into a dating pressure cooker. Relax and rely on God to bring dating success as you mature in Christ. Enjoy every phase of your Christian life. If single, delight in singleness, keeping in mind that someday you will most likely have far less leisure time with a partner and perhaps kids to love and take care of. Find Christian Singles in
Dating can make you feel both ecstatic and ill all at the same time. For someone looking for a relationship, not simply an attach, dating holds not just the wish for a brilliant and caring future but likewise the possibility of pain and heartbreak. Dating is rough. Individuals aren’t always exactly what they seem. When you start the dating procedure, you are generally on your best behavior. But many individuals attempt to be someone they aren’t in order to convince the person they are dating that they have found exactly who they were searching for. But that does not lead to a delighted ending.

"Exhibited an impressive grasp of the techniques of Baroque vocal style and a natural way of making them serve a vocal text."
Countertenor JEFFREY DOOLEY, a protégé of the renowned British countertenors Alfred and Mark Deller, is now available for master classes and coaching in authentic Baroque style for both concert and opera.
Jeffrey has performed Bach’s MASS IN B MINOR at the Basically Bach Festival (Chicago), Purcell’s ODE FOR SAINT CECILIA’S DAY with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra (Lukas Foss conducting), and Scarlatti’s SAINT CECILIA MASS and Vivaldi’s MAGNIFICAT on a tour of Switzerland and Italy with Amor Artis (Johannes Somary conducting). Other performances include a recital at the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (Berlin), Bach’s SAINT JOHN PASSION with the Paul Hill Chorale at the Kennedy Center, Purcell’s DIDO AND AENEAS (Sorceress) with the Central City Chorus in New York City, and Handel’s MESSIAH in Milwaukee, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal and New York City (Lincoln Center), among many others.

“Dooley’s voice is clear and flexible, with capabilities for both lightness and strength ... fine attention to ornamentation and other aspects of Baroque vocal practice “ (Henry Purcell Airs & Duets - Nonesuch)
“An excellent countertenor ... thoroughly pleasing ... seemingly effortless diction ... refreshingly unporetentious manner of expression”
“The best a bedazzled critic can offer is appreciation ... a more cultivated sound than Dooley’s is scarecely to be found .. perfectly pitched, intelligently considered, subtly inflected, exquisitely colored ... Dooley proved himself not just a countertenor of the highest rank, but a musical artist in excelsis.”
“Touched upon the sublimely melancholy spirit of Elizabethan England ... his approach was unusually affecting ... the audience flowed from the chapel into the main sanctuary and this was one of the coldest nights of the year” (Homage to Alfred Deller)
“Jeffrey Dooely is to be congratulated for following his heart. Dear Friends & Gentle Hearts is an original idea come to successful fruition.”

I had my daughter when I was 19 and it was a pretty difficult process for me. I didn’t really know how to deal with the contractions, or what was really going on. But with the help of my baby’s dad’s mom it got easier. It got a lot more easier when I got the epidural. I felt so much better after that.
I am 20 now and my daughter is 1 year and 2 months. I’m not going to lie, it’s been hard; even with her dad around I feel like I’m a single mom. At the moment I am attending school and also being a home health nurse for my mom. It gets frustrating at times with not much help. But at the end of the day when I get to see her smile, it’s all worthwhile.
I’m glad I went through all of this. I love being a mom. It’s the best feeling in the world, to have someone love you unconditionally. I wouldn’t give up my life or my choices for anything. I love this life.

Saturday, dozens of people came to Children’s Village in Yakima for their first annual Autism Awareness Fair.
Volunteerism is up, and the recession is getting the credit as displaced workers look to do something meaningful with their extra time
YAKIMA, Wash. — After spending two decades working as a surgical assistant in Yakima, Laurel Poor wasn’t overly worried when her employer let her go.
But a year later, the 57-year-old Yakima resident is still looking for a job and trying not to take the rejections personally.
“There are jobs out there, but there are so many of us applying for them,” said Poor, who collects unemployment. “I thought experience would count for a lot more than it does.”
Yakima, WA – April is Autism Awareness Month and The Autism Oversight Committee of Central Washington and Children’s Village are hosting a free collaborative community fair at Children’s Village on April 17th from noon – 2:00 p.m. The collaborative community fair is an opportunity to raise awareness of the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) in our community and emphasize the need to increase support for Children with ASDs.
ASDs are a group of developmental disabilities that can cause social, communication and behavioral challenges. The CDC estimates that one in every 110 children has an Autism Spectrum Disorder. ASDs are classified as “spectrum disorders” because they affect each person in a different way, and can range from very mild to severe.
“Our goal with this event is education and highlighting the work that our community is doing-working together to provide support and effective services to children on the autism spectrum and their families,” says Diane Patterson, Director of Children’s Village. “Each day there are new advances in the area of autism research and as a community we want to support children with autism to achieve their hopes and dreams.”
The community event will represent the prevalence of Autism in our society with a visual display of one in 110 balloons. Families and others can connect and learn more from other parents raising children with Autism. It’s also an opportunity to find out more about how the Children’s Village expansion will offer more opportunities to serve children with autism. Onyx salon will be offering $10 blue hair extensions with proceeds going to support the expansion campaign. Face painting and snacks will also be provided throughout the event.
Children’s Village is a unique partnership that resulted from a community vision for easily accessible, comprehensive, collaborative health, education and social services for children with special health care needs. Since Children’s Village opened its doors in October 1997, it has transformed from being just a building into a philosophy of care for our Valley’s children. Over the past decade, 16,000 children and their families have received services, support and care through Children’s Village in Yakima and Sunnyside. For more information or to schedule a tour, call (509) 574-3200 or visit www.yakimachildrensvillage.org.

We understand that discussing or pre-arranging funerals is not a welcomed subject for most people. Some even question if funerals are really necessary or desirable. We joke about the fact that we see each other only at weddings and funerals. Both events are milestones in our lives, like birthdays and other important occasions. We observe them because they fulfill certain very strong human needs.
There are compelling reasons why funerals matter. Whether you choose a traditional or a contemporary ceremony, a funeral provides a profound experience that ultimately aids in grieving process. Funeral brings together friends and family whose support and compassion gives us a comfort and perspective. They help is express our grief in a safe setting. They help us remember, they help us understand and accept the fact that a death has occurred and that it is time to commemorate our loved and say good-bye. They help us share memories, tributes and appreciation for a life of the deceased. They help us acknowledge the reality of death, allow for the expression of faith, provide us with a sense of continuity-that life goes on, and they allow us to encourage our acceptance of loss and help us heal.
Virtually everyone who comforts family and friends at a visitation and attends a funeral experiences a profound sense of their importance and helpfulness. Funerals are bridges of transition. As time passes, we appreciate more fully the relationship that endures. We see that the words spoken, tributes offered and feelings experienced at the visitation and funeral helps us reach a place of fond memories and appreciation for the person who dies and for the life of that person we celebrate.
Jeff Murphy and the staff of the Murphy Funeral Home believe that conducting funerals is a sacred trust, and we keep this trust uppermost in mind when serving you.

A voice, a knock on the door, a phone ringing, another person bursting in through the walls. That is especially common at the very beginning of the scene and many times we may not even realize doing it.

I ingest albums very slowly. I find one or two songs I like from an album and listen to them on repeat for a week or so. Other songs from the album will slowly make their way into my repertoire, and if the album is good, I’m eventually listening to it in order on repeat. This is what happened to me with La Louma’s debut album Let the World be Flooded Out.
The opening track (and first single from the album) “The Decline of Nations” immediately intrigued me with its polished punk swagger. Then, I listened to “Just Wanna Love You” (the second single released). “Just Wanna Love You” features middle eastern influences, and is unlike any song I’ve heard recently. La Louma’s lyrics tell a story about the deep emotional unrest of being in a relationship that is no longer working, and her voice moves from clear vocals in the chorus to gritty vocal styling in the verses, with desperate pleas asking what she did wrong. I was utterly enthralled.
Next up for my ears to obsess over was “If We Don’t Now We Never Will.” This song is slower than the last two songs, but the mournful lyrics and vocal styling enchanted many of my fall walks. While slower in tempo, the song still posses the layers of instruments present throughout the whole album. This song really highlights La Louma’s ability to knit instruments together. Her layers of melodies and counter melodies are united in one large blanket of sound. The songs sound full, but never chaotic.
Perhaps this unity has to do with the fact that La Louma performed, record, produced, and mixed every song in her garage. The album was recorded over the course of three years, and during these three years, Lauren Ross (the talent behind La Louma) recorded 200 songs. She then distilled them into the ten song Let the World be Flooded Out. Growing up, Ross was a classical woodwind player, but the album displays Ross’ ability to play piccolo, flute, bassoon, french horn, electric guitar, electric bass, v-drums, and tambourine. And sing. Really, really well. “Brother True,” “Candy” and “Aaj Mausam Bada Beimann Har” showcase her woodwind classical training, and the combination of classical training and the unique recording process really make this album stand out.
Bear with me for the following digression. Ready? Ok. My younger sister loves Harry Styles. She was in middle school during the peak of the One Direction era, and during this time, the whole area around her bed was covered in One Direction posters (much to my displeasure). Needless to say, she was so excited when Harry Styles released his self-titled debut album this year. When it came out, I was in the depths of my disillusionment with academia, and I channelled this into a new-found appreciation for pop music as an anti-elitist statement. For the first time, I actually listened as my sister obsessed about Harry Styles. I listened to his album, and I really wanted to like it, as some kind of statement, or to support this male pop star who defends his female fans from the sexist eye-rolls music snobs might give them. But… I couldn’t get into it. I appreciated the 60s and 70s rock sensibility displayed, but there was something missing. After some thought, I narrowed it down to Styles’ voice. His voice is “perfect,” polished to pop perfection. A polished voice may be the cause of his fame, but it’s also his artistic weakness. Listening to the album, I kept waiting for a true, unbridled release of emotion to come from Styles’ mouth. Instead, all I got was the voice of a pop star too afraid to make mistakes.
A crack in the voice, the scream of a singer who’s letting their emotions govern their voice when emotions become too powerful to be contained, it’s cathartic and powerful. In my opinion, it’s a signifier of a great work of music. When I was listening to Let the World Be Flooded Out I was reminded of this. Lauren Ross has a beautiful, clear voice that shines in her songs. It’s a voice that would fit into the pop charts, but unlike Harry Styles, Ross can let her emotionality shine through in her voice. She can scream or show grit. Her voice cracks and breaks with emotion when needed. When La Louma creates a work it feels powerful and personal.
While at first Lauren Ross’ punk sensibility may be obscured by her classical training, it is there, evidenced by her vocals, her recording process, and her politics. Let the World Be Flooded Out is the first album released by Bitchwave, the feminist/queer collective and label Ross co-runs in Los Angeles. Bitchwave allows Ross to live her politics outside of her songs. The album is personal, but many of the songs are also very political. “I am Here I Am” was inspired by a first-hand account that Ross read about several female refugees. Ross said that “the chorus is a repeating declaration that ‘I am here’, and while it’s meant to be their [the refugee’s] statement, it’s crucial for me to hear myself sing those words over and over, too.” “Decline of Nations” (inspired by the Syrian refugee crisis) also serves as a political anthem and implores the listener to “Promise me you’ll stay until you try to make things right.” Bitchwave is still in it’s early stages, but hopefully we’ll soon have more amazing music from them.
In Let the World Be Flooded Out, Ross masterfully mixes opposing forces to create a truly unique album. La Louma makes complex pop music sound effortless, and combines her classical training, her DIY punk ethos, and pop sensibilities to create an album confident in its clashes.

John Winston Ono Lennon MBE (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who rose to worldwide fame as a co-founder of the band the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership.
Born and raised in Liverpool, as a teenager Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze; his first band, the Quarrymen, evolved into the Beatles in 1960. When the group disbanded in 1970, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and iconic songs such as "Give Peace a Chance" and "Working Class Hero". After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969, he changed his name to John Ono Lennon. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy. He was murdered three weeks after its release.
Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism, he moved to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixon's administration to deport him, while some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.
As of 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States exceeded 14 million and, as writer, co-writer, or performer, he is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Hot 100 chart. In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth and, in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice; as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994.[1]

One by one, they form a little conveyor belt—throngs of students lining up to sit in a chair, look into a camera lens, and smile. For millions of kids, picture day is a way to memorialize their appearance in a given year, although later the out-of-fashion clothes or cosmetic growing pains may be a way to memorialize pure awkwardness. For the photographers tasked with the job, however, picture day means corralling hundreds of children and establishing a comfort level without any time to waste.
“We get about 30 seconds per kid,” Kristin Boyer, a photographer in Atlanta, Georgia, who has been taking school portrait photos for eight years, tells Mental Floss. “And it’s amazing how much impact you can have. You want to make them feel like a million bucks—beautiful, awesome, and smart.”
To get a better sense of what goes into the job, we asked Boyer and two other school photographers to divulge some of the more interesting aspects of wrangling kids for posterity. Read on for some insight into uncooperative subjects, why mornings make for the the best shots, and the importance of booger patrol.
While deals can vary by school, photographers typically get paid when parents order photos. The school then takes a percentage of that fee.
To select a professional, schools will often take bids. "I make a presentation," Boyer says. "I'll explain what I do. Sometimes schools are looking for certain things." Boyer takes more dynamic shots with ambitious outdoor backgrounds; some larger schools herding 1500 or more kids, she says, may want to opt for a simple portrait to expedite the process.
As for what schools do with their portion of the revenue, it depends on the school. But many usually sink it back into student programs.
“Parents are very passionate about their kids getting good school photos,” Courtney, a photographer based in Canada, tells Mental Floss. They might send along a note with their kid describing what they didn’t like about the previous year’s photo. “When I started, I didn’t expect the level of hostility with parents when a photo doesn’t go the way they want it to.”
Boyer has sometimes had parents ask to stand behind her while she shoots so they can take their own pictures. “I usually say no cell phone photos. If they take theirs, they won’t buy mine.”
For younger kids, mornings are better. After lunch, photographers are likely to need the help of photo-editing software. “One of my first-graders got spaghetti on them,” Boyer says. “You don’t want to let them start to get markers or food all over.” Boyer’s most unusual Photoshop request? “I edited out a cookie once. The kid would not sit down unless he had a cookie.”
Portrait photographers typically work across a spectrum of ages, from kindergarteners to high school seniors. If a child is very young, it’s possible the entire idea of sitting for a portrait will scare them silly. “You always get one or two that are just terrified,” Grant, a portrait photographer who works on pre-K to 12th grade, tells Mental Floss. “I’m a big, beefy dude, and sometimes a kid will get in there and see me and go, ‘Oh, I’m not doing this.’” To placate the pensive pupils, Grant makes a big show of leaving by stomping his feet, then lets one of his less-threatening assistants take the pictures.
Photographers need to be careful when giving instructions to kindergarteners and first graders, who tend to process things with little nuance. “Sometimes I’ll ask a kid to high-five me and I'll act like it hurts,” Grant says. “I’ll ask for a Band-Aid. Sometimes they’ll look very serious and say, ‘I don’t have one.’” Another time, Grant asked a kid to point his knees toward a nearby computer. “He came over and touched his knee to the laptop.”
A lot of photographers are switching up the conventional portrait by snapping pictures of kids outdoors, in "action" poses like jumping, or against more eclectic backgrounds. Kids are getting more creative, too. Like prop comedians, they will sometimes arrive for picture day armed with accessories. “I’ve seen everything from Halloween costumes to dogs and other pets,” Courtney, says. “Or they want to wear hats or sunglasses.” If it’s within reason and OK with the school, she’ll take one traditional photo and then let the subject pose with their prop for the second.
Posing for a professional portrait can be a strange experience for a kid who has spent considerable time on a cell phone. “Kids have gotten much more comfortable in front of the camera, but it’s bad selfie behavior,” Boyer says. “Doing duck lips, thrusting their arms out to make their shoulders straight. You kind of have to re-train them.” Boyer lets them know it doesn't look good, but "I say it in a nice way."
Sometimes, fashion can betray kids. “Fluorescent green and orange tops seem popular now and light tends to bounce off of it and on the chin,” Grant says. “The bottom of the chin tends to turn orange.” Unless they happen to have an extra shirt or request a photo retouch, they’re stuck with it.
Aside from some unfortunate fashion choices, one staple of school photos is the head tilt, with kids cocking their faces off to one side. According to a school photographer on Reddit, there's a good reason for that. "These photos are going to be used for the yearbook (more than likely) and everyone should have somewhat of the same head pose," they explain. "The way we stage our lights does not flatter the subject when they're looking straight at the camera. If you tilt your head you're more likely to also move your chin in that same direction, which makes for a more interesting highlight/shadow play and also has the added benefit of making the face look smaller (if you're a little overweight)."
With hundreds of students at a given school, photographers need a reliable system of identifying kids and making sure their names match up to their portfolio. While systems vary, one of the most common is to collect school data and then print a unique ticket with a student’s name, grade, homeroom, and a number. “Those have a barcode,” Grant says. “So they come up, we scan the ticket, and pull up their record. It’s like scanning soup at a grocery store.”
It’s also error-free, unless some senior decides to trade tickets with a friend so their names get mixed up on their school identification cards. “They don’t seem to think it out, though, because the homeroom teachers pass the cards out and will notice the picture isn’t of them.”
Photographers have less than a minute to relax a kid enough so they deliver a broad, genuine smile. To facilitate that, Grant says he keeps a laundry list of groaners at his disposal to provoke a laugh. “It’s like a script tree that a telemarketer would use,” he says. “If a kid says they play soccer, I’ll say, ‘Oh, so you like kicking people?’”
Photographers also rely on another age-old technique: embarrassment. “In grades four to six, if you ask girls to say ‘boys’ and boys to say ‘girls,’ it’s so scandalous,” Grant says. “For a second shot, you ask them to say, ‘cute boys’ or ‘cute girls.’ That typically works.” Grant can also provoke smiles by asking about pet names. Elementary kids react to being asked to say, “trick or treat, smell my feet.” If they remain stubborn, Grant will pull out all the stops and request they say “stinky feet.”
While photo-editing software can address rogue snot, no one really wants to spend the extra minutes digitally erasing boogers from photos. Boyer typically enlists volunteer parents to make sure faces are wiped clean or has assistants armed with tissues, combs, and other grooming products to make for a stylish and snot-free image. “We usually try to catch things like that before they get in front of the camera,” she says.
To build rapport, photographers are always looking to get kids to talk about themselves. Once, one of Grant’s assistants asked if a child had any pets. “Yes,” the kid responded. “Rabbits. But we ate them last night.”
The older kids get, the more they tend to commit acts of subversion. “One kid came in with his jacket on, took it off, sat down, and was ready to go,” Grant says. “I knew something was going on. I looked at his shirt and it said ‘Student of the Month.’ Except he put masking tape over the ‘ent’ so it read ‘Stud of the Month.’” (After consulting with the principal, the kid was allowed to keep it on for the photo.)
Courtney had a kid sit down with what looked like a nice shirt with birds on it. “It was actually middle fingers,” she says.
While most kids are cooperative, Grant will sometimes see subjects who want to make their life as difficult as possible. "Seniors tend to fool around more and be difficult on purpose," he says. "Some of them are just perpetually in a bad mood or feel self-conscious." Sports teammates might egg each other on to not crack a smile. One school photographer who works for Lifetouch writes on Reddit that there are one or two "problem kids" per class: "You just have to remember they're just doing it for attention because they aren't getting it somewhere else."
The internet is overflowing with awkward and embarrassing school photos, from unfortunate backgrounds to unfortunate hairstyles. But according to Grant, “bad school photo” is a misnomer that gives photographers a bad rap. “There’s a common idea school pictures are bad,” he says. “No. School pictures are like shooting fish in a barrel. Is a kid going to smile? Is a kid going to lean into it? Or is it going to be bad no matter what I do? If you think the picture is bad, well, no, that’s you. The picture was fine. The bad haircut wasn’t.”
Creating a tombstone is more complex than just sandblasting letters onto a slab of granite. Designing memorials involves helping families of the deceased—or people looking to plan their own resting places—figure out the best way to represent a whole life in a single, permanent monument. Here are 13 secrets of memorial engravers that we gleaned from the experts:
Clients don’t necessarily know what they want right off the bat, and they may even feel overwhelmed by the sheer breadth of the possibilities. “A lot of families come in and they bring up the S word—standard,” explains Vince Dioguardi, the president of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-area Rome Monument, a company founded by his great-grandfather in 1932. “There is nothing standard.”
Even the preferred size of a memorial can vary vastly from client to client. What seems tiny to one person might seem huge to another, and vice versa. And so a monument designer will sit down with clients and discuss the person the memorial is for, including their hobbies and interests, their family, and other aspects of their lives—then come up with ways that life could be symbolized in stone (or another material). The end result is always unique.
Everyone deals with death differently. Some people want to decide on a memorial immediately after a loved one dies, while others might take years. Even just signing off on a contract can be an emotional step for someone who's grieving. “The most important thing you can do is give people the room to process their grief,” Greg Lundgren of Seattle-based Lundgren Monuments, which focuses on cast-glass memorials, says. He's come up with ideas for clients who then went dark on him for two years before moving forward on the commission. It usually takes him just a week or two to come up with preliminary drawings, but he and the client might go back and forth for up to a year discussing dimensions, prices, and other factors before the client is 100 percent sure about the design. Then Lundgren drafts up a contract, and typically finishes up the memorial in six months or so.
Dioguardi estimates that crafting a memorial takes around eight to 10 weeks at his company. First, however, customers typically come in for two or even three consultation visits where they learn about the process, talk about design ideas, decide on something, and finally come up with a contract.
In the course of creating a monument, "you become very deeply engaged with the family," Lundgren says, much more so than you would in any other sort of designer-client relationship. Talking about a deceased loved one and trying to come up with a design that will adequately capture who they were as a person is naturally more intimate than if you were designing, say, a piece of furniture or a new kitchen. The process can create a relationship that lasts beyond the scope of the project itself. "I have families in other parts of the world where if I were to visit that city, I would completely go visit them and have dinner with them, and I know that I would be welcome," Lundgren says.
“One of the most important parts of my job is to remind people that there’s no way they can capture a real person in a piece of stone,” Lundgren says. Clients often want to incorporate as many symbols of their loved one’s life as a stone can fit—requesting that the designer incorporate an image of their college mascot, and their truck, and a dove, and a photograph of them, and a poem memorializing them, for instance. But that impulse can mean the memorial “ends up looking like a NASCAR [vehicle] with all the company sponsors on it,” Lundgren explains. His biggest advice is to follow the old adage "less is more.”
One challenge memorial designers face is that families often don't come to unanimous decisions. “Everyone has an opinion,” Lundgren explains. “It’s a hard thing, especially when you’re faced with the legacy of a person and it is so permanent—it’s not like buying a shirt.” While a family might be able to agree on the size, shape, and color of a monument, they often get hung up trying to decide on the specific text that should be included.
You don’t have to leave your gravestone’s design up to the people who outlive you: You can choose something for yourself before you go. “It’s extremely common here,” Dioguardi says. It’s called “pre-need.” That way, there’s no guessing or arguing among your family members about what you might want—it’s already determined.
When asked about the most elaborate memorial he has ever designed, Lundgren described not a huge tombstone or complex statue, but an urn he made to memorialize a dog. Ruth was a stray Australian shepherd his client found on the street, and when she died, he was heartbroken. To honor her memory, Lundgren created a bronze and stainless steel urn. Ruth had one brown eye and one blue eye, so he incorporated two semiprecious stones, one brown and one blue. “I think it was the fanciest urn I’ve ever made,” he says. The result is an urn that looks more like a piece of modern art than a memorial for a deceased pet.
“If you lost something you love and want to pay your respects to it, I’m going to approach it with that same sense of humanity,” he says, whether it’s a person or a pet.
How your memorial is made depends a lot on who you commissioned it from. Lundgren doesn’t consider himself a stoneworker. He labels himself a designer, and says much of what he does is really graphic design. “Basically what you’re doing is creating line art,” he says. “Most engraving is not done [the] old-fashioned [way], like hand chiseled and chipped away. I’d say probably 99.9 percent is formatted on a computer, cut as a stencil, and then sandblasted and carved into the surface.”
Dioguardi disagrees with that assessment. “A lot of consumers think this is all machinery-based,” he says, but not all firms rely entirely on stencils and computers. Rome Monument uses an automated sandblaster for lettering, but also uses chisels and other tools to create designs by hand. If a family comes in and asks for a gravestone with a rose on it, one of their sculptors will actually carve that rose into the stone freehand.
Just because you choose a particular cemetery or funeral home doesn’t mean you have to buy a headstone or monument directly from that company. “Cemeteries that do sell memorials make the consumer think that they have to purchase a memorial from the cemetery,” Dioguardi explains, but that isn’t the case. You can commission a memorial from any designer, and then have it delivered and installed in that cemetery. Both Dioguardi and Lundgren design and ship memorials to cemeteries all over the country. Lundgren, in fact, has designed memorials for installation all over the world.
“There’s a lot of funeral homes and cemeteries that will show families a very narrow slice of what’s possible. They’ll say, ‘Pick something out of this book,’” Lundgren says. “I think it’s important for families to remember that there’s no limitation on what can be done.”
Just because he advocates for “less is more” doesn’t mean Lundgren thinks all memorials should be simple grave markers with minimal text. He has designed memorials shaped like giant boomboxes and unicorn heads, hot pink headstones, and all manner of custom sculptures.
“Whatever that consumer can think of that they want to do, we can design it,” Dioguardi explains. That goes for the industry as a whole, not just his firm. “There’s a monument in Vermont that it’s a full scale Mercedes-Benz [made] out of a single block of granite,” he describes. The only thing that truly limits what kind of memorial you can design for your loved one is your budget— and your imagination.
Cemeteries do have some say over the type of memorial you install at your love one’s final resting place. “A cemetery is like a condominium association,” Dioguardi explains. While you may own the gravesite itself, there are still certain rules you have to abide by. Specific motifs typically aren't off-limits, but designs are often restricted by size, material, and sometimes even by color.
These restrictions can even vary within cemeteries. In one cemetery Rome Monument has worked with, for instance, some areas are restricted to bronze monuments, while monuments in another section have to be granite. Recently, a customer called to inquire about buying a memorial for a family member, but didn’t know where in that cemetery they were buried. “We had to make a couple phone calls to the cemetery to find out where this family’s loved one was laid to rest so that we know what type of monument that we [could] design,” Dioguardi says.
Some of these rules stem not from cemeteries looking to strong-arm customers into buying monuments from their own catalog—though that’s an issue, too—but from real concerns about how certain materials age. “It’s always a good idea to have restrictions and rules to make sure a cemetery is going to age well,” Lundgren says. Many rules were developed in the 1920s and '30s to keep people from installing materials that would quickly deteriorate, like wooden crosses or metals that would rust. But those rules haven’t necessarily kept up with new technological advances. The large-scale cast-glass memorials Lundgren makes are only possible because of computer technology that wasn’t commercially available until the 1990s. Part of his job is simply educating cemeteries and funeral homes about what long-lasting materials are possible.
The guy in Vermont who was memorized with a giant Mercedes-Benz sculpture isn’t a total outlier—a fair number of people ask to somehow incorporate cars or trucks. While many of Dioguardi’s clients request memorials that incorporate themes like faith, family, hobbies, and career, Lundgren says he’s created multiple memorials that somehow involve vehicles. “Strangely I’ve gotten more cars than I would have thought,” he explains. He suggests that it could be a demographic pattern. “A lot of the work we do is for younger people, and when you have someone who’s 17 or 19 years old and the family is trying to recall what’s important to them, cars are often a lot more important to [teenagers] than if you’re 60 or 70 years old.” He says he also receives a lot of requests for birds, flowers, and butterflies.
“As depressing as it might sound to be a monument designer, it’s really amazing,” Lundgren says. While most aspects of dealing with the logistics of a loved one’s death are stressful and depressing, figuring out a way to memorialize them permanently is actually a positive process. “To be able to be that one person that can talk about beauty and art and legacy is really powerful,” he explains.
You may know them as the deranged clown, the mad scientist, or that guy with the chainsaw who won't stop chasing gaggles of shrieking girls down a dimly lit hallway. But behind the fake blood spatters and caked-on makeup, they’re just regular people trying to have some fun while making money. To find out what it takes to be professionally terrifying, we spoke with three people who served as "scare actors" (as actors at haunted houses are known in the industry) and lived to tell the tale.
Sure, you’ll probably see some high school students working at haunted houses, especially smaller operations run by community centers. (Some work for free to rack up their volunteer hours—a requirement at many high schools.) But students aren't the only people employed at haunted houses. Christine Mancini, who works at the ScareHouse in Etna, Pennsylvania, says the actors at her establishment come from a diverse array of fields. “We have anywhere from doctors, lawyers, and psychologists to college kids working at McDonald’s and waiting tables,” she tells Mental Floss. Mancini and several of her ScareHouse colleagues are mental health professionals by day—a job that's not unusual in the scare industry. “We actually hire a lot of therapists and psychoanalysts [as actors playing torturers] because they actually get a kick out of seeing how this all plays out,” Joshua Randall, the co-founder of Blackout in New York City, told CNN.
Hiring protocols vary from place to place, and some haunted houses don’t hold auditions at all. For those that do, managers generally want to check out an actor’s improvisation skills and ability to think on their feet. The ScareHouse, for instance, has prospective actors complete a traditional interview first. Some questions are standard, while others are more specific to the job (Why do you want to work in a haunted house? Are you allergic to latex or makeup? Are you physically able to wear heavy costumes?). Once the interview portion is out of the way, candidates are asked to act out a spooky scene.
Actors have to re-audition each season—which generally begins in early September—and “not everyone is always hired back,” Mancini says. This could be for several reasons. For one, the sets are usually already designed by the time auditions are held, and managers might be looking for certain skills or body types to fill a particular role. For instance, a petite person might be needed to squeeze into a tighter space, and some of the costumes might require an actor of a certain height. Then there’s the competition. “Better talent [at auditions] is a thing each year as well,” Mancini says. “ScareHouse is consistently upping the performance expectations each season.”
Acting in a haunted house requires more improvisation and audience interaction than most other types of acting. Some people come in with extensive theater experience and fail miserably in their auditions. “Just because you’re a good actor doesn’t meant that you’d be a good haunt actor,” Mancini says. Others get hired but end up quitting halfway through the season because they hate the high level of interaction and demands of the job (both physical and mental).
Shawn Lowry, a railroad construction worker who used to volunteer at the Haunted Hillside in Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, says being confronted by customers is often the hardest thing for new actors to adjust to. Patrons might scream in your face, mock you, try to get you to break character—and you have to be able to take it. “You’re going to get heckled. It’s not going to be like being on a stage where people are paying to watch and be quiet,” he says. “You’re being challenged by the audience.”
Getting hit in the face is one of the many occupational hazards of being a haunt actor. If actors are doing their jobs really well and scaring the living daylights out of people, it could trigger a “fight or flight” response in their patrons. The former reaction is when things start to get pretty scary—not just for customers, but for the actors, too. “They forget that they paid to have fun and play along with the show, and that they are not really in any danger,” Lowry says. “I’ve seen some hairy situations with drunk folks showing up and getting rough with actors.”
Jacob Hall, a former haunted house actor in San Antonio, Texas, wrote about his experience with drunk customers for Esquire. “On Friday and Saturday nights, the bar-dwellers came out. So did their inner demons. The first time I was ever punched in the face came courtesy of a frat bro,” he wrote. “The scariest thing in a haunted house is often the people who visit it.”
Because of the potential for danger, many haunted houses are well-equipped with security cameras and guards. Mancini says a security guard is always stationed inside the ScareHouse’s camera monitor room, and if any of the workers need assistance, they can turn to the nearest camera and make a hand signal that they've been briefed on in advance. That will summon backup immediately.
In addition to the risk of getting clocked in the face, the job is also physically exhausting. Some actors have to sit motionless in a rocking chair or stand quietly in a corner for hours on end, pouncing only when a group of people walk in. Others are required to slide across the floor on knee pads or hobble around on stilts all night. Ky Scott, who volunteered at a couple of haunted attractions in Vancouver, British Columbia, told Mental Floss she worked three-hour shifts with no breaks, lying quietly in a coffin and popping up whenever a group walked through. “To stay in character doing the same thing more or less over and over again is hard on the voice and hard on the body,” Scott says. “By the end of it, your voice is hoarse, you’re sweaty, and you need a shower and a nap.”
It can get really hot in the haunt, especially early on in the season when temperatures might be upwards of 80 degrees. This is especially true if you happen to be wearing a full-body costume. “In the past we've had a full grizzly bear costume—head-to-toe fur, fairly realistic. It can be too much for some actors,” Mancini says. “But if someone does one of those characters, the haunt has ice vests for folks to wear so they don't overheat and stay as comfortable as they can in it.” The many-pocketed vests are filled with little ice packs, and a manager goes around replacing the ice packs in the pockets when they melt.
When it comes to voice protection, proper screaming technique is crucial. “If you scream all night from your throat, you’ll lose your voice after night two,” Mancini says. The actors at her haunt are taught how to growl and snarl from their diaphragms instead of their throats—the same technique many professional singers use.
Even if there's no screaming involved, different character voices require a bit of preparation. Scott studied theater arts at Vancouver's Studio 58 training school, so she knew she should do lots of vocal warm-ups before talking in her “weird little girl voice” for the role as a possessed doll. If all else fails, tea and honey are a scare actor’s best friend.
When customers aren't around, one actor might call out to another “I dropped them!” In haunted house parlance, this means a visitor was so scared that they fell to the floor—and it's considered an accomplishment. “It’s always great every time an actor does that for the first time because it is one of the cooler things to do,” Mancini says. It's an even bigger win if someone “melts into the floor” in fear and has to crawl out of the room on their hands and knees.
Some might even lose control of their bowels. One time, a ScareHouse patron was so petrified that she pooped her pants, Mancini recounted with a tinge of pride in her voice. (She's not an outlier, either. One haunted house in San Antonio offered a $200 reward to any actor who could make a customer defecate.)
Sure, it might be a little sadistic to enjoy scaring people, but Lowry says adult customers are fair game because they knew what they were signing up for. “I’ve seen actors high-five and laugh because they had grown-ups crying—like, ‘Oh man, did you see that woman? She was bawling,’” Lowry says. But for him and many other actors, kids are an exception. Lowry has broken character before to stop other actors from tormenting children who were already terrified.
Considering the loss of bodily function that happens from time to time, cleaning supplies are often tucked away where customers can’t see them, according to Mancini. Someone from management will come clean up any puddles of pee or piles of poo that may have escaped their frightened guests, and this can usually be taken care of quickly without interrupting the flow of foot traffic. For bigger spills, an actor might be asked to stay in character and prevent customers from advancing to the next room while other staff clean up. Staff have also been known to hand out garbage bags to patrons who have had accidents—“to protect their car seats when they leave,” Mancini explains.
It’s a classic scare tactic: One actor is the designated “distraction” while the other swoops in from some dark corner to scare you silly. The decoy actor then does something even bigger to keep ramping up the fear. “It’s a team effort,” Mancini says, adding that she loves being the distraction.
For example, in one outdoor scene this season, she plays the role of a demon. She starts out by crouching down in the middle of the path and staring creepily at guests, which freaks them out without her having to do anything big or bold. She adds: “Then they scare themselves more by continuing to move by me, still wondering what I'm going to do. Then the other actor in a hidden space amongst the trees in the yard scene comes out to do their scare. Then I would pop up and scare them from the rear. So, four or more scares by two actors in a relatively small space by using distraction and timing to our advantage.”
Feel like you’re the only one being chased and taunted? You probably are. Many scare actors look at a customer’s body language when choosing their next victim. “You always know who’s going to be an easy scare because they’re walking in a guarded [way],” Lowry says. “They’re holding their boyfriend or girlfriend tighter and they have their arms crossed.” Other actors, like Mancini, prefer to target patrons who look like they’ll be more of a challenge to get a reaction out of. “Our goal is for every customer to ‘get got’ at least once,” she says.
Longtime scare actors might be desensitized to haunted houses, but that’s not the case for every actor. For some of those with fears, it’s a lot easier to work in a haunted house than to visit one. “I’m petrified of going into haunted houses but I really like acting in them because I’m on the other side of it,” Scott says.
Similarly, Lowry is claustrophobic—a common fear that many haunted house designers try to tap into. Once, while visiting a new haunted house, he freaked out in one those “giant sphincters” (officially known as squeeze rooms) that you have to push your way through. “Other people’s faces have been exfoliated on those things. I’m walking through and it smells like a locker room and I literally had a panic attack when I went through it,” he says. Fortunately, the haunted house he worked for didn’t have any super-tight corridors.
Haunted houses have plenty of slow days early on in the season, so there’s a lot of standing around. Sometimes, things can get a bit too sleepy: Lowry says once one of his fellow actors was supposed to ring a bell to alert actors in the next room that a group was about to come through, but since there were so few customers that day, he fell asleep at his station. Patrons thought he was a prop so they kept walking into the next room, where they were puzzled to see Lowry and a few of his co-workers “BSing out of character with masks off.” Oops.
On the other hand, Lowry recommends not waiting until Halloween day to visit a haunted house. Not only will it be crowded on Halloween, there’s also a good chance the actors will be tired and “phoning it in,” so you probably won’t get to see their peak performance.
Scare acting jobs tend to pay around minimum wage, or roughly $20 a night, Mancini says. However, this varies from one haunted house to the next. A couple recent job postings on Indeed, for example, offered a rate of $50-$75 per night. Suffice to say, it’s not exactly a money-making venture. Both Lowry and Mancini love the macabre, and Scott says volunteering at a haunted house was a fun way to develop her acting chops. “Everyone who loves haunt acting does it because they get something out of it,” Mancini says. “No one continues to be a haunt actor for an extended period of time for the money.”

I have been trying to write about something, but I cannot quite find the words. The other day, I started and ended up merely talking about Bettina, Sunshine, and Manna. I shall try again.
For well past two and a half years, day in and day out, I have lived with great criticism. It is a devastating thing to always have the worst assumed about you, to be judged and found wanting on every level, to have a mirror held up to you that is so distorted nothing you see is real. What you knew as real is lost as the sight you thought you recognized ripples into the lie, words that fill your mind drown out the Word you knew. When boundaries are crossed and the work environment fills nights and weekends, you can find yourself spinning around in all directions. I did.
In the midst of that, I found the pure doctrine. That should have been the perfect anchor. It was. I just couldn't see it.
What called to me in the Book of Concord, its siren song, is Christ crucified. There is no sweeter thing on earth than objective grace. Someone once called the Gospel elusive to me. I liked that, for it had the promise of a day when it wouldn't be. That day finally came, has been sweet on my tongue for a while now, that I have been savoring, storing up the memory for the times—I know will surely come again—when I lose sight of that which the Holy Spirit has shown me.
A perfect example, I think, is the freedom I found in the answer to a recent desperate email to Brother Goose about feeling like a fraud in writing out the Snippets intro:
You are only fraudulent if that's a lie. If it's not, then you are indeed a poor, miserable sinner who has found a source of comfort in the Book of Concord. A lifeline, of sorts, thrown out to a person who is drowning and who clings to its message for dear life.
So the Snippets are tossed out in the hopes that some other poor, miserable sinner might find in their Gospel message the same lifeline you've found.
You don't toss them out as a person who is anything other than a sinner involved in divine worship - in the exercises of faith as it struggles with despair (Tractatus 51).
Now, the key is to STOP LOOKING AT YOURSELF! You ARE a sinner and will remain one so long as you live in this flesh; the key is to let the Lutheran Confessions guide your attention away from yourself and to rest your eyes solely on Christ. In many ways this is the struggle that constitutes the Christian faith: looking to self vs. looking to the Savior. The one way leads only to despair (when we're honest) or to pride (when we're blinded); the other leads to tears of joy and songs of praise. For all us sinners, God has set forth His Son as the Propitiation, the wiping out of our sin, and of the whole world's! In Christ, your sins are forgiven, hidden beneath the saving blood. So the struggle goes on about where to focus attention. And you write the Snippets as a bit of an exercise for yourself and for others in allowing the attention to stay focused on the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
Goose, you have no other righteousness than Him. And He is enough. And more than enough. It is not your hold on Him that saves; it is His hold on you. And in Baptism He has said to you that He's got you and will not let you go until He finishes the good work He has begun.
Anyway, Christ eased the overwhelming burden I felt over the Snippets between Brother Goose's words and another's advice to think of myself as merely a placeholder until God brings someone else along who is trained in the doctrine of our confessions. But for all his admonition about looking to the cross—and all my own gazing upon my beloved crucifixes—these words still eluded me. How ever do I do that?
Tonight, while praying the Psalter with Brother Goose (he used the Coverdale Psalter) and singing hymns (he showed me a new Gerhardt one), I told him about a confession of the Gospel I made last night. In telling him, it hit me. I really have begun to learn (I am sure the process will take the rest of the my life) to crawl into the wounds of Christ and hide there. The words I wrote last night were not mere words, were not the confession I wanted it to be, but the confession I made by the faith that Christ gave me.
The problem I have battled is that I let my eyes slip from the home I found in that first pass through the Book of Concord because I wanted something as much as I wanted the Gospel. Maybe you could say I wanted what I thought would be the greatest mercy Christ could show me. Surely I would find it hanging out with a bunch of Lutherans, eh? Ah, but Myrtle, you say, you really are stupid! Hanging out with a bunch of Lutherans also means hanging out with a bunch of sinners. Looking to them for mercy will always disappoint you even as Christ will serve you through them.
If you spend your time looking at the people in the churches, you will never really see the Church. Maybe I am not quite saying that right. But our Confession is our Church. It is what binds us together and to Him. We believe, teach, and confess that there is hope, healing, and forgiveness in the gifts of Christ, in the Sacraments, the Living Word, and the Word of Absolution. And our true home is in Him. In Him and nowhere else. In Him is salvation and nowhere else. In Him is life and nowhere else.
The greatest mercy, then, that Christ could show me is the cross. It is how He is saving me. Now, this day. And how He will tomorrow. I don't even understand the half of it, but I know that it is true.
There is a sister out there who was not helped through troubling "life events" and has walked away from the Lutheran Church in her hurt. Part of what I wrote is:
It may seem that Protestant churches are more...welcoming...of wounded people, struggling people...but what they offer is cruel, for it is a confession that puts all the burden of your faith on yourself; it is specious teaching that is truly egregious. I weep so often for my brothers and sisters in Christ in all those churches where Christ is made the new Moses, where the Gospel is distorted beyond recognition, and where forgiveness is not offered in Word and Sacrament. I know not what life event fell her. I do not really need to. I shall be praying for her that she might find the peace of Christ, taste His forgiveness, and remember her baptism.
Pray for her this day, that she might remember her baptism. Pray for me, that I might remember mine. I pray you remember yours.
Typing out the Psalter and our Confessions day after day has helped me to think about all the things Pastor F, Brother Goose, my pastors, my Internet pastors, Walther, Krauth, and Forde have taught me, all the things the Holy Spirit has been revealing to me in bits and pieces despite the maelstrom swirling through the past year and a half. You could say that I have taken in my first promise: the Living Word will never return void and will always accomplish its purpose, as as Luther put it: [the Living Word] has, and is able to do, all that God is and can do. [LC, IV, 17-18]
A while back, in great anguish, I cried out that everything had changed and yet nothing had. Tonight, I cry out the same in great joy. Nothing has changed and yet everything has.
The pain is overwhelming. My hands are stiff and sore, as are all parts of me, making it feel as if I have not taken the Celebrex at all. When I am without the knee brace, that joint simply does not function at all.
A woman stopped by with boxes and sort of looked askance at me for not rising from the couch, but I cared not. No masking for me...at least for this day and the rest of the week. At least that is my intention. I need to recover for the Saturday;s cleaning push before Sunday's open house.
A short while ago, Bettina sent me info on an app that helps you remember birthdays. I have missed four in the past six weeks. Then, I saw a commercial about a Blackberry ap that was a personal assistant of sorts. I tried to find something similar on iTunes because I missed seven bills last month, including my mortgage, despite the system of checks and balances I have in place. I did not find one, but I did find a medical assistant app that seems most helpful to me.
I put it on the first screen in the first slot. If you tap on it, you will see a red button marked "emergency information." If you press on it, you will see my name, date of birth, blood type, emergency contact, allergies, medications, primary care physician, insurance, and a note field.
In the app itself, I have entered all my medical appointments, contacts, and history (conditions, allergies, surgeries, and vaccinations). This way, at least, when I go to a new doctor and have to fill out all those forms, I will not have to battle to remember the information. I also made a note file for my asthma attacks.
I also worked on another Snippet, sweating bullets the whole time since it was on Christ's return. That means they are done through Thursday. I am trying to work ahead to make the review process easier for the editor.
My left ring finger started hurting yesterday. How I wish my rememberer worked better. Were that the case, I would have spent today in bed, not moving an inch. But, alas, I did not remember that when a finger on my left hand pains me it is because I am growing too tired.
I have been working and working and working on the house since I lost my job. And then started out this past week sleep deprived for those neurological tests. I should have spent Thursday sleeping, but alas it was more selling-the-house work.
Today was extraordinary in that my brother came for a second all-day yard fest: mowing, edging, raking, sweeping, pruning, cleaning, re-setting the rocks that border the flowerbeds, and re-arranging both decks. The difference in the yard last week was truly amazing to me. This week, I am astounded. It is the same and yet is so neat and clean and well...balanced and larger somehow. Truly the "curb" appeal, fore and aft, has greatly improved.
I do believe that all the work on the closets was worth it, for they are all no longer crammed in appearance. Inside, the entire house is much, much cleaner, though it could still use help. It is also neat and balanced and larger somehow. Hopefully, it will all be worth it.
The problem is, I have reached the point of no return. My right knee has begun to fail, causing me to cry out even as I try to endure the pain in silence. That great barometer of my fatigue has gone from mere warning to breaking in protest. Out came the knee brace, but truly I probably need to sleep at least until the open house slated for next Sunday.
To be honest, I am disappointed in myself. I should remember these things. I should be able to take better care of myself. I should be better at pacing and setting boundaries...except...except...there really isn't anyone else to ready the house and readying the house is what is needed to sell it. And my rememberer is clearly broken.
With my brother willing to help both days, I had to leverage that assistance. Without his help, and that of Sunshine, I never would have regained control of my yard, which most certainly has been ignored for the past three seasons, if not the past two years. Being ill all last summer did not bode well for mowing and such. With all that happened this summer and fall, tending the yard merely fell by the wayside. As did keeping the house clean.
I do not know when to stop. I push and push and push myself...mostly because there does not seem to be another choice. Yet...often when I do make good decisions, when I set boundaries and say I shall not do something or I need to sleep longer I am criticized, oft told I could if I wanted to or something similar. If I wanted...what I want is to be able to function like a normal person, to not have pain in my legs when I stand for any amount of time or walk about for more than an hour or so, to remember simple things, to be able to write by hand, to always know when and where I am, to see clearly, to not shake, to not faint, to not grow so blooming cold...to not...to not...the list is long.
There are, I believe, only two Sugarland songs for which I do not care: Mean Girls and Take Me As I Am. Both have melodies I find irritating and the lyrics have no real pull. Except the title of the latter one. Oh, how I wish people would take me as I am and most certainly not as they perceive me to be. I wish, with my whole being, I did not feel the pressure to mask my symptoms and struggles as much as I do.
That is what I love best about Bettina. Well, second best. I mean, I love that she loves me. I marvel that she loves me. I am, actually, in disbelief that she loves me. She loves me as I am. She also takes me as I am. She is as mindful of my struggles as I could want a person to be, watching out for things that are a problem for me, such as bending over, turning around in the car, and walking up stairs too often. She helps me in so very many tiny ways and she is always, always, always willing to do something for me, to save the step, to save the energy. And yet, all the while, she never makes me feel as if I am a bother or am being lazy or am actually anything other than normal. My life is our normal.
I can tell her that I am too hot and she will leap into action. She does not question me or doubt me or tell me that she doesn't feel hot. None of those things, if they cross her mind, cross her lips. She just helps me get cool or find a place where wet noodle status will not be a danger to me. She has seen me wilt like a plucked flower in the August sun. She knows my fears and frustrations when wet noodletude arises. So, she is there, helping me if she can or waiting for things to pass if she cannot.
The best thing is that she does so sort of folding me into her life. When I am at her home, if I am ensconced on the couch, she goes about her duties and hollers at me or sets up a DVD or something for me. She trusts that I do not expect her to interact with me (though I am quite greedy about playing games with her even though she oft humiliates me with her brilliant play). So, when she can, she will bring the chore to where I am, such as folding laundry or peeling apples. Again, I am not a bother, just part of the ebb and flow of her existence. I love that. I truly do.
It is that quality, in at least some measure, that I recognize in Sunshine. Oh, did she bear such grief her first few Sundays. Yet she never crumpled beneath the burden. God has blessed her with this amazing ability to simply take in what she hears and then lay it at the foot of the cross. The Holy Spirit has guided her, on any number of occasions, to care for me in very small ways that are not necessarily time consuming but have great mileage on my heart. A favorite is that she heard me talk about bread pretzel bites that I had just once at a movie theatre and still dream about since they were served with nacho cheese. The next time she was at her volunteer place and was actually coming back to my house rather than going on home, she spotted a pretzel place and picked up one for me. Oh, how my heart sang and wept at such thought.
Like, well, Manna's quickie emails. Little snippets of her day that she shares. Little snippets she sends to let me know that she is thinking of me. Such a heady thing, a wondrous thing to be thought of and loved and cared for and to have people let you know in small ways because they understand that knowing is important and needed and...healing.
Something, too, that I know about Bettina and Sunshine is that, with me at least, they look more toward the future rather than the past. They do not assume one thing based on what I have done, but rather expect for good rather than bad, rather than the mistake. They see where change has come and celebrate that, help me see that, rather than where failures still run hip deep.
I had a secret that I kept, out of great fear, from Bettina. Events in August brought that into the light. She responded with more mercy than I ever thought possible. I do not believe that I have ever felt more loved, more safe, than in that moment when she first responded to the fear I voiced as to why I did not tell her. It was as if Christ Himself, not my dear friend, was giving voice to those words. It was the beginning of freedom that has worked itself into the darkness and despair unbeknownst to me at first. A washing away that only comes from absolute forgiveness.
When I despaired over the condition of the fifth petition of the Lord's Prayer because it certainly sounded like law to me, Brother Goose went round and round to help me understand. I could finally make sense of his words, but I did not really believe them, take them into my heart. They were still a mystery to me. The sign of our being forgiven is that we can forgive others. Yet I know that she could not have given me that forgiveness for the lie of omission and the distrust in her love and the gift of her friendship that was my silence unless she had been forgiven herself. Oh, do I understand that now!
At her words, too, began the process of finally trusting in her friendship, in her love. Less than two months later came a time of such trial born of a lie from someone else that tested that trust in a horrible way. Yet she did not, at least with me, flinch at my fear and doubts and the wall I threw up in haste. She waited and then came running when I cried out for help. And sat and talked and listened to hard things and took me out to do that which few others would even understand. She wrapped me up in as much love as possible and then walked away to get back to her family, trusting that the future would be as God would have it.
I sometimes wish I could ask her things as if I were another person, not me, not Myrtle. First and foremost, I would ask her what is the hardest part about loving me, for I would do most anything to make that cross easier for her to bear. It is a cross. I know it. I would think that the hardest part of our fifteen year friendship is that I doubt that she will continue to love, will continue to want me in her life. To be fair, that is the kind of relationship outcome I learned as a child. And, to be fair, I cannot actually remember the bulk of those fifteen years because of my blasted brain cells. Yet I know those 15 years have passed as a fact even if not as a memory that I can re-live. I should trust that.
I have changed. The wailing has ceased. The weeping, for loss and grief, will ease when it eases. Doubts and fears and terrors and worries still exist. Yet I also understand that which I hoped would be possible is not and most likely will never be and I have laid that hope down. In the laying down has come balance. And in all those Psalms have come peace.
In no small part, I have also changed because I am more at ease with her friendship than I have ever been...more joyful, actually. What an amazing gift God has given me born from a terrible, terrible cross! Such is faith. Such is the life He has for us.
So, this night, is in part peaceful because of Sunshine's companionship and her selfless collating and folding of the 100 copies of the Dare to Read: The Book of Concord booklets that have been sitting in a box for a couple of months, is an easier night to bear.
It is also an easier night because I know, when Bettina and I talk next, I can bewail and bemoan the absolute misery I am in due to pain and the bone deep fatigue. She will listen, love me, and pray for me. She will, as she is wont to do, search for some little way I can do something easier, some bit of organization or some process, or some remembering help, and she will tell me to take better care of her best friend. But she will also accept me as I am. She will let me voice my pain and not take it as complaint. She will let me voice my fears and not take it as criticism. She will let me voice my heart and merely take it as wanting not to be alone in those things.
She will love me in such a way as I can understand--juggling the needs of her family with our friendship as best she can--patiently and selflessly, reflecting the love and mercy of Christ to me, because she is forgiven and she is loved by the Good Shepherd who is also the Lamb who takes away the sins of the world.
As silly as it sounds, my prayer would be that everyone have a Bettina in their lives. I pray that everyone would have a Sunshine to shower mercy and a Manna to reach out and touch and a Brother Goose to ask questions that they might learn that which is missing in their life, in their heart.
We have entered Advent today, that ineffably joyous time of reflecting on the many ways Christ comes to us. Today, He came to me in a dear woman who traced the cross on my forehead after I was served the Eucharist so that I might have the tangible reminder I need. Today, He came to me in a brother who labored long and hard in my yard. Yesterday, He came to me in a writing student who took from her college holiday break to help me in my yard. This week, He came to me in an adoptive brother who carved out a smidge of time to pray the Psalter with me for courage to walk through a door. This month, He came to me in a realtor who has poured out her life in finding me a home to buy, sight unseen, so that I can start a new life. This summer, He came to me in a woman who offered to scrub my tub and another woman who offered to read the Living Word to me and sing hymns to me. This spring, He came to me in a man who offered to be my brother, both men who have more on their plates than any three men should have. Last year, He came to me in the pure doctrine of the Lutheran Confession and in the holy waters of Baptism and in the Eucharist and in the Word of Absolution. Fifteen years ago, He came to me in a woman who sat in one of my classes, who would end up loving me as He does so that I might taste and see that I am loved. Thirty-two years ago, He came to me in a single verse of the Living Word that has deepened into an ardent passion and hunger for the Gospel and the promises of God. Two thousand years ago, He came to me in a broken and bruised body, put to death in abject shame, that I might know forgiveness.
I spent this day trying to make progress on reducing the things in my house. While I did not gain as much ground as I would have wished, I did complete a long desired task: creating a spreadsheet of the Book of Concord quotes on my Facebook page!
This past week, I created a spreadsheet of the psalms used in the Snippets emails because it is difficult for me to remember whether or not I have already used a particular Psalm. I would rather laboriously open up the past files or log onto the interface and pick through them. And then the next day I couldn't remember any of them that I reviewed the day before. Now, I just glance down my chart and can quickly determine if I have used it or not. The same was true for my Book of Concord status posts.
Now, repeats are not bad at all, but there are so many riches contained in both the Psalter and the Book of Concord that I do not wish to repeat until repeats are necessary. With the Psalter, that will be in 100 more emails. With the Book of Concord...well...probably many years!
This day, I would also like to note the power of the Living Word, once more. Truly, I believe typing out nearly 1/3 of the Psalter to date has helped heal some of the hurt and confusion that I have borne of late. Night after night, the Word has fallen from my lips and my fingertips and then back into my ears as I read and re-read to ensure I have not made a mistake. These prayers have filled my days and sometimes my nights.
And then there is Sunshine, who has consistently prayed the Psalter over me, putting my name into the Word, the Word that is the words of my heart spoken aloud, spoken by Christ, spoken and brought into the light, rather than the darkness that can be so terrifying, such despair.
I am walking in a measure of peace that is actually rather foreign to me. I have hope that I have never experienced before. And I am reminded of my baptism at every turn. Yes, some things are still so difficult that I do not see a way around them. I have suffered such losses of late they seem unbearable. I have been without the consolation and comfort of the Word of Absolution for months. And I have so many questions about the Gospel, about doctrine, that the hunger drives me crazy half the time. But I do see the cross. Christ be praised, I do!
As much as I longed to take in the body and blood of Christ, I was tired. Very tired. Brother Goose called to pray some psalms with me before I went in and she sat with me in the pew. Well, she sat and I lay down.
She asked if I wanted her to stay with me, a query to which I nodded emphatically. I did not want to commune. However, it turned out that I did. By mistake, she was not served. I tried to get the server's attention, but I failed. My utter joy at what I received with mixed with great sorrow at what she lost in staying by my side.
Sunshine, so aptly nicknamed, took joy in the forgiveness wrapped in healing and sustenance that I received, rather than focused on what she missed. She was truly happy for me.
We are taught that there is no greater love than a friend who lays down his life; Sunshine gave up life. Could there be greater love than that? I am truly humbled by her care of me, primarily because so often I clearly see the Holy Spirit at work, giving her Words to pray, hymns to sing, when she could not truly know how much that particular Psalm, that particular hymn would mean to me in that moment. She is quick to always say she is no great person. In that respect, she, too, is a miserable, wretched sinner. But she is baptized, given the name of Christ, and filled with the Holy Spirit who works through her that He might love me, care for me, with her hands and her voice.
In the same way, my beloved Bettina lets me know that I am loved, playing iPod games with me, miles apart but together nonetheless. She sent me a doodle drawing. She makes quick calls. She sings and prays. She tells me about her day. She records the silly songs her son sings. She includes me in her life. Her husband sends his love and affection via offers of stuffing--how well he knows my gluttonous desire for such good food!
In the same way, Manna reaches out from the great white north and sends those wonderful quickie update emails on the moments of her day, with encouragement and messages from her husband as well. He's been painting up a storm and I get to tease him about having a new painting job waiting for him in Fort Wayne if I close on the house, Lord willing. It is good to joke and laugh and tease a bit, to step outside the job loss and uncertainty and pain and fatigue and just have those newsy, breezy, cheery exchanges.
In the same way, the editor takes time out of his crammed life to regularly preview the Snippets emails for me--full well he knows how important it is to me to be sharing the Book of Concord in a good, right, and salutary manner.
I scheduled three days of testing, orginally during vacation days, thinking that it would be the best way to knock out some of the neurological tests that, hopefully, will shed light on how stupid I have gotten over the past couple of years.
I was truly not prepared for the pain. And I did not rise to the occaision, embrace it as a cross to bear. Instead, every minute all I could do was hang on just one minute more.
The tech started out by running a comb through my hair to find her reference points. My hair was somewhat wet since I was instructed to wash it, so the comb pulled and tore out significant chuncks on more than one occaision. Now, I had electrodes attached to my head on Monday. Trust me, this was totally different.
She also scrubbed my skin until it was abraded in several places. On the side of my neck, it was raw and the paste stung so much that tears leaked down my cheeks despite trying to be brave. I ended up having her move that electrode over enough to avoid the abrasion.
What puzzles me most about the day was that staring at a red dot on a screen actually hurt my right eye to the point it was watering profusely during the second round.
I should have realized, truly, that it was not going to be a good day when I got lost four times walking through the hospital trying to find the lab.
If you ask me, running electrical current through ankles and wrists is not the best way to gather data. I mean, I was supposed to remain calm, eyes closes, silent, with no other brain waves than the response to the current. It is very, very difficult to remain that way when in significant amount of pain. I would also proffer the tech shouldn't have repeatedly told me just how hard it would be and that most of her patients did not complete the test. She gave me every opportunity to quit, to not even start, instead of encouraging me through the process.
After the first pass on my left wrist, with one more pass to go on that side and double passes on my other three limbs, I asked her to count down the time, to provide periodic updates so that I knew how much longer it would last. With each update, I prayed the prayer my pastor wrote out for me when he was sharing how he managed to get through hard things: Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.
I am so tired, so very tired. My limbs still hurt. My neck still feels as if it is on fire. And I am glad that the mercy of Christ carried me through the past three days.
What was the most managable test, you ask? The one measuring my auditory pathways. In the ear not being tested, white noise was broadcast. I concentrated on that sound, instead of the clicking, and was able to remain relaxed, probably getting the best data of the day.
Will this day, this week, bring me closer to an answer? I do not know. The neuropsych exam in December should at least fill in a greater part of the picture. The neurologist just does not know if enough will be painted for him to determine what I need.
I will admit, the best part of the past three days is that I did not have to mask for a single second. It was actually important that all my weaknesses, all my confusion, all my disorientation be transparent to the technicians running the tests.
The wicked part of MS is that many times the tests fail to pinpoint the whys and wherefores of symptoms. I am ready to receive such news. However, I am hoping that will not be the case. Oh, how I long for at least some data that will pinpoint the type of cognitive dysfuction so that I might develop better coping strategies, that I might remain independent longer.
I have wanted to at least get one day ahead on the Snippets of the Book of Concord emails so that I can be sure to have feedback. This morning, the editor gave me some strong edits, most excellent stuff, but I received them after it had gone out. This was my fault since I wrote it in the middle of the night.
So, I spent this evening doing the next three Snippets. That means...yes...you guessed right...typing up three psalms in one evening. Whilst my fingers did grow a bit clumsy from all that labor, my heart sang.
It sang more brightly, too, for Sunshine called with a psalm ready for me this evening, knowing a day of tests and an offer on the house (a disappointing low-ball one it turns out) would be a trial for me. Given that the MRI scheduled for tomorrow was canceled since, apparently, four weeks is not long enough for authorization, it was an even crappier day. Sunshine did not know this, but the Holy Spirit did.
He gave her Psalm 62 for me. SIGH. BLISS. Oh how I savor having the Living Word poured over me, but I will say I am rather partial to psalms being prayed for me with my name in them the way I have done for others.
I have asked God for just one thing, one small thing, to be easy. So much, so very much has been hard for a long while. I am fatigued, yes, but I am also weary. Feeling embattled on all fronts, I asked God for just one thing in my life to be easy. Just now, I realized that God has done this; He has made one thing easy for me!
For a few months now, I have been able to step foot into my shower without fear, without the fear of falling. I have been able to do this because Sunshine scrubs my tub for me every other week. Laboring selflessly on my behalf, she scours it smooth so that I stand on sure foot. Not only does she do this, but she remembers each time and offers to do so freely, never making me ask her for help. In all ways, this is an easy thing.
Last month, when I was not at home and longed for a shower, my pastor's wife retrieved what I needed to wash my hair from my bathroom (its length requires some serious detangling conditioner), my pastor brought it to me, and a stranger stood watch over me. Even there I was safe.
Sunshine and my brother spent the entire afternoon working on the yard for me. The greatest task was to prune the crepe myrtle by the front door. The before and after is simply stunning; before was a tree taking over practically the whole home...an after of a beautifully shaped decorative tree enhancing an entrance with a freshly painted door (compliments of my Saturday's elbow grease) and the faceted light I installed when I moved in all those years ago now in full view.
I did prune some myself, since cutting branches off the crepe myrtle is as painful to me as working on my bonsais. There was much "negotiation" on nearly every cut. No tears were shed, however.
The yard was mowed, edged, and raked as well. The rose of sharon bushes lining the fence all have fresh mulch beneath them and the varigated euonymus bushes out front are finally no longer unruly messes. My brother even when so far are to clean out the shed, which I had gone through and "reduced" gardening pots and supplies to the essentials in preparation for the move.
Poor Sunshine, she had not spare shoes with her, so there she was raking, sweeping, dragging branches, and bagging leaves in her Sunday finest. What a servant's heart God has placed within her as He knit her in her mother's womb.
This is a bit of a problem since I am not to have more than four hours sleep before one of tomorrow's medical tests. I shall have to occupy myself for a few hours yet before seeking the comfort of my pillows.
The house was listed Thursday night. In three days, I had three prospective buyers. The first made an offer this evening, though since it is sitting in a sealed envelope at the realtor's office, I know not yet if it is a good one. Never would I have considered actually having to wonder that.
While I am still falling off that cliff, wondering when, where, and how I will land, it seems to me God has been busy making the path to Fort Wayne quite smooth for me.
There are many things I have lost, cognitively, that are very, very hard for me to bear. A week ago, Sunshine tried to put things in perspective for me regarding why others are oft dismissive when I have tried to talk about it. Oh, but Myrtle, you’re still so smart! I could easily punch the next person who says that. She said that I was up in the clouds and while I am no longer there, I am still on the mountain tops of the folks around me. Something like that, though without the metaphor. Reduced significantly but not noticeably for those who’ve never been in the clouds.
My pastor came and brought me the Lord's Supper last Sunday. A blessed day all around! We talked at length about several of the hard things of late and my leap off the cliff in moving to Fort Wayne. He always says that he does not know what to say, but he does, because the Holy Spirit does and that is how Christ tends to His sheep, through His undershepherds.
How do I know my pastor is an undershepherd? He mentioned an album for me to buy to listen to as I lie down to sleep and when I awake from night terrors. Now, he really doesn't know me. He knows absolutely nothing of my musical tastes, save for knowing that Lord Jesus Think on Me is a hymn I would dearly love have sung over me as much as possible. I am fairly certain he does not know of my love of Fernando Ortega, my enjoyment of a few Chris Rice songs, and my adoration for all things Sugarland. He knows nothing about what types of music sing to my heart, soothing and moving me when it falls upon my ears.
The album he advised me to purchase is Lighten Our Darkness, an a capella compilation that is so beautiful my heart aches. Oh, how I miss singing. I miss the pure music made by just voices blending oh so perfectly after much practice. Truly, I bought the album because he told me to do so, trusting his advice because he is an undershepherd and because he knows something of night terrors.
The first night, I listened to it over and over again, for hours. Now, each night, I fall asleep to it. Each time I awake, I push the start button again. My heart soars at its beauty, taking comfort and strength that our Creator would give His creation such a gift as is music.
The first night, I listened to it over and over again, for hours. And I wept. I cannot hear the words. I cannot understand them. The truth, the Gospel, that is being poured over me is completely lost to me.
I used to sing. Not all that well since my break is in an awful place. But I did. The asthma changed that. But really the scrambled brains did so more. I never read music; I learned everything by ear. In the groups I sang with, I could give people my note and they’d find theirs. I was also a fair hand at working out harmony.
Sunshine and I sing hymns together. Sometimes we find one I can sing harmony, but rarely...not as much as either of us likes. And I have not been able to learn any of the melodies she has sung for me, even If God Himself Be For Me—a Gerhardt hymn that I long so much to be able to sing.
I struggle to learn hymns because I cannot hear the melody. One thing good, great gift actually, the pastor of my last parish did for me was to make those audio files of hymns so all I heard was a single voice singing the melody. I learned 27 hymns that way.
The ex-professor part of me oft wonders why it is that I can no longer distinguish notes of music. Why I cannot work out harmonies any longer. And why I cannot hear the words in so very many recordings.
The music on the album my pastor recommended is so very, very beautiful. Utterly. I am truly thankful that the Holy Spirit prompted this undershepherd to speak of that which would help me battle the terrors of the night. But I also sorrow because I cannot understand the words.
Last winter, I went Christmas caroling and got in some real trouble with the cold. Then, I had dressed warmly and had a coat, scarf, and gloves. My godmother gave me her baby to warm my chest; the pastor fetched blankets and draped them about me. I should have been toasty. But I wasn't. I couldn't really walk...whole body shivering and cramps in my leg muscles. I didn't think about it much beyond that day.
After all, anyone who really knows me knows that I embrace cold like a dear friend! I am not really comfortable until the temperature drops to the 60's. I find the 40s balmy. The 20s a bit brisk. I rarely wear a coat. My turtlenecks have gone unworn for years. My concession to the cold is a scarf and gloves, maybe another undershirt.
However, the dysautonomia has vastly affected my thermoregulation and I fear this winter, wherever I may be, is going to be a series of hard lessons for me.
Today, I went to Lowe's to fetch some sand and pea gravel to put out front (yes, I have continued to tackle projects needing done about the house even after placing it on the market). I had on my track suit, with bike shorts, thick socks, and three tank tops. I was fine when I got out of the car. I sort of felt the cool air walking across store, but thought nothing of it. Laboriously hefting the bags into the cart should have left me sweating, but it did not. Pushing the heavy cart to the checkout stand, I started to shiver. By the time it was my turn, I resembled an aspen leaf in the fall winds. The cashier actually picked up his heater and placed it on the counter for me. I really was surprised at how cold I was, given the temperature was only about 55 degrees. I keep the house at 67.
Part way across the parking lot, I fell to the ground and curled in a ball trying to warm up. I didn't care about my cart or where I was. All I could think was that I was in trouble.
Christ be praised, an older man came along with his wife and daughter. Through chattering teeth, I managed to tell him the problem. His wife took my keys and ran to the car to start the engine and turn the heat on full blast. He then basically picked me up and carried me to the car, his daughter following with the cart. After getting me settled in my seat, he unloaded my purchases in the back of the car and put the cart away for me.
It was a rather sobering moment, soaking in the heat, trying to recover enough to drive myself home. I think the randomness of it all is so difficult to handle.
I mean, this summer, there were several times that I ended up blasting the heat in my home, more than once punching the button until it reached 80 degrees. Normally, I start getting uncomfortable above 70, really noticing the temperature and its effects beginning to creep over me at 72. I never really know what might trigger the plummet in temperature. Logically, winter will be a problem. But later this evening, when I had to go out again and it was colder, I was okay. I had changed my clothing, but I still forgot to take a coat.
I will proffer that I do not believe it is a coincidence that during the inspection for the house I chose it was determined the heating system is the largest possible for the house, i.e., I shall have no problems keeping it toasty should that be necessary.
I have felt so alone, trying to make the right decisions in haste, trying to figure out what to do next, the house here, the house in Fort Wayne, the neurological testing, work, everything....
Sunshine, knowing how incredibly shell-shocked I have been over the past two days, called to pray a Psalm over me this evening as a way to end the day. Oh, how I am thankful the Holy Spirit promoted that dear woman to speak the Living Word to me!
Strengthen us by Your Spirit, according to Your will, both in life and in death, in the midst of both good and evil things, that our wills may be crucified daily and sacrificed to Your good and gracious will. Into Your merciful hands we commend Myrtle and all who face uncertainty regarding the future in these difficult days, praying for them at all times, Thy will be done!
Sunshine called to tell me some news she knew would be important to me, and I faltered upon hearing something else behind her words. Perhaps I heard wrongly, but anguish still filled my heart and tears flowed. Sunshine, so aptly nicknamed, quickly spoke of Jesus and the hope she is certain I have in the Gospel, despite how often I stumble these days. The hope that encourages her to see in me. The hope she remembers for me when I have lost sight of the cross. Oh, how well she understands my longing for it!
Without prompting, Sunshine offered to pray a Psalm for me. When she asked me to pick one, I gave her the choice, a departure for me since I usually have one in mind I am longing to hear...or two or three or four! Which one did she choose? Or, rather, which one did the Holy Spirit choose to pour over me? That dear woman prayed all of Psalm 119 for me, putting my name into the words of this prayer of longing for the strength, solace, comfort, and instruction of the Living Word.
Nothing, absolutely nothing, means more to me and speaks more to me than the Living Word. Over and over and over again, I am humbled and awed by its power to still my heart, to bring peace in the midst of a great storm...despite even the obstacles of my own flesh. Would that it were I had it poured over me every day. Surely I would grow stronger. Surely I would know peace. Surely I would be able to bear this cross.
I read it aloud to myself all the blooming time, savoring the taste on my lips and the sound in my ears. Yet it is not the same as having it poured over me. Such riches. Such wonder.
What an utter, precious, merciful gift Christ gave to me through Sunshine this day. His timing, as always, was perfect. For in that prayer, He clung to me in a way I could understand, in a way I could take in, literally, saving me from drowning in the anguish and the confusion and the failure and the sin that has overwhelmed me this day.

I've quietly been a fan of James Austin's work. I've been reading his blog and watching videos on YouTube to glean any bit of knowledge and learn his techniques for making axes. This axe represents a step forward for me. I utilized many of his techniques and even made many of the tools he uses for the creation of his axes.
Not sure exactly where this falls in the Petersen typology, so I'm calling it a G/H hybrid. Typologies are only a guide anyway. Sometimes certain shapes don't fit it exactly.
I'll finish the polish tomorrow. I am intentionally leaving some forge pits and file marks on the piece to add character. Overall, I will give it a higher grit finish and then draw it back to a smooth satin. Some of the pits and file marks will show through the finish.
I plan on hafting it this week with a hickory haft. The blade is 4.5" (11,4 cm). Overall length is 7.5" (19,5 cm). Socket and body are 1018 and the bit is 1080.
If you are interested in receiving email updates about future projects, send me a PM or email me at ericmycue374@comcast.net and I will add you to the list.
Finished polishing and hafting the Type G/H. I want to name this axe Neckbiter. Not sure how you would say that in Old Norse. Anyway, that is the feeling of this light and agile axe when you swing it. I see a warrior with a shield in one hand and Neckbiter in the other finding a hole in an opponent's guard and then plunging it into his neck. I apologize for the poor pictures. I am in the process of acquiring better photo equipment.
In many ways, this axe was a leap forward for me. I was able to use more authentic techniques and tools to create this axe. Being able to forge-weld eye socket, body, and bit together, and have it turn out virtually invisible, has been a goal of mine for years. This opens the door to many new options for making Viking axes. I have quite a few projects planned for the near future using these new methods.
Back to Neckbiter: The blade is 4.5" (11,4 cm) wide. Overall length is 7.5" (19,5 cm). Socket and body are 1018 low carbon steel and the bit is 1080 high carbon steel. I used my Rockwell files to test the edge post-heat treat and it comes out between 50 and 55 Rockwell.
I purposely left some of the files marks in the finish. These files marks are often seen on period originals; and I have to admit, I was not brave enough in years past to leave them on a piece. Now a days, I decided I'm going to make something that pleases and inspires me. Hopefully, others will find it inspiring too. Interestingly enough, it is actually harder to do this finished than just putting a high grit belt on the grinder and removing all the marks. I also left some of the forge pits in the piece. After all, this axe was forged to shape. So once I filed it to the dimension I wanted, I stopped. If there was a pit, well the pit stayed. I hand polished the body to a high grit then drew it back with a scotch-brite pad. The edge was buffed to a near mirror finish to create a pleasing contrast. The edge is hair shaving shape.
When I do a haft, I fit it through the bottom of the socket. I know that some makers make a haft that is wider at the top and slip it through the top of the axe head and slide the head up till it wedges at the top of the haft. I'm not saying this is wrong. No one knows for sure how the Viking smiths did it, but there is evidence that the axe was driven onto the haft then wedged at the top. I personally documented multiple axe heads with Peter Johnsson in Sweden that had the iron wedge with the axe head. Here is a picture of one such wedge:
I find that using a wooden wedge to spread the haft sideways in the socket and a metal wedge to spread it the opposite direction, creates a wider section at the top of the head that makes it nearly impossible for the axe to come off the haft. On Neckbiter, I inserted a wooden wedge and made an iron wedge similar to the one I documented in Sweden to secure the head on the haft.
The haft is 30.5" long. It is made of burnt hickory which has been sanded and polished to a smooth finish. It has been treated with linseed oil to preserve it. It has a subtle octagonal cross-section, and an elegant taper from the bottom to where it enters the socket.
Neckbiter is available for purchase: price is $850 which includes US domestic shipping and packaging. If you are interest, send me a PM or email. Finally, if you want to receive email update about future projects, send me a PM or an email to ericmycue374@comcast.net.

I like that you decided to go with the haft going up through the bottom of the socket. I'm not sure why people assume the hafts were mounted in the "tomahawk" style. If mounted correctly it should be plenty strong. If wood-axes can handle a tree, why couldn't war-axes handle a man or shield? Below I have linked a video that shows some Viking type axes found in Ireland in 2013 with part of the hafts still intact using just a wooden wedge (no iron wedge). This is the only find of it's kind that I am aware of, but I think it adds further support to the idea that many (if not most) Viking axes were mounted in this fashion.
I'm in the process of making a leather axe head sheath that will be included in the price of Neckbiter.
such a high contrast between the black and polished edge looks flashy! like all your gonna see coming at you is that bright edge!
LOL, I don't usually polish my stuff to a mirror finish, but when I was working on it, the look was interesting compared to the satin body; so I left it.
So, I watched that video, and I decided to contact Dr. Halpin and ask him about the Lough Corrib axe heads. I wanted to know if there were any existing wooden or iron wedges in those hafts. Here is his reply:
Thank you for your email and the very interesting issues you raise. I would think, in general terms, that your theory is most likely correct and I can confirm that there are wedges in the top of the hafts of at least two of the Lough Corrib axeheads. However, they are not iron wedges – they are wooden, as you’ll see in the attached photo. We do have one or two other medieval axes (tools, rather than weapons) with iron wedges. I hope this is helpful to you.
So, I know this is a leap but when Peter and I were at Husbyborg we saw several axe heads (Type M) that had small iron wedges in the box with the head:
It is my theory that one possible method for axe and haft attachment was to use wooden wedges to spread the top of the haft parallel with the axe head then use a narrow iron wedge to split the wooden wedge and spread it perpendicular to the axe head. This would effectively provide a wider top of the haft that would prevent the head from coming off.
In addition, I learned from my carpenter cousin years ago, that the way to put a hammer head on a haft is to allow the weight and inertia of the head to drive itself onto the haft; so, when I put an axe head on a haft, I start the axe head on the very top of the haft, then I pound the bottom of the haft on my anvil. After about 5-6 firm strikes, the head has forced itself down onto the haft. I then use a aluminum dowel and mallet to correct any misalignment.
I also try to taper the top of my hafts so that it grows a bit wider where I want the axe head to stop. This is the same principle that we use to wedge a pommel onto a tang. The fit is so tight and secure that I have been able to test cut smaller diameter (6-8") logs in half with the axe and not have a wedge at the top. I did this with Patrick Kelly's Type M to test the blade sharpness, blade strength, and the fit of the head on the haft.
So, you combine a properly tapered haft, a properly seated axe head, and a wedge system at the top of the haft, and I you arrive at what I believe is a historically plausible method for assembling an axe.
Of course, please don't read me to say that this is "how they did it." I'm merely putting forward an theory about one possible method. Like I said, food for thought. I welcome other theories as well.
When I checked the tracking for UPS the next week, all it said was "Ready for Pick-up." I didn't think anything of it because UPS sometimes is slow in updating that stuff, but the first package (the sword) was scheduled to be delivered on Wed. Wed comes and no packages. I contact UPS but they have no record of the package even being in their possession. Thursday I file an investigation.
So, now I'm thinking what is the status of Neckbiter. It is suppose to be delivered Friday. I contact UPS and they have no record that it was even picked up. So, now I'm freaking out. I go to Staples cause all kinds of stuff is running through my head: an employee stole them or a customer standing in line heard me talk about them and came in and took them, but I'm thinking how can two large boxes be carried out of Staple without being noticed, but then again, UPS has no record of even picking them up.
Nonetheless, I ask the store manager to look at the security tape to see if something strange happened. She was very helpful and understanding. She agreed to review the tape. Conclusion: she saw the UPS man pick up the packages and take them out on his cart. So, now, WTF!!! UPS has no record of them, they were picked up, no one knows where they are...I'm flipping out.
Friday comes and Neckbiter is not delivered. So, I'm now depressed. I keep thinking someone stole the packages. I file a claim on Neckbiter and UPS begins to search for the package.
Meanwhile, I travel with Peter Johnsson to Kevin Cashen's. The whole time I'm checking for updates: nothing. The whole weekend I am depressed.
I get home Monday and I check the status for both packages...nothing...still investigating. So, I email the guys that bought the sword and Neckbiter. I get done sending the messages, and my phone rings, not joking, a minute later. It is Staples. They found the packages. So, I go to Staples, and they tell me that the UPS driver picked up the packages, loaded them in his truck, and drove to the back where he drops off the packages for things that were ordered online. They put these packages in a cage till the customer comes to pick them up. Apparently, he unloaded my packages and put them in the cage. It wasn't until Monday evening that an employee noticed that the two packages fit the description of my missing packages and took them to the manager. CRAZY!
What a relief! I asked them to put new labels on them so there is no mix up with the tracking numbers being investigated. So, now the sword and Neckbiter are on their way to their new homes.
Damn, Eric, that is crazy. I don't envy you. I have my own UPS horror stories, and one particularly terrible one... but nothing i'm willing to share at this point.

[EN] I'm not a fan of the idea of long lasting manicure as I usually get bored with it by the 5th day. I don't use gel polishes on myself and hadn't got any long lasting type polishes such as solar ones before. But I liked the color of Preview shade by Orly Epix and decided to try this one out. And I loved it!!!
[EN] The shade is quite bright coral-y red, but with some white and yellow undertone. It's neither too hot nor too neutral. By the way the bottle isn't transparent but black - its outside color is to match the polish but it doesn't though.
[EN] The polish's formula is excellent, with its comfortable application, soft brush and fast drying. Opaque in two coats. The special top coat is very good: it doesn't smudge any design, doesn't bubble, dries fast and kind of bounces and evens on the nails if you do something bad and touch your hair while the polish is wt for example. This looks like the best part of all the epix concept. And the worst part is both the color polish and the top stink like hell! Not only during the application but also about 12 hours after.
[EN] The nail art was inspired by the polish's color and our hibiscus plant as well. From June up to now it's been in bloom. Almost every day there's a new flower that dies in the evening and the circle repeats.
I applied regular white polish on my accent nail and then painted the flower and leaves using the same Orly polish and other polishes, mixed with it a bit for the harmony. I have to say that all my manicure lasted for 6 days and then chipped on one finger (not an accent one). So the truth is the predictable fact that it's the special top coat that makes my mani last longer, and the color polish doesn't really matter.

Recently with the Easter period, eggs have featured alot in the supermarkets and television adverts, as eggs are supposed to symbolise new life. Now I am always on the lookout for interesting food items, and when I saw that there were Blue Eggs being sold in Aldi, my interest was instantly piqued. Hence I had to buy this for my family to try.
Now when you first look at the box, it says that it has rich, creamy yolks and a deep flavour. The question is whether it would deliver that experience. At £1.49 for 6 eggs, it is not exactly expensive and worth a try just for the experience.
As you can see, the shell is bluish-white in colour and definitely stands out compared to the normal egg shell. But is the difference only on the surface?
Now on cracking the egg to fry, the egg yolk does look deeper yellow in colour than normal free range eggs. Now my wife has been given organic free range eggs in the past which have an even deeper yellow yolk, and she says that she can definitely taste the difference – hence she was a little underwhelmed by the blue eggs.
But the big question is whether it actually tastes different? My wife says that the white definitely tastes softer, but otherwise could not taste much difference. My oldest daughter who had two of these eggs, liked them – but could not say that they tasted different to the normal eggs (we buy free range eggs as that is what my wife prefers) she eats.
It does look that these eggs are what we can call posh eggs and a novelty. The taste difference at best is subtle. It was worth a try, but would not be on our shopping list on a regular basis.

François Lamathe Bédos de Celles (1709-1779), described as a "monk of notable erudition," was also a highly trained and supremely talented builder of organs in eighteenth century France. The greatest of his organs was Dom Bedos, built for the abbey of Saint-Croix in Bordeaux -- a glorious instrument with rich blends and subtle colors, with nuanced balances and stark contrasts, with whispering pianissimos and roaring fortissimos.
François Lamathe Bédos de Celles de Salelles, known as Dom Bédos de Celles, (born in Caux, Hérault near Béziers, France 24 January 1709) was a Benedictine monk best known for being a master pipe organ builder. He was elected to the French Academy of Sciences at Bordeaux and correspondent of the Academy at Paris in 1758.
As a recognized organ-builder, he was called upon to carry out repairs and appraise and advise other organ-builders in many locations across France.
In 1776-78 he published his treatise L'art du facteur d'orgues (The Art of the Organ-Builder). This monumental opus contains great historical detail about eighteenth-century organ building, and is still referred to by modern organ-builders.
The construction of the organ in the Abbey Sainte-Croix de Bordeaux was undertaken between 1744 and 1746 by Dom Bedos, monk of the abbey. It was completed around 1750. (lack of documentation raises doubts.)
The organ then undergoes an intervention in 1771,escaped the looting of the revolution, and is again restored in 1811.
In 1812, the Archbishop of Bordeaux, supported by various musical authorities of the city decides to make an exchange of instruments between the Holy Cross Abbey and the Cathedral of Saint Andrew. The buffet alone remains in place. The organ of Dom Bedos is therefore in the cathedral, while coming to Holy Cross the organ of the cathedral, which itself came from the church of Saint-Pierre Réole.
During its stay at the cathedral the organ of Dom Bedos underwent several revisions and transformations (1840,1877,1919,1933,1946,1954,1962)
Led by organist Francis Rosary and architect Henry Lequeux, and other musical authorities, the decision was taken in 1970 to build a new organ in the cathedral and rebuild the organ of Dom Bedos in St. Croix as a buffet. All the old material is recovered, graded and stored at Holy Cross.
Close examination of the buffet, windchests, the study of various inventories, old labels designating the stops and the treaty "The art of organ builder" Written by Dom Bedos himself helped carry out this reconstruction and is arguably one of the highlights of recent decades in the world of the organ.

On Sunday, I wanted to go for a swim and rallying the family to get ready to get out of the house was proving too difficult. In order to make great use of the beautiful Sydney sunshine, I decided on a slow ride to the beach (I usually like getting the heart rate up and tearing along as quickly as I can). I left everything at home except a beach towel in my backpack. I went down the path of simplicity – no phone, keys, wallet or other belongings!
I can confidently say I still suck at it and still don’t like swimming, BUT decided to spice things up yesterday by adding in other elements of a triathlon (Cycle and Run)! After my slow and stuttery 350m in the water, I went for a soft-sand run, doping 3.5 laps of the beach I was on (later calculated to be 1.2km total).
As I had done the swim and the run, I was left with the cycle – so I rode home (again, at a leisurely pace).
This was mostly a spur-of-the-moment morning, as I’d only decided to go for a swim the night before; the actual decisions made on the day were mostly free-form and made from a just ‘do it’ perspective. Lesson: You don’t have to overanalyse every decision you make – just make it and move on. 🙂

Marvin Hanks is an extremely low level employee at Mystic Investigations. So low in fact we have no idea what he does but we pay him $107 a week to do it. However he may have started out as a file clerk. Also I must say he is quite handy eradicating the rats, mice, cockroaches, and spiders that lurk about the sublevels of our vast facility. The last place he worked at mysteriously burned to the ground which is how he found his way to our doorstep. Marvin is unaware of the paranormal world, and has shown little acknowledgement of blatant enchanted events at our offices. Most likely a coping mechanism to avoid the horror of our supernatural reality! Although Marvin filed a complaint with HR when a vampire bit him, and spat out his vile blood in disgust. A vampire who was then weakened, and easily staked! Marvin simply called the vampire “a crazed loon who bit him on the neck!”
Marvin works in the sub-basement with large humming electrical fuse boxes behind him. His Office Space is populated with ancient Mad Men style office staples. Next to his desk is a utility sink where he profusely washes his hands every 15 minutes due to various OCD issues. He’s been reprimanded for stealing the hand soap from the rest rooms upstairs when he uses his up! Another aspect of his OCD is his obsession with his red Swingline stapler. He’s extremely paranoid about it, and constantly accuses people of stealing it. In fact he carries it around everywhere, and then absent mindedly leaves it somewhere! The last place it was found was sitting on the toilet tank in the women’s restroom. Marvin had no explanation how it got there. Yeah right Marvin! He also complains about never getting treats when we pass them out. Particularly cake when celebrating someone’s birthday. Even if it’s his own! It’s not intentional, and merely bad luck that everything is eaten up by the time he gets to it!
Marvin is a slovenly middle aged overweight white guy with a comb over hair style. He also has a distinct BO odor combined with a lack of washing his clothes. Some have nauseatingly described subtle overtones of garlic, onions, and Limburger cheese wafting about in the overall eclectic mix of offending aromas. Oddly enough he loves his strong smelling plug-in artificial chemical deodorizers to maximize his risk for lung cancer even without the blatant idiocy of smoking. Unfortunately they usually smell like a cross between standard bathroom spray with fecal undertones, rotten eggs, wet dog, and hamster cage. Although the egg smell might be his passing of noxious gasses or his tendency to suck on a hard boiled egg every so often! With so many good smelling deodorizers, and healthy aromatherapy options it’s amazing he chooses such horrible stenches!
Hank’s is soft spoken with a tendency to mutter, and stutter. Since he’s going bald he keeps an industrial size bottle of Rogaine on his desk in plain view for some odd reason. In addition he keeps his diarrhea medication, and other prescription drugs for embarrassing health conditions on his desk as well. That includes his impotence treatment! If only he knew of the natural options that would truly remedy rather than simply suppress symptoms, and leave toxins in his body along with a plethora of negative side effects! Not surprising since he has a complete lack of embarrassment, common sense, and standard awareness of his reality. All traces of critical thinking are dead on arrival with this guy! The only reason we don’t fire him is because he’s quite amusing sometimes! We often joke that he’s reminiscent of Milton Waddams from the movie “Office Space“. Ironically it’s his favorite movie, and he often quotes from it. And no we don’t have any corporate stooges on staff like Bill Lumbergh. Although a number of people do stroll about with coffee cup in one hand, and TPS reports in the other. Some even take their coffee addiction to the toilet!
Amazingly enough a background check revealed this swinging bachelor has never been married! Our standard new employee hire surveillance confirms that he spends most of his time in his studio apartment above an antique shop playing beyond old 70’s video games. His favorite appears to be Pong which he plays for hours on end. He also spends a great deal of time adjusting his comb-over into various positions. He even attempted the Triple Trump Comb-Over, and got his hands tangled in his hair for 3 hours before finally ripping himself free! Marvin also has a ragged old looking clown doll he talks to, and sleeps with at night. Before living in the studio apartment he resided in a rusty brown van down by the river, and before that in his step-mother’s basement for 15 years!
Whenever Marvin ventures upstairs he causes some level of trouble. He’s notorious for making the coffee machine overflow all over the kitchen counters, and floors at least twice a week! This insane idiocy has been going on for several years, and we’ve urged him to get an adult…I mean another employee to make the coffee if none is left. There is a huge sign right next to the machine telling people how to properly prepare the coffee. It’s unknown why he ignores it or can’t understand it! Ultimately we urge him to just get some Starbucks or bring his own coffee in a thermos. He confessed to having an after hours spaz related to this in which he threw coffee grounds all over the walls, and splashed coffee everywhere! He’s also been known to launch aspirin all over the place when he can’t get the childproof lid off. He’s also been known to cast his Skittles all over the floor in a rage over the stresses of his job. We paid for his anger management, and he seems better now! Marvin also occasionally makes sick smelling goulash he buys online from some Gypsies in Hungary. So far he’s ruined three microwaves totally staining them, and leaving them imbued with a permanent stench somewhat reminiscent of death itself! When cooking up his various noxious concoctions he leaves a sky high pile of dishes in the kitchen sink along with towels strewn about for someone else to deal with! In addition he has a bad habit of ruining our wood furniture, and we’ve had to dock his pay to get replacements! Coasters, and mats Marvin! Coasters, and mats!
We’re pretty sure Marvin is the one who’s been leaving curled up pieces of nasty used wet toilet paper all over the rest room floors. The office has disgustingly dubbed them “The Poopie Twirls”. We surmise he’s standing up, and wetting TP to wipe his messy rear! LOL! We’re also rather sure he’s the one with the diarrhea splatters all over the seats, and even on the toilet tank! How for the love of God do you shoot excrement all up on the tank, and even the walls on occasion!?! We do provide our employees with high tech Japanese toilets that have bidets built in but it apparently scares Marvin. We’ve hinted that adult asswipes might be the best route, or better yet remedy the cause of his angst ridden bowel movements! Certainly taking a decent prebiotic, probiotic, and digestive enzymes would be a logical starting point. Also it wouldn’t hurt if he gave his beloved Diet soda’s a rest. Another cancer cause, and intestinal destroyer! I’ve personally urged him to check if he’s possibly lactose, or gluten intolerant because it’s not normal to have such messed up bowels each day! People shouldn’t have to walk through his fields of filthy TP that gradually spread throughout our office in the course of the business day! Especially the kook who leaves greasy bare foot prints on the bathroom floor! Seriously not the best place to tiptoe bare through the daisies, or should I say the Poopie Twirls!
Marvin’s future at Mystic Investigations looks rather bleak as his annoyance to employees is beginning to outweigh the joy we get from the comic relief he provides for us! He pulls himself out of the frying pan every so often by doing something so completely wacky that we profusely laugh until tears flow from our eyes! Just the other day he ran upstairs to the second floor executive suites in a panic screaming that he thought he accidentally pooped his pants, and he needed to run home to get a change of underwear. Once again a total lack of embarrassment, and proper social grace! He tripped, and fell near the steps tumbling down to the lobby. The giggles bellowed forth throughout our facility as he scrambled to his feet, and then proceeded to trip out the front door causing a small hair piece to fall on to the sidewalk! A squirrel promptly swooped in, and ran away with it! Marvin chased the little critter around the lawn area, and even climbed up a tree after it. He gave up after 15 minutes as we all stood at the window dying of laughter! He finally got into his early 1970’s rusty yellow Gremlin with one door painted brown, and sped down the road to New Underwear City! Never seen someone with a comb over, and a wig before but there’s always a first time for everything! Seriously you can’t make this stuff up folks!

by mywinepal • September 15, 2013 • Comments Off on Quick Wine Reviews – De Martino Chilean Wines in BC
This past week I had a chance to try 3 wines currently in the BC market from the De Martino winery, and one wine which is yet to be released. The De Martino winery hails from Chile, originally located in the Maipo Valley, but has vineyards across Chile.
In 1998 they embarked on a project to convert their vineyards to be 100% organic and are now the second largest producer of organic wines in Chile. In addition, in 2007, they were audited by The Carbon Reduction Institute in order to measure all of their carbon emissions and undertook steps to reduce their carbon footprint. In 2009 they achieved two milestones: they launched the first carbon-neutral wine in Latin America Nuevo Mundo and Viña De Martino became the first carbon-neutral winery in Latin America. Congratulations!
De Martino Legado Limari Valley Reserva Chardonnay ($16.99). – The Limari Valley was specifically picked for Chardonnay as the valley has limestone soil which is preferred by Chardonnay. Limestone soil is also found in Burgundy, which is the home of the Chardonnay grape. This wine has light tropical fruit with a hint of smokiness or flint on the nose. Medium body, round with a nice acidic prickle on the tongue. Stone fruit, in particular pear, along with tropical fruit flavours. Mouth watering finish. An elegant wine. My favourite of all 4 wines tasted.
De Martino Legado Choapa Valley Syrah 2012 (sample – not yet in market). – This syrah is newly bottled so it was not yet expressive on the nose. It does have medium body, dry, with light cinnamon and tasty blueberry and cherry flavours. Medium fine tannins with sour cherries and light oak on the finish. I look forward to trying this wine again once it has settled in the bottle.
Drink Good Wine. That is my motto and I really want to help you drink good wine. What is good wine? That can be a different thing for each people. Food also loves wine so I also cover food and wine pairings and restaurant reviews. MyWinePal was started by Karl Kliparchuk, WSET. I spent many years with the South World Wine Society as the President and then cellar master. I love to travel around the world, visiting wine regions and sharing my passion for food & wine with you.

What is mesotherapy? In short, it is an effective revitalization of our skin, a method and a way to really provide it with essential nutrients in the form of hyaluronic acid and many other vitamins.
Of course, mesotherapy itself has been known for a long time, but like many other procedures performed in aesthetic medicine clinics, it can be said that it is only just gaining interest in our country. This means that aesthetic surgery is beginning to gain adequate meaning and present its specific potential, which we are trying to use more and more often in our own way. This needle mesotherapy is a fully effective procedure with many arguments. Wondering how much does needle mesotherapy cost? Always take into account the cost of 300-600 USD, of course needle mesotherapy has to be repeated many times, which does not change the opinion about the sense of its implementation.
Needle mesotherapy will make our skin around the face, head and neck much nicer and more attractive, sometimes smoothing and affecting the skin’s elasticity in the full sense of the word. There is no doubt that needle mesotherapy is one of the most effective and recognizable treatments in aesthetic medicine surgeries operating in Łódź. There is no doubt that the number of people who decide to undergo such a procedure is growing year by year, although they are sceptical about it at first, but with time they realize that needle mesotherapy is a solution which speaks for many arguments and adequate advantages. First of all, what makes the mesotherapy procedure sense is its painless and minimally invasive course, what is the most important effect that we can achieve de facto.
Thanks to the decision to undergo a mesotherapy of the neck, head or face, which is a very important part of our body in terms of skin aesthetics, we can only gain and, what is most important, change its appearance in the positive sense. Revitalization, regeneration and nourishment of the skin is what needle mesotherapy usually offers in the world. Needle mesotherapy in Łódź is carried out by many aesthetic medicine surgeries. Therefore, it is a good idea to go to them and find out directly on the spot about the needle mesotherapy itself, about the same understanding and about the reason why the needle mesotherapy procedure is justified. It can be said that needle mesotherapy of face, neck or head is an alternative for all those women who want to significantly improve the aesthetics and appearance of damaged, old and unattractive skin. We also take care to nourish it in the most effective, efficient and appropriate way, so that it has all the necessary nutritional qualities to make our skin more beautiful and healthy.
More about mesotherapy can be found on the website of the Aesthetic Medicine Clinic in Lodz at -skory/

Vinyl replacement windows are more than a pane of glass separating you from the outdoors. Our replacement windows are beautiful, have low maintenance, and are backed by lengthy warranties. All of these features come in shapes, styles, and sizes to match the personality of your home.
As a homeowner, you are familiar with the hassle of aluminum windows. Often they need repainting or refurnishing and the wood may crack or rot. Additionally, because they are not airtight, the aluminum may corrode or allow excess condensation, making them very hard to clean. Older ones also don't have insulated glass—if you stand by these windows in winter, you feel a cold draft. That means you are losing thermal efficiency and paying higher power bills in the winter and summer.
Fortunately, vinyl replacement windows are an excellent alternative. They are far more thermally efficient than conventional wood or aluminum-framed windows. They are easier to clean and never need painting. The sashes tilt in so you can easily reach the entire glass area from inside your home.

You know you are a success when you can spend time with your family away from the noise and rush that binding you! What is the point of all that hard work if you and your family cannot benefit from it? Everyone needs a break 锟?you from your work Browns Kids Jersey , the kids from school and your better half from whatever it is that keeps them away from spending time with those they love.
Having a break on a luxury vacation with your family is certainly one of the best answers to the problem. If you have already chosen a destination then all that锟絪 left to do is to make a choice among luxury family hotels for your family stay.
One reason that it is so important you make the right decision is that it is the hotel in which you stay that can make or break a great vacation.
When you are searching for a luxury hotel there are a lot of points you have to keep in mind especially if you are making your selection among luxury family hotels. One real problem is that each of you on this holiday will have different ideas on what you want in the way of luxurious family accommodation.
If you are looking for good advice on how make a selection you can get help from other travelers or search the internet using comprehensive accommodation sites such as http:
LONDON， Feb. 6 (Xinhua) -- A 19-year old man told a British court on Monday that he had killed a U.S. tourist and injured five others during a knife attack last year in London.
The man， whose name was given as Zakaria Bulhan from south-west London， carried out the attack in London's Russell Square on Aug. 3 last year.
Local media said Bulhan pleaded guilty at the London-based Central Criminal Court of England and Wales to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and wounding.
Diminished responsibility refers to an unbalanced mental state which is considered to make a person less answerable for murder， being recognized as grounds to reduce the charge to that of manslaughter.
He reportedly told the court that he was suffering an acute episode of paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attacks.
The victim was Darlene Horton， 64， a retired teacher who was visiting London with her husband. She was a mother of two.
The attack came amid surging hate crime after Brexit vote last June， attracting wide media attention.
BERLIN， July 26 (Xinhua) -- A gunman killed himself after shooting a doctor at a clinic in Berlin on Tuesday， local police said.
The attack happened at around 13:00 local time (1200GMT). The doctor was seriously wounded， and under intensive care， a police spokesman told Xinhua， adding that the gunman was a patient of the clinic in southwestern Berlin.
"We have no evidence of other injured people and more perpetrators，" the police said on its official Twitter account.
Security forces have arrived at the clinic and controlled the situation. There is no danger at the clinic， said the police， asking the public not to speculate and spread rumors.
Once you arrive in Germany, if you are American Browns Youth Jersey , you will notice that the German public transportation system is much more efficient and cost effective than that of America. There are many more options and for the most part, you can get anywhere any time. Keep in mind that you can purchase a train ticket from your current location to your destination and this ticket is valid for the train Browns Womens Jersey , bus and street car. ie. Take a train from Darmstadt to Hanau then use the same ticket for a bus from Hanau to Frankfurt.
Taxi Cab: Taxi cabs can be found around any airport or public location. If you walk up to a taxi parking area and there is a row of taxi cabs go to the front vehicle first. The price varies but can be expensive at times. The weekend taxi fees are generally more expensive than the fees on a weekday. If you can avoid using a taxi cab I would recommend it. If you are relatively pleased with the service provided by the cab driver a one or two EUR tip would be sufficient.
Street Cars (Trolley): Street cars were the first mode of public transportation in Germany. Street cars make frequent stops and have a map layout of each stop. Check the route and be sure the stop you want is close enough to your destination, if not you may want to take the US Bahn Black Browns Jersey , a bus or a taxi. Street cars are relatively fast, about the same speed as a normal car in the city.
Train: The European rail system is set up to be a very cost effective and efficient means for international European travel. With a vast number of inner-city trains running constantly during the day Browns Jersey Sale , the German train system is just as effective. When entering a train station (Bahnhof) you will need to purchase a ticket from the machine. You can only buy a train ticket with EUR but you can use any denomination below 20 including coins or bills. Simply select your destination from the list shown, enter the destination number and push the Cheap Browns Jersey , Einzelfahrt, button. Your change will fall along with your ticket to the tray. If you are planning to travel by train from Frankfurt to Paris Browns Shon Coleman Jersey , for example, you may choose to use the ICE train. This train is designed to get you from point A to point B much faster than a normal train. ICE trains are a little more expensive but may be the smart way to travel if you are planning inter-country travel in Europe.
US-Bahn: The U or S Bahn would be the equivalent to the subway in the States. The U-Bahn covers city areas where as the S-Bahn covers city areas and up to 60 kilometers outside the city. Normally you will only find US Bahns in bigger cities. The US Bahn normally makes more stops than trolleys making them the smarter choice for inner city travel.
Pain medications commonly used in labor present medical and mental challenges for pregnant women recovering from opioid addiction. - @NPR
Nov 10, 2018 Pain medications commonly used in labor present medical and mental challenges for pregnant women recovering from opioid addiction.
"Anti-Machine" (or Xputer) stands for the counterpart of the von Neumann paradigm. The anti-machine uses data counters instead of a programm counter. It is datastream-based and does not run any instruction streams.
These Reconfigurable Computing pages are about a route to Reinvent Compting. This term is not new. See the keynote by Burton Smith (former Cray CTO).
Why Reinvent Compting? Pse, study Thomas Sterling's interview entitled: 'I Think We Will Never Reach Zettaflops'. See HPCwire. Thomas Sterling takes us through some of the most critical developments in high performance computing, explaining why the transition to exascale is going to be very different than the ones in the past. I agree. However, I believe, we will reach Zetaflops --- by Reconfigurable Computing.
Panel discussions and keynote addresses are booming since the computing crisis caused by the von Neumann syndrome. Because of the coincidence of several disruptive developments we need to Reinvent Computing [1]. We cannot afford any more the CPU-centric, i. e. instruction-stream-centric Software-centric Aristotelian world model of computing. We are forced to go toward heterogeneous computing systems based on a Kopernican World model of Computing (Figure A) [2]. We urgently need the Generalization of Software Eingineering (SE) into Program Engineering (PE) which interlaces two machine paradigms:
the instruction-stream-based traditional von Neumann paradigm, controlled by a program counter. Its programming source is called "Software", which is a subject of SE (software engineering). see fig. A. We need to reinvent software engineering [4].
the data-stream-based anti-machine-paradigm [3] controlled by data counters instead of a program counter [3] Its programming source is called "Flowware" (FE, see fig. A), which programs data streams to run through reconfigurable hardware like FPGAs, which can be viewed as pipe networks, the generalization of systolic arrays. Sinks and sources of data streams are auto-sequencing memory blocks (asM).
By migration of applications from software to configware/flowware speed-up factors and power saving factors by up to several orders of magnitude can be obtained [8]. We also need a third area: Configware Engineering (CE). See [5] - [7] and fig. A
Configware is the programming code for reconfigurable platforms like FPGAs. Flowware can be programmed only, when reconfiguration from configware is finished, so that the datapaths inside have been set up.
We have to set up Program Engineering (PE) education to replace Software Engineering (SE) Education because programming heterogeneous systems requires a mix of skills from all three side of the PE world (Fig. A), i. e. even also from Configware Engineering (CE). By migration of an application from SE to FE / CE, for instance, a different algorithm may be needed. So, for instance, the sequential Bubble Sort algorithms has to be converted into the Shuffle Sort algorithm to avoid accessing conflicts caused by parallelism [9].
FPGA | "Reconfigurable Computing" | FPGA & "oil and gas" | FPGA & "automotive" | FPGA & "medical" | FPGA & "chemical" | FPGA & "bio" | FPGA & "defense" | FPGA & "physics" | FPGA & "molecular" | FPGA & "supercomputing" | FPGA & "HPC" | FPGA & "high performance computing" | FPGA | "Reconfigurable Computing" | FPGA & "oil" | FPGA & "gas" | FPGA & "automotive" | FPGA & "medical" | FPGA & "chemical" | FPGA & "bio" | FPGA & "defense" | FPGA & "physics" | FPGA & "molecular" | FPGA & "supercomputing" | FPGA & "HPC" | FPGA & "high performance computing" |
The von Neumann machine paradigm does not support configware. Configware is supported by the data-stream-basedKress-Kung machine paradigm (anti machine paradigm). Such data stream machines are programmed from 2 different sources: by flowware, which programs the data streams flowing from and to the machine's DPU (data path unit) or DPA (DPU array), and, by configware.The von Neumann paradigm describes the CPU such, that it encapsulates the DPU (DataPath Unit, or ALU) together with the program counter (figure 1). The behaviour of the program counter is programmed by Software (figure 2).
The compact instruction code of a CPU is tightly coupled with the structure of the DPU. This is the reason why the instruction-stream-based von Neumann paradigm does not support morphware. Whenever you tra to reconfigure the DPU, the architecture of the CPU gets destroyed. We need a second machine paradigm: the Kress-Kung Machine (Anti Machine).
About the terminology: the Kress-Kung machine is a generalization (Kress) of the systolic array (first popularized by H. T. Kung). The von Neumann paradigm is instruction-stream-based, whereas the anti machine paradigm (Kress-Kung paradigm) is data-stream-based. The systolic array (Kung machine) could be used only for applications with strictly regular data-dependencies yielding pipe networks with only uniform linear pipes. The Kress-Kung array is the generalization [Rainer Kress] of the Kung array by a new synthesis methodology, replacing algebraic mapping methods by general optimization, such as for instance, by simulated annealing [Rainer Kress], so also any wild forms of non-regular pipe networks are supported, so that reconfigurability makes sense.
Fig. 3. Data counter behavior programmed by flowware Fig. 4. Anti-Machine: data counter(s) located within as M(s)
The Kress-Kung machine (anti machine) is data-stream-based, but not instruction-stream-based. The Kress-Kung machine (anti machine) has no CPU. If it is hardwired, it has a DPU instead, or even a DPA (DPU array). If it is reconfigurable, it has a rDPU or rDPA instead (fig. 4). Instead of a program counter the Kress-Kung machine (anti machine) has one or several data counters, which are located with the memory bank (fig. 4), but not with the (r)DPU nor (r)DPA. The run time bevavour of the data counter(s) is programmed by Flowware (fig. 3).
Figure 6. Heterogeneous systems need all three: a) (von Neumann) CPUs are programmed by Software; b) reconfigurable anti machines are programmedby two sources: resource set-up before run time by configware code, run time behavior (data streams) by flowware.
Apropos Kung: in the early days of the Kung array, three different scientist carrying the name "Kung" have been involved: (1.) H. T. Kung (at that time at Carnegie-Mellon, now at Harvard, USA) who has been visible first in this scene by popularizing systolic arrays, (2.) S.Y. Kung (Princeton) who has written an early book on systolic arrays, and, (3.) also a student with the name Kung (sorry, I forgot his first names and affiliation), having been co-author of some early papers on systolic arrays.
Structural programming by Configware means Programming in Space. That's why Configware versus Software means Computing in Space and Time versus Computing in Time only.
Instruction-stream-based programming in time only (Software Engineering): one source needed: Softwar only (fig. 6 a). However, programming morphware (Configware Engineering) means programming in time and space, where two program sources are needed (fig. 6 b): configware for the space domain configures the resources before run time.#, and, flowware for the time domain: for scheduling the data streams flowing during run time.
Figure 8 (Kress-Kung machine version) illustrates, why time to space migration removes the memory cycles needed for the instruction-stream-based CPU-executed version shown in fig. 7. Fig. 9 lists a few spee-up factors having been published. A more recent speed-up factor is 28000 for cracking encrypted code. Fig. 10 summarizes some speed-up mechanisms obtaines ba time to space migration.

We were watching Kage for the weekend, and decided to separate Kage and Billy while they ate - mostly because they kept trying to eat the other dog's food. We put Kage outside, closed the screen door, and filled the dog dishes. We heard a weird noise, turned around, and saw Kage looking at us with his nose through the screen. It seems he didn't notice the screen and decided to run for dinner.
We all spent a moment regarding each other before he removed his nose from the screen and patiently stood and waited for his dinner, not with his nose in a door, instead.
Israel escalates demolitions in occupied Palestine - Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine
Chicago, Copenhagen actions in solidarity with East Jerusalem Palestinian residents facing evictions and demolition
Monday, July 13th 2009, 5am: In perhaps the largest campaign of its kind in Chicagoן¿½s history, over a dozen activists dropped 88 banners across Chicagoland this morning, decrying Israelן¿½s policies of evicting or destroying Palestinian homes. Each banner represents one of 88 Palestinian homes in the occupied East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan that have received demolition orders from Israeli authorities.
Todayן¿½s banners were dropped as part of an international day of action on July 13th in solidarity with Palestinian families facing house evictions or demolition in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. In addition to Chicago, demonstrations and actions are planned for San Francisco, New York City, London, Paris, Copenhagen, Glasgow, and Jerusalem.
Chicagoן¿½s action saw banners being hung from highway overpasses, bridges, and from the roofs of buildings. Some of the banners read, ן¿½End the occupation of Palestine,ן¿½ or ן¿½From Chicago to Palestine, communities are facing eviction,ן¿½ and call for onlookers to ן¿½Support. Resist. Fight.ן¿½
Under an illegal occupation, Israeli policies of evicting Palestinians or destroying their homes are often used as acts of collective punishment, contrary to international law.
As refugees and people living under occupation, we are asking people to help us with our struggle for our rights. It is unbelievable that in the 21st century, Israelן¿½s authorities can get away with demolishing the homes of Palestinians in order to build settlements or national parks. The price we and our neighbours have to pay is too high, we are faced with two impossible choices ן¿½ either we throw our kids out on the street or we go to prison. If we lose our homes, there is nowhere else for us to go, the only option we have is to live in tents
In Chicago, the activists also tied their message of solidarity with Palestinians facing eviction to solidarity with Chicago communities that are being displaced as part of the cityן¿½s plans for the 2016 Olympic bid.
Copenhagen demonstrates in solidarity with East Jerusalem residents facing evictions and demolitions
International day of solidarity with East Jerusalem residents facing eviction or demolition of their homes. Demonstration in front of the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen.
At 8.30 in the morning on Monday 13th of July Scandinavian activists showed their solidarity with the Palestinians in East Jerusalem facing eviction or demolition of their houses by putting up 6 tents in front of the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen.
The Danish police showed up after less than ten minutes, took the details of the activists, and ordered the manifestation to move to the opposite side of a busy street away from the Israeli embassy. The police moved the manifestation a second time further away from the Israeli embassy on demand from the employees of the embassy.
The 6 tents raised in front of the Israeli embassy in Copenhagen symbolize Palestinians in East Jerusalem threatened with eviction or demolition of their houses.

I know what you’re thinking. Surely we have enough great retail leaders on our home turf, right? Well, not according to the facts and figures. The people behind the large supermarkets and major retail stores in Australia seem to prefer the idea of been led by the British. In fact, more and more UK retail executives are being called upon for their services.
Now, I don’t know about you, but it bugs me a little bit. More than a little actually! That said, we wouldn’t have to look further afield for worthy talent if we had it on our own doorstep. Even Woolworths is believed to be getting in on the poaching action. So, why is this happening?
The reason is that some of the leading UK trained executives have the ability to take an average, or even good, retail store and turn it into a bloody great one. That isn’t to say that Australian leaders can’t do the same, but let’s take a look at why international retail talent is so desirable.
According to some of the big retail players, they experience less positive changes when hiring Aussies. However, management and leaders from abroad know how to make the right changes to stay competitive. It’s like a breath of fresh air for retailers that have struggled with strategic foresight and innovation. Many believe that foreign talent also have the edge because they have new unencumbered views.
So – what does that say about us? We’re afraid of change. I don’t understand why, though. Consistency and less change are not going to make you stay ahead of the game. In fact, it will do your organisation more harm than good. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve seen businesses stay in the shade while others are moving forward in the right direction.
The longer you avoid change, the more expensive change will become. That means you’ll spend more investing in things your competitors have already done. If you ask me, there’s no point in investing in change at all when you’re already too far behind everyone else. You should constantly be investing in change as your business grows.
Think back to 2008 when UK retail executive, Ian McLeod took up the reigns at Coles. His no-nonsense, low-cost strategy was a winner from the get-go. In 2015, David Jones headhunted John Dixon for the CEO role. John Dixon played a huge part in turning around the Marks & Spencer food business, which is an area David Jones were desperate to get into at the time. These are only two out of a countless number of UK leaders who have made their way to Australia.
Take a leaf out of some of the British-trained executive’s books and start delivering global standards and experience. If you don’t, an overseas leader might end up being your replacement.

In the world of rapidly changing retail/wholesale landscape, critical projects can make or break a retail business. After working 25+ years internationally in the retail industry, I understand the pain that a botched project can cause. It can disrupt and restrain a business that is otherwise sound, as well as mask further issues within the business.
I have made a career of fixing issues within retail/wholesale businesses and have practical methods to ensure that projects get resolved, one way or another, allowing you to get back to focusing on your core business. I typically work with retailers that have 20 to 300 stores and I possess the unique ability to cut through the turmoil of a project that has fallen off the rails and get it resolved quickly. I SIMPLIFY CHAOS. Whether it is a bungled software upgrade, a difficult transition to a new warehouse / office, a merchandise planning plan that has not achieved the desired result or an under-performing division that needs to be “dealt with”. After a proper assessment, I will sort it out by getting it back on track, starting over or putting it out of its misery.

Mikole is a great humanitarian, composer, and saxophonist. His sincerity continues to push the music in a positive direction.
Mikole Kaar is an accomplished sax player, flutist, vocalist and composer, bringing a very personal touch to his music. It’s a pleasure to be part of this project.
Jazz Jams are one of the staples of the Palm Springs music scene. I’ve attended Mikole E. Kaar’s jazz jams for years. His new one at The Block was packed last Wednesday night for his birthday party. Mikole plays sax, flute, piano and sings. He does primarily straight ahead jazz. He’s got Doug McDonald on guitar, Gilbert Hansen on bass and Dennis Burke on drums.
I’ve known Mikole Kaar for about 5 years. He always does a great job, but it wasn’t until I did this interview that I realized the amazing amount of musical experience he brings to the desert.
He played with the Coasters and Drifters. He was the contractor (who hires) for the Temptations. He played with Joe Cocker and did several soundtracks for movies including Twins where he played “Yakety Yak” with 2 Live Crew.
This enterprising man had his first song on the charts at age 13, a rock and roll band, The Mod Caps, with a tune called “She’s a Social Climber.” He opened for Billy Joel’s band, Hassles and The Young Rascals, in the South Hamptons as a teenager. How many musicians can boast that?
His love of jazz has taken him on the path he is on today. He has performed with straight-ahead jazz artists including Johnny Hammond Smith, Billy Larkins, Russ Freeman (Rippingtons) and David Benoit.
Mikole moved to the desert 11 years ago from Las Vegas, and about 5 years ago, started a weekly jazz jam at The Tavern in Palm Springs. He moved to A.J.s on the Green and has recently moved it to The Block in Cathedral City on Wednesdays from 7-10. Local musicians stop by and get the joint jumping and the party people come out in force!
The block is located in Cathedral City on the corner of Date Palm and Ramon. On Friday and Saturdays from 6-9 he’s at Nicolino’s (35325 Date Palm Drive) and also for brunch on Sundays from 10:30-2:00.
He is currently recording a new straight ahead jazz CD with 10 songs called Give em Heaven. He’s producing it himself at Dori Amarillo studio in LA. Mikole is a baby boomer who is living his dream and his message is “Don’t ever give up on your dream, age is not a factor.”
"Dar-liscious" is the compelling new fifth solo CD release from world-class Jazz musician Mikole E. Kaar! Mikole also plays tenor and soprano sax, flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, piano, and bassoon. Considered one of the most versatile woodwind artists in jazz, Mikole has played with some of the very best in the business.
Born in New York City, Mikole began studying clarinet at the age of nine. He was mentored by the great Clifford Scott, whom he knew growing up simply as "Scotty." Junior Walker and King Curtis were also some Mikole's R&B idols. Mikole continued to perfect his craft becoming both a clarinet & flute major in college.
In 1985, Mikole traveled to Europe to play jazz and in 1986, his original album, "Back to the Heart" was recorded and released in Germany on Heliocon Records. He later returned to the States and continued playing with jazz greats, among them Russell Freeman, Ti Lavitz, David Benoit, Johnny Hammond Smith, The Temptations, Bo Diddley, Joe Cocker, Rita Moreno, Otis Rush, Cash McCall, Bonnie Bramlett, The Drifters, the Coasters, The Platters, The Inkspots, and Al Wilson.
Mikole has also appeared on several movie and television soundtracks. He has played in Europe, Hong Kong, and several International Jazz Festivals around the globe. This brand new CD release is truly one for the collection from one very authentic, soulful, and accomplished performer.
Mikole plays tenor and soprano sax and flute. Considered one of the most versatile woodwind artists in jazz, Mikole has played with some of the very best in the business. If you are interested in booking a concert, festival, or private event, please fill out the form below.
This is simply a request and does not constitute a confirmed appearance, contract, or a promise to appear. Mikole's team will contact you.
The project is directed towards elaboration of advanced technological processes of nanostructurization of metals and semimetals, detection and investigation of new physical phenomena, which appear due to the re-configuration at nanometric-scale properties of that materials: nonuniform superconductivity in form of inverse proximity effect and triplet superconductivity in multilayered nanostructures superconductor/ ferromagnet/antiferromagnet (S/F/AF), surface states quantification in thin Bi wires and non-uniform superconductivity at the interfaces in the bi- and tri- crystals of bismuth. Implementation of the magnetron sputtering technology, as the method of fabrication of hybrid S/F/AF nanostructures will garantee the high quality of the contact interfaces, that should give the possibility to appear of the inverse proximity effect and phenomena of triplet superconductivity. Investigation of the non-uniform superconducting states using the method of reflectometry of spin-polarized electrons will detect the thin-structure elements, evidencing the appearance of the the triplet superconductivity and the inverse proximity effect at the interfaces of S/F nanostructures. It will be developed fundamental principles of functionality of the novel devices for spintronics, will be analysed the possibility of implementation of the obtained results and fabricated nanostrictures in superconducting spintronics for design of memory elements, logic elements and switches of the „triplet spin-valve” type.

Manvel Sector Grigoryan (July 14, 1956, Arshaluys, Armavir Marz, Armenia), Armenian military, politician. General Lieutenant (2000). 2000-2008 — Deputy Minister of Defense of the Republic of Armenia. Chairman of Yerkrapah Volunteer Union (1999-2018). «Hero of Artsakh» (2000).

"Moreover, you scorned our people, and compared the Albanese to sheep, and according to your custom think of us with insults. Nor have you shown yourself to have any knowledge of my race. Our elders were Epirotes, where this Pirro came from, whose force could scarcely support the Romans. This Pirro, who Taranto and many other places of Italy held back with armies. I do not have to speak for the Epiroti. They are very much stronger men than your Tarantini, a species of wet men who are born only to fish. If you want to say that Albania is part of Macedonia I would concede that a lot more of our ancestors were nobles who went as far as India under Alexander the Great and defeated all those peoples with incredible difficulty. From those men come these who you called sheep. But the nature of things is not changed. Why do your men run away in the faces of sheep?"
Memory is an important part of the human experience. Without our memories of the past and our memories of events and dates, it would be hard to do anything that we would like to achieve. This is one of the main reasons that people have such a hard time when they are losing their memory later on in life. It is such a shame to see a good mind go to waste. Even though there are plenty of alternatives that can help you through prescription drugs, this isn’t always the first choice that we would like to gravitate towards.
Within this article, we are going to help you to enhance your memory (or that of your grandmother) without spending a lot of time or money in the process. You’ll find out just how easy it is to get this process done.
One of the biggest things to remember when you are considering brain enhancement is how the brain chemical acetylcholine interacts with brain. For example, there are supplements called CDP choline and alpha GPC choline that help to provide the raw choline that helps with this brain chemical. More choline and you’ll have more memories and prevent the existing ones from leaving.
This is perhaps the most important first step for someone who is trying to enhance memory formation. A good drug to start with is the Optimal Choline Complex as it has both of the choline sources we mentioned above.
There are other ways for you to get choline as well. If you are really willing to eat eggs or cook them for your grandmother, there is a good chance she’ll benefit from the memory enhancement that comes through this food. Most people don’t realize the benefits that can come with eggs that are just as effective as some of the other supplements you can take!
This technique is a chakra-based shield that is used to defend against attacks. This form of defence is usually installed into puppets, where the user opens their segmented arms and radiates chakra through to form a light blue, thin shield. While it is powerful enough to block iron sand constructs, the sand will still seep into the joints of the puppets, which will restrict their movements, and thereby, stop the technique from functioning.
Chiyo installed this shield into her own arm and into the puppets designed like Sasori's parents. Kankurō later installed one into Sasori's puppet body.[4]

I'm the owner and Queen Bee of NashvilleGab. I'm not afraid to say the things you're probably thinking.
Martin’s Bar-B-Que Joint, one of Music City’s most notable barbecue restaurants, opened its fifth location in the SoBro neighborhood on Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 11am. Martin’s SoBro is located in the previous space occupied by The Rutledge at 410 4th Avenue South. Nashville Guru got a look inside the new restaurant.
The massive space features multiple bars, rooms, and an incredible beer garden unlike any other in Nashville. The main restaurant area has several different sections with plenty of room for locals and tourists to enjoy the grub without feeling cramped.
The partially-covered beer garden, accessible via an unnoticeable back stairwell, feels like a greenhouse. There are vibrant plants throughout and fans to keep the air moving. Seating ranges from picnic tables to a lounge-like area with old car seats and bus benches. Guests can get in a game of ping pong, darts or shuffleboard, too.
Barbecue enthusiasts consider Martin’s Bar-B-Que one of the best in the city. Owner Pat Martin takes his food and whole-hog style approach seriously, with an emphasis on cooking and preparing everything fresh on a daily basis, with the exception of the barbecue, which smokes a day ahead in the Pit Room. The menu features BBQ sandwiches, burgers, wings, salads, sides and more. See the menu.

A Civil traffic infraction is a non-criminal violation, not punishable by jail and which usually can be disposed of by payment of a civil penalty or election to attend a basic driver improvement course. A court appearance is not required, except in cases where the violation involves an accident with serious bodily injury or a fatality, violations of leaving a child in a vehicle unattended, going more than 30 miles per hour over the speed limit, some littering (call the traffic department), and passing a school bus on the exit side.
Payment can be made by mail or in person at the Clerk's Office in the county in which the infraction occurred. Money orders and cashier’s checks are accepted through the mail. Personal checks are not accepted through he mail and will be sent back to the defendant.

WASHINGTON, DC (March 27, 2014)—Today, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the newest autism prevalence statistics. For children born in 2002, the prevalence of autism was 1 in 68; 1 in 42 boys. Almost 60,000 US 12 year-olds likely have autism. Thirty years ago, autism affected 1 in 2,500 children; there has been a 37-fold increase.
Katie Weisman of SafeMinds stated, “Broader criteria and awareness cannot account for this magnitude of increase. The federal government continues to spend millions of dollars ineffectively and ‘potentially duplicatively’ according to a recent GAO report. We need to identify environmental triggers for autism, prevent them, and develop effective treatments.”
Holly Bortfeld of TACA stated, “The federal government has spent $1.6 billion on autism since 2006, but the money is not helping those affected in meaningful ways. We need to improve medical treatment for the many co-occuring health concerns of individuals with autism and address the wave of students who are aging out and entering an adult world with no plan for them. ”
The Autism Policy Reform Coalition (APRC) is advocating for changes in the U.S. Government’s response to the autism crisis and represents a constituency of over 100,000. The APRC is calling for significant changes in the Combating Autism Act, which is to be reauthorized by Congress this year.
“Since 2011, 44 U.S. children with autism have died after wandering away from a safe environment,” stated National Autism Association President Wendy Fournier. “Our federal government must recognize these deaths, and the urgent needs of our most profoundly affected population. They suffer silently in pain from untreated medical issues; they are abused, bullied, and may be at increased risk of suicide. Their deaths and injuries are preventable through an appropriate federal response, which our coalition is dedicated to securing.”
The AUTISM POLICY REFORM COALITION includes: Autism is Medical, Defending Academic Integrity and Research Foundation, Generation Rescue, National Autism Association, SafeMinds, Talk About Curing Autism, and The Thinking Mom’s Revolution. Its mission is to educate public officials and to encourage legislation that will make a measurable difference in the lives of the persons with autism and their families.
The program was accredited by the Hungarian Higher Education Accreditation Board in March, 2007, (as Kisebbségpolitika Mesterszak" in Hungarian) The Nationalism Studies Program (Kisebbségpolitika mesterszak) responds to the rapid growth of demand for knowledge and teaching in the field that has been obvious for the past decade. Besides considerable gains in empirical knowledge however, the resurgence of interest in nationalism and minority protection has also led to an alarming process, observed in East-Central Europe, the FSU region and beyond, as a result of which the field is being swamped by quick converts to the study of nationalism and minority protection producing works and educational materials that are theoretically and conceptually poor, narrowly focused and frequently reflect parochial, or even nationalist views. A non-sectarian and internationally comparative program in nationalism and minority protection is in a strategic position to counteract this disturbing tendency. The program will therefore fill a vital role in Hungarian higher education. It aims to shape the next generation of scholars, public officials and activists, endow them with rich empirical knowledge, and sensitize them to a non-sectarian, open and critical perspective on nationhood, nationalism and minority protection. Given the specificities of the region, it also places heavy emphasis on the study of Roma issues within the wider framework of minority studies.
Students enrolled in the Nationalism Studies Program receive the opportunity to engage in a complex approach to the study of nationalism and minority protection, subsumed under the general heading of political science with involvement of history, sociology, legal studies and anthropology as subfields.
The aim of the Program is to train future scholars, educators and professional experts. A comparative, theoretically grounded and empirically well-informed curriculum will sensitize students to the bewildering complexities of issues of nationalism, ethnic relations and minority protection both in global and local contexts. More concretely, students will get a full year's immersion in questions of citizenship, migration, statelessness, multiculturalism, racism, xenophobia, the refugee problem within and outside the European Union. Special attention will be devoted to those mechanisms and institutions within the European Union that are devoted to handle national and ethnic diversity such as processes of regionalisation and power sharing, the mechanisms of the OSCE and the developments related to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Special attention is devoted to the study of Roma society. Beyond the relevant scholarship, graduates of the program will exit with a firm knowledge in the political, legal and institutional frameworks available for dealing with issues of ethnic relations and minority protection.
Specialists trained in the program will be prepared for employment in supranational organizations, such as the offices and institutions of the European Union, OSCE, in international and domestic foundations for the protection of minorities, for employment in domestic public administration, local governments and in NGOs as well as for employment in the private sector, especially within the media and public survey institutions.

The problem with the "Anglo Saxon" gold is the recurring Pict motifs, along with the Coptic Interlace.
Along with no earlier artifacts in the raiders tribal lands either on the Continent or in the northern peninsulas.

If you are interested in that sort of thing I have been told there is a gold reef in Fiordland which gets covered at high tide. The person who told me came from the South Island and his grandfather had rescued the explorer who found it, sadly he died before revealing much more.
I was referring to hoards of the sea raiders found at their homes on continental Europe, not the Scottish hoards.

simon wrote: Why on earth would you think only Christians traded with Gaul. Have you not heard of Sutton Hoo?
The garnets come from around the baltic. This has been answered. The silver bowls from Sutton Hoo come rom Syria. They may be St Augustine's originals. They have been analysed scientifically there is no reasonable doubt.
The hoardes issue still applies. They not be plunder and I haven't heard of any such finds definitively stated to come from Britain. It would be near impossible to prove.
Not sure what is meant by workshops? Precious metals were worked under the eye of the emperor at the imperial court. Same applies to local rulers.
To give yo an idea of the importance of the Life of Columba, this passage appears to be a reference to Vortigern, with a location given, and a rough and very confused description of Mithraic rites. It wold be nice to have the Andersons' text and translation at hand,
THE following is told as having occurred in the house of a rich peasant named Foirtgirn, who lived in Mount Cainle (not identified). When the saint was staying there, he decided justly a dispute between two rustics, whose coming to him he knew beforehand: and one of them, who was a sorcerer, took milk, by his diabolical art, at the command of the saint, from a bull that was near. This the saint directed to be done, not to confirm these sorceries--God forbid! but to put an end to them in the presence of all the people. The blessed man, therefore, demanded that the vessel, full, as it seemed to be, of this milk, should be immediately given to him; and he blessed it with this sentence, saying: "Now it shall in this way be proved that this is not true milk, as it is supposed to be, but blood, which is coloured by the artifice of demons to impose on men." This was no sooner said than the milky colour gave place to the true natural colour of blood. The bull also, which in the space of one hour wasted and pined away with a hideous leanness, and was all but dead, was sprinkled with water that had been blessed by the saint, and recovered with astonishing rapidity.
I am sorry this is entirely irrelvant. Patrick is a contemporary. As is Gildas. Have you even read these sources? And I do not underestand the last bit. Bazas still exists.
There is n o question where the garnets come from. And frankly coming from someone who quotes a saints life as a source this is rather rich.
Sorry the origins of the gold and precious material has been established. End of. What atoms are supposed to prove is neither her nor there. Presumably you mean crystallography etc. To repeat, this has been done. Many so called Viking items in Sweden etc have been traced to their areas of origin.
Sorry I cannot understand the English here. What do you mean, what local church centres? Sutton Hoo was not a church. Presumably they camer from the Vatican since that is where Augustine came from. This is referred to in Bede.
And no one has located Julius Caesar's head, do you doubt he had one? I think you do not quite understand how ancient products were manufactured. There were not big modern factories,
Am I to assume you beleive this? I am sorry but one cannot discuss these issues with someone who haas not read the sources. The above is simply a demonstratin of why Saint's lives are generally not credible.
I do not "believe" The life of Columba. What I am interested in are the original sources used to construct it.
it took so swift a hold that homesteads and threshing floors with the grain still spread out on them

The most important thing to note is that Orleans (Civitas Aurelianorum) is not in the Bordeaux region –

Finally, both stories share the same precise detail that the impact occurred at threshing time: August 10 or so, anyone?

Sorry I have read Gregory of Tours and studied his work. None of this is remotrely relevant. What is the point here? Just to show you have read Gregaory of Tours?
The only relevant thing here is that Gregory states that Æthelberh was " a man of Kent". What do yuou think this means
May I suggest that instead of posting huge irrlevant quotes and trying to suggest Roman Gaul was destroyed by meteors you read these sources.
I comment on your entries but you ignore mine - I await your views on decurions in sub roman Britain
Then I suggest a course in reading, It is quite established info now. The Staffordshire hoard was identified in a year.
I simply do not understand this strange remark. You beleive they got their gold from outer space? Even though it has been proved scientifically where it comes from.
Again I do not understand this. Spanish labs? Why bother trying to locate something that has been located?
You seem not to be able to accept facts. Why should a Spanish lab be better than one in Ohio or Manchester?
Since roughly 1997, I have been retrieving accounts of geologically "recent" asteroid and comet impacts

In 1997, I became aware of the work of Clube and Napier and others on recent asteoid and comet impacts.
I consider further work at Bazas the responsibility of the French archaeological authorities and the CNRS.

If you’re on a fixed rate tariff with your current supplier, check to see if there’s an exit fee for leaving the contract early. If there is, you’ll need to factor this cost into your price comparison as it could swallow up some of the potential savings. If you can supply your tariff name when you get a quote, we can take your tariff into account when showing you the savings you could make.

Twenty-nine states have deregulated electricity, natural gas or both. That allows you to shop for the supply portion of your bill from alternative providers who may offer rates lower than the default supplier – usually a utility. Delivery services and billing will remain the responsibility of the local utility as they own the power lines and wires that keep the lights on.
Founded in 2008, Public Power is one of the largest licensed electricity and gas suppliers in the U.S. Public Power is headquartered in Connecticut, and is also licensed to offer similar services in Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington, D.C. Focused on being the best and the most conscientious customer service company in the industry, Public Power provides services to hundreds of thousands residential and commercial customers. With the deregulation of electricity and gas in many states, Public Power gives people a choice for their energy provider.
Every single energy supplier in the UK is regulated by Ofgem, the industry regulator. This means that the smaller, lesser-known companies have to follow exactly the same rules as the bigger, more established ones. If a company goes bust, you’ll be covered by Ofgem – they’ll ensure your supply isn’t cut off, and they’ll appoint a new supplier to take over your tariff.

The complaints filed against providers aren't a perfect mirror of the J.D. Power customer satisfactions scores. Just Energy, which earned only two J.D. Power Circles and earned the second-lowest score, had only 21 complaints recorded with the Public Utility Commission. But it's helpful to view these complaints in aggregate: Over 50 percent of the 1,119 total complaints fall under "billing" — another reason to seek out a provider with high customer satisfaction in that area in particular.
Last year the duo said that sales would break the 500,000 milestone but significantly underestimated the market’s growth, so “at the start of 2017, Angus and I are going to throw prudence to the winds, run our hands through our grey sea-captain hair, and bet it breaks the million mark”, helped by higher oil prices, a flood of new, improved models on the market, ongoing falls in battery prices and improved charging infrastructure. The aforementioned need to improve air quality and the continued fallout from the Dieselgate scandal will play a part, too.
As a residential or commercial customer, you’ll enjoy competitive rates, flexible contracts, and personalized plans that give you the power to choose what’s best for you. And we offer no-deposit electricity for well-qualified customers and deposit payment plans for those with less than desirable credit so that switching retail electric providers won’t break the bank.‡ When you switch to Amigo Energy today, you’ll switch on the power of convenience and affordability.
To try to prevent these customers from being further ripped off, the government is planning to implement an energy price cap, which will require Ofgem to set a maximum amount that suppliers can charge on their standard tariffs until 2020. This should be in place by the end of 2018. This is in addition to the current price cap for vulnerable and prepayment customers.
The freedom to choose your energy rates in Maryland is not only available in homes but also to commercial customers. In fact, more than 90% of large businesses in the state have enrolled with alternative suppliers. This competition between energy suppliers to provide lower prices for businesses could be why commercial electric prices in Maryland are lower than the national average this year. If the same competition between suppliers existed for residential customers, prices might also decrease. However, without participation in energy choice, suppliers are not forced to compete for your business. Want to see the available rates? Enter your ZIP code above.
Agera Energy is a leading supplier of electricity and natural gas; serving residential, small business and large commercial /industrial customers across the United States with one of the finest trained sales staff and first-class customer service representatives in the industry. Founded in 2014 the company operates in 16 markets and offers customized electricity and natural gas plans, fixed and variable contract terms, and renewable energy options.
In summary, fixed-rate plans provide a level of certainty and stability in your energy charge since the price will not fluctuate over the life of your contract. If prices suddenly spike, you are protected because your rate is locked in. The flip side is that if rates drop over the life of your contract, you’ll be stuck paying the higher rate. You can incur steep cancellation fees if you change electricity plans or providers before the end of your contract term.
Your most effective weapon, however, is a site like ComparePower (Power to Choose) to locate and compare details from various Houston electricity resellers. In one fell swoop, you will efficiently and quickly locate and classify cheap electricity resellers all on one page, instead of wasting your valuable time searching out available companies and visiting their websites one by one (who even does that any more?).

Maryland is among 15 states where electricity customers may choose their providers. It's called deregulation, but it might be less confusing to call it energy choice. Customers may select their electricity supplier - providers compete on price, term length, percentage of renewable energy and more. Electricity will continue to be delivered by a utility.
Thanks to years of industry experience, broker relationships, and the competition introduced by our proprietary comparison shopping technology, we're able to offer you competitive electricity and natural gas rates on the market. And unlike junk-mail promotional offers, Power Kiosk Direct rates are fixed — guaranteed — over the course of your plan. They don't go up after you switch.
Cavity wall insulation. Most homes built since 1920 have a gap between internal and external walls. Filling the cavity with insulating mineral wool and foam means cold air's kept out, and warm air stays in. It can save an average three-bedroom home up to £150/year. We've heard of certain cases where damp has formed after having cavity wall insulation installed, so make sure it's appropriate for your home.

On the other hand, month-to-month variable rate (no-contract) plans don’t have cancellation fees. You won’t be penalized if you find a better deal elsewhere and want to make another switch. And, you won’t be stuck paying more than you should be if the market rate for electricity trends down. But, if it goes up, you’ll be paying more than your in-contract neighbors, and you’ll likely want to shop around again for a better deal.
Consumers in Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and Corpus Christi were promised bargains on electricity when the Texas Legislature deregulated the electricity market. But 16 years later they're still paying more for electricity than their counterparts in cities Texas lawmakers exempted from deregulation such as Austin and San Antonio, according to the Texas Coalition for Affordable Power which analyzed federal electricity pricing data.
After Senate Bill 7 went into effect in January 2002, nearly 6 million power customers became eligible to choose their energy supplier. That number has grown through the years. By deregulating the state’s energy market, the Texas Senate gave constituents the power to choose. The process of energy deregulation in Texas dismantled the utilities’ monopoly over the electric market and encouraged customers to explore their energy options.
When changing your address, first contact your supplier to go discuss special offers when you move.

Canadian electricity is cheap at 10 US cents per kilowatt hour, which is reflected in their high average electricity usage. US electricity prices at 0.12 $/kWh are also quite cheap internationally. In India and China they are very cheap. The UK is in the middle at 20 cents. It’s relatively expensive globally but not too bad for Europe, where most countries pay a high share of tax on their power.
Direct Energy is one of North America’s largest energy and energy-related services providers with nearly 5 million residential and commercial customer relationships. Direct Energy provides customers with choice and support in managing their energy costs through a portfolio of innovative products and services. A subsidiary of Centrica plc (LSE:CNA), one of the world’s leading integrated energy companies, Direct Energy operates in 46 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia and 10 provinces in Canada.
For example, if you use a small amount of energy each month, you expect to be rewarded — right? Unfortunately, nearly all electricity plans from Texas REPs are advertised as costing more per kWh the less electricity you use. It’s a little like buying in bulk: Providers often discount your bill when you cross certain kWh thresholds. For instance, one 12-month plan from StarTex Power quotes 8.1 cents per kWh for 1,000 kWh a month and 8.8 cents for 2,000 kWh per month, but 12.1 cents for 500 kWh per month. Why the difference? Customers get $35 back each month if they pass 1,000 kWh of use, and another $15 back per month if they cross 2,000 kWh. In this case, using half as much electricity as your neighbor on the same plan wouldn’t get you half the bill.
Since 2002, the majority of Texans have had to choose their own Retail Electric Provider (REP) – the middleman that buys electricity wholesale, then sells it to you, the consumer. According to the Public Utility Commission of Texas’ 2017 report, the Lone Star state is “the national leader in competitive residential, commercial, and industrial offerings,” which means there are well over 200 providers bidding for your attention.

We are so glad to announce that Travis Thunder Bull has been "officially" named as the Allen (Pass Creek) Youth Center Director, by the Pass Creek Tribal Council. Travis and the community children are working hard to clean the grounds, mow the grass, and provide a safe place for the little ones.
For the fourth time One Spirit Germany had the opportunity to take part in the Karl May Festival in Radebeul near Dresden, East Germany.
The days of summer are here in Lakota Country, and it’s beautiful. As I look out across the Great Oglala Lakota nation I can feel the presence of the spirit of the long ago. Where life can sometimes hit a low it can also hit a high. Each month when we do our One Spirit food sharing day there’s always some really good stories that come about and sometimes I have a spot where I can actually write and tell them.
We are pleased to announce that One Spirit has received a $6900 grant from the Black Hills Area Community Foundation. These funds will be used to buy needed equipment for The Buffalo House Meat Processing facility and will directly help provide the traditional meat needed by the Lakota to prevent the diet related diseases that are so rampant on the Reservation.
Monetary donations are tax deductible. 90% of all donations/contributions received are used for direct support of the Lakota programs.

You should permit only reliable, mentally sound, and physically fit persons to work with or use explosives and ammunition. Make sure their qualification and certification are current. QUALIFICATION PROCEDURES Personnel qualify at various levels, such as team member, quality assurance, and safety observer. We discuss the different qualification levels in later para- graphs. Explosive devices are segregated into representa- tive family types. That prevents the need for personnel to qualify on every type of ordnance or ammunition. Personnel qualify by demonstrating their skills before a certified member of the certification board. They show each evolution they will perform (for example, assembly and testing) on the specific explosive device, represented by a family type of device, if appropriate. The person qualifying must know the documentation, such as a technical manual, that applies to each device and how to use it. QUALIFICATION LEVELS As with any qualification process in the Navy, there are different levels and minimum standards for certification. The qualification levels and corresponding basic qualification standards are as follows: 1. Team Member (TM): Members must have an awareness of basic safety precautions about the work task and explosive devices concerned. They must have received formal or on-the-job training and must have been recommended by their immediate supervisor. NOTE: TM qualified personnel will perform in team concept only under supervision of a Team Leader. 2. Individual/Team Leader (I/TL): Team Leaders must have the same basic qualifications as a TM. They must have sufficient knowledge and must have demonstrated the skill required to be entrusted with performing the work task alone or to direct the performance of others in safe and reliable operations. They must be capable of interpreting the requirements of applicable checklists and assembly/operating manuals. 3. Quality Assurance (QA): QA personnel must have the same basic qualifications as an I/TL. They must have a detailed knowledge of applicable inspection criteria for the explosive/device system. They must be able to determine whether an explosive device/system is functioning properly while in use. They must be able to determine whether the individual followed necessary assembly or installation procedures according to applicable directives. 4. Instructor (IN): Instructors must have the same basic qualification as an I/TE. They must have the required skills to instruct others and provide formal training using an approved course of instruction. 5. Safety Observer (SO): Safety observers must know enough about safety procedures and the functioning of safety devices to decide on actions needed to counter improperly used procedures or safety devices. NOTE: This level of qualification does not build on any other level of qualification. CERTIFICATION PROCEDURE The commanding officer or officer in charge (OIC) of each unit or naval activity involved with explosives appoints a certification board. This board includes, as a minimum, the responsible department head (or comparable supervisory representative if not a department). The board also includes at least one person, E-6 or above, certified to perform the task, function, or evolution. In large units, such as aircraft carriers or weapons stations/ammunition depots, the department head may delegate the responsibility for certification. Additional personnel from within or outside the command may increase the board as appointed by the commanding officer or OIC. Once qualified and recommended, personnel receive their final certification. The commanding officer, OIC, or the appointed head of the certification board issues the final certification. You must make sure this information gets entered into your peoples training or personnel record. In addition, you must keep a certification sheet (fig. 9-1) in the operating area for each person performing operations covered by an oper- ating procedure. Activities may vary the certification sheet formats to satisfy specific requirements. Duration of Certification Certification, unless revoked, is valid for a maximum of 12 months. The certification board confirms a renewal of the certification, whether issued at the time of expiration or later. The certification covers an individual or a team qualification. If possible, you should completely requalify personnel before renewing their certification. 9-8

Amegilla cingulata, commonly known as the blue-banded bee, is an Australian native bee that occurs in many other regions. Currently, several scientific organizations are conducting research on how the blue-banded bee benefits agriculture through its distinctive "buzz pollination". These bees are very important for the production of food and contribute to at least 30% of crops in Australia.
"I jumped up and said, 'That's it!,'" Mulcahy remembers. He knew that Beebe really had collected the nightsnake on Clarion Island. Martinez-Gómez encouraged Mulcahy to travel to Mexico to see if they could find the snake once again. "It was a big risk," Mulcahy admits. "I'm a technician at a molecular lab. They don't pay me to go out and chase things. I had to get funding elsewhere." The journey—which required approval from the Mexican Navy—would also take more than a month, because Mulcahy would be joining a team that would spend 15 days on nearby Socorro Island before making the 16-hour ocean journey to Clarion for another 15-day stay.
Yesterday I found a cute tiny jumping spider of the Simaethula genus. I'm not sure if they've been found in South Australia before. Interesting feature - It's covered in golden scales and is sparkly.
Mazin! Often wondered about jumping spider vision but never got around to it. pretty interesting short intro.
Actually they are quite a pest these days, although they're a native bird. Noisy Miners specialise in living on the edge of eucalypt forests and chasing all the other birds out of their territory, but because so much forest cover has been removed by human action, especially west of the Great Dividing Range, there are a lot more "edges" - like trees lining roads and fence-lines, or in cleared paddocks or urban parks and gardens. So the same human-influenced conditions that have brought species like Regent Honey-eaters and Swift parrots to their knees have profited Noisy miners greatly.
On the road and can't access the talk vid but interesting and seems then it's an area/perimeter problem and if there were more unbroken forest areas the problem would decrease. Not easy to see how that might be achieved but will watch the talk when can. We see similar issues with changing land use in the uk and benefitting species are gulls, corvids and wood pigeons.
Bell miners are funny. They play the same game and I've seen them drive the noisy miners out of an area.
I've got a couple of little wattlebirds in our garden that refuse to back down. They'll occasionally take on a dozen or so noisy miners, which is impressive as hell. However, a lot of birds can't handle noisy miners at all.
The photo is quite a few years old, but only yesterday I swept half a dozen tailfeathers out from under my desk and wiped a few spots of drying blood off the floor tiles.
They are found on a small island off Perth called Rottnest Island, where they are quite tame, and safe from foxes and cats.
The island name is from the Dutch for "rat's nest" - they had discovered the west coast in the seventeenth century more than 150 years before Captain Cook.
Yes, that's where I saw them. Some time ago, I read that some monsters got hold of them because they are so trusting and tortured them. Will try and find the link - or maybe better not.

Our MAc program is a 30-hour, full-time program designed to be completed in two consecutive semesters beginning the in Fall, with some optional sections available during the summer prior to full-time fall enrollment. Additionally, the MAc curriculum provides the additional hours beyond those required for a BBA in accounting to take the CPA exam in Texas.
MAc Core. The MAc Core curriculum combines advanced critical accounting knowledge with soft skills such as professional communication, analysis and persuasion. The goal of the MAc Core is to provide students the opportunity and ability to think about and appreciate the accounting and business world from various perspectives.
Audit and Assurance Services. Develop the skills needed to audit or consult with multinational corporations. Graduates with this concentration typically begin their professional careers in the audit practice of a professional services firm.
Taxation. Taxation develops a foundation for understanding and analyzing the manner in which tax strategy impacts the current business environment. Graduates with this concentration typically begin their professional careers in the tax division of a professional services firm or in a corporate tax department.
Financial Reporting & Valuation. Financial Reporting and Valuation develops accounting knowledge and analytical skills necessary for decision-making in today’s complex business environment. While many graduates with this concentration will likely begin their careers as assurance professionals, this concentration also prepares graduates more broadly for positions in consulting practices of professional services firms, with investment banking firms or other financial institutions.
MAc students are encouraged to participate in the sponsored learning experiences held off-campus. There are currently two travel experiences available to TCU Master of Accounting students.
Each summer, students travel to The Washington Campus for a three-day intensive study that includes presentations from legislators and regulators, policy experts and influencers, and experienced sector professionals. Participants will gain understanding of the accounting profession’s increasingly dynamic public affairs and public policy environment.
The itinerary will include company visits in Munich, Germany as well as Bologna, Italy, and the trip will include travel via train through the Alps. The objective of the class is to provide a perspective on international markets and the global economic environment. Students will consider the impact of cultural differences on international business. There will be a strong focus on commerce, culture & cuisine!

Zimbabwe needs up to $4 billion to avert a looming currency crisis that could unleash economic havoc, with the new Cabinet urged to take tough decisions to increase confidence in the economy.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Friday appointed former banker Mthuli Ncube as Finance minister and retained Winston Chitando in the key mining portfolio, tasking two competent technocrats to steer the quest to revive the country’s stuttering economy.
This comes as government has been moving away from market-friendly economic policies toward a more populist attitude that grants generous government subsidies on everything from agriculture to social programmes.
The government has been reprimanded by the International Monetary Fund for high government spending and foreign debt, with the Bretton Woods institution calling for comprehensive structural reforms.
Critical cash shortages and foreign currency limitations have been inhibiting investment where hard currency to fund imported inputs is needed.
This comes as there is a willingness to invest and amid concrete proposals from multinationals, among others, but structural impediments continue to discourage some potential investors.
This comes as the economy is a mess, the regulatory environment is a nightmare and there is no foreign currency to assist investment when it knocks on the door.
Industrialist Busisa Moyo said the September to March period required a forex boost in order to achieve economic growth.
“Zimbabwe since the 1960s has had a cyclical inflow of foreign currency due to its dependence on agriculture,” Moyo told the Daily News on Sunday.
“An agricultural input some of which are imported and festive season stocking up which requires both finished goods and raw materials further puts pressure on imports and foreign currency.
“This dry forex period needs a financial structure or package in order to smooth financial flows; this can be in the form of a loan advance or a structured financial package.
This comes as President Emmerson Mnangagwa failed to secure a $2bn loan from China to clear arrears to multi-lateral institutions under the Lima Plan — a payment plan agreed with foreign lenders in 2015 in the Peruvian capital.
In meetings with President Xi Jinping last week, Mnangagwa tabled the request for a bailout package to bankroll productive sectors such as tourism, mining, industry, agriculture and manufacturing, among others.
But China was reportedly edgy about extending fresh loans to Zimbabwe, citing its $300m arrears from previous loans.
Zimbabwe is now banking on accessing part of $60 billion in financing for Africa unveiled by Xi during the opening of a major summit with African leaders last week.
Xi, addressing leaders at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People last Monday, said the new $60 billion will include $15 billion of aid, interest-free loans and concessional loans, a credit line of $20 billion, a $10 billion special fund for China-Africa development, and a $5 billion special fund for imports from Africa.
Reserve Bank governor John Mangudya, who travelled with President Mnangagwa’s delegation, told Chinese State media: “Zimbabwe’s economic development hinges on the access to capital and in that vein we are excited that the $60 billion package announced by President Xi Jinping is going to be accessible to African countries.
“We as Zimbabwe we are taking this matter seriously and engage with other financial institutions here and see how best we can make the economy improve through such lines of credit.”
“As a country we import $6-7bn of commodities including fuel and raw materials per annum while our imports are half that, so we have annual import deficit of about $3bn ($250m per month), this means $1,75m for seven months, but because the bulk of outflows go out for agricultural inputs and festive season raw materials and finished good demand, this amount is uneven during the latter half of the year and reaches circa $2,3bn driven by the period September to December although it comes off slightly in January-March period,” he said.
Moyo also cited with concern the increasing backlog of monies in the queue for foreign currency. He said farmers and the private sector need foreign currency for re-tooling.
Analyst Eldred Masunungure concurred with Moyo, saying the country was in dire need of financial assistance.
“Government is in very dire financial straits, going forward hence the imperative for robust re-engagement with the international community especially the IFIs (international finance institutions).
“China can also come handy with support including agricultural inputs such as fertilizers , pesticides amongst others,” he said.
Gary Van Staden, an analyst at NKC African Economics said: “There is a long track ahead, but Zimbabwe appears to have at least found the tunnel at the end of which some light may eventually appear.
“We believe the information we have, our sources and the analyses we have done suggest the Zanu PF victory and that of Mnangagwa was most likely legitimate.
“It may have been ugly, flawed in places and skewed — suggesting electoral reform is now a necessity — but the polls were not stolen, the opposition just let it slip.
“Several imperatives now appear: Mnangagwa must keep his promises and introduce a range of economic and political reforms designed to set Zimbabwe on a path to recovery at all levels and in all kinds of ways.
“Real compromises and tough decisions need to be made by all parties in the country and the opposition MDC-Alliance in its various forms and factions needs to now look at its own failures rather than look to blame someone else.
As for South Africa and the role it can play inside and outside of the Sadc, we expect to see real constructive engagement because the rest of the international community is going to lag, Van Staden said. Daily News
Delta Corporation is contributing $260 000 towards the upgrade of a road junction linking its Fairbridge Chibuku Super plant in the second city with the Harare-Bulawayo highway.
In a statement, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed concern said the rehabilitation of the plant in 2016 has necessitated the upgrade of the road junction that links with the highway.
“The upgrading of the Chibuku Super plant at Fairbridge in 2016, has given rise to an increase of volume of traffic to and from the plant particularly the heavy motor vehicles that ferry raw materials and finished product. It became necessary to improve the safety of traffic entering the highway or manoeuvring from the highway into the premises,” said Delta.
The project is being supported by various stakeholders including Zimbabwe National Roads Administration, the ministries of Transport and Local Government.
“This project fits well into Delta’s integrated and sustainable development framework which was part of the brewery redevelopment in 2015/16,” said Delta.
Delta Corporation is involved in the brewing of lager and traditional beer and the bottling of soft drinks under licence from the Coca-Cola Company under the Delta Beverages Company . Daily News.

Potential Game-Changing Land Exchange between the Evergreen Hotel and the Vail Valley Medical Center
The Town Council will consider proceeding with VVMC's West Wing Conditional Use Permit Application at their 6:00 pm Evening Meeting Tuesday, December 16th. The Meeting will be held in the Vail Town Council Chambers at 75 South Frontage Road in Vail. Public input is encouraged mailto:towncouncil@vailgov.com.
Attempts to redevelop portions of the Vail Valley Medical Center (VVMC) have been underway for most of the past five years. In conjunction with these attempts, adjacent property owners have requested that a long-term master plan for the VVMC be prepared and adopted by the Town of Vail. The most current version of the VVMC Proposed Master Plan is presently under review by the Town of Vail Planning and Environmental Commission (PEC). Both the Town of Vail and the Evergreen Hotel have expressed interest in redeveloping their sites which are adjacent to the VVMC campus. The Town of Vail had prepared a joint redevelopment Master Plan for its site in conjunction with a VVMC effort to use a portion of the Town municipal site for a medical office building, which was subsequently abandoned.
The Vail Homeowners Association (VHA) has participated on behalf of its members in the public review of the various versions of both the VVMC and TOV Master Plans. VHA advocates that public safety issues, with respect to both vehicular and emergency helicopter traffic need to be resolved in the master planning for all three sites. Specifically, VHA desires all VVMC vehicular traffic be removed from Vail Road and West Meadow Drive and relocated to a new access on the South Frontage Road. Secondly, that medical helicopters do not overfly occupied structures in the community, but instead fly over Interstate 70, accessing the community's emergency helipad at its current location or at a new location on the Town's municipal site, which gives timely and direct access to the VVMC emergency care facilities via a new sky bridge over the South Frontage Road, and additionally, that surrounding neighborhoods are shielded from the takeoff, landing and idling noise associated with the helipad. Thirdly, that VVMC make other necessary improvements consistent with those required of other new developments located in similar circumstances between East & West Meadow Drive and the South Frontage Road.
The Evergreen Hotel has been seeking a "land exchange" with VVMC for some time. Recently VVMC and the Evergreen Hotel agreed to have serious discussions about a potential exchange. If the exchange were to occur, it would give VVMC a much larger exposure along the South Frontage Road, enabling it to potentially attain compliance with the public safety improvements advocated by VHA and neighboring property owners.
The VVMC Proposed Master plan is nearing completion of its review by the PEC. VHA is submitting detailed language to amend the VVMC Proposed Master plan to include the goals desired by VHA and neighborhood property owners.
Recently, VVMC has requested that it be given permission to proceed through the final review for the West Wing expansion, the next phase of redevelopment. The VVMC request opens the prospect of beginning construction in the spring of 2015. Some are of the opinion that VVMC has a history of agreeing to certain improvements as a condition of approval by the Town of Vail for earlier buildings, but not completing the improvements and seeking to alter the agreed upon conditions in subsequent development applications.
The Vail Homeowners Association recommends that VVMC not be given permission to proceed with construction expanding the West Wing until it enters into a contractual agreement (Developer Improvement Agreement) giving financial guarantees that it will complete the improvements stipulated in an adopted master plan. Such an approach was used by the Town in their ongoing negotiation with Vail Resorts concerning the Ever Vail development in West Lionshead. The Town Council will consider proceeding with VVMC's West Wing Conditional Use Permit Application at their 6:00 pm Evening Meeting Tuesday, December 16th.
Because the condition for approving the VVMC Proposed Master Plan may be changed through a subsequent land exchange or related improvements on either the Town of Vail or Evergreen Hotel site, a provision to amend the Plan should also be included. The amendment provision should not preclude adjacent and affected property owners from initiating an amendment to the VVMC Master Plan.
The Vail Valley Medical Center (VVMC) and the Evergreen Hotel (EGH) have entered into discussions to exchange parcels of land. The exchange would give VVMC greater exposure along the South Frontage Road. The exchange could meet the Vail Homeowners Association's (VHA) goal of eliminating all VVMC vehicular traffic from Vail Road and West Meadow Drive. Also, it could attain the VHA and affected residential neighborhood's goal of relocating the existing and proposed VVMC truck delivery facility and its access from West Meadow Drive to the Evergreen Exchange Parcel and the South Frontage Road. The effect of the proposed exchange would bring the proposed VVMC Master Plan, with respect to access and truck deliveries, into conformity with all other developments that have been built in recent years on sites located between East & West Meadow Drive and the South Frontage Road. The exchange could alter other critical portions of the VVMC Proposed Master Plan.
The Town Council will consider proceeding with VVMC's West Wing Conditional Use Permit Application at their 6:00 pm Evening Meeting Tuesday, December 16th. VVMC, while it considers the land exchange, wants to proceed with the approval of their proposed expansion of the existing West Wing building, saying it wants to begin construction this coming spring (2015). VVMC says the West Wing must be completed before subsequent phases of their master plan can proceed. If the master plan fails to gain approval by the start of construction the Town could withhold the issuance of the building permit for the expansion, this according to Town officials.
While the potential VVMC/Evergreen Hotel exchange offers many advantages, VHA believes that the Town of Vail's (TOV) proposal to redevelop the municipal building site and the Evergreen Hotel's redevelopment proposal could offer an opportunity to improve the VVMC Master Plan. However, neither of these properties are advanced enough in their own master planning to make definitive commitments that could result in a much improved joint master plan that would benefit these three large properties and the surrounding neighborhoods. For example, the influence of the potential land exchange has caused the location of the proposed new South Frontage Road roundabout, shown above, to be moved further to the west.
Suggested changes to VVMC Proposed Master Plan to attain VHA goals of ensuring improved public safety and neighborhood compatibility
The ongoing land exchange discussion has resulted in the timeline for the VVMC master planning process to be lengthened. To avoid delays, VHA text changes to the VVMC Master Plan proposal have been prepared that would allow for amendment of the VVMC Master Plan as more becomes known about the redevelopment of the Evergreen Hotel and the Town of Vail municipal sites. The proposed text changes also include modification to the content of the VVMC Master Plan proposal that attains VHA's goal of ensuring public safety and enhancing compatibility with the surrounding residential neighborhoods. The VHA text changes are summarized in the diagram above.
The proposed location of the new roundabout on the South Frontage road has been moved further west, keeping it totally on Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) right-of-way. The roundabout would improve access to the VVMC, Evergreen Hotel and Town municipal sites, while conforming to the two lanes of traffic flow in either direction planned for this section of the South Frontage Road. The new location would eliminate the existing CDOT helipad. Town officials are requesting CDOT to give a preliminary opinion on the roundabout location. VHA believes that the heliport should be relocated to the top deck of the Town proposed new parking structure on the municipal site, as it would conform to the Association's public safety goal of eliminating helicopter overflight of occupied structures like schools, office buildings, hotels and residences.
The proposed land exchange is affecting the location of the new SFR roundabout, moving it further to the west, which would eliminate the existing CDOT helipad. To attain the VHA public safety goals of eliminating helicopter overflight of occupied structures, the helipad could be relocated to the surface of the Town of Vail's proposed new parking structure on the municipal building site.
The proposed land exchange could significantly alter the configuration and architectural treatment of the proposed VVMC office building, on which VVMC would like to relocate the community's emergency helipad, now located nearby on CDOT right-of-way.
The VVMC proposed office building does not comply with the high standards of Vail's architectural design and is incompatible with the surrounding neighborhood, nor does it attain VHA's public safety goal of eliminating helicopter overflights of occupied structures and shielding the surrounding residential neighborhoods from objectionable noise pollution. VHA believes both the adverse effects on public safety and environmental impacts could be eliminated by relocating the helipad to the upper deck of the Town of Vail's proposed new municipal site parking structure or by leaving it in the existing CDOT location, while still meeting the desire of VVMC for speedy patient transfers.

In 1880, only four years after he invented the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell received a patent for a remarkable idea- using light, rather than wire, to carry phone calls. Professor Bell built an experI- mental "Photophone" that trans,mitted his voice over a beam of sunlight. It didn't work very well, however. Sunbeams are scattered by air, rain and fog. In any event, the sun doesn't always shine. The Photophone, unfortunately, was an idea whose time had not yet come A new kind of light By the 1950's, scientists again were looking for a way to use light for communications In September, 1957, Charles Townes, a Bell Labs consultant, and Bell Labs scientist Arthur Schawlow conceived a way of producing a new kind of light- extremely intense, highly direc- tional, and capable of carrying immense amounts of information. Townes and Schawlow received a basic patent on their invention-the laser. Since then, Bell Labs scien- tists have invented hundreds of lasers, including many firsts- gas and solid-state lasers capable of continuous operation, high- power carbon dioxide lasers, liquid dye lasers that produce pulses shorter than a trillionth of a second, and tiny semi- conductor lasers that work reliably at normal temperatures Some of these, no larger than grains of salt, may emit light continuously for 100 years. Getting the light to the end of the tunnel While we were developing lasers to generate light, we also looked for a way of shielding it and guiding It for long distances and around curves. Extremely transparent glass fibers, perfected at Bell Labs and elsewhere, provide the answer. These hair-thin fibers can carry light many miles without distortion or the need for amplification. In 1977, the Bell System took lightwave communications out of the laboratory and put it to work under the streets of down- town Chicago. The system, the first to carry phone calls, computer data, and video signals on pulses of light, is working successfully. Spin -off Laser light is now used in many other ways-to perform delicate eye surgery, detect air pollution, read product codes at supermarket checkouts, and do a variety of manufacturing tasks. Western Electric, the Bell System's manufacturing and supply unit, was the first company to put the laser to industrial use back in 1965. Hundreds of applications in many industries have followed. Sometimes, it takes a lot of work and a long time to make a bright idea-like Professor Bell's-a reality. Often, the things we invent, such as the laser, benefit not only Bell System customers, but society in general.

Thither he dashes, straight from the airport; and before saying a word he heaps a plate with whatever is left. Despite their differences over mat- ters of etiquette, Heller has a high re- spect for Brooks. He freely admitted to me that he used a lot of Brooks's ß lines in his second novel, "Something Happened," and that in his next book, "Good as Gold," "the hero is a small J ewish guy, and there's a great deal of .,' Mel In that." In the early seventies, Heller was teaching writing at City College of New York. He had long # been aware that Brooks was vulnerable to practical jokes. One evening, Heller casually lied about his salary, saying that it was sixty-eight thousand dollars a year-more than double the truth. A couple of days later, Heller's ac- countant, who also worked for Brooks, -:-. called him up and said, "For God's sake, Joe, what the hell have you done? First thing this morning, Mel was up here screaming, 'Why am I in the en- tertainment business? Why aren't I teaching and earning seventy thousand 4 a year like Joe Heller?' He was out of his mind! " Having told me this story, Heller went on, "Mel has always had plenty of resentment and aggression that he can sublimate into creativity. He's usually at his best when he's en vYIng people more successful than he is. Now that there's hardly anyone more successful, what will he do?" I cited a mot attributed to Gore Vidal: "It is not enough to succeed Others must fail." "I thought that was La Rochefou- cauld," Heller said. "But anyway it doesn't apply to Mel. He likes to see his rivals fail, but not his friends. Pro- vided, of course, that he's succeeding." I asked whether, in Heller's opinion, fame had changed Brooks. "Not a bit. He's just as nasty, hos- tile, acquisitive, and envious today as he ever was. Please be sure to quote me on that," Heller said warmly. He wen t on, "You have to distinguish between Mel the entertainer and Mel the private person. He puts on thIs manic public performance, but it's an act, it's something sought for an'd worked on. When he's being himself, he'll talk quietly for hours and then make a remark that's unforgettably funny because it comes out of a real situation.

Over the weekend I went camping with my friend and her sister. We drove up to Rattlesnake Point in Milton, ON. The drive was gorgeous and had many steep turns and hills. When we arrived at our campground, Shreya, Neha, and I set up the tent and started to make a fire.
A good 2 hours later the fire was made! Our dinner menu was hot dogs and s’mores. That night we stayed outside for as long as we could until the mosquitoes started to attack us. Then, we went inside our tent, played cards, watched Harry Potter, and slept.
The next morning, Neha drove us to Fifties Diner in Oakville. We ate a huge breakfast while listening to music from the 50s. What an awesome breakfast!
It was my first time camping! I had been in cabins and did field trips with my school, but I never went camping in a tent. It was a great experience to be out in the nature. This trip reminded me of my experience in Ecuador! Staring up at the night sky with no electricity and taking in the beauty of nature. Camping has been on my bucket list for a while and I can finally check it off! I definitely suggest you to pick a campsite, get a tent, grab some s’mores and go camping!

I took SPD today. PC at prometrics failed during the site grading vignette. Icons were not working. Could not select anything, then the "set elevation" tool didn't work. I reported it to the staff, they came they checked, lost what? 2 minutes? they assigned me to another workstation....I was totally in shock and out of concentration. Computer started again, "set pad elevation" didn't work too, I lost maybe another 2 minutes, guy explained me he was going to write report to NCARB and to his supervisor, he came back and told me to continue without setting the pad elevation... I explained that is a fail mistake because the pad elevation is mandatory,....at that point frustration, shock and panic were in my mind at the same time...totally out of focus and concentration.....I got myself together and continued working and trying the "Set pad elevation" icon many times....boom...magic... worked!
I finished, but the computer was acting up, very slow movement of the mouse, problems selecting stuffs, the upper section where the clock is was flickering at every second and I am not exaggerating...against all odds I finished both vignettes... not sure how......then in my last minute I was doing a final check and boom...." you ran out of time" popped up.....during my last minute!!!!!!!!!
They just told me to contact the Architect Board and NCARB...I am shocked and frustrated...all this effort, time and dedication, and of course skipped work to take the damn test....all gone because of the stupidy of the NCARB testing program....
Please share your thoughts or experience with something similar...not sure how NCARB handles this...and to make it worst...ARE 4.0 retires tomorrow!!!!!
I didn't have this problem, but I did see on the NCARB 4.0 SPD Google Plus page several people experienced computer problems. Go to the page and take a look for the thread. I think Michelle NCARB or Nick NCARB were the ones responding to them. I believe one girl already NCARB reaching out to her about it...
I want either a free test or my money back or a grade of my test based on the failures of the program.
And to make it even worst. You don’t have the right to see prometric report because it’s in their rules when ok pay for the dam test. I can’t believe nobody had sued them both. It’s just not correct.

English [French translation below] NEMO-Online is delighted to propose this new article by Amine Beyhom on notational tools and graphical analyses of melody and rythm. Musical notation has been reputed as disqualified for the analysis of “Foreign” musics since – at least – the experiments of Charles Seeger with the Melograph. It is nevertheless still used as the main analytic – and teaching – tool for these musics in most researches in musicology, and today in the teaching of these musics in autochthonous conservatories. Seeger’s experiments brought at his time cutting-edge solutions – and alternatives – to score notation but, [more…]

The theme will be about ‘Musicology/Ethnomusicology: evolutions and problems’. Since its origins as Vergleichende Musikwissenschaft, ethnomusicology struggles to define itself in relation to classical Occidental musicology, the latter being the semantic carrier of a more general character which is nevertheless restricted to the study of musics which in a first instance concerns only the Occident, and in a second instance, which is concerned with music labelled as ‘learned’, even integrating popular musics such as jazz, pop, rock [more…]

Article “A Hypothesis for the Elaboration of Heptatonic Scales” by Amine Beyhom updated and reissued for NEMO-Online Vol. 4 No. 6
Although the "Warburg effect", i.e., elevated glucose metabolism to lactic acid (glycolysis) even in the presence of oxygen, has been recognized as the most common biochemical phenotype of cancer for over 80 years, its biochemical and genetic basis remained unknown for over 50 years. Work focused on elucidating the underlying mechanism(s) of the "Warburg effect" commenced in the author's laboratory in 1969. By 1985 among the novel findings made two related most directly to the basis of the "Warburg effect", the first that the mitochondrial content of tumors exhibiting this phenotype is markedly decreased relative to the tissue of origin, and the second that such mitochondria have markedly elevated amounts of the enzyme hexokinase-2 (HK2) bound to their outer membrane.
HK2 is the first of a number of enzymes in cancer cells involved in metabolizing the sugar glucose to lactic acid. At its mitochondrial location HK2 binds at/near the protein VDAC (voltage dependent anion channel), escapes inhibition by its product glucose-6-phosphate, and gains access to mitochondrial produced ATP. As shown by others, it also helps immortalize cancer cells, i.e., prevents cell death. Based on these studies, the author's laboratory commenced experiments to elucidate the gene basis for the overexpression of HK2 in cancer.
These studies led to both the discovery of a unique HK2 promoter region markedly activated by both hypoxic conditions and moderately activated by several metabolites (e.g., glucose), Also discovered was the promoter's regulation by epigenetic events (i.e., methylation, demethylation). Finally, the author's laboratory turned to the most important objective. Could they selectively and completely destroy cancerous tumors in animals? This led to the discovery in an experiment conceived, designed, and conducted by Young Ko that the small molecule 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), the subject of this mini-review series, is an incredibly powerful and swift acting anticancer agent.
Significantly, in subsequent experiments with rodents (19 animals with advanced cancer) Ko led a project in which 3BP was shown in a short treatment period to eradicate all (100%). Ko's and co-author's findings once published attracted global attention leading world-wide to many other studies and publications related to 3BP and its potent anti-cancer effect. This Issue of the Journal of Bioenergetics and Biomembranes (JOBB 44-1) captures only a sampling of research conducted to date on 3BP as an anticancer agent, and includes also a Case Report on the first human patient known to the author to be treated with specially formulated 3BP. Suffice it to say in this bottom line, "3BP", a small molecule, results in a remarkable therapeutic effect when it comes to treating cancers exhibiting a "Warburg effect". This includes the most cancer types.

Team Scurlinuster continues to reign as champions off their historic gold medal win in men's curling. I had a chance to meet John several times and he was even kind enough to bring in his gold medal for us to see. According to NBC Sports now the team is getting some more recognition with the "Team Shuster Table Top Curling Set" which will be out in TJ Maxx stores this Fall.
The game is being marketed as endorsed by the U.S. Olympic men’s curling team of John Shuster, Tyler George, Matt Hamilton, John Landsteiner and Joe Polo that made history with their gold medal win in PyeongChang.
The idea for this game was developed by an Ambassador Games employee in Hong Kong shortly after the Olympics and features little stones that is similar to a shuffleboard. I must admit I have never watched curling in my life before this last Olympics and even stayed up way past my bed time to watch the early rounds of the men's curling team matches. This is a must purchase for any men's curling team fan and a great holiday gift idea.
In 2014 prices started at $770 and fell to $314 for the year.[31] In February 2014 the Mt. Gox exchange, the largest bitcoin exchange at the time, said that 850,000 bitcoins had been stolen from its customers, amounting to almost $500 million. Bitcoin's price fell by almost half, from $867 to $439 (a 49% drop). Prices remained low until late 2016.[citation needed]
Investigations into the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto were attempted by The New Yorker and Fast Company. The New Yorker's investigation brought up at least two possible candidates: Michael Clear and Vili Lehdonvirta. Fast Company's investigation brought up circumstantial evidence linking an encryption patent application filed by Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry on 15 August 2008, and the bitcoin.org domain name which was registered 72 hours later. The patent application (#20100042841) contained networking and encryption technologies similar to bitcoin's, and textual analysis revealed that the phrase "... computationally impractical to reverse" appeared in both the patent application and bitcoin's whitepaper.[11] All three inventors explicitly denied being Satoshi Nakamoto.[31][32]
That low point in unique addresses is a point where Bitcoin was hovering around $6,900 USD back around April 11, 2018. Using the seven-day average of the number of unique addresses (which smoothes out low points caused by low volume on the weekends), you can see that growth has returned since April to this underlying fundamental. The price today is lower, but the number of users appears to be growing again, and this time the network can support more transactions than before due to the rise of Segwit Adoption. If I had to guess I would say Bitcoin could now handle 50% to 100% more transactions per second than when we had the last peak in December/January.
Various journalists,[204][211] economists,[212][213] and the central bank of Estonia[214] have voiced concerns that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. In 2013, Eric Posner, a law professor at the University of Chicago, stated that "a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion."[215] A 2014 report by the World Bank concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme.[216]:7 The Swiss Federal Council[217]:21 examined the concerns that bitcoin might be a pyramid scheme; it concluded that, "Since in the case of bitcoin the typical promises of profits are lacking, it cannot be assumed that bitcoin is a pyramid scheme." In July 2017, billionaire Howard Marks referred to bitcoin as a pyramid scheme.[218]
That crash was made up for by a rally in October and November of that year. By early October, Bitcoin was at about $100, and it hit $195 by the end of the month. In November alone, Bitcoin had an unbelievable rally, going from $200 to more than $1,120. The causes of this rally were fairly obvious to most people, as more miners and exchanges were supporting Bitcoin. In addition, China had entered the marketplace.
An official investigation into bitcoin traders was reported in May 2018.[175] The U.S. Justice Department launched an investigation into possible price manipulation, including the techniques of spoofing and wash trades.[176][177][178] Traders in the U.S., the U.K, South Korea, and possibly other countries are being investigated.[175] Brett Redfearn, head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Trading and Markets, had identified several manipulation techniques of concern in March 2018.
Bitcoin’s popularity has undeniably been its number one advantage over the numerous other cryptocurrencies. By gaining a large number of adopters and users, Bitcoin has achieved a network effect that attracts even more users. Users who would otherwise be more apprehensive investing in a relatively unknown and unproven digital currency are reassured by Bitcoin’s performance over time, its growing community, and the fact that people they know are adopting cryptos.
The proof-of-work system, alongside the chaining of blocks, makes modifications of the blockchain extremely hard, as an attacker must modify all subsequent blocks in order for the modifications of one block to be accepted.[81] As new blocks are mined all the time, the difficulty of modifying a block increases as time passes and the number of subsequent blocks (also called confirmations of the given block) increases.[64]
Regulatory Risk: Bitcoins are a rival to government currency and may be used for black market transactions, money laundering, illegal activities or tax evasion. As a result, governments may seek to regulate, restrict or ban the use and sale of bitcoins, and some already have. Others are coming up with various rules. For example, in 2015, the New York State Department of Financial Services finalized regulations that would require companies dealing with the buy, sell, transfer or storage of bitcoins to record the identity of customers, have a compliance officer and maintain capital reserves. The transactions worth $10,000 or more will have to be recorded and reported.
In the blockchain, bitcoins are registered to bitcoin addresses. Creating a bitcoin address requires nothing more than picking a random valid private key and computing the corresponding bitcoin address. This computation can be done in a split second. But the reverse, computing the private key of a given bitcoin address, is mathematically unfeasible. Users can tell others or make public a bitcoin address without compromising its corresponding private key. Moreover, the number of valid private keys is so vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is already in use and has funds. The vast number of valid private keys makes it unfeasible that brute force could be used to compromise a private key. To be able to spend their bitcoins, the owner must know the corresponding private key and digitally sign the transaction. The network verifies the signature using the public key.[3]:ch. 5
It’s decentralized and brings power back to the people. Launched just a year after the 2008 financial crises, Bitcoin has attracted many people who see the current financial system as unsustainable. This factor has won the hearts of those who view politicians and government with suspicion. It’s no surprise there is a huge community of ideologists actively building, buying, and working in the cryptocurrency world.
In the early days, Nakamoto is estimated to have mined 1 million bitcoins.[23] Before disappearing from any involvement in bitcoin, Nakamoto in a sense handed over the reins to developer Gavin Andresen, who then became the bitcoin lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation, the 'anarchic' bitcoin community's closest thing to an official public face.[24]
Press Contacts: San Francisco, CA, Kerryn Lloyd, [email protected] San Francisco, CA – August 28, 2018 –The Bitcoin Foundation has received a commitment of $200,000 for its 2018/2019 plan - $100,000 from Brock Pierce, a venture capitalist, philanthropist, serial entrepreneur and Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation and a further $100,000 commitment [...]
By 2017, Bitcoin dominance had plummeted from 95% to as low as 40% as a direct result of the usability problems. Fortunately, a large portion of the Bitcoin community, including developers, investors, users, and businesses, still believed in the original vision of Bitcoin -- a low fee, peer to peer electronic cash system that could be used by all the people of the world.
In July 2013, a project began in Kenya linking bitcoin with M-Pesa, a popular mobile payments system, in an experiment designed to spur innovative payments in Africa.[71] During the same month the Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department in Thailand stated that bitcoin lacks any legal framework and would therefore be illegal, which effectively banned trading on bitcoin exchanges in the country.[72][73] According to Vitalik Buterin, a writer for Bitcoin Magazine, "bitcoin's fate in Thailand may give the electronic currency more credibility in some circles", but he was concerned it didn't bode well for bitcoin in China.[74]
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to control its creation and management, rather than relying on central authorities.[1] The presumed pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto integrated many existing ideas from the cypherpunk community when creating bitcoin. Over the course of bitcoin's history, it has undergone rapid growth to become a significant currency both on and offline – from the mid 2010s, some businesses began accepting bitcoin in addition to traditional currencies.[2]
There are many Bitcoin supporters who believe that digital currency is the future. Those who endorse it are of the view that it facilitates a much faster, no-fee payment system for transactions across the globe. Although it is not itself any backed by any government or central bank, bitcoin can be exchanged for traditional currencies; in fact, its exchange rate against the dollar attracts potential investors and traders interested in currency plays. Indeed, one of the primary reasons for the growth of digital currencies like Bitcoin is that they can act as an alternative to national fiat money and traditional commodities like gold.
The price of bitcoins has gone through cycles of appreciation and depreciation referred to by some as bubbles and busts.[155] In 2011, the value of one bitcoin rapidly rose from about US$0.30 to US$32 before returning to US$2.[156] In the latter half of 2012 and during the 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis, the bitcoin price began to rise,[157] reaching a high of US$266 on 10 April 2013, before crashing to around US$50.[158] On 29 November 2013, the cost of one bitcoin rose to a peak of US$1,242.[159] In 2014, the price fell sharply, and as of April remained depressed at little more than half 2013 prices. As of August 2014 it was under US$600.[160] During their time as bitcoin developers, Gavin Andresen[161] and Mike Hearn[162] warned that bubbles may occur.
In March the bitcoin transaction log called the blockchain temporarily split into two independent chains with differing rules on how transactions were accepted. For six hours two bitcoin networks operated at the same time, each with its own version of the transaction history. The core developers called for a temporary halt to transactions, sparking a sharp sell-off.[55] Normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version 0.7 of the bitcoin software.[55] The Mt. Gox exchange briefly halted bitcoin deposits and the exchange rate briefly dipped by 23% to $37 as the event occurred[56][57] before recovering to previous level of approximately $48 in the following hours.[58] In the US, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established regulatory guidelines for "decentralized virtual currencies" such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as Money Service Businesses (or MSBs), that may be subject to registration and other legal obligations.[59][60][61]
In late August 2012, an operation titled Bitcoin Savings and Trust was shut down by the owner, leaving around US$5.6 million in bitcoin-based debts; this led to allegations that the operation was a Ponzi scheme.[197][198][199][200] In September 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had reportedly started an investigation on the case.[201]
Bitcoin's origin story sounds like something out of science fiction: It was launched in 2008 on the heels of a white paper published by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity – and country of origin – are unknown. Nakamoto conceived of Bitcoin as a currency that was 1) encrypted; 2) decentralized, i.e. it was ungoverned and did not belong to any nation; and 3) a digital "distributed ledger," such that everyone can verify online the legitimacy of transactions.
In January 2012, bitcoin was featured as the main subject within a fictionalized trial on the CBS legal drama The Good Wife in the third-season episode "Bitcoin for Dummies". The host of CNBC's Mad Money, Jim Cramer, played himself in a courtroom scene where he testifies that he doesn't consider bitcoin a true currency, saying "There's no central bank to regulate it; it's digital and functions completely peer to peer".[49]
To be accepted by the rest of the network, a new block must contain a so-called proof-of-work (PoW).[64] The system used is based on Adam Back's 1997 anti-spam scheme, Hashcash.[5][79] The PoW requires miners to find a number called a nonce, such that when the block content is hashed along with the nonce, the result is numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target.[3]:ch. 8 This proof is easy for any node in the network to verify, but extremely time-consuming to generate, as for a secure cryptographic hash, miners must try many different nonce values (usually the sequence of tested values is the ascending natural numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...[3]:ch. 8) before meeting the difficulty target.
Google Trends structures the chart to represent a relative search interest to the highest points in the chart. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term “Bitcoin” and a value of 50 means it was half as popular at that time. A score of 0 indicates that the term was less than 1% as popular as the peak. It’s amazing how the searches relating to Bitcoin have spiked in the past few years.
This is particularly problematic once you remember that all Bitcoin transactions are permanent and irreversible. It's like dealing with cash: Any transaction carried out with bitcoins can only be reversed if the person who has received them refunds them. There is no third party or a payment processor, as in the case of a debit or credit card – hence, no source of protection or appeal if there is a problem.
In early February 2014, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox,[97] suspended withdrawals citing technical issues.[98] By the end of the month, Mt. Gox had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan amid reports that 744,000 bitcoins had been stolen.[99] Months before the filing, the popularity of Mt. Gox had waned as users experienced difficulties withdrawing funds.[100]
Jump up ^ "Crib Sheet: Neptune's Brood – Charlie's Diary". www.antipope.org. Archived from the original on 14 June 2017. Retrieved 5 December 2017. I wrote Neptune's Brood in 2011. Bitcoin was obscure back then, and I figured had just enough name recognition to be a useful term for an interstellar currency: it'd clue people in that it was a networked digital currency.
Bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that funds are not tied to real-world entities but rather bitcoin addresses. Owners of bitcoin addresses are not explicitly identified, but all transactions on the blockchain are public. In addition, transactions can be linked to individuals and companies through "idioms of use" (e.g., transactions that spend coins from multiple inputs indicate that the inputs may have a common owner) and corroborating public transaction data with known information on owners of certain addresses.[111] Additionally, bitcoin exchanges, where bitcoins are traded for traditional currencies, may be required by law to collect personal information.[112]
Yesterday, we saw a major downside move below the $6,350 support in bitcoin price against the US Dollar. The BTC/USD pair declined heavily and broke the $6,240 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It traded as low as $6,202 and later started a short term correction. The price moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $6,433 high to $6,202 low.
The future of global payments could be in the early stages of significant change, with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies gaining in popularity and use. These charts can keep you up to date on Bitcoin prices and market activity, and can be a useful tool for timing purchases or sales. While prices could go down as well as up, the Bitcoin market has enormous potential, and prices seen in 2017 could eventually look like a genuine bargain.a
Nigel Dodd argues in The Social Life of Bitcoin that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social, as well as governmental, control.[124] Dodd quotes a YouTube video, with Roger Ver, Jeff Berwick, Charlie Shrem, Andreas Antonopoulos, Gavin Wood, Trace Meyer and other proponents of bitcoin reading The Declaration of Bitcoin's Independence. The declaration includes a message of crypto-anarchism with the words: "Bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment, anti-system, and anti-state. Bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian."[124][123]
"Satoshi Nakamoto" is presumed to be a pseudonym for the person or people who designed the original bitcoin protocol in 2008 and launched the network in 2009. Nakamoto was responsible for creating the majority of the official bitcoin software and was active in making modifications and posting technical information on the bitcoin forum.[12] There has been much speculation as to the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto with suspects including Dai, Szabo, and Finney – and accompanying denials.[28][29] The possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto was a computer collective in the European financial sector has also been discussed.[30]
Mining is a record-keeping service done through the use of computer processing power.[e] Miners keep the blockchain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly grouping newly broadcast transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified by recipient nodes.[64] Each block contains a SHA-256 cryptographic hash of the previous block,[64] thus linking it to the previous block and giving the blockchain its name.[3]:ch. 7[64]
This is a rather simple long term model. And perhaps the biggest question it hinges on is how much adoption will bitcoin achieve? Coming up with a value for the current price of bitcoin would involve pricing in the risk of low adoption or failure of bitcoin as a currency, which could include being displaced by one or more other digital currencies. Models often consider the velocity of money, frequently arguing that since bitcoin can support transfers that take less than an hour, the velocity of money in the future bitcoin ecosystem will be higher than the current average velocity of money. Another view on this though would be that velocity of money is not restricted by today's payment rails in any significant way and that its main determinant is the need or willingness of people to transact. Therefore, the projected velocity of money could be treated as roughly equal to its current value.
Bitcoin's blockchain can be loaded with arbitrary data. In 2018 researchers from RWTH Aachen University and Goethe University identified 1,600 files added to the blockchain, 59 of which included links to unlawful images of child exploitation, politically sensitive content, or privacy violations. "Our analysis shows that certain content, eg, illegal pornography, can render the mere possession of a blockchain illegal."[229]
It's impossible to say how much bitcoin has increased in price single its earliest incarnation, because its value back then was in the fractions of cents. A conservative estimate, based on bitcoin's current price being around $6,300 per coin, and its early price being less than $0.01, would see bitcoin's value increasing more than 1 million fold in the last decade.
“These companies are using extraordinary amounts of electricity – typically thousands of times more electricity than an average residential customer would use,” a spokesperson for the New York State Department of Public Service told Wired. “The sheer amount of electricity being used is leading to higher costs for customers in small communities because of a limited supply of low-cost hydropower.”
No one knows. Not conclusively, at any rate. Satoshi Nakamoto is the name associated with the person or group of people who released the original Bitcoin white paper in 2008 and worked on the original Bitcoin software that was released in 2009. The Bitcoin protocol requires users to enter a birthday upon signup, and we know that an individual named Satoshi Nakamoto registered and put down April 5 as a birth date. And that's about it.
The bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions.[64] It is implemented as a chain of blocks, each block containing a hash of the previous block up to the genesis block[a] of the chain. A network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software maintains the blockchain.[30]:215–219 Transactions of the form payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network using readily available software applications.
With the Bitcoin price so volatile everyone is curious. Bitcoin, the category creator of blockchain technology, is the World Wide Ledger yet extremely complicated and no one definition fully encapsulates it. By analogy it is like being able to send a gold coin via email. It is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a completely digital money.
One of the first supporters, adopters, contributor to bitcoin and receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was programmer Hal Finney. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released, and received 10 bitcoins from Nakamoto in the world's first bitcoin transaction on 12 January 2009.[21][22] Other early supporters were Wei Dai, creator of bitcoin predecessor b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bitcoin predecessor bit gold.[12]
As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s long price history should come as no surprise. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an alias for a person or group who has still not been revealed. Over the years, it has hit many highs and lows, To better understand the past of this cryptocurrency, as well as its potential in the future, take a deeper delve into its history.
In 2013 and 2014, the European Banking Authority[144] and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a United States self-regulatory organization,[145] warned that investing in bitcoins carries significant risks. Forbes named bitcoin the best investment of 2013.[146] In 2014, Bloomberg named bitcoin one of its worst investments of the year.[147] In 2015, bitcoin topped Bloomberg's currency tables.[148]
On 3 March 2014, Flexcoin announced it was closing its doors because of a hack attack that took place the day before.[211][212][213] In a statement that once occupied their homepage, they announced on 3 March 2014 that "As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss [the hack], we are closing our doors immediately."[214] Users can no longer log into the site.
As bitcoin has matured as a cryptocurrency there has been more companies warming to the idea of using various bitcoin exchange facilities to gain exposure to the volatile bitcoin price while a few websites such as reddit WordPress and overstock have begun accepting bitcoins, most major retailers have yet to take the plunge into the cryptoverse whils other pioneers have decided to create their own bitcoin forks and have listed new projects on other cryptocurrency exchanges.
There are no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger in the cloud, that – along with all Bitcoin transactions – is verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite its not being legal tender, Bitcoin charts high on popularity, and has triggered the launch of other virtual currencies collectively referred to as Altcoins.
Our first assumption is that bitcoin will derive its value both from its use as a medium of exchange and as a store of value. As a footnote to this assumption, it should be stated that bitcoin's utility as a store of value is dependent on its utility as a medium of exchange. We base this in turn on the assumption that for something to be used as a store of value it needs to have some intrinsic value, and if bitcoin does not achieve success as a medium of exchange, it will have no practical utility and thus no intrinsic value and won't be appealing as a store of value.
In June 2013, Bitcoin Foundation board member Jon Matonis wrote in Forbes that he received a warning letter from the California Department of Financial Institutions accusing the foundation of unlicensed money transmission. Matonis denied that the foundation is engaged in money transmission and said he viewed the case as "an opportunity to educate state regulators."[182]
Bitcoin mining saps energy, costly, uses more power and also the reward delays. For mining, run software, get your wallet ready and be the first to solve a cryptographic problem and you get your reward after the new blocks have been added to the blockchain.Mining is said to be successful when all the transactions are recorded in the blockchain and the new blocks are added to the blockchain.
Bitcoin continued to decline during early 2018, before eventually stabilizing at around $7,000 per coin. It has remained in the $6,000 to $7,000 range since June, and the volatility that characterised the market in 2017 and early 2018 has all but evaporated. On its 10-year anniversary, bitcoin is trading at $6,305 per coin, according to Markets Insider.
More recently, at a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill, global economist and New York University professor Nouriel Roubini said, "Crypto is the mother or father of all scams and bubbles." He called out "swindlers" who tapped into investors' fear of missing out and took them for a ride with "crappy assets that went into a bust and crash — in a matter of months — like you have not seen in any history of financial bubbles."

Chase Field will be full of visiting attractions in 2019. The Red Sox, Yankees and Cubs are coming to town. According to whispers, so is Billy Joel, a legendary musician expected to sign on for a springtime concert.
Following a May agreement with Maricopa County, the Arizona Diamondbacks now control all ancillary events staged at Chase Field. They need every revenue stream possible to compete with the Dodgers and Giants. And you can’t book big-ticket concerts in a baseball stadium without trashing a playing field of natural grass.
But the new playing surface might be the least jarring of aesthetic changes at Chase Field. Unless you like the thought of Patrick Corbin and Paul Goldschmidt in the opposing dugout when the Yankees come to Arizona.
— A quick nod to the city of Boston, which has won 11 major professional championships since 2001. That includes a life-changing event (the Red Sox breaking an 86-year curse in 2004); a 25-point comeback in the Super Bowl; an Original Six franchise that survived three seven-game series, winning the Stanley Cup with a 4-0 victory on the road; and the most jaw-dropping ending in Super Bowl history.
— No professional sport is evolving as rapidly as Major League Baseball, for better and worse. Defensive shifts are jarring. Strikeouts are soaring. Pitchers are filthy. Good teams grind for six months only to be ruthlessly eliminated in a one-game playoff.
When the Brewers went rogue in the postseason – using a starting pitcher for one batter, just to force the opponent’s hand; followed by the deployment of a star closer early in the game, for as many outs as he could eat – the future of baseball came into focus.
Teams must find a healthy balance between analytics and the organics of old-school. Those privy to groundbreaking data are often smarter than the players who must incorporate the information overload. How much is too much? Answer at your own risk.
— Villains are good, even the despicable Manny Machado. Major League Baseball seemed to take progressive steps in 2018 to encourage outrageous displays of emotion and bat-flipping passion. That’s good. The sport desperately needs more personality and less clubhouse conformity. Bring it on. The good, the bad and the ugly.
— Despite their payroll restrictions, the D-backs are in a good place. Mike Hazen is a brilliant general manager. Torey Lovullo provides great balance in the era of Big Data, a manager with charisma and great human touch. But the struggle is real.
If Hazen can peddle Zack Greinke, a new path emerges. The Braves would be a great trade partner, a team with a great defense and money to spend. They have a rich heritage of pitchers thriving on guile and great command. This could be the oasis in the desert, the way out.
If not, Paul Goldschmidt represents a franchise-altering decision. He is a revered face of the franchise, a hometown icon like Larry Fitzgerald and Shane Doan.
But Hazen has witnessed two September swoons in successive years. We have seen how a bloated contract devoted to an aging player can hamper a mid-market budget. And how much would he really be missed around here?
— J.D. Martinez should’ve bet on himself. He hit 45 home runs in 2017, including 29 after joining the Diamondbacks on July 19, accruing 72 RBI after the All-Star Break. He waited months before signing a five-year, $110 million deal with the Red Sox. He responded with a .330 batting average, 43 home runs and 130 RBI.
What would’ve happened if he came back to Arizona for one season and now a member of the lucrative 2019 free agent class?
Martinez might’ve added $100 million to his salary. And maybe we would’ve taken solace in dethroning the Dodgers, not trolling them after another World Series loss.

Alex Ferguson has been named Carling Manager of the Year after leading Manchester United to their fifth Premiership title in seven years.
Ferguson, in his 13th year at Old Trafford, picked up his fourth manager of the year accolade, regaining the title from Arsenal's Arsene Wenger.
A spokesman for the Premiership sponsors said: "His team is the perfect ambassador for the Premiership and Alex can take a good deal of credit for helping make this league the most exciting and entertaining in the world."
His side face Newcastle United in the FA Cup final on Saturday - and German giants Bayern Munich in the European Cup final on May 26.
"We have to go to Wembley and win and then Barcelona for the greatest day of our lives," Ferguson said. "We are going to enjoy ourselves."
But Ferguson admitted the 2-1 victory over Tottenham that handed the Red Devils the title had given him no end of heart-stopping moments.
"It's the nature of things at United that we make it hard work for ourselves. We did that by going a goal behind."
The turning point in the contest came at half-time, when Ferguson replaced Teddy Sheringham with Andy Cole, who scored what proved to be the winner just minutes after coming on.
Ferguson explained: "I had a feeling Andy would score. I thought we did well in the first half and I fancied our chances in the second half."
The manager also paid tribute to goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, who is leaving the club at the end of the season and played his last ever game at Old Trafford.
"I always knew when I came here that one day we would win the championship but to do it again and here at Old Trafford is brilliant," he added.
An emotional Schmeichel said: "Alex Ferguson is the top man in the world for me. I am very proud of what he said about me.
"We have won the league and go into the FA Cup with a great attitude. It is possible to win that and what comes after that we'll see," he added.

What a shame! The Scenic Railway at England's Dreamland, which is in the middle of a rebuild from head to toe, was partially destroyed in a wind storm over the weekend.
Crews have been working since this past Fall to rebuild the historic roller coaster, which dates back to 1920. The coaster continued to operate after Dreamland closed, but arson burned a part of the structure and threw it into standing-but-not-operating status in 2008. The 1920 original opening date makes the ride one of the top ten oldest still standing coasters on the planet.
A long time campaign to restore Dreamland and the Scenic Railway has been underway, finally poised to reopen the coaster and a "reimagined" Dreamland around it in 2015. Obviously the partial collapse of the ride, which appeared to be the turnaround section on the North end of the ride is a setback.
However, this news story points out that while the collapse isn't good news, it's fixable and crews will get right back to work. Take that, wind storm! Anyone who is interested in following the reconstruction of the coaster, along with learning more about the new Dreamland, can stay up to date on the park's website.

Today is the last day of this really wonderful exhibition which if you have time I encourage you to go see. I found this show very poignant and moving. Running from 6th to the 29th May 2016 at the Glen Eira City Council Gallery which is on the corner of Glen Eira and Hawthorn Roads in Caulfield (Monday to Friday 10am–5pm, Weekends 1pm–5pm).
Curated by Dr Helen Light AM, this exhibition includes works by these artists who have responded to personal and collective histories and viewpoints regarding the trauma of war, and The Holocaust in particular. The artists' interpretation of contemporary portraiture further encourages a critical engagement with ideas around memorialization and representation. This exhibition honours post-war refugees who journeyed across the globe in order to establish new lives and families. Their stories are pertinent to current debates concerning refugees and asylum seekers." -Glen Eira City Council Gallery

Sometime you only have 5 mins to see a show… while I was in Footscray having dinner(yes I normally eat very early), I rushed over to have a look at the exhibition NEWER 15 (JAN 21 – JAN 31) at the Trocadero art space. I was happy to see two artist which I mentioned in my previous post 'Monash Grad show: 2014 MADA NOW'. I know there is only one more day to see it but it is a great little show and worth seeing and experiencing. Enjoy my photos…
Happy New Year 2015! I have a few exciting posts​ coming up for 2015 and can't wait to share them with you. Expect more regular posting.
I was very lucky to have been able to go ​to ​ Canberra ​recently ​to visit family and see some amazing exhibitions. Today I want to talk about James Turrell's show "James Turrell: A Retrospective" 13 December 2014 – 8 June 2015 at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA), Canberra. This is a paid exhibition costing $20.39- $45.88. The more expensive premium tickets are for experiencing 'Perceptual cell', which I unfortunately didn't get to do because it was booked out when I was there. Also note that 'Within without' is part of the permanent collection and can be viewed for free, this work ​is ​best viewe​d​ at dawn or dusk to fully appreciate the lighting effects.
So what did I think? I really loved seeing & experiencing both his earlier works through to his more recent im​m​ersive​ works​. I also loved ​seeing​ other visitors have a sense of curiosity and wonder about the work. I loved the show so much I plan on seeing it again when I go back up to work on a commission and I hope to be able to get ​a ​ticket to the 'Perceptual cell'. ​P​remium tickets are selling out fast so ​if you​ plan on going to Canberra try and book the tickets now otherwise you might miss out.
As photos w​ere​ not allowed in the exhibition​,​ here are some images and a video provide​d​ by NGA.
Welcome to the Sparkle N Sprinkle "Sparkling Wintry Sensations” blog hop! If you hopped here by way of Marie, then you're in the right spot. If you'd like to start from the beginning and become eligible for SIX great prizes, then click here.
During the blog hop, from today through Sunday July 17, the Sparkle Team presents all of the SNS Winter Holiday stamps on a super special - 20% off! (exception is Spellbinders Combos).
Since those hot and humid days are settling in for a lot of us, I think these two cards will help to cool you down. And what better way than to stamp up some snowman cards.
This snowman is in set 340 Dancing Snowman. He is so cute and he's dancing and tipping his hat to you. Can't you picture him on one of your Christmas card designs.
I have him sitting offset on top of a blue snowflake that was made with a punch. Next, I added brushable glue to that snowflake and covered it with Sparkling Snow Glitter G1003
I embossed the card front with a snowflake embossing folder and lightly covered those embossed images with Memento Ink - Summer Sky 99620.
My next card, is another snowman also from Set 340 and this stamp is known as Top Hat - Snowman. He is framed using a frame from a Cuttlebug Emboss Plus folder. The Dotty Flakes are a great addition to this snowy card too and are also in this set.. I used Poolside EP (EP393) and Silver Lightning EP (EP262) on this card and used that swirly silver ribbon to tie it all together.
Don't forget, I might be one of “The Five” with a secondary prize, so take a minute to leave a comment to become eligible for the Grand Prize and one of the 5 secondary prizes, then hop on over to Patti's blog for more "cool" ideas.
Brrrr, Cold! I can feel the chill from the cascading ice in your pleated ribbon and sparkled die cuts! Very sweet custom designer paper with the snowflakes, and a darling framed snowman! Beautiful cards, Barbara!
I love snowmen and snowflakes. Your shimmery cards really show them off so sweetly! I like the embossed backgrounds and that glittery snowflake seems a perfect spot for your frosty little character. Great ribbon choice!
You make me wish we had snow down here. Those snowmen are too cute. I love the colors and finishing touches.
You can just feel the chill in the air with those cool light colors. Beautiful cards, Barbara. Brenda
How very cute Barbara. Love all the different elements you used on each card, especially the pleated ribbon I guess I'm going to have to put that set on my wish list. Great job. Shona
Those snowmen and all that glitter are making me feel the chill! Clicked on each card & they look even more sparkly & pretty up close! Great cards Barbara!
Oh, your Top Hat Snowman card is so cute Barbara. I really liked it. Thanks for sharing your ideas with us. Peg K.
I like the effect of the sparling snow glitter. Now I have an idea as to how to use it on my cards. Thank you for sharing.
Yes, the snowmen did cool me down, but got a couple ideas of what to use with my snowflake folder-a light touch of blue....and adding cut out snowflakes with the snowmen...neat cards.
I love your first card, Barbara! You gave me a wonderful idea in the way you brushed lightly the embossed background to make it stand out. It is as delicate as lace. Does the snowman actually cast a shadow or did you color a shadow in? Simply stunning! Thank you for sharing!
I really like your treatment of the embossed snowflakes. It's a great background. "Happy Winter" is a cheery look. I like it very much.
Snowmen are always good subject matter for holiday greetings. I certainly love what you created with these cute snowmen images. They are darling.
Very CCCCCoooolllll cards lol love all your cards they are so Beautiful. thanks for all the Ideas. love all the colors. thanks for sharing. and thanks for the chance to win. keep up the great job.
What unique way you used the ribbon wave. Snowmen are my favorite and your ideas just make me smile! Thanks for sharing.
Love the snowmen on both cards and the little touch of color on the background snowflakes of the first! Wonderful work!
You have inspired me to pull out my snowmen, glitter, and ribbon and make cards! I know it is 11 pm but the night is still young. Thank you.
You did a terrific job designing the two snowman cards. I like the backgrounds and the ribbon on your first card very much. Linda Beyer
I,m amazed at all the talent and these snowmen are just so cute and glittery...Will be in my to do file.. Thanks for the inspiration.
Where did you find that lovely silver swirly ribbon? I especially like your first card with the snowman tipping his hat & the summer sky ink on the embossed snowflake background.
You used some lovely blues on your cards! And the ribbons really add a beautiful accent! These are CUTE snowmen and make for great wintry cards!

Boy I have been busy this week. Went to Lexington, KY. to teach a class and then decided to straighten up some of my paperwork, that keeps piling up, and then I caught the cleaning bug and ....... on and on. You know, life gets in the way at times.
Well I have just received a new Sizzix die and its a mover and shaper. I had a hard time finding this one so when I finally did find it I grabbed it right up.As I was looking at the die I wasn't quite sure how I would use it and I spied a glitter paper cut out piece that was just laying around, and decided that the joy die would fit perfectly in the center of it.
Me again, Barb. Would you mind very much if I display this on the Craft-Dee BowZ blog showing off that elegant bow? Thanks.
fab creation, love the ribbon, thanks for playing along with our Anything goes challenge at CRAFTY CATZ x carol
What a stunning card. So lovely design. I like the colors and that image is super cute. Also love the CAS style design like Plastic card which make the card POP. Thanks for sharing.
It looks like we are likely to have an environmental disaster on the Gulf Coast. The off-shore oil drilling platform that blew out is spilling 5,000 barrels of oil a day and it is headed toward the shores of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Some have said that this oil spill could eclipse the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska.
I suspect the economic fallout from this disaster to far exceed the clean up costs. There are already forces driving up the price of oil due to concern about war in the Mideast. This disaster will only serve to reinforce the positions of those who don’t want us to drill for oil off our shores and say, “not in my backyard.” The net result will be that we will become even more dependant on oil from the Mideast; from Islamic nations that despise our way of life and fund terrorist groups to wage Jihad against us. So the price of oil is destined to go up stalling our economic recovery and fueling inflation; the price of oil impacts the price of everything.
There is a powerful political contingent in this country that secretly applauds the price of oil going up and even the economic crisis that will result. It is part of their agenda to bring the United States down and force us to be more subservient to the world community of nations. This is necessary to make way for the global government that mankind pins it hopes on to solve our problems. Any government that does not seek to please God will fail and the worldwide government of the Antichrist will fail spectacularly.
I can’t help but think that the reason the federal government has been slow to react to the Gulf oil spill is because president Obama is in the camp of those who want to diminish the power of the United States in order to make us more of a team player in the world. Playing this kind of politics will have consequences. The time will come when God will “destroy those who destroy the earth” (Revelation 11:18, NKJ).
This environmental disaster foreshadows even worse pollution during the Tribulation. Revelation 8:10-11 says, “a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.. many men died from the water, because it was made bitter.” While this is probably a reference to the effects of radioactive fallout from the use of nuclear weapons, it too is pollution resulting from the sin of man.
Every day something happens to make us cry out to Jesus to deliver us from the mess ungodly men are making of His creation. Indications are that it will not be long before we see that Day.
The spirit of Antichrist is not just being seen here in the United States, it is popping up everywhere. For example, it now looks like Ukraine has effectively returned to being a satellite of Russia. President Yanukovych has taken advantage of American indifference and European Union ineptitude to undo most of the pro-Western policies of his Orange Revolution predecessor, Viktor Yushchenko.
One might miss this as being the spirit of Antichrist except for a revealing tidbit in the Times OnLine article linked above: "He declared that the famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s was not genocide perpetrated by the Soviet Union but a “shared tragedy” with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan at the hands of Joseph Stalin." This kind of historical revisionism is what the Antichrist will do; "He shall speak pompous words against the Most High, shall persecute the saints of the Most High, and shall intend to change times and law" (Daniel 7:25, NKJ).
Unseen pressures are causing governments to seek bailouts from higher authorities. Of course they are not seeking deliverance from the highest authority, only human agencies. It seems like the trend toward more centralized governmental authority is becoming bolder and more urgent. It has become easier to see how a major crisis could catapult the world into embracing a world-wide governmental leader. God is in the process of giving the world over to total human authority which will culminate during the Tribulation when "authority was given him [the Antichrist] over every tribe, tongue, and nation" (Revelation 13:7).
As we experience more birth pangs heralding the proximity of the Tribulation, there will be plenty of crises for governments to take advantage of in grabbing more control over the people. The goal is total control. The day will come when "no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name" (Revelation 13:17).
I am convinced that followers of Jesus in this Age of Grace will not have to suffer through the Tribulation. Yesterday's blog pointed out how the flood of Noah's day is connected to the pouring out of God's wrath during the Tribulation. Thus one would expect Genesis to offer insight into the timing of the Rapture since it is such a significant event. And indeed it does, Genesis 5:24 says Enoch who "walked with God" was taken directly to heaven to be with the Lord ahead of the flood. Enoch was a type of the church. As Enoch was protected from God's wrath in the Flood, those who walk with Christ will be protected from God's wrath during the Tribulation.
Considering Enoch reminds me to make sure I'm walking with the Lord all the time because we don't know when Jesus will return. I certainly don't want to miss out on His coming for us.
The remains of Noah’s Ark have been seen by many people before but the site has now been documented sufficiently to be revealed to the worldwide community. A group of Chinese and Turkish evangelical explorers found the remains of the ark at 13,000 feet on Mount Ararat in eastern Turkey. This is just as one would expect from Genesis 8:4. Carbon dating of the wooden beams proves the relics are 4,800 years old, around the same time the ark would have been built.
This may be the most significant archaeological discovery of all time. Representatives of Hong Cong based Noah's Ark Ministries said the structure contained several compartments used to house animals. The structure could not have been part of a building since no established human settlement has ever been found above 11,000 feet in the vicinity. The freezing temperatures at the altitude the ark remains were found preserved the wood for just such a time as this.
It is interesting to me that the Lord would allow evidence of Noah’s Ark to be made public now. The discovery of Noah’s Ark reinforces what the Bible says about the last time God poured out his wrath on the earth and indications are that we are close to the Tribulation when God will change the earth yet again. Of course most of the world does not believe the Genesis flood was world-wide, just as they scoff at the idea that Jesus is coming back…
“Scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, and saying, ‘Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.’ For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water.” (2 Peter 3:3-6, NKJ)
The denial that Jesus is returning is coupled with the denial that God poured out His wrath on the earth by a literal world-wide flood. Besides this connection, there are a lot of similarities between the first time God poured out His wrath on the earth and the next time. Indeed, Jesus said, "as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be" (Matthew 24:37-39, NKJ).
Thank God that followers of Jesus in this Age of Grace will not have to go through the Tribulation. "For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thessalonians 5:9, NKJ). Every day there is more evidence that we do not have long to wait before we get to experience that salvation.
Unprecedented changes are occurring in the world that are subtle enough that they could easily be dismissed unless you are actively watching for signs of the Lord’s soon return. A good example of this is that more than one-third of the nation's commercial honey bee population has mysteriously disappeared.
This phenomenon is not limited to the United States but has been observed in other food exporting nations worldwide. It was in fact first documented in Israel which indicates to me that this development has special prophetic significance. Ohio State University's state honey bee specialist, James Tew said if bees are unable to pollinate the nation's crops, Americans could be forced to settle for a menu of wheat and corn.
God is the source of the diversity we enjoy and His reducing our food options foreshadows the coming Tribulation. The Third Horse of the Apocalypse symbolizes one of mankind’s afflictions after the Antichrist emerges. Revelation 6:5-6 says, “when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, ‘Come and see.’ So I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, ‘A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine’” (NKJ).
A denarius represents a day’s wages. The time is coming when war and plagues from God pouring out His wrath on the earth will result in so much scarcity that a typical day’s wages will be required to pay for a day’s food. Jesus said that an increase in famines would be a sign of His soon return in Luke 21:11. These famines will get so bad during the Tribulation that most of the world will be touched by them during this time.
Most people dismiss the idea that we will experience a famine here in America. But there is more than the disappearing honey bees that threaten our food supply. The coming war in the Mid-East will disrupt the oil supply which will drive up the cost of producing and distributing food. A major terrorist attack on this country or some other macro-economic event that crashes our economy would also make food scarcer. One of the effects of a nuclear attack is EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse) that will fry electrical systems including the ignition systems in vehicles used to transport food.
Of course, such events are unthinkable and painful to imagine for our life time. But upon considering all the trends we are seeing today and the accelerating pace of developments; it is hard not to conclude that the Bible's dramatic culmination of history can not be far off.
The mysterious disappearance of the honey bees is just a subtle foreshadowing of what is to come. I expect we’ll see increasingly less subtle signs up until the Rapture when it will be hard for people to deny that God is trying to shake the world awake.
We should definitely take notice when a leading scientist makes a prediction that is aligned with Scripture. Mankind is being prepared for a great deception involving alien disclosure…
Stephen Hawking believes that extraterrestrials are almost certain to exist but humanity should be doing all we can to avoid any contact. Hawking said, “We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn’t want to meet. I imagine they might exist in massive ships, having used up all the resources from their home planet. Such advanced aliens would perhaps become nomads, looking to conquer and colonize whatever planets they can reach.”
Despite Hawking being a materialist, his basic expectation that mankind mixing it up with extraterrestrials will not have a good outcome is consistent with the Bible. The extraterrestrials described in the Bible are angels. About a third of the angels are or will eventually be fallen angels, also known as demons (see Revelation 12:4).
Jesus told us when He returns it would be “as the days of Noah were” (Matthew 24:37, NKJ). Among the things characterizing the time preceding the worldwide flood was this: “The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown” (Genesis 6:4, NIV). The term “sons of God” is a reference to angels (see Job 1:6, 2:1). Non-corporeal beings can not have children so this must be a reference to propagating those possessed by demons.
The angels that mixed it up with mankind during this period have been incarcerated awaiting punishment… “The angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day” (Jude 1:6, NKJ). Fallen angels have gotten involved in the affairs of men in the past and they will do so again…
Jesus warned that there will be great deception during the Tribulation that will precede His return (Matthew 24:24). I believe that during this time extraterrestrials will introduce themselves to mankind. Revelation 16:13-14 says, “I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” I think it likely that these demons will masquerade as friendly aliens rallying earth to come together to thwart an impending alien invasion.
It is interesting that the Apostle John refers to the three demons as looking "like frogs." The most common depiction of alien faces have big eyes, smooth features, and no nose… "like frogs." Fallen angels are preparing mankind to have this expectation for when they formally introduce themselves. And indeed there will be an extraterrestrial invasion coming… “Immediately after the tribulation of those days… Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory” (Matthew 24:29-30, NKJ).
I could certainly see the scenario where the three friendly alien ambassadors deceive mankind into coming together at Armageddon where Jesus and the armies of heaven squelch mankind’s rebellion against God. What most of mankind on the earth at that time perceives to be “good” aliens will really be bad aliens and visa versa. “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!” (Isaiah 5:20, NKJ).
Our government is careful not to label Islam as the root cause of the terrorism radical Islamists direct against Western Civilization. Our politically correct fear of offending Muslims is on display for all to see virtually every day. A good example of this occurred on Thursday when the U.S. Army withdrew an invitation to Franklin Graham to speak at a Pentagon prayer service next month.
Ostensibly, our government is fearful of inciting the easily offended Islamists. But I suspect that this politically correct attitude has come more out of postmodernism than anything else. After all, who are we to impose our values on others? This attitude apparently also applies to people who are working hard at doing everything they can to kill Americans.
Postmodernism is a lethal doctrine. It leads to spiritual death and it will likely also lead to the physical death of many people in this country. We should not be fighting a war if we can not identify who the enemy is. I’m sure that is the conclusion our government has come to since they are actively seeking to extract our selves from Afghanistan as well as Iraq as soon as possible.
Our lack of resolve will embolden those who seek to do us harm so it is just a matter of time before we see another major terrorist attack on our country. That is if something else does not happen to keep the Islamic terrorists busy in the Middle East. I think it likely that Israel’s need to do something about Iran’s existential threat will be the only thing that keeps Islamic terrorists distracted enough to leave us alone. It does look like throwing Israel under the bus is our government's secret strategy to keep us safe from terror attacks.
I have observed so many times before that those who try to accomplish anything apart from God will end up experiencing that which they are trying to avoid. As 1Thessalonians 5:3 says, “for when they say, 'Peace and safety!' then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape” (NKJ).
In the case of postmodernists trying to appease radical Islamists, they will end up becoming subservient to those they fear offending. This is totally consistent with my conclusion from Scripture that the Antichrist will be al Mahdi, the Muslim savior. “They worshiped the beast, saying, ‘Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?’” (Revelation 13:4).
Postmodernists fear following Christ because they do not want to be “constrained” by a narrow understanding of the truth. But Jesus admonished us to “enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction” (Matthew 7:13).
While it is frustrating to see the path so many in this world is on, it is a blessing to know that Jesus has promised salvation for His followers.
Just when you think the pendulum is swinging back toward more conservative ideas, the European Union has declared travelling a human right, and is launching a scheme to subsidize vacations with taxpayers’ dollars for those too poor to afford their own trips. There appears to be no bounds to growth of government.
The governments in Europe have taxed their people about as far as they can go so to pay for any new entitlement scheme such as this they'll need to go further into debt. Western nations already have major debt and the sky has not fallen so what is the harm in just a little more debt? Of course this will inevitably lead to inflation which is really a form of hidden taxation.
It seems to me that there is a general sense among government authorities that the end is near so let's spend all we can while we can. This attitude is the fruit of materialism which denies the judgment of God and says, "If the dead do not rise, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!" (1 Corinthians 15:32, NKJ). It is an amazing thing when even unbelievers are acting like the end is near.
Despite strong resistance, maxing out on taxes while piling on as much debt as the government can get away with is the direction we are headed in the United States. A lot of people think that the Tea Party movement and general populist outrage over the excesses of our federal government will turn things around. I hope it will but I can see a scenario where a third party is formed which divides conservatives and allows the socialists to continue their schemes to rob workers of their pay and make everyone subservient to the elites running government.
There is a limit to how far God will allow the socialists to practice their corrupted form of justice. "Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth" (James 5:4).
The unchecked rise of socialism in the world is just one more reminder of how sorely we need Jesus to return. There is no reason why that Day couldn't be today.
A science fiction buff challenged me to write a science fiction story from a Christian perspective. The thought had previously crossed my mind. I think it would be a great story to depict the adventures of people during the Millennial reign of Christ. Here are some rough notes outlining a potential story line…
The story is told from the perspective of the main character, Chet, a 20-something computer whiz-kid who works for a major electronics manufacturing company, Zion Instruments. His technical wherewithal gets noticed by senior management in the company and he is asked if he’d like to be a part of an extraordinary expedition that would require a lot of travel away from home for extended periods of time. The company executive could not tell him the nature of the expedition but it would require a rigorous training program. He would only be permitted to go on the expedition if he passed the requirements of the training program.
Chet agrees to go because he was in the mood for some adventure and was getting bored with the often routine tasks required by his job. The training program at a remote desert location was mostly a physically demanding military boot camp type of training but he was part of a special group learning how to work with new technology that was rumored to be from extraterrestrial origin.
Chet perseveres through the physical part of the training because he was enamored with learning how to use the extraordinary technology that apparently had the capability to transport physical matter and communicate across vast distances in space. Chet was not a big fan of the military style discipline which was part of the training but he did come to appreciate it due to how it facilitated getting things done efficiently. Chet excelled in the technical portion of his training and was going to graduate at the top of his class.
When his training was nearing completion, he learned he needed to be interviewed by one of the Ascended Ones who would command the expedition. The Ascended Ones ran all the levels of the planetary government and all the business. Chet had gotten to know some of them since most college professors were Ascended Ones. The thing that fascinated him the most about the Ascended Ones was that it seemed like they were usually attended by one or more of the Shining Ones who were rumored to be extraterrestrials.
The Shining Ones looked like normal people but they rarely spoke, mostly they watched and served as assistants to the Ascended Ones. The Shining Ones were powerful beings that rarely displayed their power but they glowed with an outer worldly light when they did. People who provoked shining Ones to display their power were severely punished by the government.
Chet was apprehensive about his interview with the Ascended One that would command the expedition because they expected all their associates to adopt their religion and worship the King. Chet just didn’t believe the King was as Almighty as the Ascended Ones and Elders said he was. Chet knew that the Ascended Ones had an uncanny ability to know what people were thinking so you could not fool them. That was why all the judges were Ascended Ones; justice was always swift and severe. It discouraged any kind of dissent.
In the interview Chet comes clean that he did not think the King was the Creator-God but Ascended One accepted him for the expedition anyway and told him what it was… to test a star ship with a dimensional drive. But Chet learns later that there was more to the expedition than just a test flight... their mission was to explore the universe along with track down and send to the pit any of the Fallen Ones they could find. It was rumored that the Fallen Ones had scattered throughout the galaxy when the Shining Ones came to the rescue of earth during the Great War. Of course the politically correct version give the King credit for ending the Great War.
On the expedition Chet learns that the universe is teaming with life. And during the course of it and as a result of his relationships with his crew mates and the Ascended Ones leading the expedition, he comes to accept King Jesus as the Creator God and Savior of mankind.
OK, so what is the biblical basis for this? Revelation 20:6 says, "Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years" (NKJ). When Jesus comes back to establish His Millennial Kingdom, we come back with Him in our resurrected bodies. We will mix it up with mortal people who survived the Tribulation. people born during the Millennial Kingdom will need to accept Christ the same as everyone throughout history. They will have every advantage to do so with Jesus ruling from Jerusalem, a Utopian society where the government is run by resurrected saints, and with Satan bound and other fallen angels on the run.
People who follow Jesus will have a grand adventure. "He who overcomes [the deception of this world] shall inherit all things" (Revelation 21:7, NKJV). The stars are part of all things, I'm convinced we will explore them for, "the heavens declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1, NIV).
Will we be limited to viewing God’s glory in the heavens from earth? God’s glory will increase the more we know Him through His creation… "Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end" (Isaiah 9:7, NIV). All dispensations have foreshadowed aspects of what things will be like during the Eternal State. I believe the Millennial Kingdom will be the closest to what the Eternal State will be like since the fall of mankind.
God will enable us to explore the stars. Jesus promised, "I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am" (John 14:3, NIV) . Jesus promised us that we would be able to go where ever He may be; and He can go anywhere… "Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there"
Is it only science fiction to think God will enable us to explore the stars? "Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us" (Ephesians 3:20, NKJV). Sci-Fi has a propensity to come to fruition. It is the result of mankind’s God-given sense of adventure, wonder, creativity, and imagination… Is God’s imagination less than that of His image-bearers? Psalm 37:4 says, "Delight yourself also in the LORD, and He shall give you the desires of your heart" (NKJV).
Granted, there are a lot of details to fill in for this story but it is interesting to speculate what things will be like during the Millennial Kingdom. Meanwhile, we have our missions during this Age of Grace... adventure awaits!
I recently had a discussion with an associate where my faith in Christ was maligned as being too constrained. The more I thought about this, the more I was struck by the bad logic of that rationale. Truth is very constrained. A common argument for not allowing yourself to be constrained by the truth is to deny that we can know the truth.
Postmodernism denies that we can know the truth which leaves people to accept for themselves as valid what ever wild thought pops into their head. Such a perspective is attractive because it enables people to be accountable only to themselves and denies an Almighty Creator who will judge us. This perspective is what gets the nations in hot water with God during the Tribulation...
Why do the nations rage, and the people plot a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying, "Let us break Their bonds in pieces and cast away Their cords from us." He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; the LORD shall hold them in derision. (Psalm 2:1-4, NKJ)
I am convinced that people who doubt we can know the truth about God really don't want to know the truth about Him. They are happy going along as they are with whatever belief system they have manufactured for themselves since it just feels right. They have made God in their own image. This is plain and simple rebellion against God. And the consequences for holding to this philosophy is to get what they desire... separation from their Creator for eternity. "There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death" (Proverbs 14:12).
God has made the truth easily accessible to anyone who really wants to know it. The Bible is the most published book in the world by a huge margin. The Bible has been translated into more languages than any book in history. There is a reason the Bible has been so successful... the Almighty Creator wants us to know him. The first thing governmental authorities who hate God do when they come to power is make the Bible illegal; yet it is amazing how the Bible has overcome all opposition to be everywhere. There is a reason for this, God is behind it.
A common way of dismissing the Bible by skeptics who don't want to let go of their personal view of God is to say that the Bible is subject to interpretation... "who can know what it really says?" This is just more postmodern philosophy that corrupts a person's ability to think clearly. God gave us His Word so that we may know Him. Thus God would have to make the Bible understandable by the common person without needing some specially anointed intermediary to tell us what God is really saying to us.
The problem is that people just don't want to believe what God has said to us in His Word. They may accept this piece or that piece but reject the truths they don't like. Such lukewarm acknowledgement of God is worse than being a blaspheming atheist... Jesus said, "because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth" (Revelation 3:16).
My own personal discovery that I can take God's Word literally was the most liberating development I have ever experienced next to being born again. The Bible is full of prophecies that have been literally fulfilled; thus we should expect the ones yet to be fulfilled to be fulfilled literally as well. This is simple logic that anyone who honestly seeks the truth must acknowledge.
God wants us to check these things out for ourselves. "Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him!" (Psalm 34:8).
Antisemitism is another trend we can expect to see in the time leading up to the return of the Lord. A friend pointed out to me that Pastor Mark Blitz in his latest newsletter believes God raised up a volcano to shut down tourism in the U.K because the British government is attacking tourism in Israel. The British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) criticized Israel for including pictures of the Western Wall in a tourism advertisement, claiming that the holy site is technically not located within the country's borders.
Now I know a lot of skeptics will simply say this is a coincidence; but I don't believe there are coincidences with an Almighty God who is in control of His creation. Despite immediate repercussions for "touching the apple of God's eye" (Zechariah 2:8), antisemitism will increase as we get closer to the Lord's return because all nations will seek the demise of Israel... "it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a very heavy stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it" (Zechariah 12:3, NKJ).
Israel is being backed into a corner by the world and so it is just a matter of time before they will be forced to respond decisively. It amazes me that most people don't see this trend or are just content to put their head in the sand denying what is happening so that they can go about pursuing their own personal agenda that excludes any recognition of God. Of course the Bible tells us why there is such spiritual blindness in 1 Corinthians 2:14.
I get the sense that we are on the cusp of some dramatic changes among the nations of the world. Habakkuk 1:5 says, "Look among the nations and watch-- be utterly astounded! For I will work a work in your days which you would not believe, though it were told you." God is allowing the evil of antisemitism to grow so that Israel will be forced to take action. The chain of events this triggers will plunge this world into the Tribulation.
I don't look forward to the Tribulation, but I do look forward to the Rapture that has to precede it. Let the grand adventure begin!
The increase of earthquake activity is now getting hard to ignore. It hasn’t been long since I commented on the major quakes in Haiti and Chile and now we have just had another one in China. Also in the news is a major volcano eruption in Iceland that is disrupting air travel across Northern Europe.
People don’t usually think of a volcano as a type of earthquake but it is; volcanoes are caused by tectonic movements the same as earthquakes. And a shaking of the earth is always associated with volcanoes.
The message to everyone in this obvious increase in earthquake activity is that all things are not continuing as they have from the beginning (see 2 Peter 3:4). Volcanoes have the potential affect more people over a broader range than earthquakes as we are seeing in this case with the travel disruption. And ash from volcanoes has been known to significantly cool the earth by blocking the sun… God will show the global warming humanists who really controls the climate.
Volcano ash in the atmosphere also foreshadows the even greater darkness God will bring during the Tribulation. Joel 2:31 says, “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and awesome day of the LORD” (NKJ).
We are blessed to live in a time when Bible prophecy is being fulfilled. I can’t wait to see what God will do next.
It never fails to amaze me how people generally end up experiencing the very thing they are trying to avoid when they leave God out of their effort. That is the thought which occurs to me when I hear about President Obama's efforts at nuclear non-proliferation.
President Obama recently watered down our policy for using nuclear weapons and signed an arms reduction treaty with Russia. These developments were followed closely by a nuclear summit of world leaders where Obama declared that, "We've made real progress in building a safer world." So why do I get the sense that the President's rhetoric is really far from the truth? It might be because so much of what this president says has been found to be deceptive. Or that history has shown appeasement to have a poor track record of success (remember Chamberlain and WW II). Or it could be because of the age we are in, "for when they say, 'Peace and safety!' then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape" (1 Thessalonians 5:3, NKJ).
The Bible certainly makes it clear that nuclear weapons will be used. Zechariah 14:12 says, "this shall be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the people who fought against Jerusalem: their flesh shall dissolve while they stand on their feet, their eyes shall dissolve in their sockets, and their tongues shall dissolve in their mouths." Now this could be supernatural but since God most often works through natural means this certainly could be a description of nuclear weapon effects.
And consider this passage which describes an aspect of God's wrath during the Tribulation: "He opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became like blood. And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its late figs when it is shaken by a mighty wind. Then the sky receded as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place" (Revelation 6:12-14). The blast effects of nuclear weapons are like an earthquake; the sun and moon being obscured could be from dust in the atmosphere thrown up by nuclear ground bursts; ICBM warheads re-entering the earth's atmosphere at night will look like falling stars; the sky receding like a scroll could describe a mushroom cloud; and thermonuclear weapons even have the power to displace mountains and islands.
The situation today is significantly more dangerous than during the Cold War when the use of a nuclear weapon was unthinkable because it would clearly result in a massive response. We no longer have this balance of Mutually Assured Destruction. We have rogue nations like North Korea and Iran with, or about to have nukes. We have a potentially unstable government with nukes in Pakistan. The turmoil and corruption of a rapid transition to a market economy has resulted in some nukes going missing in Russia. We have the rapid growth of Islamic Jihadists who believe they have a mandate from god to kill as many infidels as they can. The world is backing Israel into a corner daring them to use their nukes preemptively against Iran. And God is removing His restraint of evil in the world.
I believe that a likely time for the Rapture would be during a nuclear exchange. Who would miss a few million Christians when the world is busy dealing with a crisis where millions more have died from war. 2 Thessalonians 2:11 says "God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie" explaining away the Rapture. People will be significantly more receptive to a superficial apologetic when they have other concerns on their minds.
In these perilous times, it helps to remember the promises of God... "For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thessalonians 5:9).
Energy companies appear to have discovered just off the Israeli Mediterranean coast the largest natural gas resource ever found. Prophecy watchers have often said that some sort of development such as this would have to happen for the Ezekiel 38-39 war to take place. We no longer have to wonder what that the hooks in the jaws of Gog will be (Ezekiel 38:4).
Ezekiel 38:13 makes it clear that coveting material wealth is the motivation of the coalition of nations that come against Israel in the "latter days," a reference to the time preceding the return of the Messiah. Israel has been blessed with technological prowess but that is less of a temptation for an attacker because it can not be exploited like mineral resources. So this discovery in Israel changes things.
However, there is yet another problem thinking we are on the verge of Ezekiel 38 being fulfilled. Ezekiel 38:11 says that Gog will seek to attack, "a land of unwalled villages... all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates" (NKJ). Since symbolic language is common in prophetic literature, I once rationalized that the security barriers in Israel today are nothing to a modern mechanized force but God put this detail in the Bible for some reason. And couple that with the fact that the nations listed in Ezekiel 38 do not include Israel's immediate neighbors. You would think they would be involved given all the rhetoric regarding the plight of the Palestinians today.
There is a growing body of prophecy watchers today saying that the problems with Ezekiel 38 being on the verge of fulfillment is explained by Psalm 83. The agenda and fate of the nations immediately adjacent to Israel are addressed in Psalm 83. I plan to study this more thoroughly in the coming few weeks but it looks very much like a Psalm 83 battle will precede Ezekiel 38. This certainly is reinforced by my recent conviction that Gog is another term for the Antichrist; besides Ezekiel 38-39, the only other reference to Gog in the Bible is Revelation 20:8, clearly a world leader that is allowed to emerge to oppose Christ.
As we can see the stage being set for the world-wide government of the Antichrist during the Tribulation, we can also see the ground-work being laid for the Ezekiel 38-39 war. I believe this war must happen during the Tribulation. This is reinforced by the fact that Israel will be living in a false peace at the beginning of the Tribulation as a result of a peace treaty guaranteed by the Antichrist (Daniel 9:27).
Since the Rapture of the true followers of Christ must occur prior to the Tribulation, we can see we're getting close. This massive gas discovery in Israel is just one more piece falling into place.
The fact that Poland has been one of the United States' closest friends has been a source of tension between them and Russia. So the Russians are doing their best to show that they were not complicit in the plane crash that killed Poland's president and other top government officials. All indications are that fog and the pilot not wanting to disrupt the schedule of his country's most important dignitaries were the causes of the accident.
Still, God is in control and could have prevented this accident so He must have allowed it to happen for a reason. We will probably not know the full scope of that reason while we're in our mortal bodies but it appears to me at least part of the reason is that this reinforces our suspicions we are in the season when God is increasingly removing His restraint on evil in this world. Jesus said in Matthew 24:6-8 that the incidence of tragedies common to this fallen world would increase in frequency and intensity like birth pangs as His return gets closer.
The Apostle Paul reinforced this when he explained to the Thessalonians that God is keeping the government of the Antichrist from rising up through the ministry of the Holy Spirit who restrains evil... "For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the way" (2 Thessalonians 2:7, NKJ).
The tragedy of losing a country's top government officials could have happened to any country. The fact that it happened to a close ally of the United States is just more evidence that God is allowing the influence of the United States to be diminished in the world. This is necessary to have a more level playing field between the nations of the world to make way for a worldwide government to emerge.
Even though God is removing His restraint on evil in the world, it doesn't mean evil has to affect us personally. Spiritual warfare is not new to followers of Christ; Ephesians 6:10-18 explains the resources God has given us "to stand against the wiles of the devil." We are entering a time when superficial faith will not be suffice... "Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man" (Luke 21:36).
The price of oil is beginning to creep up. A barrel of oil is now $87 a barrel, its highest level since October 2008 prompting concerns that triple-digit crude was once again in the offing. The pundits are saying this is because speculators are anticipating increasing demand as the world comes out of the recession. But I suspect there is another dynamic at work: fear that the supply will be disrupted.
A war in the Mideast threatens a disruption in oil supplies which honest analysts would have to conclude is inevitable. Iran is defiant in developing nuclear weapons so that they can execute their mission from Allah to rid the world of Israel. The world community of nations are unable to impose effective sanctions on Iran. And Israel will not allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon while Iran's proxies in Syria and Lebanon are itching to punish Israel for an attack on Iran's nuclear capacity. It doesn't take a political science scholar to figure out what all this will lead to.
You also have to wonder if the world is really coming out of the recession. The number of US workers claiming jobless benefits for the first time recorded an unexpected rise last week. And the economic melt-down in Greece is about to come to a head. The fundamentals that plunged us into a recession are still at work... there is massive debt everywhere with no real resolve to do anything about it. Thus many financial analysts think that conditions are ripe for a second dip recession. So this means the main reason for the price of oil going up must be jitters about supply disruption.
Jesus told us that an increase incidence of "rumors of wars" is a sign of His coming soon in Matthew 24:6. The price of oil going up in anticipation of a war disrupting supply certainly qualifies as a rumor. The only consolation for me about paying more at the pump is that we are getting closer to the Day when Jesus will come for us. It behooves us to stay ready.
The United Nations does not have a very good track record of doing anything of value. Yet the world keeps trying to improve our condition by working through this community of nations. The U.N. is the world’s great hope of being able to “beat swords into plowshares” and not have to “learn war any more.” But Micah 4:3 says that it is the Messiah that makes this possible.
The struggle over how severe the sanctions imposed on Iran should be is only the latest display of U.N. fruitlessness. You have to wonder how long the governments of the world will tolerate a powerless body like the U.N. The day is coming when they will yield their sovereignty to a strong world leader who can get things done… “These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast” (Revelation 17:13, NKJ).
The trend toward more centralized governmental power has certainly been accelerating in this country. It wouldn’t take much to see this trend extend to the nations of the world. There will be some crisis that precipitates it. The situation between Iran and Israel is likely to be the catalyst that causes the nations to cry out for a strong leader to fix our problems. The idea that we can fix our own problems without God will lead to His wrath.
I’m looking forward to the true peace between nations that will only happen when Jesus returns to rule on the earth.
As we get closer to the return of Christ, we can expect to see what 2 Timothy 3:1 calls perilous times. Since we don’t exactly have anarchy in the streets, perilous times seems like it could be far off but we are seeing political posturing that reduces our security.
President Barack Obama has declared that the United States has changed its doctrine on using nuclear weapons essentially saying that they will not be used against nations that do not possess them. This sounds good on the surface (a la, imagine a world without nukes); but it completely disregards the realities of human nature…
You have to ask yourself, does narrowing our nuclear weapon options make us safer or less safe? The answer to this question depends which side of the ideological divide you are on. I’m sure that secular humanists will think it is one step closer to world peace. But those of us with a biblical world view know that reducing the nuclear deterrent will only make this world more dangerous.
Jeremiah 17:9 says, “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?” (NKJ). The only thing that keeps wicked hearts at bay in this world is the threat and use of force. Resolving to back off on that force allows wickedness to grow bolder. There are a number of specific results I expect will be seen from Obama’s new nuclear doctrine…
This new nuclear weapons posture seeks to appease those who would like to see the demise of the United States. History shows how well appeasing despots work; it fails every time it is tried. The timing of this in the midst of growing Islamic Jihad is pretty significant. This new policy encourages Islamic Jihadists to use chemical or biological weapons to test our resolve not to punish a nation that harbors them.
I think this new policy makes Ezekiel 38-39 more likely to happen since there is less risk that the United States would intervene on behalf of Israel. Many will ask what the danger is in the Ezekiel 38 war to the United States… I think a close reading of Ezekiel 38-39 reveals that it describes a nuclear war that escalates (see especially Ezekiel 38:22 and 39:6). The reference to “fire on the coastlands” may well include the United States. The real danger of nuclear weapons is that their use by any nation is guaranteed to escalate.
President Obama’s new policy makes the US less of a military super power and thus more likely to go along with the will of the world community of nations. I’m sure many will applaud that feature. I’ll only point out that this is designed to be coupled with our reduced economic super power status to make it easier for a world government to emerge.
President Obama thinks his new nuclear policy is a step toward peace in the world. But what it does in fact is reduce our security by encouraging those with terrorist visions. This is one more sign that God’s restraint of evil is being removed. “For when they say, ‘Peace and safety!’ then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape” (1 Thessalonians 5:3).
While we have been fiddling around with domestic issues associated with the economy and health care, things have been heating up in the Mideast. Not only is there now general acknowledgement that Iran will soon be a nuclear state, Palestinians believe the peace process has reached a dead-end in the wake of Israel moving forward with building in East Jerusalem.
Jordan's King Abdullah told The Wall Street Journal that, “I think the long-term future of Israel is in jeopardy unless we solve our problems.” This could be interpreted as a threat and is somewhat of a surprise coming from a neighbor of Israel who used to be a friend. There are other indications that the relationship between Israel and Jordan has going sour.
King Abdullah must not know what God has said about the future of Israel or he wouldn’t make such ominous predictions… “Thus says the Lord GOD: ‘Surely I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, wherever they have gone, and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land; and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; they shall no longer be two nations, nor shall they ever be divided into two kingdoms again... and they shall dwell there, they, their children, and their children's children, forever” (Ezekiel 37:21-25, NKJV).
A lot of this prophecy has already been fulfilled. Jews have returned to the land of Israel from the nations where they have been dispersed. And they have been one nation in the land of their ancestors for 62 years this May. So since the first part of this prophecy has been fulfilled, we should expect the rest to be fulfilled as well; thus Israel is back in their own land to stay.
An increasing number of people think that peace in the Mideast can not be achieved without the demise of Israel. These people are opposing the will of God and will suffer His wrath as a result. Betting against God’s Word is illogical and its growing pervasiveness shows that God is giving more people over to a debased mind (Romans 1:28).
All people should need to be convinced that God’s Word is true is to look at Israel. It is amazing to me that so many reject this evidence for the veracity of the Bible to pursue their own path. “If it seems evil to you to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve… as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD” (Joshua 24:15).
The Constitution of the United States represents the rule of law and not rule by the whims of rulers. As we get closer to the world being ruled by the Antichrist, we can expect to see us moving away from the rule of law and toward more rule by decree of the king.
U.S. Representative Phil Hare (D-Ill) revealed his mindset regarding the rule of law recently in a heated exchange with his constituents. While being pressed on the complications of “Obamacare” he was asked, "Where in the Constitution?" Hare’s reply was, “I don't worry about the Constitution on this to be honest.” This is amazing to hear from one of our “lawmakers.” Phil Hare must not have really meant it when he swore to uphold the Constitution.
This kind of Freudian slip that reveals a person’s true thoughts about a matter is more evidence that the spirit of Antichrist is growing stronger in our day. Indeed seeking to change from the rule of law will be one of the character traits of the Antichrist. Daniel 7:25 says, “he shall speak pompous words against the Most High, shall persecute the saints of the Most High, and shall intend to change times and law” (NKJ). It is interesting to note that our president ran promising change. I wonder how many people would have actually voted for him if they knew what kind of change Liberal Democrats really want to make.
Jesus also told us that there would be an increasing departure from the rule of law as a sign of His soon return. Matthew 24:12 says, “because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.” There are many who do things under the auspices of caring about others but their real motives are to secure power for themselves or their political party. I look forward to the day when Jesus returns to expose such schemes for all to see.
I’m guessing that when President Obama breaks himself away from his domestic agenda to deal with foreign policy that he genuinely wants to see peace in the Mideast. But it is amazing how actions by rulers with a materialistic world view end up with exactly what they are trying to avoid.
After Israel approved 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem, President Obama diverted JDAM kits for turning bunker buster bombs into smart bombs from Israel to the US Air Force base on Diego Garcia. I’m sure this is intended to punish Israel for building in Jerusalem by discouraging them from attacking Iran. But all this does is signal to Israel that they are on their own regarding Iran so their first strike has to be effective. There were already questions that conventional bunker buster smart bombs would be effective, so this only makes it more likely that Israel will employ tactical nuclear weapons to take out Iran’s hardened targets.
Given the existential nature of the threat Iran’s nuclear weapons program represents for Israel, using nuclear weapons against it is justified. And the world will ostracize Israel for attacking Iran whether they use conventional weapons or nukes. This is all the more reason for making sure the first strike will not require a second.
There is speculation that the reason Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu recently visited President Obama was to notify him about Israel’s single-strike plan. This conjecture is reinforced by the White House stepping up efforts on getting sanctions imposed on Iran by the world community of nations in weeks rather than months. All that sanctions will do is give the nations participated in it the perception of the moral high ground; it gives them cover that they did all they could to avoid a war. Iran has sufficient support from other nations that universal sanctions will not happen and thus will not be effective. Israel knows this and will not risk waiting for the world to come around to realizing this as well.
So Israel will attack Iran in a single, multiple target strike with tactical nuclear weapons. We don’t know when but I’d expect it to happen this year, probably by summer. The world will be outraged and I expect this will likely precipitate the Ezekiel 38 nations to mass for an attack on Israel. What will the outcome be? Israel will prevail. Zechariah 12:6 says, “In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a firepan in the woodpile, and like a fiery torch in the sheaves; they shall devour all the surrounding peoples on the right hand and on the left, but Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place—Jerusalem” (NKJ).
Any time nuclear weapons are used, even for a limited tactical objective, there is high risk of escalation. And it is very likely that the Ezekiel 38-39 war which includes a nuclear exchange will be the result. Ezekiel 38:22 describes how God will devastate those who attack Israel, “I will rain down on him, on his troops, and on the many peoples who are with him, flooding rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.” I’m sure this defensive action is what will cause the world’s longest continuously inhabited city, Damascus to become “be a ruinous heap” (Isaiah 17:1). And the devastation will not be limited to the massing soldiers: “I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in security in the coastlands. Then they shall know that I am the LORD” (Ezekiel 39:6).
This war will set the stage for the Antichrist to come on the scene to clean things up. If this scenario is plausible, the Rapture must happen in conjunction with the Ezekiel 38 war. And I think that a nuclear exchange would be a likely time for the Rapture to occur. Who will miss a few millions Christians when the world has lost millions more from a nuclear war? 2 Thessalonians 2:11 reinforces the idea that God will time the Rapture in such a way that people will not give it the significance it deserves.
Developments in the Mideast bear watching… “Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near” (Luke 21:28)
In the book of Revelation, Jesus dictated letters to seven churches that existed at that time. Scholars have marveled at the order these churches were addressed because the characteristics of these churches mirror church history. Thus it is instructive to take a good look at the letter to the Laodicean church because it describes the state of Christendom in the time leading up to the end of the Church Age. Since the Laodicean error is the spirit of the Age, it would be to our advantage to really understand it so as not to contribute to it. We may be in the Laodicean church but we don't have to be Laodicean believers.
The letter to the church at Laodicea is found in Revelation 3:14-22. Jesus rebuked the church for their being lukewarm toward Him and thinking they were wealthy due to their worldly things when in fact they were very poor spiritually. Jesus admonishes the church to purchase from Him true spiritual wealth that only comes from growing in our relationship with Him along with "white garments" which represent righteous acts per Revelation 19:8 and "eye salve" so that we may see the truth with the help of the Holy Spirit per 1 Corinthians 2:14.
Clues as to the root cause of the Laodicean lukewarm-ness can be found in other passages about the final phase of the Church Age. The error of the Laodicean Church is represented by 1 Timothy 3:1-5, "But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money... having a form of godliness but denying its power" (NKJV). The end of the Church Age will be characterized by the practice of religion but being on fire in a relationship with the Creator will be lacking. The remedy for this that the Apostle Paul goes on to tell Timothy about is the need to follow true doctrine: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work" (1 Timothy 3:16-17).
Thus, the Apostle Paul says that not correctly recognizing the authority of Scripture will be a problem in the last days. He reinforces this issue in 1 Timothy 4:3-4, "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables." Bad doctrine from misinterpreting Scripture is what contributes to people being lukewarm toward Jesus. Truth resonates with people but falsehoods to support a personal agenda does not. The more people get the idea that the Bible is just a collection of sayings to support the latest wind of doctrine, the more they will ignore it and the God who inspired it.
The alternative to seeing the Bible as being inspired by God is to see it as being the story of man's search for God. People who deny the supernatural inspiration of God's Word expect the Bible to be subject to errors and contradictions since it was written by flawed men. So when they force Scripture to support their pet ideology, they ignore the contradictions pointed out to them because such discrepancies are to be expected if the Bible was authored by flawed men. But if the Bible is truly God's Word, there will be no contradictions in Scripture, only gaps in our understanding.
There is a plethora of doctrinal errors that people fall into if they don't see Scripture as being inspired by God. Some of these include salvation by works, the idea that once born again a person can lose their salvation, and the view that all people will go to heaven regardless their relationship to the Lord. Playing fast and loose with what Scripture actually says has lead to a proliferation of denominations that have divided over disputable matters and also cults that promote fundamental heresies. Among the errors that the Laodicean church has embraced in this end-phase of the Church Age is related to beginning things and end things, theistic evolution and amillennialism.
Theistic evolution is nothing more than a compromise with an anti-Christ worldview that sows doubt about the veracity of God's Word. If God really did use an evolutionary process, why didn't He make that more clear in His Word rather than force us to just accept contradictions in order to fit the human theory of evolution into Scripture? If we can't trust the Bible to be true then we end up having to trust in human authority as the final arbiter of what is true, a very dangerous practice. Indeed, the Lord warned us about this in Luke 16:31: "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead."
We are told in 2 Peter 3:3 that the end times would be characterized by scoffing about the return of Jesus. Such scoffing is growing in the church due to the the pervasiveness of of amillennialism. It is interesting to note that those who adopt this superficial, lazy approach to eschatology generally also embrace theistic evolution. The false doctrine of amillennialism effectively says Jesus will not return until He comes back to usher in the Eternal State. But proponents of this view don't believe the Eternal State will be any time soon because if it took Jesus millions of years from the beginning of creation to come the first time then it could be millions of years before He returns. This means amillennialists generally have no sense of urgency to get on with what God is calling us to do, hence their lukewarm-ness.
The practice of doubting God's Word began early in history. "Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” (Genesis 3:1). This was the tactic Satan used to tempt Eve in the Garden and this tried-and-true approach is still being used today. The Enemy of God takes advantage of our human propensity to apply our own meaning to what God has clearly told us.
We can trust that the Bible is true because of the nature of God: He is Almighty enough to have accurately given mankind His Word and preserved it through time even using His flawed subjects. We can also trust the Bible is true because of the love of God: He has provided us a way that we can know Him and know what is of Him and what is not. And there is plenty of evidence that the Bible really is from God in its fulfilled prophecy; only God can declare the end from the beginning per Isaiah 46:10.
Given that we can trust the Bible to really be God's Word, we should interpret it then using a proper orthodox exegesis. Hermeneutics is the theory and methodology of text interpretation. The terms "hermeneutics" and "exegesis" are sometimes used interchangeably. While hermeneutics includes written, verbal, and nonverbal communication, the term exegesis focuses on just the text. The word exegesis means “to lead out of” and that means the interpreter is led to make conclusions by what the text actually says.
There is another approach to interpreting Scripture known as eisegesis which is the interpretation of a passage based on a subjective, non-analytical reading. Eisegesis means “to lead into” and results in the interpreter injecting his own ideas into the text effectively making it mean whatever he wants. Obviously, all the bad doctrines of our age come from eisegesis. We are commanded in 2 Timothy 2:15 to use exegetical methods: “Present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.” An honest student of the Bible will be an exegete, allowing the text to speak for itself.
Among the ways people eisegete Scripture to make it support their favored ideology is to ignore its textual and historical context. They also ignore its literal meaning and instead apply some spiritual truth to it. This practice of spiritualization forces a text to mean something that it does not say and is the most common form of eisegesis.
The best approach to avoid eisegesis is to apply a consistent literal exegesis. This means seeing the text in a normal or plain sense first along with applying the ordinary meaning of words that are used. Yes, there is symbolism in Scripture that is typical of any good literature but it is generally easily recognized by the context and often even explained by the text itself. The Golden Rule of interpretation is this: when the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense or you'll end up with nonsense.
There is good news in the orthodox hermeneutics of literal interpretation: we can allow Scripture to interpret itself. We don't need to see the Bible as some mystical code book requiring a special decoding ring to figure out. Neither do we need some scholarly intermediary to tell us what the Bible really says. We can allow God to speak directly to us through the plan sense meaning of the Bible. Having this perspective is powerful medicine against the Laodicean spirit of lukewarm-ness because it will energize our personal Bible study and help us grow closer to the Lord.
The great error of our Age is not believing the Bible is in-errantly God's Word. But we don't have to be sucked into this dangerous doctrine. The more we appreciate the Bible as being inspired by God by studying it to know the Truth, the closer we'll grow to our Savior. And this is getting increasingly important as deception and other birth pangs of the Tribulation get more frequent and intense.
If you haven't noticed, Syria is a mess. ISIS has taken over large swaths of the country in order to kill Christians and anyone else who does not embrace their brand of radical Sunni Islam. Syria's president, Bashar Hafez al-Assad is being supported by Russia who is showing their commitment to him by building a base there and putting boots on the ground. ISIS is fighting against the Syrian regime and there are also apparently non-ISIS-aligned rebels fighting against Assad with U.S. support.
There are also Kurds in Northern Syria and Iraq that are fighting ISIS. While the Kurds are fighting ISIS, the U.S. has not been very helpful in that effort and even blocked Arab allies wanting to fly heavy weapons to aid in their fight. Our whole effort against ISIS has been lackadaisical launching a few air strikes just to say that we are dealing with the problem. The U.S. program to train rebel Syrians to fight ISIS has been a dismal failure spending $500 million to train 54 fighters of which only 4 or 5 have stayed in the fight.
You have to wonder if the U.S. really wants ISIS to be defeated. When the U.S. military pulled completely out of Iraq, a power vacuum was left that gave rise to ISIS. And President Obama no-doubt likes the fact that ISIS is fighting against the Assad regime because he still thinks Assad needs to go. Since President Obama praised the "Arab Spring" movement where Arab dictators were replaced by Muslim Brotherhood Theocracies, he must be disappointed that has not worked out in Syria. President Obama for some inexplicable reason favors the Muslim Brotherhood referring to them as a moderate alternative to more violent Islamist groups like al Qaeda and the Islamic State. Egyptian scholars have explained that while ISIS is publicly hostile to the Muslim Brotherhood, they share identical goals and support radical jihad.
Turkey has reluctantly entered the fight against ISIS but this is complicated because they are also fighting the Kurdistan Workers Party which has been calling for Kurdish autonomy. So far, the Kurds are the only group that has held their own against ISIS despite the U.S. and Turkey trying to impede their efforts. It is interesting to note that the Kurds are likely descendants of the Medes who where aligned with the Persians when they defeated ancient Babylon. Since history does repeat itself (Ecclesiastes 1:9), look for the Kurds to align themselves with Iran, they already have a common enemy in ISIS.
The Shiite Islamic Mullahs of Iran also support the Assad regime and has arranged Hezbollah to help him battle ISIS. Hezbollah, based in neighboring Lebanon is effectively the Iranian Foreign Legion. This anti-ISIS effort has no-doubt distracted Hezbollah from their mission to prepare for the inevitable war against Israel. It is likely that the Iran has pressured Russia to get involved in supporting Assad against ISIS so that Hezbollah may go back to their primary mission.
All these groups fighting in Syria has resulted in a massive flight of refugees into Europe. It also looks like ISIS is taking advantage of the refugee migration to embed more jihadists in Europe. And as you'd expect, the Obama administration wants to help Europe out by taking tens of thousands of the Syrian "migrants" into this country. It is a sign of the times that we have no problem bringing multitudes of Islamists into this country of which many are certainly ISIS jihadists while we refuse asylum for Christians fleeing the ISIS genocide.
Certainly the refugees fleeing Syria is a tragedy that the U.S. had a hand in causing through our inept foreign policy. Or maybe this was all calculated by the Obama Administration to facilitate Islam being spread throughout the Western world. The Syrian refugee crisis does show how prophecy is being fulfilled in our day... "The end of it shall be with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined" (Daniel 9:26, NKJV). There are no-doubt many villages that are now desolate in Syria due to ISIS.
It is also clear that recent developments are setting the stage for fulfillment of other end-times prophecy. Russia going into Syria shows how easily the Ezekiel 38 war against Israel will develop. And the alignment of the nations involved in the Ezekiel 38 war against Israel are already in place, principally Russia (Magog), Iran (Persia) and Turkey (Gomer and Beth Togarmah).
More stage setting is seen in the growing enclaves of Muslims in Western nations. In Daniel 2 Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon had a dream that the Prophet Daniel interpreted for him describing all the Gentile governments that would rule over Jerusalem until the Messiah established His kingdom. The vision in Nebuchadnezzar's dream was of a statue made up of different materials each representing a different Gentile government. The last government before the Messiah will come is described as being "iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay" (Daniel 2:43). The iron represents the modern-day vestiges of the Roman Empire which is Western Civilization today, and the clay represents the progeny of the Ottoman Empire which are the Muslims seeking a revival of the Islamic caliphate.
There are Westerners living in their own enclaves within Islamic countries to help them with technology, security, and to develop their oil. There have also been Muslims migrating to Western nations mostly as refugees. The Muslim communities do not assimilate into the culture of the Western nations where they live and the Westerners in their enclaves in Islamic nations do assimilate either. This is just as the Daniel 2:43 prophecy indicates, the "iron does not mix with clay."
It doesn't take a political scientist to see that Syria is a powder keg; it is just a matter of time before it explodes which means there will soon be another Mid-East war involving Israel. What better way to unite the competing Shiite-Sunni Islamic interests than to direct it against their common enemy Israel. It is likely this next war probably described in Psalm 83 will resolve the Palestinian claims on Israel once and for all. This means that Israel will be able to be at peace enough to build a temple in Jerusalem as prophesied in Daniel 9:27. This false peace is also the key condition necessary to precipitate the Ezekiel 38 war which is already being staged.
End time developments will happen faster than all of us think possible. As the Prophet Daniel indicated in Daniel 9:26, "the end of it shall be with a flood." That means we don't have long to persevere in this fallen world. The Rapture of the Church will occur prior to the Tribulation which will begin with Israel entering into a seven-year peace confirmed by the emerging world ruler (Daniel 9:27). This peace will turn out to be a false, temporary peace. With all the stage setting going on, the Tribulation period can't be far off. As Jesus told us in Revelation four times, "behold, I am coming quickly!"
Indications are that the Blessed Hope of Christians will occur soon. That is why I am moved to post an article directed to those who are left behind. My hope is that people who did not accept Jesus as their Savior during the Church Age will read this and accept Him now despite all the deception seeking to explain away the Rapture.
The term "Rapture" is derived from the Latin word "rapturo" which is translated "caught up" in English where it is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air" (NKJV). God revealed this amazing supernatural event to First Century Christians: "Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed— in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed" (1 Corinthians 15:51-52).
The idea that the Creator-God would resurrect His Church when it is complete translating living mortal people into immortal bodies is pretty fantastic. But that is what He told us He would do and if you have heard that millions of people have instantly disappeared worldwide, the Rapture is what has happened. No-doubt, this has those who are left behind scrambling to explain what has happened. Given the incredible nature of this event, the explanations will be pretty incredible as well. The question is, will you believe what you are being told by your trusted media and government officials, or will you believe what the Holy Bible has said for centuries?
Among the things the Lord Jesus Christ revealed to us when He walked the earth is that the time preceding His return would be characterized by great deception (Matthew 24:4, 11, 24). Scripture says that God Himself will provide for a "strong delusion" to help unbelievers "believe the lie" that explains away the Rapture (2 Thessalonians 2:1-12). God will do this for the same reason that Jesus spoke in parables when He was on earth, so that unbelievers determined to remain so will be able to justify their unbelief (Matthew 13:10-17).
Since this article was written prior to the Rapture, I can only speculate what the deception will be that seeks to explain away this supernatural event. But I have observed the set-up for some of the deception that will take place in the eager expectation that has been built up for contact with extraterrestrials. People who do not want to accept the Bible's explanation of human origins will be quick to embrace the news that extraterrestrials have taken an interest in the affairs of earth. If evolution happened on earth, then it could have happened anywhere in the universe and discovering that there is extraterrestrial life only corroborates the theory of evolution.
But don't fall for the lie that extraterrestrials caused the Rapture using their technology. The beings representing themselves as extraterrestrials are indeed not from this world but the Bible refers to them as fallen angels or demons. They are beings from the spiritual realm that God has allowed to have access to our physical universe to serve His purpose in deceiving those who have rejected Him.
Another possible lie that may be used to explain away the Rapture not necessarily involving aliens is that the Large Hadron Collider at CERN opened a portal which resulted in some people being thrust into another dimension or some such nonsense. Whatever explanation is used to represent the sudden disappearance of millions of people as being anything other than a supernatural act of God, know that you are being prepared for even more deception during a terrible time which Jesus called the Tribulation in Matthew 24.
The Tribulation is addressed in various places among the Old Testament prophets but is most completely described in the book of Revelation. It is a seven-year period if time when God pours out His wrath on the earth in judgment of those who have opposed Him. But even though you find yourself in this terrible period of history, you don't have to suffer the eternal consequences of rejecting God. You can accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior right now and be assured of spending eternity with Him after you die; "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved" (Acts 16:31). Death is not the worst thing that can happen to a person; everyone will exist into eternity but only those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior during this mortal life will see heaven (John 14:6); all who have rejected Jesus will be separated from Him in hell (John 5:28-30).
There may be some time between the Rapture of the Church and the Tribulation though the Bible is silent as to how much time there will be if any. The seven-year Tribulation officially begins when a world leader who emerges from a coalition of ten world rulers confirms a peace treaty with Israel (Daniel 9:27). This "covenant" enables Israel to build a temple in Jerusalem which the world ruler will enter at the midpoint of the Tribulation to declare himself god (Matthew 24:15, Daniel 8:11, 9:27, 11:31, 2 Thessalonians 2:4).
Don't allow yourself to be deceived by the man who is emerging as the world ruler. This ruler is referred to as the man of sin, son of perdition and lawless one in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-8; he is called the Beast throughout Revelation and the Antichrist in 1 John 2:18, 4:3. He will be charismatic and eloquent speaker (Daniel 7:8). But he will blaspheme our Creator-God and persecute the followers of Christ (Daniel 7:25). He will be the smoothest, most invincible political operative to ever come on the world scene (Daniel 11:21, Revelation 13:4). Most people in the world will love and follow him (Revelation 13:3). But this man is bad news; he is represented by the first horse of the Apocalypse (Revelation 6:1-2) and will preside over the destruction of many people (Daniel 8:25).
At some point during the Tribulation, the world ruler institutes an economic system that will require all users to swear allegiance to the state so that they may receive some kind of identification on their right hand or forehead. This is called the "mark of the beast" in the Bible, see Revelation 13:16-18. Taking the mark of the beast will guarantee that you will spend eternity separated from our Creator-God (Revelation 14:11). Sure, not taking the mark of the beast will force you underground and make you an enemy of the state but condemning your soul to hell for eternity will be far worse.
I will not sugar-coat your situation... most people who accept Jesus Christ as their Savior after the Rapture of the Church will be hunted down and killed as enemies of the state (Revelation 7:9-17). Remember, physical death is not the worst that can happen to you and you have a great opportunity to help others escape separation from God in hell by helping them to also see the need to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior before they succumb to taking the mark of the beast.
There will be some followers of Christ from all nations who will survive the seven years of the Tribulation. Jesus will come back at the end of the Tribulation to establish His Kingdom on earth. If you survive the Tribulation, you will be blessed to be part of the Lord's glorious Millennial Kingdom. But you shouldn't make surviving the Tribulation your goal, "for whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it" (Matthew 16:25). Instead, work to "lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" (Matthew 6:20) by helping other yield their life to Jesus before it is too late.
If you haven't yet yielded your life to Jesus yourself, you can and should take care of that right now. Pray that God would open your Heart to Him and help you to trust in Him for your salvation. Ask God to forgive you for your sin and for help to believe that Jesus paid your sin debt when He died on the cross. Acknowledge that you believe Jesus is the only Son of God and that He rose from the dead as the Bible testifies. Ask the Lord to give you strength, courage and wisdom to survive the days ahead along with His help in being a powerful witness for Him.
I recommend studying your Bible as you have time starting first with the Gospel of John, then Revelation, and the rest of the New Testament. Following that, you should read the books of the prophets and then the rest of the Old Testament. Trust in the Holy Spirit to help you understand what you need to know to help others believe God's Word. I look forward to seeing you in heaven and hearing about your grand adventure representing Jesus Christ during the most amazing time in history.
This post constitutes the notes I used for the sermon delivered at Alpine's First Baptist Church on September 6, 2015.
I have been a born-again follower of Jesus for 25 years. As many of you know, God used His prophetic Word to open my heart to Him. Consequently, I have a special interest in Bible prophecy because I know from first-hand experience that God uses Bible prophecy to help people know Him. And that is becoming even more important today as the signs of the Lord's soon return are becoming more obvious.
So I'm pleased to have an opportunity to share a message with you today. Probably the most important passage of Scripture that helps us understand Bible prophecy is known as the Olivet Discourse. This is where the disciples of Jesus asked Him when He would establish the promised kingdom of the Messiah on earth.
This is such an important passage of Scripture that the Olivet Discourse is included in all three of the Synoptic Gospels. But we will focus on Matthew 24. Note: I will use the title of Messiah a lot... "Messiah" in Hebrew and "Christ" in Greek both mean the same thing: "God's Anointed." I'll use the title Messiah to remind us that Jesus spoke in Matthew 24 to Jews for a Jewish audience. That historical perspective will help us better understand what Jesus is saying to us today.
"Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.” Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?” (NKJV)
Aren't these great questions? Don't we too want to know the answers to these questions? The disciples wanted to know when the temple would be destroyed, and they assumed that it would happen as part of the Lord establishing His kingdom on earth at the end of the Age. For them, the end of the Age they were in would mean the beginning of the promised Messianic Era when, "the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed" (Daniel 2:44). They understood this kingdom to be not just a spiritual one but a literal, physical one where the Messiah Himself would rule the earth from Jerusalem; as Isaiah 9:6 says, "the government will be upon His shoulder."
What the disciples didn't realize was that there would be another Age between the Covenant of the Law and the Messianic Age. In between there would be the New Covenant also known as the Age of Grace or the Church Age. The Apostle Paul called the Church a "great mystery" in Ephesians 5:32 because it wasn't revealed to the Old Testament prophets.
"Jesus answered and said to them: “Take heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows."
Here Jesus lists a number of things that have characterized the human condition throughout history; so how are they signs? What makes them signs is that they will increase in frequency and intensity: “All these are the beginning of sorrows” (Matthew 24:8). The Greek word translated into “sorrows” is “odin” which means birth pains. So are we living during a time when we are seeing the signs Jesus gave us increase in frequency and intensity?
False Christs: We have always had cult leaders claiming Messianic authority but the number and impact of these religious deceivers are increasing. The fastest growing religion is Islam... while the Sunni and Shiites have their disagreements, they are both expecting the Messiah called al Mahdi to unite the world under Islam. Some Muslims are saying that al Mahdi is already here, waiting in the desert until a great war between the nations where he can emerge... it is interesting that Jesus specifically warned us about those who claimed the Messiah was hiding in the desert per Matthew 24:26.
Wars: There have been more people killed in the wars of the 20th Century than all of human history up until then. So far the 21st Century has not been as deadly, but the Century is still young. Among the types of wars Jesus mentioned as signs are "nation rising against nation." The Greek word translated “nation” in this passage is “ethnos” which refers to different ethnic people groups. I used to think we were beyond racial conflicts in this country but it looks like we have regressed in recent years and worse: the stage is being set for more racial conflict.
Famine: We don't notice famines so much in our global economy but our recessions result in the same loss of wealth as famines did in the agrarian society of the 1st Century. Our recessions are getting worse and we can expect the next one that is looming to be very bad.
Pestilence: It is certainly obvious that pestilences are increasing. There are many viral infections we thought we had eradicated in this country that are making a come-back like tuberculosis, scarlet fever, measles, and whooping cough. And we have new ones like Ebola and bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics.
Earthquakes: Have you noticed that earthquakes are on the increase? The U.S. Geological Survey which archives earthquake data does document an increase in earthquakes but they blame the increase on Hydraulic Fracturing. However, their own map showing where the earthquakes occurred reveal they have been in diverse places including locations where no fracking is going on. I saw a report from April that the number of volcanoes erupting at that time was greater than the 20th Century’s yearly average.
Jesus said we should not be troubled as we see these things... Why? Because God is in control and the end is not yet. The end will come, but for those who know the Lord, we don't have to fear the end. Indeed, the end includes our redemption to Him so we should actually look forward to the end. It will be an escape from a fallen world that sorely needs Jesus to make it right.
The Apostle Paul called our escape from this sin-sick world our "blessed hope" in Titus 2:13. It is not escapist to look forward to when we will be resurrected at the Rapture. Colossians 3:2 says, "set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth." We would all be better off making our decisions with an eternal perspective. For more on the Rapture, see 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 and 1 Thessalonians 4:15-18.
“Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come."
Jesus speaks of tribulation here which is a time of persecution. In context, He is not just speaking of general tribulation which has occurred since He was first here but "The Tribulation", a specific period of time that immediately precedes His return to establish His kingdom on earth. The Tribulation is also called "the time of Jacob's Trouble" in Jeremiah 30:7 and it is also known as the 70th week of Daniel since details about it are given in Daniel 9:27. The Tribulation is a terrible 7-year period on earth when God pours out his wrath on the nations that have rejected Him and His people.
I know it's not popular to talk about God's wrath these days but that in itself is a sign of our times per 2 Peter 3:3-7. Most of the book of Revelation describes the Tribulation in detail. The good news for the Church is that we will not have to suffer through the Tribulation as we shall see later in this message... In some places of the world today, Christians are certainly already in tribulation. But this is not "The Tribulation" which will be worldwide and is identified by certain specific prophetic events some of which I'll point out. The persecution of Christian is however a sign of the Lord's soon return and these instances will increase in frequency and intensity as we approach the Tribulation.
Jesus tells us that we can expect deception to grow as we get closer to His return. As 2 Timothy 3:13 says, "evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived." You'd think the public would be wise to the mass media by now but people don't want to believe their trusted institutions are manipulating them to embrace harmful ideological narratives.
Jesus said that lawlessness will abound... I don't know if you've noticed, but the United States Constitution is being seen more and more as a "living document" that needs to be interpreted and updated for our times. The result is that rule of man is eclipsing the rule of law in this country and the consequences of that will not be pretty. The rule of law is derived from God's Law and departing from it is what oligarchies and dictatorships do.
Jesus also said, the love of many will grow cold... The more people turn away from God, the less true sacrificial love of God we're going to see.
And Jesus said the end will come after the gospel of the kingdom is preached to all the nations. We are talking a lot about the end here, what end is Jesus referring to? In context, he is talking about the end of the Age which includes the Tribulation and culminates in Jesus coming back to establish His kingdom on earth.
The gospel of the kingdom refers to God's kingdom on earth. "Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven" (Matthew 6:10). This is yet future and will happen prior to the Eternal State as we shall see...
Now the idea that Jesus is coming back to establish a kingdom on earth is a strange doctrine to many people in our day. But this was not strange to the disciples to whom Jesus was speaking. Right before Jesus ascended back to heaven in His resurrected body, the disciples asked Him, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” (Acts 1:6). They were anticipating a real physical kingdom on earth as promised throughout the Old Testament. Jesus didn't correct their expectation but said the future kingdom would happen in God's timing; "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority" (Acts 1:7). This brings to mind God's response to Daniel when he asked the meaning of the prophecies God gave him: "the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end" (Daniel 12:9). The season of the Messianic Kingdom would not be known until the generation that will see Him return. We know now that God has delayed His kingdom on earth in order to, "take out of [the Gentiles] a people for His name" per Acts 15:14.
Jesus did indeed establish a spiritual kingdom when He established the Church but this was in addition to and preceding His kingdom on earth that was promised to Israel. The Church has not replaced Israel in the promises of God as many people falsely believe... yes, we are spiritual descendants of Abraham per Galatians 3:29 but the time will come when God will again bless people through Israel: "I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in" (Romans 11:25). God is working through the Church today, but the Church Age will come to an end and then God will resume working through Israel again. God is not done with the Jews; why else has He preserved them as a distinct race of people despite their being dispersed among the nations for over 18 centuries? God preserving the Jews is clearly a fulfillment of Malachi 3:6... "for I am the Lord, I do not change; therefore you are not consumed, O sons of Jacob."
Another point of confusion about the coming Kingdom of God on earth is that it will be fulfilled by the Eternal State which is after all people will be resurrected. This future kingdom of God is called the Millennial Kingdom because it says in Revelation 20 that Christ will rule on earth for 1,000 years prior to the Eternal State. My favorite passage of the future Millennial Kingdom of Christ which proves it will not be fulfilled by the Eternal State is Isaiah 65:17-25. A careful reading of this passage reveals that there will be mortal people being born and dying during this future Age. So the new heavens and new earth of Isaiah 65 can not be the Eternal State when there will be no death per Revelation 21:4.
Now some people are OK with conflicts in Scripture like this; but I'm not. If you think the Bible is just the story of man's search for God, you would expect to find unresolved conflicts in it. But I know that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" per 2 Timothy 3:16. God is Almighty enough to have accurately given us and preserved His Word even using his flawed subjects. So if there appears to be a conflict in Scripture, it indicates that we are understanding something wrong and need to dig a little deeper to resolve the conflict. "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth" (2 Timothy 2:15). God gave us His Word so that we may know Him; you have to wonder of anyone who is content with the superficial milk of God's Word and not wanting to go deeper into the meat of it really wants to know God (1 Corinthians 3:2).
So what is the gospel of the kingdom? It is the good news that Jesus, the Prince of Peace is coming to fix this sin-sick world. This is good news for any time but especially for His followers during the Tribulation. You could say that with the Internet and satellite communications, the good news of Jesus has already been declared to all nations. But the ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy will be during the Tribulation: "Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth; to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people" (Revelation 14:6).
"Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place” (whoever reads, let him understand), “then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened."
This is a very important passage because it ties the signs the Lord gave us to watch for with the timeline that the Prophet Daniel gave us. So what is this "abomination of desolation"?
Daniel 9:20-27 describes 70 weeks of years for Israel that will culminate in the rule of Messiah on earth... The first 69 weeks of years, or 483 years extends, "From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler comes" (Daniel 9:25). This 483 years has happened in history. In Nehemiah 2:1-8 we learn that Artaxerxes, the king of Persia issued a decree allowing the Jews to restore Jerusalem in the 20th year of his reign, or in 444 BC. If you do the math here as I have, adding 483 years to 444 BC, you'll find that "the Anointed One will be put to death" on the cross in about 33 AD. You have to allow for the fact there is no "year-zero" and that scholars say our current Gregorian Calendar has a 4-6 year error in when it originally placed the birth of Christ.
Isn't amazing that God told us the exact timing that Jesus would come the first time? No wonder Jesus chastised the Jewish religious leaders for not recognizing Him as Messiah since they did not "discern the signs of the times" in Matthew 16:3.
The Prophet Daniel separates out the 70th week of years from the 69 and prophesied that the Temple would be destroyed by "the people of the ruler who will come" in Daniel 9:26. That happened in 70 AD when the Romans sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the temple. This "ruler who will come" should not be confused with the ruler called the "Anointed One" who is put to death. The "ruler who is to come" will emerge with the 70th week of Daniel: "He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’ In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him" (Daniel 9:27, NIV).
This "ruler who is to come" will confirm a covenant that enables a temple to be rebuilt in Jerusalem at the beginning of the 70th week of Daniel and he is also the one who sets up the abomination of desolation at the mid-point of Daniel's 70th week. If you haven't figured it out yet, this "ruler who is to come" is the Antichrist who will rule the earth during the 7-years of the Tribulation.
Some have said the 70th week of Daniel has already happened in history with the abomination of desolation being fulfilled by the Romans when they set up their standard of Caesar in the temple prior to tearing it down. But that would mean Daniel 9:24 has been fulfilled which lists all God will accomplish in the 70 weeks of Daniel including: "bringing in everlasting righteousness, sealing up vision and prophecy, and anointing the Most Holy" (NKJV). I don't see how anyone with the wildest stretch of the imagination could think that everlasting righteousness has been brought into this world, and Jesus, the "Most Holy" certainly has not returned yet to be anointed the King of kings over the nations.
Correctly understanding the Abomination of Desolation is important, the Prophet Daniel mentions it four times. And from 2 Thessalonians 2:4, we learn that the Antichrist will enter the temple and declare himself to be God. This is what Jesus warned His future Jewish followers about... when they see the ruler of the world commit the abomination of desolation, it is time to get out of Jerusalem.
Jesus said that following the abomination of desolation, "there will be great tribulation." The whole 70th week of Daniel is called the Tribulation, but Jesus calls the second half of it, great tribulation that would result in the end of all life on earth if allowed to continue. But Jesus ends the Tribulation when He returns. His return will not be in secret or just seen by a few; everyone on earth at the time will see His return: "all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory" (Matthew 24:30). People will morn Christ's coming because most of them will realize they bet on the wrong ruler who will be summarily defeated when Jesus comes back. But the beleaguered followers of Christ will rejoice because it means they have survived the Tribulation and will be entering the Millennial Kingdom ruled by Jesus Himself from Jerusalem.
"Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors! 34 Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place."
We know that the fig tree is a symbol of Israel per Hosea 9:10 and Joel 2:21-25. The generation that sees Israel preparing to bear fruit as a nation will be the generation that sees the return of Jesus. The fig tree of Israel started sprouting leaves when it became a nation on May 14, 1948.
There is no question that the presence of Israel in the Land God gave them is a miraculous fulfillment of prophecy. One of the most prolific prophecies in the Old Testament is that the nation of Israel will be re-established back in their land prior to the Messiah's return. It is unprecedented in history that a race of people who has been dispersed from their homeland for multiple centuries would retain their cultural identity and come back together as a nation again.
The Hebrew language was among the world's lost languages like Latin. But when the Jews needed a common language to be a nation again, they updated Hebrew with new words for our modern world. They could have chosen any number of languages that were already in use for their common language such as English which is effectively the international language of commerce. But instead, they did what is also unprecedented in history, resurrecting a dead language to the point where the average Jew on the streets of Israel can read the Old Testament scrolls in the original Hebrew in which it was written. Anyone who denies that God is fulfilling prophecy in Israel today doesn't know the Lord as well as they think they do.
Alright, Jesus told us that the generation of people who sees Israel put forth leaves in preparation for bearing fruit will be the generation that sees Him return. Church, we are that generation! We are well into the season of Israel's leaf bearing and thus about to enter the season of fruit bearing when God will resume working through Israel as his representatives on earth. This means that the Church Age is about to end.
When I discuss Bible prophecy with people, I often hear them try to justify ignoring the signs of the Lord's returning since Jesus said "of that day and hour no one knows" in Matthew 24:36. But Jesus gave us signs to watch for so that we may know the season of His return as the Apostle Paul said we should know in 1 Thessalonians 5:1.
"As the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming."
I could preach an entire message on the "days of Noah" but this morning I want to focus on the people being taken... I've heard various explanations of this passage trying to avoid the obvious one that Jesus is talking about the Rapture of the Church here. I'll just make three critical points that have convinced me Jesus is speaking of the Rapture here:
The Rapture of the Church will be a sign to the Jews; it will be such a spectacular supernatural display of the intervention of God that it will be hard for Israel to ignore (see Psalm 12:1). In 2 Thessalonians 2:11, God said he would send a strong delusion as an alternate explanation of the Rapture to facilitate people holding on to their unbelief. But God will open the hearts of the Jews to Him and they will recognize the Rapture for what it is.
The taking of people Jesus spoke of will occur in the midst of life going on routinely pretty much as we know it now. That will not be the case during the Tribulation, even during the first half. The book of Revelation describes the terrible things that will happen as part of God pouring out His wrath on the earth during the Tribulation... life can hardly be considered routine during that time.
Also, this passage is in the context of Jesus saying that no one knows the day or hour of His coming in Matthew 24:36. Thus this has to be referring to the Rapture because the Bridegroom coming for His Bride, the Church can happen at any time without warning. That is not the case when Jesus returns at least 7 years later to establish His Kingdom on earth. There are specific events that happen during the Tribulation where time-frames are given to the day for them to happen. For example, Revelation 12:6 says Israel will be supernaturally protected by God in the wilderness following the abomination of desolation for 1,260 days... this is exactly 3.5 years using the 360-day Hebrew lunar calendar.
Finally, Jesus said that we should, "watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming." Notice He did not say we should wait for His coming but that we should watch for Him. Waiting is passive, watching is active. Jesus gave us signs to know the season of his return; in order to watch, we need to be familiar with what to watch for and looking for the signs He gave us.
Why do you think Jesus commanded us to watch for His return? He wants us to live ready for Him to return. It is all too easy to put off growing in our relationship with Him, but as we see signs of His soon return, this should give us a sense of urgency to learn all we can about Him...
Studying Bible Prophecy facilitates learning about Jesus, "for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy" (Revelation 19:10). Bible prophecy does not lend itself well to just a superficial treatment; As you go deep in God's Word, you find yourself going deeper into a relationship with the Lord. The more we know about God and His ways, the better decisions we'll make in the here and now.
We should also have a sense of urgency to get on with whatever God is calling us to do. We have a window of opportunity to lay up treasure in heaven that will soon close. As Jesus said in John 9:4, "I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is coming when no one can work."
And finally, I have found Bible prophecy to be a powerful evangelistic tool. It proves that the Bible really is from God since only He can declare the end from the beginning per Isaiah 46:10. There is nothing more relevant to our world today than Bible prophecy. The more we are watching for Jesus, the more we can help ourselves and others see how the Bible helps us make sense of the crazy trajectory this world is on.
I hope everyone here will be joining us in the Rapture of the Church. If you're not secure in your relationship with Jesus, I'd urge you to take care of that before it is too late. You will have an opportunity to come to Christ after the Rapture but the Tribulation will be an especially challenging time to be a follower of Jesus. As the Apostle Paul said in 2 Corinthians 6:2, "behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation."
I'm going to conclude with a prayer then we will have a song of invitation. This will be your opportunity to come forward if you need to make a public profession of faith or would like to join our fellowship here at First Baptist.

January 11, 1988|DEBORAH CAULFIELD | Arts and entertainment reports from The Times, national and international news services and the nation's press
Actor Ian McKellan is giving all of the revenue from the London run of his hit one-man show, "Acting Shakespeare," to a treatment center for victims of the deadly disease AIDS. The Tony award-winning actor has raised $250,000 in less than three weeks from box office receipts, collections in the theater lobby, program sales, a brochure and a bar with champagne donated by Marks and Spencer department store. The show's run was extended until Jan. 30 and McKellan said in an interview that he hopes to reach his target of $540,000 by the close. The center McKellan supports is the London Lighthouse, set up in August, 1986, with a $1,260 interest-free loan from the John Paul Getty Trust, established by the American philanthropist.
Forget "Hill Street Blues," "L.A. Law" and "Hooperman." Steven Bochco is worried about producing his first TV show.
Never mind his illustrious, Emmy-studded past. The veteran writer-producer's newest creation, ABC's "Doogie Howser, M.D."--a quirky half-hour about a child prodigy who zipped over the academic hurdles to become a physician at age 16--is the first new show of the 10-series deal Bochco struck with ABC in November, 1987.
"The stakes are higher, I guess, on the first one--you want it to be a credible effort, because there are a lot of people who will be watching," Bochco said at his airy new production headquarters--informally dubbed the "Bochco Building"--on the 20th Century Fox lot. The show debuts Tuesday at 8:30 p.m. and then will be seen Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m.
In an era when multiple-series deals with networks have fallen out of vogue, Bochco believes the success or failure of his first few series could affect the future of such deals for other producers.
"I would hope that, in the course of the next few years, ABC is going to look as though they were very smart," Bochco said. "If we don't do well, I guess I don't look so smart."
In 1987, Bochco turned down an offer from CBS to become president of its TV entertainment division and chose instead to accept ABC's offer of a six-year, seven-series deal with three more non-exclusive commitments over a flexible period of several years. At the time, Bochco's attorney said ABC paid Bochco in the ballpark of $10 million.
A few months later, Bochco announced that he would produce the 10 ABC series at Fox--for whom he already was making "L.A. Law"--and that Fox would get worldwide distribution rights to the shows.
If ABC doesn't like a Bochco series, he can sell it elsewhere, and Bochco can also take a series to another network first--but such a decision would result in substantial penalties for whichever party breaks the agreement.
"I like that aspect of the deal, because it keeps everybody on their toes," Bochco said. "Quite honestly, I don't see that happening. We were in easy accord on this first one. We're both a little nervous about the second one, just because it's an odd, different sort of hour."
Bochco, grinning widely, refuses any further details about his second ABC series, except to say: "Well, I don't know how odd it is, but it's complicated, and I'm not sure it's feasible, and nobody's ever done anything quite like it, so we both had anxieties about it for different reasons."
Anxiety doesn't seem to be leaving Bochco much the worse for wear these days, however. Although the "Bochco Building" is still so brand-new it has entrances and exits that don't lead anywhere, it seems more like a resort hotel than an office complex: "I wanted it to feel like a home, not like every building on every studio lot I've ever worked on, a warren of little hallways," Bochco said with a shudder.
And even with new-show jitters, Bochco seems as happy as a housecat here. Even though it's a new project, "Doogie Howser" remains all in the family, sort of: Scott Goldstein, producer of "L.A. Law" from 1986 to 1989, has moved over to produce "Doogie" this season; David Kelley, taking over from Bochco as "L.A. Law" executive producer, co-created "Doogie" and will serve as a creative consultant, as will Rick Wallace, now co-executive producer of "L.A. Law." Actor James B. Sikking, who portrays Doogie's father, is a "Hill Street Blues" veteran.
Bochco said his idea to develop a series about a child prodigy existed long before the deal with ABC. Bochco's father was a child prodigy who went on to become a concert violinist. An animated version of a 50-year-old photograph of Bochco's father playing the violin is part of the Steven Bochco Productions logo, which will appear at the end of each "Doogie Howser" episode.
"When I was growing up, he was just my dad," Bochco said. "He was 43 when I was born, so by the time I was a young child, my dad was 50 years old. Prodigy didn't mean anything to me. All I knew was I had a dad who was a violinist--that's what he did professionally.
"But he was also a guy who was a gifted portrait painter, self-taught, a wonderful architect, self-taught, a wonderful designer and master-builder, a voracious reader. That is my enduring memory of my dad, with a book in his hands. He audited medical school when he was a 20-year-old kid, because he had a bunch of friends who were medical students."
Bochco's interest was solidified by a magazine article on such children. "I thought, what if a kid's prodigious ability, through a certain set of circumstances, were focused almost obsessively on medicine?"
WASHINGTON — From a British schoolteacher who lost his life savings to a Beverly Hills millionaire who fears he may lose his home, claims are rolling in for the millions forfeited by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Gerald Bolton, a Briton living in Qatar, says he had about $100,000 in a savings account at BCCI's home branch in Luxembourg.
"This humble petitioner . . . pleads with the court to enable me to retrieve the money I have deposited," Bolton wrote. "This is my entire life savings from my work teaching English to Arab students here in the Middle East."
Bolton and other individuals, banks and private companies hope to persuade a federal judge to grant them a share of the BCCI money.
BCCI agreed to turn over $550 million in U.S. assets when it pleaded guilty in January to a federal racketeering charge. The bank's international operation was taken over last July by liquidators after an audit uncovered widespread fraud.
Under the plea agreement, about half of the money would be put in a contingency fund to shore up financially troubled U.S. banks that BCCI now admits it illegally controlled. The rest would go into a worldwide fund to compensate depositors and other investors caught up in BCCI's demise.
But first, federal law on forfeiture of racketeering proceeds allows people to claim a legal interest in the money.
U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green, who approved the plea agreement, must decide if these individuals and companies may recover their money now or whether they must get in line with all the other worldwide claimants--who are seeking nearly $30 billion against assets of $2 billion.
S.A. Reza Shekarchian of Beverly Hills, said BCCI holds a net $1.2 million of his money and a lien on his family residence and business property.
"The Shekarchians are one of the innocent victims whose economic security has been greatly distressed and afflicted by the fraud and mismanagement of BCCI," his court papers said.
Shekarchian said he deposited the money with BCCI in London to secure a line of credit at the Los Angeles branch for real estate and business investments.
One claim was a class-action suit filed in California on behalf of all BCCI individual depositors. Their lawyer, William Lerach, said that would be about 1 million people with claims "certainly in excess of $5 billion."
Some of those making claims said they were victims of mistakes or bad timing around the time of the July 5, 1991, international takeover of BCCI.
The World Bank said it sent $1.65 million to the government of Pakistan as a loan to modernize its telecommunications system. Unfortunately, the money was sent to a BCCI Overseas branch at Security Pacific International Bank in New York on July 15--10 days after the takeover. The money has been frozen ever since.
"Those racketeering crimes (admitted by BCCI) were completely unrelated to the Pakistan development loan" and the money should be released, the World Bank's claim said.
The Congregation of the Holy Ghost, a Roman Catholic missionary group based in Bethel, Pa., said it was sending $10,000 to the Middle East to buy auto parts for missionaries in Africa. But its bank transferred the money to a BCCI branch at the Bank of New York on July 17--and now it can't get it back, according to the claim.
"It was just incredible bad timing" that the money was sent through BCCI after the takeover, Father Donald McEachin, the group's treasurer, said in an interview. "I feel bad for our guys, who are out not only the money but the essential car parts."
"We're a very small operation. We don't know anything about international banking," McEachin said. "BCCI to us is just another bank."
The New York office of Britain's Barclays Bank said it accidentally made a duplicate payment of $470,441 to a BCCI branch at Security Pacific International Bank in New York on July 3, two days before the takeover.
Then, Barclays mistakenly sent another $14,448 to a BCCI account in New York in August, when the money was intended to go to another bank, its claim said.
Meanwhile, Security Pacific International--which was required to turn over the money it held in BCCI Overseas accounts--filed papers intended to preserve its rights if it is sued by the depositors to those accounts.
The situation is "unpleasant but unavoidable," said Security Pacific's attorney, Franklin Bloomer. "What we've been looking for is protection from multiple liability."
The Central Bank of Paraguay said it is worried it may lose $640,000 deposited in a BCCI Overseas-Paraguay account in Miami.
The BCCI-Paraguay branch was not involved in any criminal activity and should not have to turn over its money, said the Central Bank, which complained about the whole U.S. forfeiture procedure.
"The very countries whose regulations for years failed to police adequately the BCCI empire are now being allowed to preside over its remains," the Central Bank said. "Other countries around the world are also simply trying to protect their citizens."

What's The Frequency, Gen X? : These guys don't look or sound like many talk-radio hosts, but that's the point. Tavis Smily (just turned 30) and Ruben Navarrette (he's 27) are trying to connect with listeners their age--on the issues. - latimes
What's The Frequency, Gen X? : These guys don't look or sound like many talk-radio hosts, but that's the point. Tavis Smily (just turned 30) and Ruben Navarrette (he's 27) are trying to connect with listeners their age--on the issues.
The topic under discussion was the deteriorating quality of a university education, but Jim, a student at UCLA, was calling to complain about something else. It was unfair, he said, that he was unable to get into UC Berkeley with a 3.5 grade-point average when a Latino friend got in with a 3.0.
"I'll tell you what," Jim said. "I would have had a lot better chance if we didn't have these stupid quotas for these minorities who haven't done as well as I have in high school, who haven't put in the time and the guts. . . . It's a fact that they have affirmative-action advantages. It's ridiculous."
The co-hosts at KMPC-AM (710) weren't buying it. "You call it ridiculous," said Tavis Smiley, "but do you understand why institutions are mandated and challenged to enlist students of color at these campuses? Do you understand that at all?"
His colleague, Ruben Navarrette, jumped in: "One of the reasons it's important to do that, Jim, is because we're trying to produce leaders of the future. And if you've studied anything at UCLA about demographic changes, you know that there are now many more people in Los Angeles who are Latino, and if you're producing leadership for the next century, doesn't it make sense to try to produce a leadership class that looks like America?"
A typical talk-radio exchange? Not exactly. It was a serious discussion, it was a topic that pertained to young people, and the hosts were members of minority groups.
The idea alone sounds like the premise for a "Saturday Night Live" sketch, one that might feature callers debating the merits of a Nine Inch Nails concert, analyzing the most recent episode of "Melrose Place" or discussing the optimum places to meet members of the opposite sex.
But Ruben Navarrette, 27, and Tavis Smiley, who turned 30 in September, are catering to no one's stereotypes--not about Generation X, not about minorities, not about talk radio. As the hosts of "Twentysomething Talk," heard on KMPC weeknights from 9 to midnight and Sundays 7-10 p.m., they are men with a mission.
"We're trying to do three things that have never been done before: We're trying to bring in people of color, we're trying to bring in younger people, and we're trying to bring them into a thoughtful kind of medium," Smiley said. "I think we have the most difficult challenges facing us of any talk show in the city."
He's right. Talk radio, in Southern California as throughout the country, is chiefly the province of middle-aged white hosts who cater to an older audience, increasingly by emphasizing entertainment and sensation over serious discussion of the major issues of the day. It's not that younger listeners are disregarded, but rather that they are thought to be more interested in spending their radio time with music stations.
But Capital Cities Communications already had a traditional talk station in venerable KABC-AM (790) when it bought KMPC last May. So the company decided to go after a different crowd. Smiley and Navarrette were a perfect pairing for what it had in mind.
"We thought it would be an interesting, novel thing to have a black and a Hispanic discussing all the issues--not just generational issues, but what's going on in the community," said George Green, general manager of KABC and KMPC.
The three-pronged challenge is one that the young hosts are more than willing to tackle--and for which they are more than qualified. No self-absorbed slackers they.
By 26, Navarrette had written a book chronicling his experiences as a Mexican American at Harvard. Within the next five to 10 years, he plans to run for Congress in the San Joaquin Valley, the area where he grew up.
Smiley, a former aide to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, was already running for office, on the Los Angeles City Council, when he was 26. He finished third in a field of 15. Since then, he has had several radio commentary jobs and still has a daily syndicated 60-second commentary, "The Smiley Report," on radio stations across the country. He also is considering another run for public office.
"We want to get young people thinking and talking," Smiley says of their goal with the radio show. "I think too often we go through life in our younger stages not thinking that social or political issues are going to impact us.
"If you're 22 or 28, you're not interested necessarily in this health-care debate--until you realize you're going to be the ones paying for it. . . . We need to be concerned about that, and we need to be talking about it, for our own sake. And beyond that, we have older Americans eavesdropping on our conversations every night, maybe even participating. I think it's important that older Americans hear what we have to say."

Bruce Hoffman’s piece on “Defining Terrorism” is a thought-provoking essay, raising many questions regarding the nature and goals of terrorists as he moves towards a workable definition. Hoffman ultimately accepts that terrorism cannot be clearly defined, settling instead to close his essay with a section titled “Distinctions as a Path to Definition.” According to Hoffman, the most effective way to define terrorists is by understanding what they are not.
Particularly, I am interested in Hoffman’s final distinction: he points out that the terrorist is “not pursuing perfectly egocentric goals”, further identifying the terrorist as “fundamentally a violent intellectual.” This classification piqued my interest, and I am curious whether Hoffman would assert this stance today. Ultimately that would depend on how he defines an intellectual. Is one an intellectual simply because they are motivated by a cause? That seems to be Hoffman’s logic. Ignoring the fact that defining an intellectual in that manner seems odd, I am confident Hoffman would hold to his position under that definition.
Hoffman seems to imply in the same paragraph that the only difference between a political extremist and a terrorist is violence; I find that a bit dramatic and far-fetched, as it seems to leave the entire psychological element of terrorism, referenced by Hoffman earlier in his essay, out of the picture.
Writing prior to the 9/11 attacks, Hoffman’s analysis predates the nature of terrorism as it has evolved over the last 17 years since his writing. I am curious whether the events of 9/11 and the changes terrorism (and counterterrorism) have witnessed since that attack have changed Hoffman’s classification.

Hundreds of Air New Zealand Passengers bound for Auckland were stuck in Hawaii for two nights due to a faulty plane system, reports the Daily Mail, and for their troubles, each passenger was awarded $1000 New Zealand dollars, ($850) in cash.
Pilots aboard the the Boeing 767-300 noticed a faulty indication system on flight NZ09, originally scheduled to depart the U.S.
After repeated attempts to address the issue, the Airline was forced to cancel multiple rescheduled takeoffs and issued an apology to all passengers affected by unusual delay.
Due to the lengthy nature of this disruption, the difficulty we've experienced in adequately communicating with customers and the fact we have repeatedly let them down, we have made the decision that in addition to our unreserved apology we will also be compensating each customer $1000 in either cash or Airpoints Dollars, Carrie Hurihanganui, general manager of customer experience told passengers. We are incredibly sorry to have let our customers down and will conduct a full review to see how we could have managed this disruption better.
According to the customer service rep, about half of the passengers from the original NZ09 flight were transferred to a Hawaiian Airlines Flight headed to Auckland.

In November, Betsy Beer will be available for first and business class passengers on Flights between Hong Kong and New Zealand. "The inclusion of "Dragon Eye" fruit is a unique characteristic of the beverage.

Has anyone been allowed to (or wanted to) keep the piece of skull after decompression surgery? I want to for some reason.
When I was in elementary school I kept my tonsils in a jar after I had them removed. My sister brought them to school for show and tell. She dropped the jar on the school bus and they were last seen rolling around on the floor. I'm just saying.
Another thought for those skull parts....if you suspect you may be part of a family in which there is a genetic link for Chiari, volunteer to participate in the genetics studies that are being done right now at Duke. I heard a presentation on this and collecting DNA from bone tissue from the head was mentioned. Of course, you would have to enroll, etc. But it is really not a big deal if you meet the criteria and your doctor is willing to send info.
Most importedly, it is a very constructive way for us to really do something useful to help future generations avoid the pain and suffering we are experiencing. If they can find the chromosomal markers for Chiari, that could lead to a much better understanding of the condition and future treatments, cures, etc.
If you have already had surgery but have now found that another family member has CM, you can still apply to be part of the study. They just use blood tests and you don't have to go to Duke or travel or anything.

Not yet but I hope to be. I have talked with the research coordinator and now have to check some things out with my family.
Now that I think about it, it might be handy to have that piece of bone in my cabinet too so I would have proof that I am losing my mind....
I asked about this today and was told I wouldn't have a skull fragment, that they grind the skull into a fine powder while removing it with a drill. So I guess there's multiple ways to do this surgery.
I guess it depends on how much bone they have to remove based on the location and size of your herniation. My skull fragment measures approx. 2-1/2" x 2". They decided to cut it out in one piece rather than sanding it off a little at a time. There are as many different ways to do surgery as there are surgeons.

Realpolitik – Mr Modi acknowledged the massive power of media houses more than once.

Intensive longitudinal data have become increasingly prevalent in empirical studies. For instance, in the study of human emotions, researchers often adopt ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures to obtain responses reflecting individual’s ongoing emotional states “in the moment.” Common approaches for analyzing longitudinal data are not directly suited for handling the noisy, high-dimensional nature and diverse time scales of EMA affect data. The proposed project seeks to (1) develop and test frequentist and Bayesian estimation techniques for fitting discrete- and continuous-time dynamic models to intensive longitudinal data, (2) extend the models and estimation procedures to accommodate regime-switching processes, namely, processes that are characterized by phases with homogeneous dynamical structures, (3) conduct local influence analysis to assess the sensitivity of the proposed modeling procedures, and (4) find ways to improve the robustness of the estimation techniques in the presence of missing data. This project is supported by funding from the National Science Foundation.

SIMON WHITLOCK enjoyed his best run of the year so far as he reached the final of the inaugural Danish Darts Open in Copenhagen on Sunday.
The former European Champion defeated Jermaine Wattimena, Ricky Evans, Mervyn King and Steve West before being denied a second European Tour title by Mensur Suljovic in the decider.
The run was well timed by Whitlock, who feels like he his finding his best form ahead of next month’s World Matchplay.
“That bodes well for the second half of the year with all the big TV tournaments coming up. I’m really excited about what I can achieve.”
Whitlock will next be in action at a double-header of Players Championship events in Barnsley on Tuesday and Wednesday before heading to Hamburg for the ninth European Tour event of 2018 next weekend.
West also impressed with a second run to a semi-final in three weeks, while Joe Cullen made it an incredible six quarter-finals from eight European Tour events this year.
(Via Nodwick) And it will not be a light romantic comedy set in modern Nebraska. Do you think that I jest? Go look at what they did to Exit To Eden if you want to see what Hollywood can do to a book. Not going to be a problem here:
The main issues that financiers have had is that del Toro needed his movie to be a period film, and he needed it to be R-rated. Movies like that are really hard to market, and so studios, such as Universal in this case, haven’t wanted to pay for it.
So why would Universal decide that they were finally ready to take the risk? One name: James Cameron. According to the reports, the Avatar director has decided to back del Toro’s vision and come on as a producer. Not only that, but the movie will be in 3D, and there’s no one else on the planet right now that you want in your corner when it comes to 3D more than James Cameron. They even plan to start pre-production immediately with hopes of filming some time next summer.
Cameron’s a bit of a… wonderful person who is going to help put one of Lovecraft’s most epic vistas on the screen… but he knows how to do big, and big is what you need when you’re doing a horror/adventure story about a lost, pre-human Antarctic city. There’s been a real dearth of big-screen Mythos movies that have been mainstream successes – I count three, in fact, and none of them are officially Lovecraft films* – so I’m kind of hoping that this one takes off.
All right, I’ll bite. Alien is pretty obvious, and Pleasantville…I can kind of see. But United 93, part of the Mythos? Really?

Since discovering you and your work at RedState.com I’ve become something of a fan. Not obsessed, mind you, but very appreciative of your very fine work. I have also noticed that we have some things in common: you are a geek and I am a geek, though not nearly as accomplished as you; You are a Political Geek and I am a political geek, same caveat and, finally, you appear to love Movies and Music at least as much as I do. No, I’m not about to ask you to go steady so you can relax.
But I do have a project that I think is particularly suited to your suite of talents: “The 17th Amendment: The case for its repeal.”
This particular amendment is, IMHO, the product of an enormously misinformed public by a horde of leftist “Muckraking” so-called journalists.
I’ve often argued for giving the state legislatures back the option to pick Senators, but I’ve never come up with a practical method for getting that done.
We have to reverse engineer the way it got done to begin with. YOU have the talent and writing skill to begin to build the case. There already exists an undercurrent of thought and feelings that something is not quite right with the universe in that there is this great imbalance of power between what the Founders envisioned and implemented and what has come to be with the adoption of Article the Seventeenth.
Think of this as The New Federalist Papers. Channel Madison. Use the Force. No, Seriously. This will be the hardest thing you will ever do but whenever I read your stuff and see the wit and intelligence that goes into it my faith that it can be done is renewed.
Ok, I’ll bite. Alien I can definately see, but I’m fascinated where you find the mythos tie in to the other two. I live for digging out Lovecraft references in literature (or as my wife puts it, ‘shut up about it already’) but Pleasantville and Flight 93 has me stumped there…

Samsung staged a First Look event at the American Stock Exchange building in New York City yesterday to introduce new, forward-looking features for its flagship QLED 4K/Ultra HD (UHD) TVs and showcase its 2018 lineup of home entertainment products, most of which will be available this month.
Front and center were two models previewed in January at CES 2018: The top-of-the-line Q9F QLED 4K TV, featuring a full-array local dimming backlight, and its state-of-the-art sibling, the Q9S 8K set, which uses proprietary AI (artificial intelligence) scaling to produce stunning 8K images from 4K, 1080p, and even standard-definition content. The processing improves scaling over previous systems by comparing images to a database of "reference” content that’s loaded into the TV and constantly updated.
Several new features for the QLED TV series were introduced, including a unique "ambient mode” that plays music and displays news headlines (through a partnership with The New York Times), traffic reports, weather updates, and other useful information throughout the day when the TV is "turned off.” The mode also has a décor-matching setting for wall-mounted TVs that replicates the pattern on the wall behind the TV to create a visual effect that makes it appear to blend into the wall. This trick is accomplished via a photo the user takes of the TV against whatever background is on the wall; the TV then fills the screen with a replica of the wall so that only the frame is noticeable.
The new 2018 QLED TVs also boast what Samsung calls One Invisible Connection, a slim cable up to 50-feet long that carries both power and AV data to the TV to allow for more flexible placement. The connector is available on TVs above the Q7, except for the Q8F.
Several updated smart TV capabilities — including Samsung’s voice-based virtual assistant Bixby, a new SmartThings app, and a new intuitive Universal Guide — are designed to make it easier to set up a QLED TV and navigate across streaming services and live TV to find content.
Samsung also announced The Wall, a massive 146-inch (diagonal) modular MicroLED TV shown in prototype form at CES 2018, will ship in August. The self-emitting TV uses tiny micrometer-scale LEDs.
The HW-N950 soundbar supports Dolby Atmos 7.1.4 surround sound with up-firing and side-firing drivers, while the HW-N650 targets gamers with Acoustic Beam Technology designed to put players in the middle of the action. The HW-NW700 is a wall-mountable sidebar designed to complement Samsung’s QLED TVs and the VL550 speaker comes with a wireless voice-control module/volume dial that attaches to any metallic surface so you can control the speaker with voice commands or by simply turning the dial.

I’ve been breeding using the ultra breeding tree. However, I do not get 2 eggs. So, what does ultra breeding tree exactly do? I am sure that there are no eggs in my hatchery every time i use the ultra breeding tree
The fact that you have the artwork for EVERY habitat at EVERY level is AWESOME!! I love that I can see what my habitats are going to look like before they are upgraded!! THANK YOU SO MUCH, for putting all of your time and effort into making this site simply amazing!! You my friend… ROCK!! Thanks a million times over!! 😀 <3
I am now at level 230 I’ve been fighting that cookie monster and those other two fairies with the one legendary monsters I have been winning the fight about 15 times now but because I don’t get it at three-star completely I don’t win nothing so all those 15 times I beaten them . To me is not a winning it’s really a losing because I’ve lost all the money I lost almost all my Argold and I didn’t get nothing back in return so it takes away all the enthusiasm to want to fight and even though I get very close to a three star that’s still not enough . I am very discouraged I have legendary monsters and at one time is show that you can have to Litateri monsters on their habitat now they changed it you can only have one end they say good news if you upgraded to four levels and you will be able to put 4 legendary monsters on their habitat . Why did they change the capacity on the legendary habitat from 2 to 1 that’s weird to me because that’s costing us more money every time you upgrade it it cost is 5 million so if you upgrade it four times now you’re into like a 40 million who has that kind of money I don’t have the money to keep upgrading all the habitat for legendary monsters and they’re winning fighting that game at level 230 I lost all my money on my gold I have to start all over again and that’s gonna take a while and I’m even embarrassed to say how much I spent I feel like they just want to get money off of us end and not give us much in return I feel like I’ve been cheated , it comes down to this I didn’t win any flights I lost the fight I’ll because I didn’t get as Stakely three stars but I use it every single tool to win and I beat them but it really means I lost so I’m not going to be going back to fight again so I can lose gold and gam stones which equals to money to bed and I’m playing fair game I’m disappointed I really love playing this game is very challenging I like it I hope no one gets upset about what I wrote is just what I feel and what I think is going on ,
The higher you go on the habitat and the temple the money just goes higher and higher and higher and then you run out of money what do you do then?
Just a noob question here. I just started this game(re-entered my Dragon City lol) and is stucked currently at level 17 of the adventure map. I do not have any rares or epics yet. Any ideas to proceed on forward??Do i really need to get epics or rares to beat that mission? Thanks in advance for any tips that come along the way
How the hell it is possible to a lvl 29 player to have over 50 level monster ? HOW just lost 2 arena matches cause of some players under 30 have lvl 50+ monsters
what’s the use of this when u can do some maths and figure out what’s what cost and all that, but establishing the breeding calculator is correct but this does not make sense!!!

Cars, Trucks, Sports, Bugs, and loud laughter as someone farts. Help I need a little more pink in my life!
I absolutely love the holiday season with all the fun things to do. One of my kids favorite things to do is to help create an advent calendar or if they don't help make it just to help eat the treats! This year I created one with my sister-in-laws, it was so much fun to make and we are just loving it.
Usually I add a scripture or a thought on Christ to each day but this year I only had time to put treats in it. So tonight for Family Night I'm going to allow each of my boys to help me fill the calendar with thoughts or kind deeds that they can do for each other or scripture stories that they love to hear told. It always seems to be more meaningful when you help so I'm trying to make this years calendar more meaningful for them.
Another great idea is to choose a family or friend to do the 12 days of Christmas for and to think of ideas to give them on each day. I've been pondering this for a few weeks now trying to decide what family we can do something for. So tonight is the night we choose the family and then we'll spend this week getting preparations done so that we just have to deliver something every night and it doesn't turn into a big hassle.
So I went to a little craft type boutique today with one of my friends and let me just tell you it was awesome! They had bags, shirts, jewelry, watches, and tons and tons of baby stuff. Mostly for little girls, which I have none of, but my sister-in-law just had her first girl. Soooooooooo you know what that means, yep presents from the favorite aunt (that's me in case you were confused *S*).
I also got a cool watch but the lady didn't have the right fit so she is going to make me one and mail it on Monday, I can't wait to get it. I've been looking at the for a while but hadn't found one I loved until today! Yipee for craft fairs!
So I know my blog has been a little lonely these days or should I say weeks on no more like months. I'd do the cross out thing but then I'd have to call my sister to figure out how since it's been so long! :) I have another family blog and I haven't been posting there much either. I guess it's because of the holidays and trying to get everything ready plus I just got put in charge of the girls youth group at my church so I help with all their activities and teach their class on Sundays. It's the best place to be in the world since they are awesome and so much fun but it's really busy and I am just not getting to everything, if you don't believe me you should take a look at my laundry room.

Morning Glory Blog will be taking a brief hiatus and will return at the end of June with plenty of wedding day/honeymoon photos and stories to share!
First off, I want to apologize for my lack of blog posts the past few weeks. Feeling neurotic about making all my wedding decor myself didn’t seem like a big job….until I actually started making everything myself. It’s been a big job, but as I near the finish, I promise to post more frequently!

From the time of its inception, the U.S. Armed Forces played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the founders of the United States were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played a critical role in the American Civil War, continuing to serve as the armed forces of the United States, although a number of its officers resigned to join the military of the Confederate States. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework. The Act established the National Military Establishment, headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and the National Security Council. It was amended in 1949, renaming the National Military Establishment the Department of Defense, and merged the cabinet-level Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force, into the Department of Defense.
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test is used by each branch of the military to determine a military recruit’s aptitude in ten different areas. The ASVAB test helps assign new recruits into career fields they may be well-suited for, but the ASVAB should not be considered an IQ test. It is a multiple-aptitude battery that measures developed abilities and helps predict future academic and occupational success in the military. The ASVAB test is also administered to millions of high school and post-secondary students making it one of the most widely used tests in the world.
The operational level is at a scale bigger than one where line of sight and the time of day are important, and smaller than the strategic level, where production and politics are considerations. Formations are of the operational level if they are able to conduct operations on their own, and are of sufficient size to be directly handled or have a significant impact at the strategic level. This concept was pioneered by the German army prior to and during the Second World War. At this level, planning and duration of activities takes from one week to a month, and are executed by Field Armies and Army Corps and their naval and air equivalents.[31]
Additionally, all services except for the Air Force have an active warrant officer corps. Above the rank of warrant Officer One, these officers may also be commissioned, but usually serve in a more technical and specialized role within units. More recently, they can also serve in more traditional leadership roles associated with the more recognizable officer corps. With one notable exception (Army helicopter and fixed-wing pilots), these officers ordinarily have already been in the military often serving in senior NCO positions in the field in which they later serve as a warrant officer as a technical expert. Most Army pilots have served some enlisted time. It is also possible to enlist, complete basic training, go directly to the Warrant Officer Candidate School at Fort Rucker, Alabama and then on to flight school.
You should note that the exam is given only in English. This is because all of the documents you will need to reference during your military career are in English. Even if English is not your native language, you should be able to make the cut as long as you study enough. You may need to take another test, the ECL (English Comprehension Level), to make sure that you can read and follow instructions given English if it is not your native language.
As you go along, keep in mind that the ASVAB practice test is just that: practice. Memorizing these questions and answers will not be very helpful on the actual test because it is unlikely to have any of the same exact questions. If you only know the right answers to the sample questions, you won’t be prepared for the real thing. Study the concepts until you understand them fully, and then you’ll be able to answer any question that shows up on the test.
After adopting the test in 1976 the test became a way of indicating whether or not an individual was 100% qualified to serve. As previously mentioned this aptitude test has a colorful history. That is because it underwent a dramatic change in 2002 and another dramatic change in 2004. The change that occurred in 2002 expanded the categories of the test and the overall difficulty. This can be seen by the addition of all of the diverse categories below:
The way to prepare for this exam is study hard and then quiz yourself with plenty of practice ASVAB tests. Remember that the exam is identical for all branches, so an Army ASVAB practice test is exactly the same as an ASVAB practice test for the Navy. The most important components of the test are the ones that count towards the Armed Services Qualifications Test, or AFQT. These sections are Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Math Knowledge. For tips and strategies for success on these questions, be sure to review our article on ASVAB Test Prep.
The Assembling Objects section of the ASVAB practice test measures your ability to determine how an object will look when its parts are put together. You will be shown an illustration of pieces and asked to choose which one, among a selection of finished diagrams, shows how they fit together. The CAT-ASVAB has 16 questions in 16 minutes, while the paper-and-pencil version has 25 questions in 15 minutes.
The U.S. Armed Forces are one of the largest militaries in terms of the number of personnel. It draws its personnel from a large pool of paid volunteers. Although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972, but the Selective Service System retains the power to conscript males, and requires that all male citizens and residents residing in the U.S. between the ages of 18–25 register with the service.[11]
The profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself. Some of the most enduring images of the classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders. The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC was one of the defining points of Pharaoh Ramses II's reign, and is celebrated in bas-relief on his monuments. A thousand years later, the first emperor of unified China, Qin Shi Huang, was so determined to impress the gods with his military might, he was buried with an army of terracotta soldiers.[1] The Romans were dedicated to military matters, leaving to posterity many treatises and writings, as well as a large number of lavishly carved triumphal arches and victory columns.
The United States Coast Guard traces its origin to the founding of the Revenue Cutter Service on 4 August 1790 which merged with the United States Life-Saving Service on 28 January 1915 to establish the Coast Guard. The United States Air Force was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, which was formed 1 August 1907 and was part of the Army Air Forces before becoming an independent service as per the National Security Act of 1947.
Prospective service members are often recruited from high school or college, the target age ranges being 18–35 in the Army, 18–28 in the Marine Corps, 18–34 in the Navy, 18–39 in the Air Force and 18–27 (up to age 32 if qualified for attending guaranteed "A" school) in the Coast Guard. With the permission of a parent or guardian, applicants can enlist at age 17 and participate in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), in which the applicant is given the opportunity to participate in locally sponsored military activities, which can range from sports to competitions led by recruiters or other military liaisons (each recruiting station's DEP varies).
Test scores provide only one measure of your skills and abilities. Test scores and grades, combined with information about your interests, values, skills, and achievements may help you select appropriate occupations for career exploration. As you explore careers, you can compare your skills with the skill requirements of occupations in which you are interested.
Obviously, the most important way to prepare to take the test is to spend plenty of time reviewing practice test questions. Look at questions from all sections of the test, but pay special attention to questions on the Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge sections, which will be used to calculate your Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score for enlistment.
High school and postsecondary students can also take the ASVAB test as part of the Department of Defense’s Career Exploration Program. This paper-and-pencil version of the test is the same as the paper-and-pencil enlistment version but excludes the Assembling Objects section. It is intended to help those students considering a career in the military to discover their strengths in both military and civilian jobs. If the student scores high enough in the AFQT section of the test, he may use the score to enlist within the two-year expiration window.
AFQT scores are the primary measure of recruit potential. Figure 2.7 indicates the percentage of NPS recruits who scored at or above the 50th percentile (Categories I–IIIA) since FY 1973. Numerical data are in Appendix D, Table D-12. The drop in Category I–IIIA recruits after FY 1976 was due primarily to the miscalibration of the ASVAB. [1] In FY 1976, when new versions of the ASVAB were introduced, an error in calibrating the score scales made the new versions "easier" than the old versions (i.e., applicants received test scores higher than their actual ability). In FY 1980, an independent study of the calibration was made and the test was correctly calibrated. Then, Congress added legal provisions stipulating that no more than 20 percent of accessions could be in Category IV and that such accessions had to be high school diploma graduates. [2] However, as previously stated, Defense Planning Guidance decreases this limit even further, allowing no more than 4 percent of recruits to come from Category IV.
These sections are full of specific and detailed information that will be key to passing the AFQT Exam. Concepts and principles aren't simply named or described in passing, but are explained in detail. The guide is laid out in a logical and organized fashion so that one section naturally flows from the one preceding it. Because it's written with an eye for both technical accuracy and accessibility, you will not have to worry about getting lost in dense academic language.
Initially, recruits without higher education or college degrees will hold the pay grade of E-1 and will be elevated to E-2 usually soon after basic training. Different services have different incentive programs for enlistees, such as higher initial ranks for college credit, being an Eagle Scout and referring friends who go on to enlist as well. Participation in DEP is one way recruits can achieve rank before their departure to basic training.
The United States has the world's largest military budget. In the fiscal year 2016, $580.3 billion in funding were enacted for the DoD and for "Overseas Contingency Operations" in the War on Terrorism.[6] Outside of direct DoD spending, the United States spends another $218 to $262 billion each year on other defense-related programs, such as Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, nuclear weapons maintenance and DoD.
Air Force recruits must score at least 36 points the 99-point ASVAB. The overall ASVAB score is known as the AFQT score, or Armed Forces Qualification Test score. Exceptions may be made, however, for a handful of high school graduates who can score as low as 31. The vast majority, some 70 percent, of those accepted for an Air Force enlistment achieve a score of 50 or above.
The ASVAB is one of the most widely used aptitude tests in the world. The intent of the ASVAB test battery is to assess a candidate's potential for future success in the U.S. Military. Because of the nature of the test, the ASVAB can also be used to give a candidate valuable information about both military and civilian career choices that they may be suited for.
It's important to understand the difference between the ASVAB Standard Scores, and the ASVAB AFQT score. Test takers will receive a separate score for each of the nine sections on the ASVAB. These scores are known as Standard Scores. A Standard Score is used to determine how the test taker compares to the "average" 18-23 year old American on that part of the ASVAB. Not long ago, a large number of people in this age group were given the tests, and these results are the benchmark for Standard Scores. Around half the people in this age group will score a 50 or higher, and about 16% will score a 60 or higher. In other words, the scoring is based on a standard bell curve distribution. Standard Scores are very important when it comes to determining which military job a person will be assigned to.
Oh Wow! I really love this album on cd. I have the irst rerelease with the 8 bonus tracks on Rykodisc which is truly great! But, what's really even greater is the rereleased version with the bonus disc on Rhino. The bonus disc has 17 bonus tracks which include 10 tracks that were recorded live. I do ot know where the live tracks are from but the recodings are of "sound" quality, very well done, great quality audio.Not only are they of "sound" quality, but the performances are remarkable,and quite a rockoing concert. The live tracks are listed above as well as the rest of the original album. All tracks are really good tunes such as Big Boys (which there is an alternate version on the bonus disc as well. Also, another nice tune is Goon Squad which is done in the live set and Party Girl which is also done live. One song that has always stood out for me is *What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding. I have never heard a recording of this song performed live. I wonder if this song is even peerformed live at all. But, to be perfectly honest with you, this is one of Costello's crowning achievements, if not thee one. After all, its part of the first five. The first five are the greatest ----- aren't they?
Military tactics concerns itself with the methods for engaging and defeating the enemy in direct combat. Military tactics are usually used by units over hours or days, and are focused on the specific, close proximity tasks and objectives of squadrons, companies, battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions, and their naval and air force equivalents.[31]

There are 65 MEP joint services locations across all 52 states and in Puerto Rico. If you do not live close enough to a MEP, your recruiter will advise you to take the test at one of the MET sites which are located in many Federal government buildings, armories and Reserve stations. With multiple locations across the country to choose from, you won’t have to travel far to take this all-important first step toward a military career.
The ASVAB is a series of timed aptitude tests that are used to classify selected candidates into appropriate job roles as well as ultimately decide the eligibility of candidates for US military service. In other words, perform poorly on this test and you could severely limit your opportunities in the military or even prevent yourself from serving.
The content of the test has been clearly laid out, but there is still a ton of information concerning the actual place where the test is administered and the time that is allocated for each section. The computerized test is administered in a “military entrance processing station” (MEP) or a satellite region that is identified as a “military entrance tests site” (MET). The difference in the two locations is that the METs are the places that are responsible for administering the written test, while MEPs are the places that administer the computerized tests.

Being new to the bitcoin world I didn’t know what to expect and like all newbies am always worrying about losing my money… so just yesterday i did just that because not only did i put in one wrong digit in my wallet address , the teller at the bank also did not quote the reference number ….. i definately told her to do that…… before i even had time to realise there was a problem Jeremy sent me an email asking me to check my wallet details and what i had to do to fix the problem….. of course i didnt see that email before i checked my wallet and couldnt see my bitcoin and like a lunatic sent an email to spendbitcoin asking what was going on and explaining that i got one digit wrong in my wallet… filled with panic because i honestly thought that i had just lost $400 AUD ….. well jeremy – the main man helped me through the confusion and sorted the whole thing out for me ….. less than 24hours of dealing with jeremy i had my bitcoins…..phewww…. i was so happy and thoughout the process became alot more educated on how it all works and how to be a lot more secure in the way i do my purchasing so as to limit my chances of losing money/bitcoins and be more security wise. Also i wasn’t passed around to various people and never did jeremy leave me hanging for a reply…..This is THE BEST PLACE IN AUSTRALIA to buy bitcoin if only but for the fact that the service is personal, hands on from the number one man Jeremy himself and you dont get that ANYWHERE these days…. i hope for Jeremy to do well in his business spenbitcoins and hope everyone passes on the great experiences and service they get to all their friends so Jeremy and spendbitcoins is successful because i believe as a customer we will benefit from the success of spendbitcoins as our cost of doing business with jeremy will be kept to a minimum…. that is just the way this company and jeremy are …. thank-you so much and i wish you all the success with all your endeavours with spendbitcoin and look forward to learning more through reading the forums…. regards darren
Used spendbitcoins many times and had my first ‘troubles’ with the service yesterday due to banking companies internet clients breaking but all it did was delay the order so it was no real trouble at all, it wasn’t spendbitcoins fault but Jeremy did everything in his power to confirm the transaction as soon as possible and stayed up all night to do so, he really cares about his customers. I would have to say as well that we all must be grateful for he created the most convenient and easy to use Exchange in Australia years ago and he also maintains it.
There was a hiccup with westpac bank yesterday Jeremy and his team handled the problem in a very profesional way. great service
A great job done by the team in very difficult circumstances – customer service at its very best. Thank you.
bought my first bitcoins here, just because the site looks good, the transaction was very easy (i was a btc noob at the time) and if it wasnt for this site i prob would have given up on btc. i recommend this site to all btc noobs
Highly recommended – very trustworthy. Just always remember to double check that the bank teller includes your reference in the deposit comments to avoid any stress for you! Jeremy was very quick and helpful with my support call.
I’ve made a few purchases now very happy overall I think you guys are getting faster with your deposits and better coverage on weekends… Just a word of caution just like spendbitcoins have mentioned it’s always worth comparing the exchange rate to say Mt Gox.. as there is sometimes a a glaring anomoly… Most of the time it’s on par but not always! Overall I have no desire to shop elsewhere….
I was hesitant at first, but I went to the bank, made my deposit and the bitcoin was in my account by the time I got home. Super impressed. You can have my business fit every transaction in the future!
I bought my first BTC through spend bitcoins today. Was very VERY skeptical! Glad I went through with it. The 10% markup is well worth it in my opinion just because of how simple it is. I deposited the money at NAB. Had the coins in my wallet within the 4 hours like promised! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED A++++ Nuff Said 🙂
after all the messing around I found these guys they say 4hr more like 4 mins really good way to run a businessrnA+++
Thank you! Your approximate time frame was spot on – 2 hours to process and another hour to get to a 3rd part wallet. Greatly appreciated. Will use again if needed.

1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
2 And be not conformed to this age: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
3 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
8 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.

19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

Joon Koo is the Tricky Master hired by people to fool others. He demonstrates his skills on one of his customers using a trick door and a trap toilet, leaving the customer in the middle of a shopping mall with everyone laughing at him. It is then we find out that the real customer was the wife of the one who is on the toilet.
The story then moves to an office where the staff play elaborate tricks on each other all the time. This is where we meet the other main characters in the story who will be involved with Joon Koo later.
It does get a bit less complicated but more silly after this, as we find out that Joon Koo is meant to be fooling a man to keep him away from the boss' daughter and fiancee, but it is too confusing to explain.
A very silly film starring Stephen Chow with loads of slapstick humour and 'tricks'. My favourite scene was the fight between the "Tricky Masters" with the two announcing the gag tools they were using on each other.
Some people may see the film as a bit pointless, but it is really just meant to be a fun film where you are not meant to question much about it.

I don’t know if I like this season of Arrested Development. Of course, I don’t know if I dislike it either. As I write this review of the first episode, I’m only halfway through the batch. This has given me, I think, an interesting vantage point: I’m far enough along that I get a sense of what the season is trying to do, but not far enough along that I know how it pulls everything — or fails to pull everything — together.
What I do know is that this season — with its unique structure, twisting timelines and gradual plot reveals — had the potential to be the best one yet. It isn’t.
A lot of this is due to the simple fact that Mitch Hurwitz couldn’t get the cast’s schedules to align. (There were reportedly some budgetary setbacks as well but I don’t know anything about those.) Without the ability to get every actor in the same room at the same time on every day of filming, Hurwitz splintered his narrative. In one episode we’ll see what GOB is up to, in another we’ll check in with Lucille, and of course we’ll circle around and see what wacky Uncle Tobias has been doing as well.
While this sounds gimmicky, the logistical fact is that it was this or nothing, and that goes a long way toward excusing it for even the most negative viewers. What goes the rest of the way toward excusing it is the fact that Arrested Development had an incredibly rich roster of characters in the first place. When you first hear that each installment will be centered around a different character, your reaction is probably skepticism that Character X can carry a full episode on his or her own. Then you stop, think for a second, and realize that any character in this show can carry an episode.
Arrested Development arrived more or less fully formed with its pilot. We got a sense of who everybody was, and also a sense of what got them there. The fact that they then spent three seasons evolving further was something akin to magic.
It would have been enough to keep them in stasis — they were certainly interesting enough as they were — but instead we got to watch them grow, or choose not to grow, and interact in fascinating ways as they each complemented and undermined each other’s goals.
The reset button was never pressed…sure, they’d eventually gravitate back to their comfort zones, but there was always a sense that everything that had happened along the way had really happened, and is now a part of their shared history. Of course, the narratives and sub-narratives that spanned multiple episodes meant that even as one character was returning back to center, there was at least one other plate spinning somewhere to keep up the illusion (…Michael) of forward progression. Long story short: it was good writing.
Which brings us to season four, which isn’t really able to rely on that formula. We have 15 new episodes, but only one plot…and halfway through the season I couldn’t spoil it for you if I wanted to, because I still don’t understand it. That’s okay, or would be okay, as long as the individual episodes accomplish something along the way to stitching up the greater whole. Sometimes they do…other times they definitively do not.
“Flight of the Phoenix” is actually a strong contender for my favorite episode so far, largely because it raises an issue of its own, sees the consequences through, and then resolves them. That shouldn’t sound like much for an episode of television to do, but in light of what follows it feels like an achievement.
Arrested Development was always at its most impressive when it discovered some throwaway detail embedded in its past that, suddenly, could have a new and intriguing resonance. In this case, it’s Michael’s earlier threats to leave the family and run away to Phoenix. Not only does he do this at the end of the episode, but the fact that Phoenix (of any city in the country) was chosen for this detail in the past means we’re now treated to some great jokes about Michael attending notorious scam The University of Phoenix, as well as getting a subtle echo in the fact that the show itself has risen once again. It’s a great theme which gives the episode a sense of consistency that a lot of what follows doesn’t have.
Also working hugely in its favor is the father / son dynamic. Whenever I rewatch the original run, I’m struck by how wonderful the relationship is between Michael and George Michael. They love each other, but are constantly tripping over their own communication, shutting each other out without meaning to. I’m also struck by how unfortunate it is that that theme softened massively after season one. While I don’t think the show got worse when it charted zanier territory, it did leave less room for single-minded Michael and his awkward son to share quiet moments together…which, in turn, made the heart of the show that much more difficult to find.
Here it’s back in full force, and it serves a dual purpose: not only are we re-exploring the relationship between these two characters, but we’re being shown — more vividly than ever — just how delusional Michael is. George Michael has grown up, and he’s starting to see his father for what he really is. In what is unquestionably the most heart-breaking moment in the episode, we see that George Michael voted his father out of the dorm by starting to write “Dad,” but crossing it out and replacing it with the word “Michael.” It’s a rich moment that speaks silent volumes about how the dynamic has shifted, and Michael sulking out of the dorm is the ending the episode should have had.
Instead, however, we get a trip to the airport, a short flight to Phoenix, another flight back, and then a check-in at Lucille’s penthouse. It’s flab appended to what could have been a clean episode, and that’s a criticism I think you’ll be hearing a lot. Streaming on demand instead of airing in a rigid timeslot means Arrested Development has as much time as it needs to tell its story…but it also unintentionally reinforces the creative value of rigid timeslots: choosier editing.
Because these episodes have more room to sprawl, we end up with lengthy digressions and repeated jokes that overstay their welcome. We end up with scenes that would barely deserve to be retained as extra footage on a DVD. We have, basically, a lack of focus, and this works against the final product. That’s why we have the pointless scene with the twins, why Michael and George Michael have the same vague exchange about how the room sharing isn’t working (one single, tighter exchange would have packed a lot more punch) and why we waste so much time in laughless strategizing over who is going to be voted out of the dorm.
The flab is noticeable and absolutely on display, but in “Flight of the Phoenix” there’s at least a lot more going for it. The laughs, when they come, are solid. Kristen Wiig is unbelievably perfect as a young Lucille. The casual racism tossed around about tipping black people and investigating people in burqas is a bit left-field, but it’s at least funny and says something about the characters making those observations.
Best of all, however, we get to see Michael see through his vision of Sudden Valley without interference from or reliance upon his family. As it must be, it’s a total failure, and it’s great to finally see illustrated what had been so masterfully implied from the start: Michael may be the most capable Bluth…but that certainly isn’t saying much.
“Flight of the Phoenix” is a good episode, with a daringly dour atmosphere to position as the fourth season premiere. However it’s also overstuffed and doesn’t seem to have a sense of where its real narrative closure needs to be, nor does it seem capable of telling its great scenes from its needless ones.
Scene That Most Needed Tightening: The vote planning sequence, which should have been about 10 seconds long and handled through narration. Instead it drags on for two full minutes, and is then reprised in the airport.
* Not counting the penthouse scene, which is returned to throughout the season, the younger version of George and Lucille played by different actors, or archival footage.
Man did I have low hopes on the second episode. I think I laughed a few times but sweet Jesus I did not have nearly as much fun as I thought I would.
It really redeemed itself as it went on, and thankfully the number of references to the previous three seasons wasn’t a constant annoyance and rather served as a wink to the audience. Usually not Arrested Development’s strong suit but I understand why it was there.
I think that’s the problem I’m having…I’m not having as much fun as I should. Which might sound like a strange complaint when it’s chock full of silly situations and cartoon characters, but man…you know what was fun? The twisted family dynamics and stellar writing of seasons one, two and three.
I thought the joke about George Sr. not tipping African-Americans was that he was under the mistaken belief it was considered demeaning for them to be tipped – he thought he was doing the right thing not tipping them. Hence his friendly smiling while they stood waiting for their tip. I don’t see how the joke is racist really – if anything it’s a joke about people’s fear of appearing racist causing them to be hyper-sensitive when it comes to the right/wrong protocols regarding race.
Anyway, I really thought this was the worst one, even if it is more self-contained. Michael propositioning Lucille II in the early scenes was massively jarring and out of character. Okay he’s hit rock bottom, but then they jump backward in time and show him living in a dorm with George Michael, even more oblivious than he’s ever been – again really jarring and unexplained. It made me think the writers – having been away from the show for so long – had forgotten who Michael was. Of course once you see the whole arc his change of character is understandable but the non-linear way the story is told means for half the episode I was wondering what the hell was going on. I think if Hurwitz had started with Cinco de Quatro, started with the shock of Michael propositioning Lucille II, then immediately gone back to the events after the Queen Mary party it would have been a much smoother, coherent experience. As it was it’s a jumbled and bloated mess.
I liked that they did try to show us a “different” Michael from what we’d seen before, and I do think it felt like a natural evolution of the character. (At least in terms of the dorm-room stuff. Propositioning Lucille 2 was still a bit much, even after a season’s worth of justification. I don’t hate it, but it never stopped feeling just slightly wrong.) But ultimately you’re right…we needed a “much smoother, more coherent” treatment of the evolution than what we got. And I’m not sure there are any episodes (apart from maybe one or two toward the end) that don’t qualify as a jumbled and bloated mess.
“if anything it’s a joke about people’s fear of appearing racist causing them to be hyper-sensitive when it comes to the right/wrong protocols regarding race.”
I don’t think that’s the joke, if only because George Sr., Lucille and Barry have never before been worried about appearing racist or ignorant, let alone hyper-sensitive regarding right/wrong social protocols! Regardless, treating someone of a certain race differently _because_ they are members of that race, is racist.
Just painted myself into the corner. I love that. I think that’s such an important part of comedy. You know, we do it all the time on “Arrested,” just paint ourselves into corners, you know… […] …and then try to get out. Yeah. It’s all about constraints, you know, I think.

Iconic couples' therapist and best-selling author of Mating in Captivity Esther Perel returns with a groundbreaking and provocative look at infidelity, arguing for a more nuanced and less judgmental conversation about our transgressions.
An affair: It can rob a couple of their relationship, their happiness, their very identity. And yet this extremely common human experience is so poorly understood. Adultery has existed since marriage was invented, and so, too, the prohibition against it - in fact it has a tenacity that marriage can only envy.
So what are we to make of this time-honored taboo, universally forbidden yet universally practiced? For the past 10 years, master therapist Esther Perel has traveled the globe and worked with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity. In The State of Affairs she asks, why do we cheat? And why do happy people cheat? Why does infidelity hurt so much? And when we say infidelity, what exactly do we mean? Is an affair always the end of a marriage?
Affairs, she writes, have a lot to teach us about relationships. They provide unusual insight into our personal and cultural attitudes about love, lust, and commitment. Betrayal hurts, but it can be healed. An affair can even be the doorway to a new marriage - with the same person. With the right approach, Perel argues, couples can grow and learn from these tumultuous experiences, together or apart.
Fiercely intelligent, The State of Affairs provides a daring framework for understanding the intricacies of love and desire. As Perel writes, "Love is messy; infidelity more so. But it is also a window, like no other, into the crevices of the human heart."
After listening to Esther read The State of Affairs, continue on as she opens the door to her office and invites you to listen in on actual couple sessions. These are unscripted conversations of real, anonymous couples grappling with infidelity from her Audible Original podcast Where Should We Begin Begin? (courtesy of Audible Originals, LLC). As you enter this raw, intimate space with Esther, we hope you find the vocabulary for the conversations you may wish to have.
General purpose, large-diaphragm true-condenser microphones for all areas of recording, especially for project studios and live sound applications.
General-purpose, large-dual-diaphragm true-condenser microphone with switchable polar patterns for all areas of recording, especially for project studios and live sound applications.
A studio standard and reference microphone for recording use, one of the most famous AKG microphones went through several engineering metamorphoses. First introduced in 1971 as the “C 414 comb”, it was relaunched in 1976 as “C 414 EB”, upgraded to digital-level performance as “C 414 EB P- 48”, conquered the installed sound market in its “C 414 B-ULS” version, and the “C 414 B-TL II” became a favorite mic of studio engineers. The unmistakable twin-trapezoidal shape was often copied, and the unique sound and technology have remained unequaled.
A fifth polar pattern has been added to the original set of four selectable patterns. Besides cardioid, hypercardioid, figure eight, and omni, the new generation also provides a wide cardioid.
The Perception 400 is a multi-pattern large-diaphragm, true condenser microphone with outstanding build quality and a unique combination of excellent performance, deluxe features and high value. The Perception 400 delivers a classic warm, transparent, yet detailed sound and it conforms to the stringent standards defined for AKG recording products, based on the company’s 60-year heritage of know-how.

Nootropics may seem attractive to anyone who wants to try to improve their cognitive function and is willing to purchase powders, pills and other forms of these natural and synthetic supplements. Nootropic users have their own terminology, referring to measured combinations of nootropics and vitamins and minerals as “stacks.” For instance, Danger and Play, a site for active people, features a stack for beginners.[5] The recipe includes 1600 mg of the piracetam along with recommended dosages of supplements such as ALCAR, rhodiola and magnesium. There are recipes for morning, afternoon and night, thus providing daylong guidance on how to most effectively stack for more energy, greater concentration, and improved information retention. The stack tip specifically states that the ingredients are not addictive, especially if taken in strict accordance with the recipe.
Blinding stymied me for a few months since the nasty taste was unmistakable and I couldn’t think of any gums with a similar flavor to serve as placebo. (The nasty taste does not seem to be due to the nicotine despite what one might expect; Vaniver plausibly suggested the bad taste might be intended to prevent over-consumption, but nothing in the Habitrol ingredient list seemed to be noted for its bad taste, and a number of ingredients were sweetening sugars of various sorts. So I couldn’t simply flavor some gum.)
Is lifestyle truly important, though? According to Dr. Lisa, "genes load the gun, but lifestyle pulls the trigger." As someone who grew up very aware of my genetic predisposition (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, breast cancer — you name it and someone in my family has it), I always thought that this weighed heavily on whether or not someone manifests an illness. But, groundbreaking research on epigenetics actually states the contrary.
For 2 weeks, upon awakening I took close-up photographs of my right eye. Then I ordered two jars of Life-Extension Sea-Iodine (60x1mg) (1mg being an apparently safe dose), and when it arrived on 10 September 2012, I stopped the photography and began taking 1 iodine pill every other day. I noticed no ill effects (or benefits) after a few weeks and upped the dose to 1 pill daily. After the first jar of 60 pills was used up, I switched to the second jar, and began photography as before for 2 weeks. The photographs were uploaded, cropped by hand in Gimp, and shrunk to more reasonable dimensions; both sets are available in a Zip file.
The third category was cognitive control - how effectively you can check yourself in circumstances where the most natural response is the wrong one. A classic test is the Stroop Task, in which people are shown the name of a colour (let's say orange) written in a different colour (let's say purple). They're asked to read the word (which is easy, because our habitual response to a word is to read it) or to name the ink colour (which is harder, because our first impulse is to say "orange"). These studies presented a more mixed picture, but overall they showed some benefit "for most normal healthy subjects" - especially for people who had inherently poorer cognitive control.
The blood half-life is 12-36 hours; hence two or three days ought to be enough to build up and wash out. A week-long block is reasonable since that gives 5 days for effects to manifest, although month-long blocks would not be a bad choice either. (I prefer blocks which fit in round periods because it makes self-experiments easier to run if the blocks fit in normal time-cycles like day/week/month. The most useless self-experiment is the one abandoned halfway.)
The word “nootropic” was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for “mind” and “bending.” Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity.
We all wish success came in a pill form. That was the premise of the hour and half Adderall commercial/ thriller film ‘Limitless’ starring Bradley Cooper. In the film he popped a transparent round pill and instantly his brain power skyrocketed- anything became possible. Most of us wished that pill existed- and now it does. Donepezil is a drug that is used to treat Alzheimers, but it’s effects on normal people make Adderall and Vyvanse look like a cup of coffee.
Mosconi clarifies a few concepts. Other authors have advanced that the brain needs fat, including saturated fat, and cholesterol to function properly. Not so, Mosconi indicates that the fats we eat (saturated fat from animal protein) and cholesterol can’t even cross the blood-brain barrier. The brain needs a completely different type of fat: essential Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs). They include Omega-3s and Omega-6s fatty acids. Good sources of Omega-3s include fish, oils, eggs.

In her new book, Brain Food: The Surprising Science of Eating for Cognitive Power (Avery/ Penguin Random House), Dr. Lisa Mosconi, PhD, INHC, Associate Director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medical College, highlights the connection between diet and brain function and shares approachable, actionable tips to put that research into practice.
Reason: More than 50 percent of your brain is comprised of DHA! Among a big group of elderly Americans, those with the highest blood levels of DHA were about half as apt to develop dementia and 39% as apt to develop Alzheimer’s as those with lower blood levels of DHA over a nine-year period. The top 25% of those with the highest blood DHA got about 180 mg DHA a day or three servings of fish a week, researchers said. In this study, the other major fatty acid in fish oil. EPA had no effect.
The power calculation indicates a 20% chance of getting useful information. My quasi-experiment has <70% chance of being right, and I preserve a general skepticism about any experiment, even one as well done as the medical student one seems to be, and give that one a <80% chance of being right; so let’s call it 70% the effect exists, or 30% it doesn’t exist (which is the case in which I save money by dropping fish oil for 10 years).
A randomized non-blind self-experiment of LLLT 2014-2015 yields a causal effect which is several times smaller than a correlative analysis and non-statistically-significant/very weak Bayesian evidence for a positive effect. This suggests that the earlier result had been driven primarily by reverse causation, and that my LLLT usage has little or no benefits.
Gibson and Green (2002), talking about a possible link between glucose and cognition, wrote that research in the area …is based on the assumption that, since glucose is the major source of fuel for the brain, alterations in plasma levels of glucose will result in alterations in brain levels of glucose, and thus neuronal function. However, the strength of this notion lies in its common-sense plausibility, not in scientific evidence… (p. 185).
These are some of the best Nootropics for focus and other benefits that they bring with them. They might intrigue you in trying out any of these Nootropics to boost your brain’s power. However, you need to do your research before choosing the right Nootropic. One way of doing so is by consulting a doctor to know the best Nootropic for you. Another way to go about selecting a Nootropic supplement is choosing the one with clinically tested natural Nootropic substances. There are many sources where you can find the right kind of Nootropics for your needs, and one of them is AlternaScript.
One curious thing that leaps out looking at the graphs is that the estimated underlying standard deviations differ: the nicotine days have a strikingly large standard deviation, indicating greater variability in scores - both higher and lower, since the means weren’t very different. The difference in standard deviations is just 6.6% below 0, so the difference almost reaches our usual frequentist levels of confidence too, which we can verify by testing:
Green tea is widely drunk in many cultures, especially in Asia, and is known to have potent health benefits. These benefits are attributed to its polyphenol content (particularly the flavanols and flavonols). In cell cultures and animal studies, the polyphenols have been proven to prevent neurotoxin-induced cell injury. Green tea also has anti-inflammatory properties and, according to a study performed on aged mice, may delay memory regression. It’s safe to drink several cups of green tea per day, though it may be more efficacious to take a green tea extract supplement to reach a daily dose of 400 to 500 mg of EGCG, one of the main active components of green tea.
Thursday: 3g piracetam/4g choline bitartrate at 1; 1 200mg modafinil at 2:20; noticed a leveling of fatigue by 3:30; dry eyes? no bad after taste or anything. a little light-headed by 4:30, but mentally clear and focused. wonder if light-headedness is due simply to missing lunch and not modafinil. 5:43: noticed my foot jiggling - doesn’t usually jiggle while in piracetam/choline. 7:30: starting feeling a bit jittery & manic - not much or to a problematic level but definitely noticeable; but then, that often happens when I miss lunch & dinner. 12:30: bedtime. Can’t sleep even with 3mg of melatonin! Subjectively, I toss & turn (in part thanks to my cat) until 4:30, when I really wake up. I hang around bed for another hour & then give up & get up. After a shower, I feel fairly normal, strangely, though not as good as if I had truly slept 8 hours. The lesson here is to pay attention to wikipedia when it says the half-life is 12-15 hours! About 6AM I take 200mg; all the way up to 2pm I feel increasingly less energetic and unfocused, though when I do apply myself I think as well as ever. Not fixed by food or tea or piracetam/choline. I want to be up until midnight, so I take half a pill of 100mg and chew it (since I’m not planning on staying up all night and I want it to work relatively soon). From 4-12PM, I notice that today as well my heart rate is elevated; I measure it a few times and it seems to average to ~70BPM, which is higher than normal, but not high enough to concern me. I stay up to midnight fine, take 3mg of melatonin at 12:30, and have no trouble sleeping; I think I fall asleep around 1. Alarm goes off at 6, I get up at 7:15 and take the other 100mg. Only 100mg/half-a-pill because I don’t want to leave the half laying around in the open, and I’m curious whether 100mg + ~5 hours of sleep will be enough after the last 2 days. Maybe next weekend I’ll just go without sleep entirely to see what my limits are.
Dosage is apparently 5-10mg a day. (Prices can be better elsewhere; selegiline is popular for treating dogs with senile dementia, where those 60x5mg will cost $2 rather than $3532. One needs a veterinarian’s prescription to purchase from pet-oriented online pharmacies, though.) I ordered it & modafinil from Nubrain.com at $35 for 60x5mg; Nubrain delayed and eventually canceled my order - and my enthusiasm. Between that and realizing how much of a premium I was paying for Nubrain’s deprenyl, I’m tabling deprenyl along with nicotine & modafinil for now. Which is too bad, because I had even ordered 20g of PEA from Smart Powders to try out with the deprenyl. (My later attempt to order some off the Silk Road also failed when the seller canceled the order.)
Rather than cause addiction, the nootropic choline may help to treat this illness. Choline helps to increase dopamine levels. In cocaine users, for instance, dopamine levels are lowered. Taking choline potentially helps those recovering from cocaine abuse to feel better and experience fewer cravings. Research in this area is limited, but it is promising.[9]
There are a variety of substances to get magnesium from. Considerable enthusiasm for the new compound magnesium l-threonate was stirred by 2 small animal rat studies finding that magnesium l-threonate was able to increase magnesium levels in the brain and improve learning/memory tasks. (There are no published human trials as of October 2015, and evidence of publication bias, which I take as evidence against there being large effects in humans.) Animal studies mean very little, of course (see the appendix), but I thought it’d be interesting to try using l-threonate, so I bought the $30 Life Extension Neuro-Mag Magnesium L-Threonate with Calcium and Vitamin D3 (205g), which according to the LEF product page works out to ~60g of Magtein™ magnesium L-threonate and ~4.31g elemental magnesium inasmuch as LEF claims 2000mg of threonate powder provides 144mg elemental magnesium or a 14:1 ratio. (I don’t need the calcium or vitamin D3, but this was the only magnesium l-threonate on Amazon.) Experiment-wise, I’ll probably look at sleep metrics and Mnemosyne performance; I put off designing a blind self-experiment until after trying some.
While it’s no miracle pill, it can certainly give you the edge when it comes to enhanced mental and cognitive processing, as well as boosting your focus and memory retention. So, if you’re the kind of person who’s looking to optimize your performance and get the best results possible, then using an effective nootropic like the Brain Pill is a smart decision that will quickly pay dividends when it’s used in the appropriate way.
At this point I began to get bored with it and the lack of apparent effects, so I began a pilot trial: I’d use the LED set for 10 minutes every few days before 2PM, record, and in a few months look for a correlation with my daily self-ratings of mood/productivity (for 2.5 years I’ve asked myself at the end of each day whether I did more, the usual, or less work done that day than average, so 2=below-average, 3=average, 4=above-average; it’s ad hoc, but in some factor analyses I’ve been playing with, it seems to load on a lot of other variables I’ve measured, so I think it’s meaningful).
Farah has also been considering the ethical complications resulting from the rise of smart drugs. Don't neuroenhancers confer yet another advantage on the kind of people who already can afford private tutors? Writing last year in the Cavalier Daily, the student newspaper of the University of Virginia, a columnist named Greg Crapanzano argued that neuroenhancers "create an unfair advantage for the users who are willing to break the law in order to gain an edge. These students create work that is dependent on the use of a pill rather than their own work ethic." Of course, it's hard to imagine a university administration that would require students to pee in a cup before entering an exam hall. And even with the aid of a neuroenhancer, you still have to write the essay, conceive the screenplay or finish the grant proposal. Moreover, if you can take credit for work you've done on caffeine or nicotine, then you can take credit for work produced on Provigil.
Dallas Michael Cyr, a 41-year-old life coach and business mentor in San Diego, California, also says he experienced a mental improvement when he regularly took another product called Qualia Mind, which its makers say enhances focus, energy, mental clarity, memory and even creativity and mood. "One of the biggest things I noticed was it was much more difficult to be distracted," says Cyr, who took the supplements for about six months but felt their effects last longer. While he's naturally great at starting projects and tasks, the product allowed him to be a "great finisher" too, he says.
So the chi-squared believes there is a statistically-significant difference, the two-sample test disagrees, and the binomial also disagrees. Since I regarded it as a dubious theory, can’t see a difference, and the binomial seems like the most appropriate test, I conclude that several months of 1mg iodine did not change my eye color. (As a final test, when I posted the results on the Longecity forum where people were claiming the eye color change, I swapped the labels on the photos to see if anyone would claim something along the lines when I look at the photos, I can see a difference!. I thought someone might do that, which would be a damning demonstration of their biases & wishful thinking, but no one did.)
A pastor named John Piper said it well, “If hearing about God’s judgment makes it harder for us to love God, then probably the God we love is a figment of our imagination and not the real and true God. If we would love the true God, we must know the true God. There is something wrong with our faith if we cannot sing praises to God not only as our loving Father but also as the righteous Judge of all the earth.”
Clarke and Sokoloff (1998) remarked that although [a] common view equates concentrated mental effort with mental work…there appears to be no increased energy utilization by the brain during such processes (p. 664), and …the areas that participate in the processes of such reasoning represent too small a fraction of the brain for changes in their functional and metabolic activities to be reflected in the energy metabolism of the brain… (p. 675).
As I am not any of the latter, I didn’t really expect a mental benefit. As it happens, I observed nothing. What surprised me was something I had forgotten about: its physical benefits. My performance in Taekwondo classes suddenly improved - specifically, my endurance increased substantially. Before, classes had left me nearly prostrate at the end, but after, I was weary yet fairly alert and happy. (I have done Taekwondo since I was 7, and I have a pretty good sense of what is and is not normal performance for my body. This was not anything as simple as failing to notice increasing fitness or something.) This was driven home to me one day when in a flurry before class, I prepared my customary tea with piracetam, choline & creatine; by the middle of the class, I was feeling faint & tired, had to take a break, and suddenly, thunderstruck, realized that I had absentmindedly forgot to actually drink it! This made me a believer.
A key area that has been widely researched is the link between the microbiome (bacteria) in the gut and the brain. The hypothesis is that alterations in bacteria due to changes in our environment such as increased hygiene, increased exposure to antibiotics, refined and processed foods and stress have led to disturbances in short-chain fatty acids (SFCAs), which are byproducts of fermentation in the gut when bacteria come into contact with indigestible fibre found in food.
When many of us think of memory enhancers, we think of ginkgo biloba, the herb that now generates more than $240 million in sales a year worldwide. The October 22-29, 1997 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that Alzheimer's patients who took 120 mg of ginkgo showed small improvements in tests designed to measure mental performance.

The title of this blog comes from the words of Indian Prime Minister Nehru after the passing of Mahatma Gandhi. "The light that shone in this land was no ordinary light," Nehru said of the peaceful modern saint. The name of this blog, which chronicles my journey deeper into Spirit, is to remind us that there is no such thing as an ordinary light. The spiritual scriptures of many traditions such as the Bible, the Vedas, the Siri Guru Granth Sahib, the Koran and others all tell us that God is Light and so are we. It is the essence of who we are as a universe. Turn on your inner glow and shine it like a search light across the darkness of the world. We are the stuff of suns and stars.
I don't remember where I first heard this story. I just know it is a deep part of me, a kind of personal mythology that helps me to understand the world and living in it. When I move through my day, even when I feel good, I whisper this story into my own ear, and good turns into great. I hope it does the same for you.
In the mysterious and sacred land of the Himalayas, deep within a dark mountain cave, sat an old man. He was a sadhu, a man who had chosen the holy life of a renunciate. In the caves around him were other holy men, deeply involved in their spiritual practices from morning until night. In the cave to the right of this old man was another sadhu who had not eaten for 3 years except for a thimble full of water and a blade of grass each day. In the cave to the left, was a man who had kept his left arm in the air for 10 years. The old man in the cave went on about his day, cooking tea over a fire, tending to a small garden, and waving to the animals that passed by his cave door. He did not appear to be deep in meditation, and yet his eyes glowed with inner wisdom.
Early in the morning, before the light of dawn kissed the earth, the old man would climb up to the tallest peak and wait. Just as the sun rose in the sky, as the first rays of light hit the valley full of flowers below, he would hoot and holler, shouting "Good job, God!" and clapping endlessly, laughing in joy with all of his being at the radiance he saw.
His gratitude was his spiritual practice, and near the end of his life, fully and completely enthralled with creation, he reached enlightenment.
Try it. Whisper to yourself as you go through your day. Feel the warmth of the sun, the beauty of a flower, and give credit where credit is due.
Meister Eckart, a mystic, said that if the only prayer we ever said in our whole life was thank you, it would be enough. "Good job, God!"

As an Osteopath I treat people with training injuries on a daily basis. I have a background in exercise prescription and rehabilitation. I have treated beginers, professional athletes, triathletes, crossfit and functional training junkies. No matter what the level certain injuries crop up time-and-time again. Certain exercises when not done properly are common culprits
There are hundreds of joints extending from your neck to tailbone and rib cage. Movements during training that overstretch or overload joints can cause joint sprains and strains. These are common and can range from the mild irritation to debilitating pain. Most patients can make a complete recovery from most these when treated. Untreated they could remain problematic for long periods or become areas of reoccurring injury and pain.
Like spinal joints, the two large joints either side of your tail bone in your pelvis can be sprained or strained during training. The job of the sacroiliac joints can be very complex. They must bear weight and control movement at the same time.
As the name implies overuse and repetitive movements can cause injury almost any tendon. Repetitive use causes rubbing and irritation that can cause inflammation. In some cases this leads to bursitis which can easily become chronic. Tendonitis with bursitis almost always requires rest and treatment or rehabilitation.
The shoulder has a large range of motion but it generally not a very stable joint. This large range of motion makes it susceptible to chronic muscle strains, tendonitis’s, bursitis. These conditions in this area can often become chronic and can be difficult to manage.
These are a common traumatic sports injury. Rolling an ankle can be just bad luck but ankles need specific rehabilitation. Bad sprains can leave ankles week and susceptible to re-injury with simple activities. Many ankle strains over a period of time need specialized rehab.
Are common sports complains and can often be the result of problems with form and technique. Tight and inflexible muscles, improper warm up can also be the cause. Overloaded weights training are another way these strains can occur.
Poor techniques, physical trauma and overstrain of muscles around the knee can lead to many different knee injuries. Some such as patella (knee cap) tracking disorders can respond well to rehabilitation. More severe knee injuries sometimes need surgery and extensive rehabilitation to return to exercise. Knee injuries need thorough examination and investigation to be property diagnosed and treated.
So to avoid many of these common injuries we have put together a list of our top tips for avoiding injury
This is all about GOOD TECHNIQUE and knowing your body! As an Osteopath I have an excellent understanding of biomechanics – which is how your body moves. It is easy for an Osteopath to asses your movement and recommend what exercises are or maybe are not suitable for you to do and what are good alternatives. This combined with a trainer can put you in a good position to train in the safest way possible way. This is when you can gain great results from your training with less chance or getting injured.
Knowing any limitations from previous injuries and concentrating on posture, technique and form. Getting advice from trainers no matter what your level is really important. Not only will this knowledge decrease your risk of injury but it also help you to simply focus on your training and getting results without getting injuries. As you increase distance or weight you should also always be striving for improvement in technique.
Most of the time training is challenging yourself and pushing yourself harder. No matter what the challenge you need to allow your body time to get used to new movements or increased demand. Building things up steadily will always give you the best chance of avoiding injury. People become disheartened when they don’t see results from training sessions quickly
You would think this is most common to beginners but that is not always true. Sometimes more experienced exercisers misjudge where they are with strength and fitness. I often see very fit people underestimating the core strength required to get them to the next level in their training. Too much weight or distance too quickly can set you back severely. Overtraining and not allowing the body adequate rest periods can exhaust the body. Draining the body’s energy and not allowing time to recover and repair after can set you up for injury.
Most people are guilty of not doing this one at some point. Warm up exercises are usually done with the aim of increasing the blood flow to the muscles. The increased blood flow makes them more “pliable” and adaptable to exercise without injury. Warm up exercises are generally high-rep, low-intensity – a light jog, cycle etc. Lifting weights without a warm up is putting you at a much higher risk of injury no matter how fit you are.
If it hurts, STOP! Pushing through pain (especially sharp or pain you have not had before) is not good. Pushing through fatigue for resistance training is how you progress. After an intense weights session a stretch or a foam roller can ease minor soft tissue strains. A good trainer can help you identify the difference between pushing yourself to the next level and pain due to tissues being injured. I often see patients who have been pushing through the pain not realising the damage they are doing. Continuing training with tendon injuries can cause tendonitis that can be difficult to rehabilitate. It is a similar story for stress fractures. Often the body has been trying to tell them for quite sometime that it cannot deal with the loads being applied. These injuries are far more common than people realise. If identified early they have much better outcomes.
Ok so there’s lots of different schools of thought on this one. One minute it’s essential before and after all exercise. Next minute a researcher will claim there are no beneficial outcomes. What I do know from years of treating injuries is that not stretching at all will not help your performance. Not Stretching at all will probably put you at a much greater risk of hurting yourself.
Properly performed, a stretch helps to elongate, increase circulation and warm up a muscle. Warmed up muscles are more pliable and ‘alert’. in my experience this makes it far more injury-resistant. Post exercise muscle soreness is reported less when muscles are stretched after a workout.
Yep I’ve come across body builders that don’t stretch ….. like ever!! I often find not only do they have injuries but they can be very unbalanced with their strength and flexibility. They may be able to lift very heavy weights but some simple activities can easily cause strain in them. In my experience, the best performing bodies have a perfect combination of strength and flexibility. These bodies tend to recover well from injuries.
Ive seen countless people wanting to lose weight who consume too little or the wrong type of food. They continue to try to train hard and frequently. This is a great way to get injured. If you want to perform better or gain muscle bulk diet is important. Getting advice from a sports nutritionalist on what to eat is worthwhile. You need to provide your body with the best fuel possible if you want it to perform well. If you are doing resistance training you need to ‘feed’ your muscles. Optimal nutrition can feed your muscles and help them recover from a work-out.
Get the right advice from the beginning. Have a team around you to know exactly what your body can (and probably should not) do and how to do it correctly. At the first sign of injury get it assessed and treated. Follow the proper management from the beginning to avoid injuries setting you back.
There is no way I can know if this applies to you and your specific situation. How could I? I don’t know who you are … what your medical history is … what you do…. or how you use your body.
This post, therefore, is in NO WAY a substitute for thorough diagnosis and assessment by a qualified health professional.
If you’ve got pain then it’s my responsibility to recommend that you consult with a professional who is qualified to diagnose and treat pain … and someone, preferably, who knows and understands how you like to exercise and won’t just tell you to ‘stop it’ … especially when you might just be able to use it to get better!

"Not long before you wrote about how much more painful loss becomes as we get older I had contemplated (for some perverse reason) the possible death of one of our dogs. I felt such a deep vibratory pang I had to quickly cut off the contemplation. I realized how much more painful the loss of a pet would be to me now; and this from someone who was almost inconsolable when one of his snakes died when he was a kid!Your way of understanding this phenomenon really resonated in me. I actually began to understand more deeply how grief relates to awareness."
Thanks, E.W. — it takes a certain, finer awareness, along with courage to not only allow oneself to feel the pain, but to admit to it — which is really admitting the pain, allowing it to exist as is, alongside the as-is of one’s self.
Any pain, physical or mental or emotional, is vibration, which is movement. Often this movement seems to be impaired or stuck, as if running in one place but getting nowhere. Can not-moving be movement? Perhaps here is movement of a different sort, a different order on a different dimension. Moving our legs through space creates distance across space, which is experienced as a measurement called time. If our legs cannot move because we are in pain — in our body or our heart — there is still movement but of this different order. Here is where courage is needed, to do something seemingly counter-intuitive, which is to go towards and into the pain. "Riding the pain" is one way someone has described it. Others feel carried by it, or even pulled, if resistance is offered. All ways are valid and unique, generated by the Spirit Self and therefore numinous.
Whether or not one believes the pain of grief can be avoided, or has been avoided — it occurs anyway. Any suppression or repression takes place only on the two-dimensional plane of the simulate self. The Authentic Self is where the action, the movement, takes place. The simulate self interprets the difference between the two selves as an edge or barrier, and uses fear as a kind of sonar to sound off against the barrier to detect and prove its existence. Movement of Authentic Self on the waves of pain takes place, regardless of our awareness of it. It is, in fact, the awareness that signals that an awakening is taking place, an awakening to one’s living experience. This awakening can be visualized as a point of awareness arising on the wave, and as an inseparable part of the wave. Perhaps this speaks to the quantum mechanical conundrum that light is simultaneously a point and a wave.
Returning to the space opened by the pain of grief returns us to familiar feelings. The space is opened further each time; or rather, one’s awareness of the already infinite space is exponentially widened. This has been described before as experiencing each subsequent grief as “harder” — but this particular word will change in concept and meaning as the widening continues. Yet it doesn’t mean the experience will become “easier.” It becomes “different.” In a way, there is an experiential realization that one’s manifested material body is limited in its ability to experience and endure physical and emotional sensations. It simply can’t tolerate higher levels of the truth, and this gives rise to its own kind of discomfort or growing pains.
The word “grieve” arises from an ancient Indo-European root for “heavy.” When a certain level of understanding of Truth is arrived at, a lightening of the mind occurs — enlightening – but the mind-body may shut or break down, and the mind-body cooperative may then separate. The cosmic materials that comprise the atomic structure of the physical body are released when the enlightened mind dissolves the “glue” that held the structure together. Mind moves on, free of the material body, and at some point, will utilize other cosmic materials to build a new body that will be able to tolerate the higher level of Truth. Its manifestation will be reflective of the truth as understood by that particular mind.
Grief, then, “undoes” us — that is, it disengages, disentangles, frees, loosens, releases, unbinds, unblocks, unbuttons, uncloses, unfastens, unzips, unfixes, unlocks, unravels, unshuts, unstops, unties, or unwraps us. The pain of grief is a taste of the divine ecstasy foreign to our earthly mind-bodies. Deflected, it continues on anyway, unbinding the glue. Embraced, the pain embraces us back and this chemical union becomes a catalyst for consciously aware change, or movement from the lower to the higher. This is why we seek the company of others of like mind and vibration, who can hold and carry us during the grief process and thus impart a strengthening and nourishment to our temporarily weakened state. We have grown new wings — now, out of the cocoon, we need to rest, to allow the wings to dry and expand before venturing further into new space.
We also experience the separation from other human and animal (and serpentine) mind-bodies as well in our grief — and in our beginning or even anticipated grief as well. When we understand that the “undoing” is also a “doing” and that because of “like vibration attracts like vibration”, another chemical is added to the catalyst that becomes part of the emerging flux, and which will naturally reunite our mind with those minds, whether without or within new bodies.
"Creativity is the principle of novelty. Creativity introduces novelty into the content of the many, which are the universe disjunctively. The creative advance is the application of this ultimate principle of creativity to each novel situation which it originates. The ultimate metaphysical principle is the advance from disjunction to conjunction, creating a novel entity other than the entities given in disjunction. The novel entity is at once the togetherness of the 'many' which it finds and also it is one among the disjunctive ' many' which it leaves; it is a novel entity, disjunctively among the many entities which it synthesizes. The many become one, and are increased by one. In their natures, entities are disjunctively 'many' in process of passage into conjunctive unity... Thus the 'production of novel togetherness' is the ultimate notion embodied in the term concrescence. These ultimate notions of 'production of novelty' and 'concrete togetherness' are inexplicable either in terms of higher universals or in terms of the components participating in the concrescence. The analysis of the components abstracts from the concrescence. The sole appeal is to intuition.-- (Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality, p. 26)
"Because we do not know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustable well. Yet everything happens a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even that. How many times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless." -- Paul Bowles, The Sheltering Sky
"The instrument of thought, which has produced this world that does not work properly, is no longer valid. So perhaps this instrument of thought is worn out. Is there another instrument we can use?" -- Krishnamurti
"...Nature gets credit which should in truth be reserved for ourselves: the rose for its scent, the nightingale for its song, and the sun for his radiance. The poets are entirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics to themselves and should turn them into odes of self-congratulation on the excellence of the human mind. Nature is a dull affair, soundless, scentless, colourless; merely the hurrying of material, endlessly, meaninglessly." -- Alfred North Whitehead - English mathematician & philosopher (1861-1947)
". . . keeping the Risen concept of weaving in mind, perhaps at this point it can be sensed that what we have before us, from which we are inseparable and as reflected in this book, is a Supreme Tapestry. There appears to be a Very Grand Design which we all follow, either in awareness or not, co-creatively or not -- recalling that creative means fun. As we weave we are free to make it up as we go along in any way we please, simultaneously staying within the Grand Design as imagined by Higher Imaginals, of whom we an inseparable part. The Grand Design is a work of perfections intermingled with imperfections, solutions with mistakes, and stillness within movement. The Higher Imaginals are many things, but for our purposes here, it suffices to say that they are very advanced and evolved individuals, or Higher Selves." (from The Risen: Dialogues of Love, Grief & Survival Beyond Death; Chapter 13, Mundus Imaginalis, p. 165).

Ian Johnston raised his family on Mission Creek, spending summers swimming and fishing in its waters. He drinks from a well set 100 metres back from its banks and, for more than two decades, he’s worked with a volunteer group to build up its salmon stocks.
When a train derailed about a kilometre upstream of his South Hazelton home shortly after 7 a.m. on Jan. 19, spilling coal into the creek, he was one of the first on scene.
“You could see there were multiple coal cars in the creek,” Johnston says, disputing CN Rail’s initial statement was that no coal had landed in the water. By the following day, trains were running again. But by press time in late February, piles of coal remained near the tracks, less than 50 metres from the creek and slowly leaching into the earth.
“I think about having kids and the rule that you make a mess, you clean it up,” Johnston says. “It’s still a mess.”
What that mess means for salmon stocks and water quality in Mission Creek remains unclear. February’s record-breaking snowfall was hampering cleanup efforts and making it impossible to know the full extent of the damage. It will likely be years before its effects are fully understood.
According to Brenda Donas, a retired community advisor with Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), if approached properly, the incident offers an opportunity to learn more about the effects of coal in salmon-spawning streams and to improve spill-response plans.
Both Johnston and Donas have been involved with the Chicago Creek Environmental Enhancement Society since the early 1990s, when there were less than 20 coho in Mission Creek. The society started a hatchery program and, in 1994, installed a fence to count returning fish.
“We were getting between 200 and 400 coho adult coming back to spawn every year,” Donas says, at which point focus shifted to habitat reconstruction. “You can have fish coming back, but if there’s nowhere for them to spawn, you’re not going to make any more fish.”
In 2015, the creek saw a whopping 1,800 returning coho. This fall marks the end of that three-year lifecycle and could reveal whether those numbers can be sustained.
But how the coal spill will affect the society’s work has yet to be determined and may take many years—or at least another three-year cycle—to fully appreciate. Bioaccumulation, or the compounding of heavy metals up the food chain, is the biggest concern. Selenium and cadmium, which are commonly found in coal, can cause spinal deformities, lower growth rates, and reduced reproductive rates in salmon, Donas says.
The society is requesting ongoing water-quality monitoring to test bioaccumulation of heavy metals in insects and salmon fry for three coho lifecycles, or roughly a decade. If increases are detected, “we have a problem on our hands,” Donas says. “I fish at the mouth of Mission Creek all the time. I’m eating that stuff.”
Sherry Wright with the Wilps Nikate’en house group also arrived at the site shortly after 8 a.m. on the day of the spill. For the month that followed, she visited every day, working alongside fellow Gitxsan who had been hired to help with cleanup.
“All we can do is sit there and witness and speak to the work that’s being done or not being done,” she says. While the creek bed was scraped clean by excavators within days of the spill and screens were put in place to strain coal sediment from the creek water, she is concerned about the remaining coal.
By late February, CN said it had cleaned up roughly 30 percent of the spilled coal and didn’t have an answer as to when the rest would be removed. Kate Fenske, media relations with CN, said track issues had been ruled out as a cause of the derailment and the company was looking into equipment failure. She added that further monitoring and restoration work would take place in the spring.
With regard to whether the water is safe for downstream residents, Northern Health Authority’s public health protection team said in an email it believes “there is no significant threat to drinking water from this event, based on the materials involved and our review of the water quality testing results and trends.”
According to David Karn with the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, water quality monitoring began the day of the derailment and was ongoing, with a more comprehensive sediment collection planned once ice is off the creek.
“So far, from the results we’ve seen to date, recreational use this summer is not a concern. We will have a better picture when the remainder of the sample results come in,” Karn says. “The impact risks to insects or salmon fry will be assessed when the remaining sampling results are received and could potentially be a part of the long-term monitoring plan.”
But while residents wait to see what long-term impacts come from the derailment, there’s agreement that the crash—with its easily accessed location near Highway 16—presents an opportunity for CN to work with the community and improve its public image.
“If they were a good environmental corporate citizen, this is an opportunity to put something in place to learn,” Donas says. “We’re just trying for a win-win.”

After spending tens of thousands of dollars building my third website with a ‘top’ web designer and being unhappy with the results, I finally took the time to study SEO and website optimization. I read several books on search engine optimization, including The Art of SEO (by Stephen Spencer and team) to understand the basics, then I took advanced SEO training courses and spent several months learning what really makes a website rank- and what you can do to design (or should I say ‘re-design’) your website so it does what you intended it to do in the first place; attract visitors who want what you have to offer- organically- without paying for every click.
Just because you overpaid for your website doesn’t guarantee you will have your search engine optimization needs met. I was horrified to learn in hindsight that our expensive web development team didn’t even know what ‘SEO best practices’ meant, although they said the site would be built with best practices in their quote. There are certain key things you should beware of when hiring a web developer, and let me save you some money right upfront- if your web developer says he/she doesn’t write content, this person has no clue about SEO. Many web designers ask YOU to provide the content, and feel their job is to post it for you and make it ‘look pretty.’ If that’s the case, your site will not rank for the keywords you’re hoping to rank for.
It’s their job to get your site posted and done quickly and cost effectively; this is how web developers earn money; the more sites that get finished and posted each month, the more money they earn. They are essentially ‘coding people’ who understand how to post web pages and would prefer not to spend all the hours it would take to do all the keyword research, page mapping and internal link designing you need to do in advance of building your site in order to rank for the keywords and phrases you want to rank for. And honestly, it might not be all their fault. You were probably looking to save money when building your site and if the developer quoted you for the SEO work you needed in addition to the work he had to do to build your site, you’d probably reject his estimate and find someone else to do it cheaper. (Not all web designers fit this description, so don’t get offended if you’re a web developer who builds search-friendly websites).
If you want qualified traffic for your site, do your research in advance and understand which terms you are trying to rank for. Pick no more than 2-3 per page and write your content around those keywords. Be sure to check your competitors before jumping in and make sure the words you want to rank for don’t have so much competition that you don’t really have a chance; find keywords and phrases that are realistic and go for those. Evaluate the number of links your competitors have as well. Although there is no such thing as the perfect web page or web site, that doesn’t matter. You just have to be better than your competitor.
It’s like the story of the two guys in the woods who hear a bear coming- one guy starts putting on his sneakers and his friend says, “You’ll never out run the bear!” The guy putting on his sneakers says calmly, “I don’t have to… I just have to outrun you.”

Hydrogen Peroxide is a weak acid and because of it’s whitening abilities, it is super versatile for cleaning tasks, especially within your home. The great thing about using hydrogen peroxide for your cleaning needs is that it’s also an eco-friendly product, meaning it’s chemical-free and totally safe. So for those of you working hard to be green, here are 8 effective cleaning uses for hydrogen peroxide:
Whiten Bathtub/Shower Grout. If you have mildew buildup within your grout, spray hydrogen peroxide into the grout, let it sit for about 20 minutes, then scrub the grout with an old toothbrush.
Clean the toilet bowl. Pour half a cup of hydrogen peroxide into the toilet bowl, let sit for 20 minutes, then scrub with a toilet brush. You an also use for the sink and the bathtub. This really works well for working out the soap scum and to eliminate odors and germs.
Kill Germs in Your Bathroom. Mix together equal parts of H2O and hydrogen peroxide and pour it into a spray bottle. This solution will kill germs in your bathroom and as an added bonus, will keep it smelling squeaky clean.
Whiten the White Laundry. Instead of bleach, use a cup of hydrogen peroxide for your white laundry. It will whiten your clothes and is way less harsh on fabrics.
Clean a cutting board and kitchen surfaces. Mix equal parts of H2O and hydrogen peroxide and pour it into a spray bottle. Use it to sanitize your kitchen counter tops and cutting boards.
Clean Kitchen Appliances. Because it’s non-toxic, hydrogen peroxide is great for cleaning places that store food and dishes. Just spray the appliance outside and in, let the solution sit for a few minutes, then wipe clean.
Brighten Floors. For a mopping solution, combine half a cup of hydrogen peroxide with one gallon of hot H2O. This solution is very mild making it safe for all floor types. And an added bonus, there is no need to rinse. It leaves no residue.
Clean Sponges. Once you’ve completed all your dirty work, soak your sponges for 15 minutes in a 50/50 mixture of hydrogen peroxide and warm H2O. Rinse the sponges well after.
One thing to think about when mixing your solution, hydrogen peroxide can easily lose it’s chemical makeup. Be sure to either store your solution in an opaque bottle or only mix up as much as you will need for each use. Light can alter the chemical makeup of hydrogen peroxide, which is why it is only sold in a brown bottle in the store.
And you want to know the best thing about hydrogen peroxide? It’s cheap! You can buy a 16 oz bottle for just $1.00. It’s effective, inexpensive and green, making it the perfect alternative cleaning agent. Go buy a bottle today!

I Samuel 14:6 (NIV), “Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, “Come, let’s go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.”
I Samuel 14:20-23 (NIV), “Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and came to the battle; and behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines previously, who went up with them all around in the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. When all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, even they also pursued them closely in the battle. So the LORD delivered Israel that day, and the battle spread beyond Beth-aven.”
Jonathan, King Saul’s son, took it into his heart to allow God to use him, and when he told his armor bearer, the young man was willing to follow. When they did, God came through in a miraculous way. There was so much confusion in the enemy camp, that even to this day, the word “Michmash” still means utter confusion and chaos. By the time Saul showed up God had already thrown the enemy into disarray.
What happens when a few willing souls step out in faith? Others follow. They come out of the enemy’s camp and fight on the side of good. They come out of hiding, out of the dark woods. They lift their heads up out of despair and have hope. They join the battle.
Never despise small beginnings. God uses the small things and the foolish things. He uses us! That’s how He gets the glory. Nobody in their right mind would ever think that we could do it. It has to be God. It doesn’t matter what those around us are doing. Saul was a mess. He was in direct disobedience with God. He spoke curses over his troops, forbidding them even to eat. Yet, Jonathan stood up for what was right and just. No wonder he later backed David, and the two young men became fast friends. Jonathan knew in his heart that God would save by many or by few.
Never feel alone! So maybe you don’t have an armor bearer, then be one for someone else. Say to that man or woman of God, “do what seems right to you, I am with you.” Follow those who follow Christ. Be a Jonathan, or be an armor bearer. We may not know that armor bearers name, but he has been remembered all of these years. God made sure he would be written into the scriptures for our example.
We have work to do, and a battle to fight. The victory is ours, the outcome is sure. The joy of the Lord is our strength. Psalm 3:3 (NAS), But You, O LORD, are a shield about me, My glory, and the One who lifts my head. Our battle cry is “LOVE.”
Jesus, You are my Mighty Warrior King. You go before me and make a way where there is no way. You set the enemy in confusion on my behalf, yet You give Your soldiers perfect peace!
“For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.” Ephesians 6:12
Our enemies are not made of flesh and blood. We all know that right? We’ve heard it preached, taught and we’ve read it ourselves in God’s word. People are not our enemies. But, honestly, that is hard to remember at times. We can be so easily irritated by that one person (or sometimes several different people). I have found myself, more times than I am comfortable admitting to, wanting to “lay hands on” someone because of their words or actions and it had nothing to do with prayer or imparting gifts! Or as my grandson likes to say “give them a five knuckle sandwich.” It’s easier to see the carrier, the messenger, than the real enemy. Our enemy is Satan. He comes to only kill, steal and destroy. He and his minions are spirit and can only operate through people. My pastor uses the term, “principalities that use personalities.” That person that antagonizes, manipulates, irritates, brings division and harm, is operating under the influence, and sometimes control, of an evil spirit and most of the time they aren’t even aware of that fact. There are those occasions that the only enemy is our own human nature, our own flesh, but we will leave that for another day.
There have been times that we have been hurt, or worse, had to watch a loved one be crushed under abusive behavior. We have all been affected by or witness to bullying, unfair treatment, discrimination and all of those other ugly behaviors, all products of the fallen world we live in. They stem from anger, bitterness, pride, selfishness and straight from the pit of hell. So how do we keep things in perspective? How do we not lash out in anger and revenge at those who have hurt, or continue to hurt us? How do we look past the flesh and blood person and see the evil lurking behind? First, we have to accept God’s love in our lives, His love for us and His love for others, including that person who has you wanting to behave in an ungodly way. We need to renew our minds, wash it out, with God’s word (Romans 12:2). When we love God’s law we aren’t easily offended (Psalm 119:165). When we stand on God’s word, write it on the tablets of our hearts and we allow God to fill us with His love we are slow to judge and quick to forgive. Love covers a multitude of sins, so it allows us to overlook some of the behavior (Proverbs 6:12). Another way that we can overlook the flesh is to remember at one time we were just like they were. There is a reason they are called “the lost”. We were unloving, backbiting, selfish children of our father, the devil.
Quite often the ones that hurt us the most are our own loved ones, family members, spouses, our Church family. Some are even professing Christians (I would say they may still have a lot of their carnal nature there, living by their senses). How do we handle that? First off remember that they are not the enemy! If someone has offended you, we are supposed to go to them. That can be harder than asking someone to forgive you, I know. Occasionally, you will find that they never intended to hurt and didn’t realize they even did. Sometimes they know they did, but refuse to admit fault or ask for forgiveness. If it’s a big deal, ask for leaders to help with the situation, if it is not a major thing, just shake the dust off of your feet and move on. Forgiveness isn’t an emotion, it’s a choice. You choose to forgive, whether they ever admit fault or not, and let your emotions catch up. When the behavior is continued, and the relationship is toxic, forgive, but don’t stay in relationship with that person. God never intended for abusive behavior to be part of a family. Sometimes we have to distance ourselves from people and their sin. Don’t be a part of sinful behavior. Forgiving isn’t saying what they did was acceptable or that you will allow the behavior to continue in your life. You are just letting the junk go out of your own heart and refusing to hold it against them. Forgive, but move on! Let go of the anger, hurt and pain and allow God to heal. Satan hates that. He loses the battle when you forgive.
I am not saying this is all easy! From time to time, we will all face the enemy with the face of a friend, or at least a human face. But look past that face of flesh and see the evil lurking behind. Rebuke the devil; arrest his plans in your life and the life of the person he is using. Our enemy is not a person with a different opinion, skin color, doctrine, faith or beliefs. Our enemy isn’t the rapist, murderer, adulterer or even that grouchy neighbor next door. Pray for those who seem to be your enemy, the person who is being used by Satan. Pray for those who despitefully use you. Be kind to those who have the enemy working in them. This heaps coals on the head of our true enemy. Love the un-loveable. Forgive those who have hurt you. Our enemy is spirit and must be fought with spiritual weapons. We use God’s word. How does he feel about that person, the situation, your reaction? Use the blood of Jesus. Plead the blood over your life and the life of that person who has hurt you. Testify of God’s goodness. What He is doing, has done, how He feels about you, and how much He loves you. Praise God, it stills the enemy and the avenger (makes him shut up and stop his attack.) Be slow to judge and quick to forgive. Satan hates that as well.
You’ll see it all gets easier. You’ll find yourself hurt and offended less. Your patience with people will be greater and your love stronger. Relationships will be restored. Families and Churches will have less division. We will be more careful of how we treat others. Life’s too short to hold grudges and allow bitterness to take over our lives. When we do that, Satan wins the battle and gains ground. None of us want that. The person you once saw as your worst enemy might just end up being a brother or sister in Christ. God want that. He doesn’t like their behavior any more than you do…but He LOVES them. He wants them found and accepted into the beloved.
“Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that your may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. There for take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with the truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness. And having shod you feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints.” Ephesians 6:10-18
There was never a town like Funtown, and likely will never be again. It was every little boy and girl’s dream. Shiny, sparkly, noisy, flashy, extravagant and fabulous! Mr. Topper, the founder of Funtown was well spoken of in many a household. “What a marvelous man!”, some would say, “A genius!”, said others. After all he is the one who imagined Funtown, planned it, built it, paid for it, Mr. Topper was Funtown. Parents used the wonderful, beautiful town to bribe their children for weeks, months and sometime years. “You better be good, or you will not be invited to Funtown” threatened parents, or “If you are good, you may get an invitation from Mr. Popper.” So every child dreamed of Funtown, of that beautiful invitation, of lights and whirls of color, of the big merry-go-round with the music and horses, of the big top and the shows. They played ‘Funtown’ on recess, and if you listened closely, you would hear children discussing their desire to go.
Mr. Topper knew about these outrageous stories and rumors. Of course he did, after all, he started them himself and went to great pains to make sure that they continued being told, were whispered into the ears of all little girls and boys. Sometimes he even began to believe it was magic. When things were going smoothly, when all was shiny and glittered in the night, lit by gas lamps and lights. He would walk through his town and forget about the work, the trouble, and the unpleasant tasks behind all of the sparkle. At those times, he saw himself as a friend, a benefactor to the people, a generous ‘Uncle’ to all who came to escape their dreary lives.
But there were some, a few, who knew who Mr. Topper really was, and what Funtown really was. For all that glitters is not gold…

Dripping Springs ISD is committed to ensuring the most appropriate educational setting for each student. Our Gifted and Talented (GT) Program is designed to meet the needs of students who exhibit significantly advanced intellectual ability. The program provides appropriately differentiated curriculum presented in a way that offers greater depth, more complex content, and extensive enrichment activities designed to challenge GT-identified students.
Dripping Springs ISD has established a thorough assessment process to identify students and ensure they are placed appropriately into the program.
Students must first be referred for GT consideration. This is an open system with referrals accepted from principals, teachers, parents, guardians, students (both self and peer), psychologists, counselors, librarians, administrators, and community members.
Parents must complete the referral form found at the bottom of this page for permission for assessment for the GT program.
All students referred for GT assessment will complete a testing process. Testing instruments are approved by the district, are aligned with best practices, and are appropriate to the student’s grade level. Parent and teacher evaluations may be included in the assessment process.
Parents and teachers rate the student on a variety of areas including vocabulary, expression, mastery levels, critical thinking, reasoning skills, reading level, observation skills, and problem-solving.
The assessment results are evaluated by the Dripping Springs ISD GT Assessment Committee. The committee may consider additional evaluation criteria including student portfolios, anecdotal information, and other relevant data. The GT Assessment Committee makes the final determination as to whether or not the student is accepted in the GT program.
Students who were identified as gifted in their prior district and whose previous district’s GT identification process measures abilities comparable to DSISD’s assessment requirements will be placed in the DSISD GT program.
Students who were identified as gifted in their previous district and the prior districts assessment procedures does not meet DSISD’s GT identification requirements will be administered the NNAT 3 as a screening instrument. Students meeting the district standard on this screening assessment will be placed in the appropriate GT program immediately.
Students new to the district identified as gifted in their previous district who do not qualify based on comparable assessments or by score on the screening instrument may be referred for further assessment according to the district assessment guidelines and the GT Assessment Committee. GT assessment for previously identified new students will be completed within six weeks of enrollment and placement will be adjusted as determined by the campus/district GT committee.
Incoming transfer students should present any prior testing paperwork from their previous district when requesting testing for our gifted and talented program, specifically SAGES, CogAt, and/or NNAT scores.

This is the date that is remembered around the world and annually recalled on the evening news as the date President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. Far less noticed is the fact that another famous twentieth century figure also died on this date. On this day, November 22, l963 C.S. Lewis (who preferred to be called “Jack”) went to be with the Lion named Aslan.
To understand what that means, we must recall that Jack was one of the world’s outstanding writers and a professor of English Literature at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. He succeeded in capturing the imagination of young and old with his Chronicles of Narnia. These seven books tell the story of boys and girls magically stepping through their wardrobe closet to venture into a fictional land protected by Aslan, a magnificent lion who symbolizes Christ. The stories have proved to be more than captivating reading adventures for children. They also have been an effective instrument for converting many to faith in Jesus Christ.
Jack referred to himself at age fourteen as a “happy atheist,” but after years of analytical thinking, he concluded that knowing Christ is the only logical way to understand both man and the universe around him. Accepting Christ as his Redeemer at age 30, Jack soon achieved worldwide recognition as the author of more than 25 Christian writings. Perhaps best known of his non-fiction books is Mere Christianity, a simple yet strikingly logical statement of why the Gospel is worthy of acceptance.
Remarkably, Jack stands out as one of history’s gifted geniuses who has had the versatility to fascinate and delight children with his simple stories of Aslan and at the same time challenge the most scholarly philosophers with his profound thought and keen logic. One of his widely known scholarly writings is English Literature in the Sixteenth Century. Another, Abolition of Man, was classified by Encyclopedia Britannica as one of the Great Books of the World.
Jack suffered from kidney problems late in life and had to have many transfusions. Once he went into a coma. However, he revived and continued to read new books and reread the books he loved. Those close to him observed that Lewis anticipated death with cheerfulness and peace. A week before his death, Jack shared with his brother these words: “Warnie, I have done all that I was sent into the world to do, and I am ready to go.” Warnie later remarked that he had never seen death looked in the face so tranquilly.7
At five thirty on this day, November 22, 1963, Jack’s brother Warnie heard a crash and found Jack unconscious. The famous writer died a few minutes later.
Shadowlands, a BBC film on Jack’s life, co-produced with Gateway Films, won the international Emmy award for best drama and spun off a stage play and theatrical feature film of the same title, bringing the life of this English professor to a wide popular audience. Today, millions continue to read, enjoy, and benefit from the remarkable works of C.S. Lewis.

Happiness is the result of inner maturity. It depends on us alone, and requires patient work, carried out from day to day. Happiness must be built, and this requires time and effort. In the long term, happiness and unhappiness are therefore a way of being, or a life skill. (Matthieu Ricard.)
Today is Monday morning, a new week starts today and I decide to make the most out of it. It is a sunny day, my beloved are all in good health, I stretch out and fix breakfast. I am about to enter my office but then I decide to water my garden before it gets too hot, I pet my dogs and then share a coffee with a relative.
I start work with the usual routine, check mails for about an hour and when I was at this, I find a mail from a long-lost friend in Germany. I feel my heart flooded with this warm feeling I have whenever I hear from a friend I have not heard of for quite a while. How good to know she is doing fine, she lives in a caravan surrounded by the wind, flowers and birds. She is happy!!!!
After answering mails, I start the serious staff: prepare the sections of the Pronunciation course I am going to teach soon and delight at the idea of imagining the teacher trainees doing the different activities and sharing a good laugh together. I am happy !!!!!!!!!
As I grow older I have become more passionate about teaching, giving and sharing. I have been a teacher and a professor at different universities for a long time and now I am privileged to have become a teacher trainer and mentor.
I love exchanging experiences with other teachers and have become quite hooked to using web tools in my teaching.
I like plants, flowers and animals and am very concerned about our living planet. I am inspired by the Dalai Lama and am blessed for being happy almost all the time.

As many commentators have pointed out, this move to grab money from bank deposits in Cyprus is a violation of the sacrosanct deposit insurance guarantee we all think keeps us safe. The fact is that if you save money in a bank, the authorities know exactly how much and where it is and can take it anytime (and call it a “levy” or a “tax”). This is not a good trend.
The original terms of the bailout called for a one-time tax of 6.75 percent on deposits of less than €100,000, and a 9.9 percent tax on holdings of more than €100,000. The moves are designed to raise €5.8 billion of the total €10 billion bailout cost — a condition imposed by Cyprus’s E.U. partners.
Under a new plan put forward by Mr. Anastasiades early Tuesday, depositors with less than €20,000 in the bank would be exempt, but the taxes would remain in place for accounts above that amount.
Um, maybe they should rethink those water quality standards? End Times: The Bank Won’t Let You Have Your Money Back!

Women of African descent have been resilient, finding ways to survive for themselves and their children when in hostile environments. In so doing, transnational women of the African Diaspora emerged, revealing a multigenerational process of transformation occurring over time. Using an African Feminist perspective, this study examines what propelled the transformation that led to identity "Reformation"—trans-racial family origins, transnational family origins, and immigration. Although identity re-formation had been occurring throughout the Western Hemisphere since the slavery era, the geo-political nature of the twentieth century provided venues for African Diaspora identity formation.

How can you convince apathetic audiences that your museum is worth a visit? Begin by creating a single content plan for your entire museum.
Have you ever been frustrated to learn that your volunteers weren’t invited to a relevant donor event? Or members didn’t know about that big program? Or, the last email your museum sent didn’t include anything about the big sale in the store next week?
These problems cost your museum money and probably result in increased call volume, confusion and poor customer service experiences. They also make it difficult for your audiences to stay informed about what’s happening at your museum.
Looking at it from the audience perspective, they receive disjointed communications that are written in different voices, not tailored to their needs and require them to do the legwork to connect the dots to the missing or incomplete info. And, they just don’t have time for that.
A unified content plan will help your organization focus on the most important messages for each of your audiences. Every time they hear from you, they will hear consistent ideas, instructions and values. (Not the same, but consistent – an important distinction.)
The content plan will have some ancillary benefits, too, like breaking down internal silos, improving internal communication, boosting collaboration and identifying cost savings.
Maybe you can think of more? If so, good! The goal is to create a comprehensive list of all the information audiences encounter when they do interact with you. Once you’ve compiled the list, the real fun begins. Use your list to build a content planning team. Actually, you need two teams.
To actually create and implement a museum-wide content plan, you need an executive team to make decisions and support the plan and you need a planning and implementation team to make it happen.
The executive team should include department heads or VPs (whatever you’ve got) and your director or CEO. Include the lead of every affected department or you’re doomed to fail. If you can’t get the support of this group, it will be impossible to implement the plan.
The planning and implementation team should include the owners of all the various pieces of content – within reason. Your team really shouldn’t exceed more than 10 people to be functional. If you end up with more than 10 owners, figure out how to appoint representatives that can speak to 2 or 3 areas. The key here is to get people on the team who are excited about the project and willing to roll up their sleeves and do the work. If you have to choose between an enthusiastic advocate that might need to circle back with subject matter experts (SMEs) and a super-smart, but reluctant SME, choose the advocate. Every time. You’ll spend too much time convincing the un-convincible SME that the project is actually worthwhile.
The key to success here is communication. Early and often. Keep everyone on the same page. Squash territory battles by leveling the playing field and make sure everyone is in the know. Appoint a project lead and make sure that person schedules meetings, takes notes and distributes updates.
Begin by compiling types of communications to flesh out the list above. What is already going out? Can anything be consolidated? Are any new communications needed? Make assignments and set deadlines for follow up to make sure these projects happen.
Build a content calendar using Google docs, or some other tool (preferably one your org already uses), to help you build a sharable plan that can be maintained easily.
Remember that the goal is to increase collaboration and improve communication, not document every little detail. Trying to micro-manage all the information in one place will end up failing. Keep it high-level and delegate content writing to the appropriate people.
Create a reasonable review process to keep everyone in the loop. Reasonable in this case is lightweight and scalable. Empower as few people as possible to approve the plan and the communications that come out of it. This might take some trial and error to find the right balance, but it’s worth it.
If you can manage this massive, but worthwhile, feat you’ll end up with a more focused voice for your museum and audiences that are happy to hear from you – and if you stick to it, those audiences will come more often, be more engaged and even spend more money.
In this book Clive Benney continues his photographic journey around St Agnes and takes the reader through Rosemundy and up to Goonown and Goobell.

The story of the search for the figurehead of The Lady Agnes, a ship built in 1877 on the beach at Trevaunance, St Agnes.
The other day on a run, I got lost. Normally, getting a little turned around isn’t a big deal, but normally I’m not on my third day in a new city in Central Asia. Oops. Fortunately, like the other times I’ve been lost while running, I eventually found where I was supposed to be going, and before finding my route, I found something that made the whole debacle worthwhile.
I ended up a lot further away from my house than I originally planned – near the American University of Central Asia, Bishkek’s main square, and a gigantic Lenin statue. Next to these landmarks is a very pleasant park that I’ll be returning to once I can muster the distance again.
It’s called Oak Park, which is something I learned after describing it in detail to my host mom, who was concerned about why I was out so long. (“Oak Park is not nearby! Olivia, you should pay attention to where you’re going!” “Sorry, Mira…”) It’s similar to a typical park you might find in other parts of the city – it’s got fountains, cuddling teenagers on every couple of benches, people walking dogs in sweaters, and some old Soviet busts.What really makes it more interesting than other Bishkek parks (there are many) is its collection of stone sculptures and statues. From a distance, most of the sculptures look like large rocks, scattered amongst the trees and next to the pathways. As you get closer, you realize the tallish, orange rock is a woman wearing a headscarf, and that oblong one is a kind of rhinoceros, and he’s crying. There’s a woman hugging a fish (or maybe it’s part of her?), an infinity symbol, and plenty of other pieces depicting I’m not exactly sure what.
At one end of the park is a monument to Kurmanjan Datka, an important Kyrgyz military and political leader of the 19th century. She stands elevated in the middle of an arch of columns and looks over a small square that seems to be a popular meeting place for young people. On another side of the park looms the Red Guard Memorial, a tall, red obelisk topped with the classic Soviet hammer and sickle.If you wander Oak Park long enough, you also might find an oversized Marx chatting with an equally large Engells, just opposite the American University of Central Asia.
The park is a peaceful place to run, chat with friends, or ponder how exactly you’re going to find your way home. Whether you’re interested in planning a quick walk or a long afternoon in this park, you can find it off of Abdumomunova or Pushkin street, in between Tynystanov and Razzakov streets. It’s open 24/7, but is probably most pleasant in the daylight, either covered in snow or in the summer sun.
Olivia Route is an undergraduate studying Russian and International Relations at the University of Pennsylvania. She has previously spent summers in Russia and is excited to spend a semester exploring the former Soviet Union through SRAS’s Policy and Conflict program. Olivia likes running, eating, nature, and art.
