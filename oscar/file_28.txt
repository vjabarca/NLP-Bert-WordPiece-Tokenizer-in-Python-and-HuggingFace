Saving Sweet Briar, Inc. was established to block the closure of Sweet Briar College and provide accurate information to students, faculty, and alumnae about the true financial condition of Sweet Briar College and the viable alternatives to closure. The organization is also dedicated to raising the necessary funds to fight the closure and help erase the school’s financial shortfall. Saving Sweet Briar, Inc. is also committed to identifying highly talented individuals who can serve on the Sweet Briar College Board of Directors to help lead an immediate turnaround for the institution while developing a longer term strategy with input from key stakeholders. Success in achieving our mission will ensure that future generations of women can proudly call themselves Sweet Briar alumnae.
In their own words, they all wish to be “out of a job” and see themselves as temporary stewards. An example of the kind of top-notch experts they have hired to provide advice and guidance for the future include a forensic accountant, R. Stephen Spitzer, and a college turnaround expert with solid examples of other institutions. The Board vets candidates for a new Board; they have a list of interested College Presidents with proven turnaround experience; experts on a number of fields are being vetted to provide real advice for the future.
We need money to support our school! Given the state of financial aid and higher ed, Sweet Briar needs to grow its endowment to stay viable. Crowdfunding information to follow.
In the meantime, the thousands of alumnae have managed to create an organizational structure rivaling some of the largest Universities (I speak with experience working for a B1G school, University of Maryland and serve on the University Senate). There are literally HUNDREDS of Committees of EXPERTS in their professional areas reporting up through Chairs who compile the information into master documents. The first of these documents, a Strategic Plan, was delivered to the Saving Sweet Briar board in time for the first injunction hearing. There are PhD experts, attorneys, professional fundraisers, accountants, social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, medical doctors, coaches, scientists, elected officials, C-suite executives of every type providing advice that the College — any College or nonprofit — would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure (I say this with experience having watched schools hire consultants for narrowly focused work and deliverables). Sweet Briar College itself by the Board’s own admission paid over $1 MILLION for a report that was never concluded and the Board members were not able to keep after reading it and voting to close the College.
Committee Structure. This is a case for the power of social media if there ever were one. Facebook, in particular, has provided the platform for alumnae to organize their efforts. Early in the process, pages were created for experts to share suggestions in different areas in the “Saving SBC Professional Roundtable” (a closed group so not hyperlinked here). Categories include every aspect of operations:
Academic Affairs, Admissions, Development/Fundraising, Diversity, Career Counseling, College Placement, Grounds & Facilities, Information Technology, Land (Creative Use of/Maintaining), Legal, Student Affairs, Social Life.
Each group has professionals who have spent their careers in these areas with best practices to share. The alumnae’s willingness to help is not just lip service. Examples of alumnae offers and efforts to assist include:
Deferred maintenance problems? Check. Habitat for Humanity-like plans for improvement including painting, plastering and even building repair by licensed contractors paid for by alumnae or their own companies. These are documented offers to help as they cannot execute these plans without coordination from the facility leadership.
Admissions/Recruitment problems? Check. Alumnae from around the Country have offered to reinvigorate a dormant network of volunteers to attend College Fairs, visit area feeder schools (and aspirant feeder schools), house admissions staff traveling, personally write interested students and their families. In addition, the Alumnae Angel Network are alumnae who sponsor students needing support transferring to another College. Even if this might mean losing a student needed for the future, the movement is supporting the current students in tangible ways.
Fundraising problems? Check. As of this writing, over $1 million in cash is in the Saving Sweet Briar accounts. Over $10 million in pledges over five years are being held in trust by Saving Sweet Briar for the College once the closure decision is reversed and there is a Board and Administration committed to the future. A Major Donor Task Force (of which I am a part) has weekly conference calls to coordinate outreach to past donors to the College and those who care and aren’t even affiliated. A Regional Task Force from each state writing to their residents, particularly those not on social media. Liaisons to classes (a traditional way to communicate with alumnae) share information on a weekly and even daily basis with links to give, participate and support. All of this has been accomplished without the tools fundraisers usually have (I know because I am one). For example, a donor database has been faithfully RECREATED through years of magazines publishing giving information and even programs from past campaign celebrations kept as keepsakes — now data for a defacto giving database. It is INCREDIBLE to watch and witness. This is worthy of its own blog post, stay tuned.
Communications Strategy? Check. The initial news stories reported the Board’s decision to close. The news of the alumnae outcry and mobilization was relegated to the comment section of most stories. However, the tide has turned. Now, major news outlets are reporting on the success of the alumnae efforts and on the amazing accomplishments of our alumnae, the morning of my writing the New York Times wrote about our alumnae and the efforts to save the College. This type of media battle and reversal of message does not happen easily. It has occurred through professionals and passionate individuals working with contacts to share opinion, provide worthwhile facts to report, verify stories and share perspective. Interestingly, the headlines of some of the earlier stories have changed from “College imploding” to “Alumnae Fight Closure”.
Conspiracy Theories? Check. One of my favorite movements within the Saving Sweet Briar collective, is a group a la Erin Brokovich that dedicates itself to researching the “back story”. The team (which includes some with investigative journalism experience) posts pieces of documents, theories, lists, etc. and a broad network do their further work and reports results. Some of these get passed along – once vetted — for journalists or the Saving Sweet Briar Board. Just when my own efforts to Save Sweet Briar might flag or my confidence wane or my enthusiasm might be dampened by some new comment by the “President”, someone from the group will post some new theory or angle that gets me MAD. They have even inspired and commissioned political cartoons. I have the one of the women turning over the rock next to my phone (for when I “dial for dollars”).
Imagine – just imagine – if their efforts were harnessed BEFORE the College announced it must close.
Sweet Briar is receiving DAILY national attention. Sweet Briar students, faculty, staff, alumni and community are rallying to share their expertise. The future IS bright and there is much to hope for with this kind of passion.
At this point, I cling to the other Margaret Mead quote – the one you know by heart – because I am seeing it validated on an hourly basis.
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed it is the only thing that ever has. — Margaret Mead
Our aim is not the world for now. For now it is a small piece of the planet located in Southern Virginia, Sweet Briar.
The announced closure of Sweet Briar College provides much fodder for every stage of grief. The current President and leadership’s statements continue to horrify many alumnae and the public at large. Each time the President takes the microphone or speaks to press, the quotes get worse. The President of the Board, the President, the President’s wife and other leaders: How is it possible in 2015 that people could speak this way?
Rich girl days? Really? While every School and College may have a percentage of students whose parents are able to pay for tuition without any loans or grants being taken and provide for many of the extras, Sweet Briar has never been a majority “rich girl school”. Even back to the founding days of the College there were scholarships for financial need and students were able to work in all types of jobs to provide for their education and expenses.
Jones told The New York Times that for students who entered Sweet Briar in fall 2014, 37% are first-generation college students, 32% are minorities, and 43% received Pell grants — federal financial aid grants for low-income undergraduates.
To use this statement as a reason for the College closing is one of the most egregious Jones has made and has generated widespread ire. To have this statement made as a negative is extremely unfortunate. Some have picked up on this statement and repeated it in front of current students and their families both on campus and around the country — as if this is a negative. Colleges and Universities across the country are THANKFULLY becoming more diverse in many ways — racially, socio-economically. Mr. Jones’ wife describes it this way in a public Class of 1969 webpage:
Then you thought about the cost of four years of college today. That cost is far beyond what an average American middle class family can afford without great sacrifice and careful financial planning. But, Sweet Briar had a world-class riding program, so surely there were girls from super wealthy families attending, weren’t there?
Evidently not, Mrs. Jones. The majority of families in higher education today are described by the statistics your husband quoted and the average middle-class family. Sweet Briar should embrace these students and their families. A school of “girls from super wealthy families” is never a goal for even families who are blessed with extraordinary wealth. Diversity is a blessing to all.
Mr. Jones’ comments not only appeared in print, but on a call with thousands of alumnae he was bold to say:
“I guarantee you that the students of today and the students applying are not of the same caliber as your generations.”
This phrase has been repeated by some in support of closure and is extremely disrespectful for current students and their families.
Frankly, students who are bringing in Pell Grant income may be, in fact, contributing significantly to the bottom line. I raised a question to the former President when I visited for my 25th Reunion and she said, “It is the traditionally full-pay families who are sometimes paying the least – because they know they can negotiate. ”
Every school has a range of socio-economic diversity. To blame the closing of the school on a change in the percentages is irresponsible and offensive.
Horsy school on the hill? Good grief. One of Sweet Briar’s STRENGTHS which continues (based on this year’s award winning season) is its equestrian program. While a small percentage of Sweet Briar students ride horses and an even smaller percentage of students bring horses with them, to describe the College this way indicates a complete lack of awareness of the award-winning program as well as the successful athletes, including Lendon Gray, a three-time Olympian. Our award-winning sports teams and incredible coaches are one of the hallmarks of Sweet Briar — and frankly any College or University. Riding is something that gives us a niche and a good reputation.
2011 is a full enrollment cycle away from 2015 where we are now. It is very unfortunate that the College did not conduct a professional feasibility study of its alumnae testing REAL issues and themes. The last feasibility study of 200 alumnae was conducted by staff members (I have spoken to many alumnae who gave when I worked at the College and who participated in this study – they cited no confidentiality as staff were the interviewers; no theme of any concerns; no details about giving levels). This was a huge missed opportunity. Alumnae assert that the College did not come to them and the fundraising ability they have shown — in incredibly creative ways — is inspiring (to this fundraiser in particular).
To say that the “changing demographics” made it impossible to conduct a large-scale fundraiser is completely offensive. This was my reaction initially and then I heard from the editor of the leading industry publication in my field (when she read about Jones’ and Shank’s statements)
I didn’t attend Sweet Briar, but I have to say that as a person of color (and donor to causes I care about) this bit attributed to the institution raised my ire.
By the way — news flash — one of the most generous groups of alumni are those who received scholarships and support themselves because they feel a duty to give back. Some of the world’s leading philanthropists did not come from wealth — someone helped them. Chances are, your “changing demographics” may actually be the source of great support in the future.
Jones said that, at Sweet Briar, going coeducational did not seem like a simple solution. He said that such a move would have required lots of money for scholarships and facilities, and he wasn’t subtle about the purpose of the spending. “We would need scholarships to basically buy males,” he said.
Buying males? Are you kidding me? I have two sons, one college age. He is not “for sale”. He chose to attend a small, liberal arts College in the Midwest. As a parent, I would have loved to have him consider Sweet Briar (albeit with a different male-counterpart name). I imagine there would have been many more interested and they would not have to be “bought”. Even if it is true that merit or scholarship support might be necessary in a greater percentage initially, to frame it as “buying males” is just disgusting.
“You don’t just take ‘ladies’ off of every other bathroom door and put ‘men’ up,” Rice said. “You have to add programs and facilities, athletics. All of these things take significant investment and time.”
This is the Chair of our Board folks. Obviously, a co-ed environment requires some adaptations. There are men and women’s bathrooms in every facility on campus as it is. How do you think we get through Reunions? We have men and women in dorms, attending events and classes all across campus. It would not be terribly difficult to allocate a dorm for male students. We have sons of current faculty and staff who attend Sweet Briar. With the new athletic facility, a key asset was available. Furthermore, the College has capacity for far more students than it current enrolls, so even a small percentage of men initially could no doubt have been accommodated. To hear this decision dismissed so callously down to labels on bathrooms doors is embarrassing and does not instill confidence in the decision making or deliberations of the Board.
In the initial announcement about the closure of the College, the President seems to indicate that people just don’t chose a College like Sweet Briar anymore. He wrote,
“While the College has long been part of my life, as my wife is a 1969 graduate…..The board, some key alumnae and I have worked diligently to find a solution to the challenges Sweet Briar faces. This work led us to the unfortunate conclusion that there are two key realities that we could not change: the declining number of students choosing to attend small, rural, private liberal arts colleges and even fewer young women willing to consider a single-sex education, and the increase in the tuition discount rate that we have to extend to enroll each new class is financially unsustainable.”
This statement is telling because it seems to be that there was just a small group of “key” alumni who convinced themselves there was no hope. He then refers to them as “us”. Clearly, he left out the voices of thousands of alumni and his own faculty and staff who had very brilliant ideas (and who debunk with facts and figures the statements of why they needed to close).
It seems President Jones, the Board Chair and others have forgotten that there are HUNDREDS of current students at Sweet Briar College who HAVE chosen to attend a small, rural, private liberal arts college. There are also HUNDREDS of small, rural, private liberal arts colleges who are open and have smaller endowments than Sweet Briar.
Mrs. Jones, the President’s wife, uses some of the same language in the Class of 1969 webpage where she issues a public comment.
Why were the grounds not pristine as they had always been? You noticed the peeling paint, the shabby parlors, the rotting balcony about to fall off of Alumnae House, and that uneasiness grew…. Maybe you just wanted to let this new president know that it was not “the Sweet Briar way” to have the campus looking like this.
Shabby parlors? “The Sweet Briar Way?” Actually, due to surging enrollment, many of the parlors had turned into dorms and office spaces. That isn’t such a bad thing. And, yes, deferred maintenance was a problem, but no one had thought to appeal to the alumna who have since offered to organize a Habitat-for-Humanity like work project along with funding to catch up. Some people find older homes charming….
Even though you knew the demographics information: students in 2014 were turning away from single sex colleges, they were flocking to schools in urban and suburban areas that offered more vocational type curricula, they were more concerned about spending their education dollars to be trained for a job than looking for a broad liberal arts education.
Mrs. Jones, you forgot to add the important lack of a Starbucks that your husband was quoted as saying on the call with alumnae about the closure. Seriously though, there ARE people who choose small Colleges and liberal arts education still thrives.
“If we make the decision to close now, we will have a better opportunity to conclude academic operations in an orderly, compassionate and ethical way that pays homage to those who are here today and to those who came before us.”
This sounds like someone with their hands folded in their lap, speaking to a child. Perhaps it was expected that Sweet Briar alumnae would behave like “good girls” and just take this decision and go quietly onto other interests. But, no, President Jones describes our reaction this way:
Patronizing has never had a better example than this. This is classic male behavior and language. “Irrational” is such a convenient word for men, perpetuating their sense of superiority. This is CLASSIC sexism used to describe essentially what is a different way of being. One of the reasons we attend Sweet Briar is to learn such things (I was a Psychology major). Men tend to think they are logical and not use feeling words; women aren’t afraid to express and use their emotion. Emotion is the antithesis of logic. When men perceive women as being too emotional (or a way you don’t want us to be), men say women are being irrational. Crazy. Wrong. Overwrought. Minimizing somebody else’s feelings is trying to control them. If they no longer trust their own feelings and instincts, they come to rely on someone else to tell them how they’re supposed to feel. I suspect this is how a percentage of our alumnae are feeling right now (I’ll refrain from using decade generalizations) because they have people around them telling them how to feel and pointing out those who resist in negative ways. I hope they can free themselves of this path and find their voice.
The press release regarding the President and Board’s refusal to step down refined the term to describe the #SaveSweetBriar movement as:
The number of alumnae who turned out to welcome students back from their spring break — traveling far and wide — outnumbered the entire population of campus. The funds raised in 10 days exceed the entire fundraising goal for the year. The faculty unanimous voted in opposition to the Board and President. Dismissing this energy and commitment shows how out of touch the President is with the stakeholders of the institution.
To CBS, Mr. Jones was asked by the interviewer, “Was there anything anyone could do?” Mr. Jones replied,
Mr. Jones doesn’t think there was or is anything anyone could do because he is surrounded by such a small group of pessimistic people. In fact, once alumnae, faculty and parents learned of the President and Board’s decision, THOUSANDS have rallied and raised MILLIONS. Clearly he does not see the future and sees nothing that could be done. The logical thing for him to do is step down and allow those who see a future and have more creative ideas to lead.
These are just a few examples of how NOT to talk about women, diversity and education in 2015. Certainly not as leaders of an institution with current students, parents, faculty, staff and thousands of alumnae hanging on your every word.
This alumna is embarrassed by your comments and have found myself apologizing to people well beyond the walls of Sweet Briar — including leaders in higher education and the national media.
Our Country and World is reeling from situations, episodes and terrorism inflicted by individuals and groups . As I write, the march in France decrying the terrorism against the Charlie Hebdu attacks and the Kosher grocery store in Paris is underway. In the U.S. episodes between police and perpetrator/victim (depending on how you see it) are making national news and are frequent topics of discussion.
Ahmed Merabet’s (the police officer gunned down by the Charlie Hebdue terrorists) eulogy is worth reading on this topic and I want to share it here in case you did not see it. This speech by Ahmed’s brother Malek, did not draw the television cameras as the 44 global leaders did, but probably should have.
My brother was French, Algerian, and of the Muslim religion. He was very proud of the name Ahmed Merabet, proud to represent the French police, and to defend the values of the [French] Republic: liberty, equality and fraternity.
Through his determination, he had just received his judicial police diploma and was shortly due to leave for work in the field. His colleagues describe him as a man of action who was passionate about his job.
Ahmed, a man of commitment, had the will to take care of his mother and his relatives following the death of his father 20 years ago. A pillar of the family, his responsibilities did not prevent him from being a caring son, a teasing brother, a generous uncle, and a loving companion.
Devastated by this barbaric act, we associate ourselves with the pain of the families of the victims.
One must not confuse extremists with Muslims. Madness has neither color nor religion. I want to make another point: stop painting everybody with the same brush, stop burning mosques or synagogues. You are attacking people. It won’t bring back our dead, and it won’t appease our families.
Upon reflecting on this, I think about my own religion and a recent case of a senior leader, Heather Cook, striking and killing a very popular cyclist, Thomas Palermo. Rallies have been ridden in his memory and the case has made our local and regional news. She has been charged with vehicular manslaughter, being drunk and texting while driving.
No one has asked me to answer for her or asked me to speak on behalf of Episcopalians everywhere about her actions. Is this indicative of a larger problem? Yes. Because I happen to be part of a religious tradition that isn’t seen in a stereotypical way (well, it is, but not in ways that impact my daily life and how people treat me).
I’ve worked with and been a part of the Episcopal Church for many years and I’ve known of numerous religious and lay people with drinking problems. I’ve also known many who have extreme views and have left the Episcopal Church for the Anglican movement. I attended church in Charleston, South Carolina a few years ago and was horrified at what I heard from the pulpit (blatant sexism and racism and unapologetic condemnation of various groups). Thankfully, I know that these types of extreme views are not shared by the majority of Episcopalians.
There are many radical Christians who commit murder and hurt other groups in the name of Christianity. I am not asked to answer for them or seen differently for what they do.
Well, my friends who are Muslim ARE asked to answer for people within their tradition who do extreme things. These friends are treated differently by their neighbors, community, colleagues because there is a new fear – stereotype – that is applied to members of their religious tradition.
How would I feel if everyone who knew I was Episcopalian thought I was an alcoholic, or that I’d killed people while driving drunk or texting? Or that I am racist? Or that I am sexist? I know this is a pathetic example, but I know I would feel pretty bad and probably also angry. I don’t even KNOW the Bishop who struck and killed a cyclist in my town. I certainly don’t think I could answer for her – and wouldn’t want to.
On my Facebook page and in conversations, some of my friends are advocating all sorts of pretty radical responses to the French attacks – which lumps in the terrorist monsters with all people who are Muslim.
So, to them and to those who think this way, I bring to light Malek Merabet’s words and vow to do my small part in bring about a change to the stereotyping, Islamaphobic, and anti-semitic tide.
Today, “Gone with the Wind” (a.k.a. “the boat”) was in a marina near Annapolis. She (boats are referred to as “she”) was parked under a tree. This is not good when tiny scuppers designed just for salt water get filled with leaves and seed pods. This leads to the cockpit filling with water. When the snows fall, things can really go badly.
My Dad asked me to help rig a tarp over the boat on this uncharacteristically balmy day in December.
We arrived at the Marina in the late afternoon. The marina was a sea of boats. It is a surreal experience walking amidst a marina of boats. Kind of like walking through a forest of trees with glinting sunlight through the spaces of all of the hulls and keels nestled together like puzzle pieces.
It took us a while to find “Gone with the Wind”. The boat was renamed when my Dad purchased the boat after he and my Mom separated. It was previously named “Freedom”, which seemed a bit too “in your face”. The lettering matches the movie. Over the years, Gone with the Wind has seen more than her fair share of adventures (but that’s for another story).
Even though my parents are divorced, they have found a way to work together over the years. They never made us choose over the holidays, for example. We could celebrate with both of them.
Today our task was to make a tent over the boat with a tarp. All around us were beautifully-wrapped boats in white plastic perfectly hermetically sealed. My Dad and I unfurled our tarp and lines. We balanced a ladder against the boat and – precariously – we got up onto the deck. A sea of boats facing all different directions surrounded us. The sun was setting and the temperature was starting to drop.
The tarp was 9 ml plastic. Suffice it to say, it was not the flexible kind. We managed to get the tarp over the boom and laced together the front around the mast. A pattern began to emerge whereby we crossed the front and fastened it to the rails. We pulled the tarp over the sides of the rails. My father lashed the tarp around the keel with the grommets placed every few feet. Inside our (now very dark tent), I worked on sweeping up all of the leaves and seed pods.
As my father worked below the “waterline”, I worked above. Once we finished, only a tiny bit of daylight peeked through. “Gone with the Wind” was “ship shape” as they say. My final task was to literally stitch the stern closed which reminded me of my wedding dress which my father tied on my wedding day.
Mission accomplished! We took some final photos of our work to shoot to my Mom and made our way home.
I started the morning at my Mother’s house. Sometimes she needs help moving things from place to place so that she can do more. My Mom is one of the most talented and hardworking people I know.
So, I spent the morning moving boxes, organizing shelves, as my friend Christina would say, “Turning piles into files…” Out the front door I went with 20 boxes, discarded bags of all kinds, bags and bags of trash.
I love how my Mom says, “We”. This used to annoy me, but now I find it endearing. “We need to find a place for this…”, “We need to make some order out of this.” We found 20 pair of no longer useful hopalong boots and shoes. We found discarded toys, school bookbags and boxes of books.
Now that we have moved boxes out of the way and cleared a path in the middle of her basement, a craft zone has emerged. This feels familiar.
My Mom is a very talented person. Growing up, she made our clothes. She made my skating costumes. She had a business making amazing skating bags out of quilted fabrics before Vera Bradley even existed. I remember her staying up all night long while I was a teenager waking me up to go skating and she had never slept (trying to fulfill orders from skaters all over the country for bags before Christmas). I would give anything to have one of those bags. Fortunately, I do have some of her hand-beaded skating costumes.
Growing up, there was always a project at Christmas. Throughout my house and the homes of our relatives, my Mother’s handiwork adorns many homes. Hand-painted Santas with historical details; painted angels; ornaments made with tinted glue and gold thread; amazing glittering ornaments on my tree including angels, a country stagecoach, santa, elves.
The best Christmas craft was making personalized nutcrackers after my sons including their current hairstyles, soccer balls and numbers on their
Talent flows through our family tree. My Aunt sent us quilted hand-made gifts each year. Her tree adorns a table in our family room. The woven wreath is on the back door.
Later in life, cookbooks were the project. Collected recipes from family bound in special notebooks wrapped in red taffeta, embossed with gold foil and held together with gold and red cord. I still turn to that cookbook at the holidays.
I brought my Mom a ham-bone when I arrived (promised after our Thanksgiving ham). Throughout my visit, the aroma of ham and bean soup filled her home.
My Mom’s current talents are around food. Canning in particular. the shelves of her basement are lined with soups, stews and sauces of all kinds. I’ve learned if I spend a few hours, I might get to savor one of her creations.
Over some of her canned (the Mason jar kind) amazing tomato soup, we had a serious discussion sharing our perspective over some of the things our family has gone through in the past few years. We differed in perspective, but we aligned on a commitment to move ahead. She reminded me of the goodness in places and people where I’ve found it challenging to see the good. I respect my Mom as a Mom. And for her good thoughts. And for her talent.
After posting for a bit on our Honeymoon Everyday blog, it seemed there were some experiences worth sharing that were best in their own place.

There have been some great improvements lately in the downtown area. (I assumed the DDA was doing most of them, but I don’t see anything on their web site).
Of course, we have all heard about the LED traffic street lights. Now there are new bicycle racks on many downtown streets. The crosswalk lights in the Main Street area have countdown timers. And finally, finally, all the parking structures now have these nifty “Parking Spaces Available” signs.
Car Talk ran a puzzler recently asking listeners to identify the one great flaw of LED lights, and the answer turned out to be that they operate at such a cool temperature that they can’t melt snow that falls on them. Has anyone thought of this?
Great idea on the parking garages! I was driving up 4th street the other day and the garage at William & 4th (by Palio) showed that 666 parking spaces were left. Someone on the sidewalk pointed at it, all agog. Made me giggle (people, it’s just a number! :))
All the lights I’ve seen have protective shields over the tops so I’m not sure much snow would actually be around the light. Also, I can see where the freeze/thaw cycle would be more problematic than if the lights just stayed the same temperature as the air around them. And LEDs are a lot better than fluorescent lights, which don’t actually work well at all at low temperatures. But it is an interesting question. I guess we will see this winter.
The parking structure numbers are interesting. So far, my impression is that there are definitely more spaces available than I would have thought although I am not walking by at prime time. I heard that at noon on Thursday, there were only 49 spaces available at Ann Ashley, so that is fewer available than I would have thought. It will be interesting to see if posting the numbers changes parking behavior. My guess is that more people will park in the structures now.
If the parking availability signs was my idea, Todd, your memory is better than mine. One parking idea I do remember was suggesting to Susan Pollay that spaces be put in front of Ashley Mews on Main to support the businesses there (and increase downtown parking cheaply.) That one was nice to see implemented.
I have encouraged the LED lighting (both in the traffic signals and streetlights) and was quoted in the News about my appreciation of the demonstration lamps on Washington. But I’ve barely been a cheerleader—all the credit goes to City staff.
Snow on the lamps shouldn’t be a problem. The lights are appropriately aimed downward so as to not waste energy lighting the night sky. (Not by dint of the draft outdoor lighting ordinance, however, which is still under review and hasn’t been passed by council yet.) And even if temperature were an issue, the snow would insulate the lamps from radiating heat to the sky on clear nights. LEDs generate so little heat that I doubt that it matters.
I love the LED lights. I park a lot at the S Forest and when I see there are fewer than 100 spots open, I know I have to drive all the way to the top. Which speeds the hunting for a spot process. Makes my Ann Arbor driving experience that much more enjoyable.
As a follower of the Energy Commission… Do you know about the Green Energy Challenge? The Mayor put it out back in 05. It’s on the web page. The challenge is for the city to use 30% renewable energy by 2010 for everything, vehicles, streetlights, heat, hot water. They just put a solar hot water heater on the downtown fire station with more coming. The A2 news covered the LED’s last week.
The LED streetlights were initiated by city engineer Mike Bergren. He went out and found manufacturers and worked with them to develop prototypes. If you saw the news story you would know A2 is the first city in the country (maybe world) to start installing them. Tomorrow they are holding a press conference to announce wining a big award from the feds. Someone from the USA DOE is going to be there (Farmers Market at 10:30) along with Dingell and the mayor to kick it off. Hieftje got the DDA to cover the cost.
Fox 2 ran a slick 4 or 5 minute news story on the LED streetlights a week or two ago. Featured the mayor and Konkle. A2 is the first in the country to install them. I saw something in the Freep about it too. I think the story was picked up nation wide by the AP.
Julie, the “LED traffic lights” link should read “LED street lights”. The city’s traffic signals are also being converted to LEDs (colored ones), but I don’t know the progress of that effort other than that the new signals just installed in the Main Street area include them.
Two celebrities had birthdays recently, and the two men chose to celebrity their special days in ways that show what matters most to them.
Hugh Grant has been loudly protesting the British police and Conservative government's failure to stop News Corp's media outlets from hacking people's phones, which now looks like wasn't simple failure but some kind of evil right-wing parliamentary corporate collusion. Speaking to the press shortly after his birthday, he said he was glad British politicians had finally "grown balls" over this issue, which he hopes they'll keep. He's heading to Scotland soon, where he'll shoot Cloud Atlas with the Wachowskis. I bet he'll be playing Adam Ewing out on that South Pacific island.
James Gandolfini spent his birthday partying at a restaurant in Soho with friends, which he reportedly departed by hoisting himself onto the seat of Mario Batali's Vespa, which was also supporting Mario Batali, and lumbering off into the night like a half a ton of beef cheeks balanced on a gravy boat. "We thought they were going to die," said one partygoer, who I'm pretty sure was not joking.
Now let's think about how many candles were on each man's formidable birthday cake. It's time to play Who's Older?™!
One note about Hugh Grant: I'll admit that I loved his sensitive romantic-lead style when I was in high school and he played a wispy Chopin in Impromptu , but since Woody Allen cast him as a scheming double-crosser in Small Time Crooks , he's had a string of great movies where he's gotten to do some excellent work playing selfish jerks. He's gotten crinklier since the early 90's, but he's finally found the delicious kind of role he's best in, which has nothing to do with floppy haircuts and stammering.

Browsing the awesome repository of the Institute of Local Self-Reliance, I came across a great article from…2002! Maybe now is the time for these strategies to become mainstream.
Rising commercial rents are generally a good thing; they are an indication of the health of a business district and encourage landlords and banks to invest in building improvements.
But in some communities, commercial rents are rising too far too fast. Often this sudden run-up is driven by chain retailers, which discover the appeal of an area and sweep in by the dozens, offering above-market rents for choice spots and sparking a frenzy of speculation. Landlords raise rents across the board and opt not to renew leases for existing tenants in order to attract a national brand. Banks are often willing to lend building owners more capital at better terms if the lessee is a big-name tenant rather than an independent business, no matter how successful.
The displaced local businesses are not the only casualties of this process. The community as a whole suffers. Businesses that meet everyday needs, like the hardware store and the barber shop, are replaced by chains and upscale boutiques that primarily serve tourists and leisure shoppers. Residents are forced to shop elsewhere for basic items. The local economy becomes more dependent and vulnerable to outside forces—from boardroom decisions to stock market drops. Over time, building owners also lose as the character and unique appeal of the district evaporate. Why shop downtown when the mall has the same stores, free parking, and better weather?
For commercial districts undergoing a rapid rise in rents, or at risk of one, there are number of strategies that could help ensure that locally owned businesses continue to be part of the district:
The best way for a local retailer to maintain a stable location at a reasonable price is to buy the building his or her store occupies. Cities and states could encourage this through income or property tax incentives (in the same way that many jurisdictions tax owner-occupied apartment buildings at a lower rate than those with absentee landlords), or by providing low-interest loans for this purpose.
Community Land Trusts (CLTs) have been used effectively for thirty years in cities nationwide to maintain affordable housing. A CLT is a nonprofit corporation that buys property in a city and holds it in perpetuity for the benefit of the community. Homes on the properties are sold to low-income families at affordable prices. The land beneath the homes is leased indefinitely. When the family decides to sell the home, the CLT repurchases it for a price set by a formula that allows for a fair return on the family’s investment but maintains affordability for the next owner. (To learn more about CLTs, visit the Institute for Community Economics or Burlington Associates’ CLT Resource Center.)
The CLT model could be adapted for commercial districts with the requirement that buyers or lessees of CLT buildings be independent, locally owned businesses. Although a few CLTs have been involved in non-residential projects such as office space for nonprofits, to date none have been involved in maintaining affordable retail space. But there’s no reason the model would not work for this purpose, according to Julie Orvis of the Institute for Community Economics, the group that originated the CLT model and provides technical assistance and grants to help CLTs get started. In fact, the major source of funding for CLTs, HUD’s Community Development Block Grants, are available for both housing and economic development.
A city could buy a commercial building and contract for its management with the stipulation that space be leased only to local businesses. Rents would be stable and below market, reflecting the city’s actual costs of owning and maintaining the building with no profit. A town could also lease a building and sub-lease the spaces to local businesses at subsidized, below-market rates.
Another possibility raised by Donovan Rypkema of Place Economics is a land write down. It’s common for cities to buy land and resell it to developers for less than the acquisition price in exchange for the developer building a stadium or some other publicly desirable project. Communities could likewise target key downtown properties for re-conveyance with the stipulation that they house only locally owned retailers.
Communities should consider whether there are underutilized, perhaps run-down, commercial districts in the city where local businesses pushed out of high-rent areas might relocate. If so, the community might focus revitalization and economic development resources on making these districts vibrant and viable alternatives for local stores.
Many chain retailers will not open stores smaller than a certain size or that have street frontage of less than 25 feet. Maintaining the small-scale character of a retail district through zoning rules that stipulate maximum store sizes can reduce interest from national retailers and stave off gentrification. The Brookside neighborhood in Kansas City, for instance, limits stores to no more than 10,000 square feet and several San Francisco neighbors set limits at 4,000 square feet. Both have found these measures effective in keeping locally owned, neighborhood serving businesses.

Your teams are organized for play during a specific period of time or season. The teams that you'll define later exist only for that period of time. Typically, a team might play during the spring or fall, or perhaps for a whole year. The "Season" form allows you to define a season's name as well as it's beginning and end dates. Once defined, you'll use it to assign teams to and thus define their playing season.
To create a season, you'll use the "Seasons" menu choice on the Admin menu, Admin > Teams > Seasons. When clicked, this choice brings up a Season listing page that displays the seasons already defined. At the top of the page is a link titled "Add new Season." Click this link to bring up the Season Information form. The form has the following fields:
Type the name of the new season here, up to 32 characters. This is the name that will be displayed to the public so it should be descriptive but also as short as possible, such as "Spring 2012."
Keep in mind, you can only delete a season if all of the teams and leagues associated with that season have been removed.
Also, there is no reason to delete a season, unless it was a mistake :-). You can however hide seasons by editing each teams' settings and making them Not Public.

The hike up to Supin seems beautiful to us and we have already located each house in our mind, to be able to find them without any problem. There’s always a girl willing to help us with the shortcuts along the way, which are much appreciated!
The first joint meeting with the houses’ beneficiaries to whom we will do the retrofitting Works was very productive: they signed the agreement with the established conditions by both parties and we provided them with the list of necessary materials to start the works after the national holidays of Dashain.
Yesterday we did the first materials’ purchase in Hetauda for three of the five selected families, so we are already in full operation and eager to start the works!
On Sunday we will go back with the two pending families, to be able to buy their materials too, and thus have them all in Supin.
In our free time, we are also in charge of coordinating sports activities on Friday afternoons at the Khelkud Griha [The House of Sports, at the Dhunga Mato prototype].
Our intention is to create a habit for village boys and girls to get together doing sports in this versatile public space. In addition, we are lucky that Sebas is also a camp monitor and manages the organization very well. Last week was very successful with the boys and girls of Balmandir!! Let's see if we also get the Supping girls to come down to the ground and be part of this.
Let$D$be a convex domain with smooth boundary in complex space and let$f$be a continuous function on the boundary of$D$. Suppose that$f$holomorphically extends to the extremal discs tangent to a convex subdomain of$D$. We prove that f holomorphically extends to$D$. The result partially answers a conjecture by Globevnik and Stout of 1991.
We give a new characterization of the Orlicz–Sobolev space$W$^{1,Ψ}(R^{$n$}) in terms of a pointwise inequality connected to the Young function Ψ. We also study different Poincaré inequalities in the metric measure space.
We prove that the weak order on an infinite Coxeter group contains infinite antichains if and only if the group is not affine.
We describe the behavior of certain strictly plurisubharmonic functions near some real hypersurfaces in ℂ^{$n$},$n$≥3. Given a hypersurface we study continuous plurisubharmonic functions which are zero on the hypersurface and have Monge–Ampère mass greater than one in a one-sided neighborhood of the hypersurface. If we can find complex curves which have sufficiently high contact order with the hypersurface then the plurisubharmonic functions we study cannot be globally Lipschitz in the one-sided neighborhood.
We consider subordination chains of simply connected domains with smooth boundaries in the complex plane. Such chains admit Hamiltonian and Lagrangian interpretations through the Löwner–Kufarev evolution equations. The action functional is constructed and its time variation is obtained. It represents the infinitesimal version of the action of the Virasoro–Bott group over the space of analytic univalent functions.
The purpose of this note is to give an extension of the symbolic calculus of Melin for convolution operators on nilpotent Lie groups with dilations. Whereas the calculus of Melin is restricted to stratified nilpotent groups, the extension offered here is valid for general homogeneous groups. Another improvement concerns the$L$^{2}-boundedness theorem, where our assumptions on the symbol are relaxed. The zero-class conditions that we require are of the type $$|D^{\alpha}a(\xi)|\le C_{\alpha}\prod_{j=1}^R\rho_j(\xi)^{-|\alpha_j|},$$ where ρ_{$j$}are “partial homogeneous norms” depending on the variables ξ_{$k$}for$k$>$j$in the natural grading of the Lie algebra (and its dual) determined by dilations. Finally, the class of admissible weights for our calculus is substantially broader. Let us also emphasize the relative simplicity of our argument compared to that of Melin.
In this paper we consider operators of the form$H$=λ(-$i$∇), with λ analytic in a strip and with some specific growth conditions at infinity, and prove Hardy type estimates in$L$^{2}(ℝ^{$n$}) with exponential weights. In fact we extend our previous results [19] from bounded analytic functions on a strip to analytic functions with polynomial growth in that strip.
With a given holomorphic section of a Hermitian vector bundle, one can associate a residue current by means of Cauchy–Fantappiè–Leray type formulas. In this paper we define products of such residue currents. We prove that, in the case of a complete intersection, the product of the residue currents of a tuple of sections coincides with the residue current of the direct sum of the sections.
We show persistence of both Anderson and dynamical localization in Schrödinger operators with non-positive (attractive) random decaying potential. We consider an Anderson-type Schrödinger operator with a non-positive ergodic random potential, and multiply the random potential by a decaying envelope function. If the envelope function decays slower than |$x$|^{-2}at infinity, we prove that the operator has infinitely many eigenvalues below zero. For envelopes decaying as |$x$|^{-α}at infinity, we determine the number of bound states below a given energy$E$<0, asymptotically as α↓0. To show that bound states located at the bottom of the spectrum are related to the phenomenon of Anderson localization in the corresponding ergodic model, we prove: (a) these states are exponentially localized with a localization length that is uniform in the decay exponent α; (b) dynamical localization holds uniformly in α.

In this paper, the relation between algebraic shifting and join which was conjectured by Eran Nevo will be proved. Let σ and τ be simplicial complexes and σ*τ be their join. Let$J$_{σ}be the exterior face ideal of σ and Δ(σ) the exterior algebraic shifted complex of σ. Assume that σ*τ is a simplicial complex on [$n$]={1,2,...,$n$}. For any$d$-subset$S$⊂[$n$], let $m_{\preceq_{\textrm{rev}}S}(\sigma)$ denote the number of$d$-subsets$R$∈σ which are equal to or smaller than$S$with respect to the reverse lexicographic order. We will prove that $m_{\preceq_{\textrm{rev}}S}(\Delta(\sigma*\tau))\geq m_{\preceq_{\textup{rev}}S}(\Delta(\Delta(\sigma) *\Delta(\tau)))$ for all$S$⊂[$n$]. To prove this fact, we also prove that $m_{\preceq_{\textrm{rev}}S}(\Delta(\sigma))\geq m_{\preceq_{\textup{rev}}S}(\Delta(\Delta_{\varphi}(\sigma)))$ for all$S$⊂[$n$] and for all nonsingular matrices ϕ, where Δ_{ϕ}(σ) is the simplicial complex defined by $J_{\Delta_{\varphi}(\sigma)}=\textup{in}(\varphi(J_{\sigma}))$ .
Lighting Planners Associates (LPA) is an organisation of lighting specialists established in 1990 led by Kaoru Mende. The goal of LPA is to design and build outstanding lighting environments that enrich our architectural and lighting culture. Today, LPA has a total of 60 unique lighting specialists at its offices in Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong. While the majority of LPA projects are in the area of architectural lighting design, its many outstanding design accomplishments have reached to residential, hotel, office, commercial, public space, and landscape lighting as well as full-scale urban lighting projects. LPA is regarded as a leading lighting consultancy in the world.
The most important aspect of lighting design is learning from natural light. Through the designing for superior lighting environments, LPA strives to create comfortable, yet inspiring environments of daily life.
For a successful and elaborate lighting scheme, LPA recommends being commissioned for all the phases in every project. These phases include a wide range of services classified in the following order:
Office Complexes, Museums, Theaters and Auditoriums, Retail and Commercial Facilities, Hospitality Buildings, Residential Buildings, Healthcare, Transportation Facilities, Sports Facilities, Civic and Institutional Buildings, Educational and Religious Buildings
For projects in which detailed phase-wise involvement is not required, LPA offers consultancy services within which we contribute to the overall improvement in the visual environment. Such consultancy services are generally of the nature of limited time-based involvement in the following areas:
1. Consultation to Corporate firms on effective and efficient usage of their illuminated environments
2. Consultation to City Authorities and likewise organizations on procedures of evaluation and guidelines for the lighting aspect within Urban, Environmental and Architectural projects
LPA engages extensively in lighting product development, concept planning and applications design. We are also involved in collaborative development with industry manufacturers on product and systems design.
4. Investigative studies for the lighting industry dealing with effects of light on human behavior and cityscapes
LPA is constantly involved in lighting design education and tries to boost the prestige of lighting culture on a regional as well as global scale. The approach is to create an awareness of the benefits of good lighting and encourage good lighting practices across all demographics. LPA has experience in the following areas:
We like to be involved in projects right from the early stages (Concept Design Phase + Schematic Design Phase) to fully consider what the concept and theme should be for the lighting design. We use this phase to properly understand the architectural intent and strategy, and then based on the lighting requirements, are able to prepare a lighting design concept.
Based on the approved lighting concept, during this phase we present the necessary lighting effects and techniques for a project. Generally, there is always more than one possible lighting method, and we like to consider as many options as possible without limiting our freedom of thought and targeting the given conditions of a project. Also, approximate cost estimates are analysed through feasibility studies.
During this phase, we target feasible options from our initial design framework for finalisation. After many consultations with the Client, architects, and other consultants on the project, we analyse our design in greater detail to prepare documentation for approval. LPA lays emphasis on the overall cost of the lighting proposal and maintenance-friendly design during this phase.
During this stage, we will recommend to the Client, suitable contractors and/or suppliers/manufacturers who may be invited to submit tenders for the lighting works and supply contract, and assist the Client and other appropriate professional consultants where necessary in short-listing of tenderers. Drawings, Specifications, Schedules and Details that are necessary for the sake of complete comprehension of our design intention and strategy are given to the tenderers. We also assist the Client in evaluating the tender returns and the acceptability of the prices quoted. Interviews and sample tests are also part and parcel of this stage.
Lighting design can only be complete at the construction site. Many times, drawings alone cannot correctly communicate our design intent and to clarify our ideas to the builders on-site, we hold a special lighting design briefing. We also anticipate the process and flow of each construction site to confirm lighting effects through mock up experiments on-site or to adjust for other design changes. Focusing and coordination of operation scene changes are important steps just before the final commissioning.
During this stage, we conduct the final setting up of the lighting scenes to our satisfaction and to match the design intention. A maintenance schedule is prepared and handed over to the Client for future reference. The Client and consultants are usually invited to the site to see for themselves the lighting effect and feedback is taken. Minor tweaking to the lighting effect may be made during this stage. Any defects noticed are notified to the relevant parties for immediate rectification within the Defects Liability Period. A certificate of completion is also handed over to the Client from us.

Recognising nine organisations and individuals who use digital technology to improve lives everywhere.
For disabled people, this software has long been an invaluable tool for those unable to type, use a mouse, or write.
Paul Smyth, accessibility head of Barclays, explains the bank's plan to be the most accessible big company in Britain using assistive technology.
As a student Paul Smyth had to work twice as hard as his contemporaries, using binoculars to scan the blackboard in class and reading books with the help of a powerful magnifying glass.
Those early efforts to overcome a degenerative eye condition have stood him in good stead in his current position as IT Accessibility Head at Barclays Bank.
“I thought it was intensely unfair that people who face barriers in life had to continue to face them in accessing banking services,” he says.
For the past four years he has spearheaded Barclays’ drive to become “the most accessible and inclusive FTSE company”.
That bold objective was adopted in 2012 with Barclays’ introduction of talking cash machines. “Almost immediately we saw a significant uptick in customers with vision impairments coming to Barclays,” he recalls.
“Historically, Barclays had focused more on initiatives to recruit and support disabled employees but realising that accessible customer service was both good for business and good for society, we ramped up our efforts,” says Smyth.
The introduction of the new cash machines was followed by a day-long event to ensure senior managers running services such as high street banking and Barclaycard heard the views of disabled customers.
“It was a big turning point: other businesses have a disability champion; for us it was more important to have everyone championing disability.”
But it wasn’t just a one off event. “We had to systematically go about it: tracking trends and measuring ourselves through net promoter scores,” says Smyth.
The Net Promoter Score is marketing jargon for answers to the question “would you recommend us to your friends?”
With help from this kind of feedback Smyth and his colleagues were able to see the impact of each innovation they made.
For example, deaf people do not use the phone, and find it difficult to communicate with branch staff.
Three years ago Barclays introduced a virtual sign language interpreter service in partnership with SignVideo, enabling a deaf customer to use a home PC and a webcam to contact their bank. In 2015 the service was extended to bank branches through frontline staff’s iPads.
“Before we introduced it deaf people had to wait up to two weeks for a human interpreter when booking a branch appointment but now we can offer a virtual interpreter instantly.”
People with cognitive impairments and problems with dexterity find passwords and security PINS a trial.
Voice biometrics, originally a service for corporate customers but now being rolled out to all Barclays customers, by-passes the need for passcodes by recognising someone’s unique voice patterns.
The software checks a client’s voice against their stored ‘voiceprint’, and verifies that the person is who they say they are.
Contactless cards and recently introduced wearables, for smaller transactions, do not require people to memorise PINs either when shopping.
At a time when online and mobile banking has become the norm for many customers, accessible services are a must.
Barclays has partnered with access consultants AbilityNet to be the first bank to independently accredit their most popular mobile apps – PingIt, Barclaycard and Barclays Mobile Banking.
As each app underwent a design refresh, disabled user testers and accessibility experts were involved from the outset to ensure that the app was both technically accessible but useable too.
Barclays has experimented with talking webpage plug ins and continues to seek feedback from users through their Barclays Launchpad app – a public site where the bank tests new features and designs that in time are dropped into main mobile apps. For example, fingerprint identification.
A chartered accountant by training, Smyth spent his first decade at Barclays in the finance department working to reduce the bank’s exposure to interest rate risk, hedging as it is called.
He became involved with the bank’s voluntary disability staff network and was asked to create a dedicated accessibility team and then to lead the digital accessibility agenda some four years ago.
“I did a complete career change that led to something of real interest to me. It is a labour of love.
“So far as IT accessibility is concerned I wear three hats. I am responsible for training and tools, helping others to learn about and deliver accessibility. And that is a big job because we have thousands of projects underway at any one time.
“I have an evangelist hat, spreading the word inside the organisation. And finally a policeman hat since I oversee compliance performance and measuring the benefits that improved access brings.
“Changing attitudes is an important part of the job, especially how comfortable and confident non-disabled colleagues in Barclays are with disability.”
It is a mission that reaches beyond Barclays itself. Business customers, for example, can learn about accessibility at a recently created portal aimed at smaller enterprises.
A module on accessibility will soon be added to Barclays Digital Driving Licence, a free elearning hub developed with the help of companies such as Microsoft and IBM and backed by the City and Guilds examination body.
“It is important with technology that everyone can use it,” says Smyth. “The accessibility module, based on AbilityNet’s MyComputerMyWay learning programme is trying to make everyone is aware of the built in accessibility settings (in their devices).”
The process of providing 30,000 digital and change people with the knowledge and tools to make the bank accessible seems a daunting task.
“We have to make sure they satisfy international standards. The World-Wide Web Consortium’s Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) may relate to developers but everyone has an obligation to understand, manage and meet accessibility requirements.”
To that end Smyth has boiled down the dry technical guidelines into a set of accessibility principles.
His team have also published a series of books containing personas, comic book characterisations of people with disabilities.
The personas, which are available for any organisation to use, make it clear what difficulties differently disabled people may face in everyday life and how they may use technology in different ways.
“Accessibility is getting more important but we need to make sure that developers get the right tools and training, for example, by trying to send a text using just their nose. These exercises provide light bulb moments and greater empathy.”
In addition to his Barclays day job, Smyth has also thrown himself into work with outside organisations, taking a leading role at the Business Disability Forum’s Technology Taskforce.
“I am proud of rewriting the accessibility maturity model which allows companies to measure their performance and compare it with peers,” he observes.
Smyth has also been instrumental in introducing to the UK a new certificate devised by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). He is looking to “professionalise the profession”.
“Historically bespoke AT solutions were created by niche suppliers for a narrow view of disabled users whereas now, mainstream manufacturers are applying inclusive design principles from building cars to kettles and major IT companies are enhancing built-in accessibility features.
“Accessibility is becoming of interest to more companies and of benefit to more consumers. It’s a fantastic time to be an accessibility professional.”
Looking ahead, Smyth sees new developments in prospect such as portable, personalised preferences that would allow individuals to identify themselves to any cash or vending machine and have it set up to suit their requirements.
In an age of increasing anxiety about cybercrime it is vital, he believes, to ensure that increased security does not result in increased complexity and the exclusion of disabled people.
Above all Smyth sees accessibility as a joint venture which is why Barclays is opening up its application programi Interfaces (APIs) so that they can be shared with other organisations.
The move is being driven by the Payment Services Directive which will require banks to open up to more competition and share information (assuming UK banks still adopt the Directive following Brexit).
“In a few years when details of customers will have to be shared with others you will have an interface that is user accessible on an aggregated portal (used by many financial institutions). It is an exciting prospect that will really improve accessibility.”

Frankly I sit home in my finally completely redecorated bedroom very tiresome to see 'social justice' being ranted over and over in the email lists and deafie blogs like a Carpathian tombstone spiriting a ghost out every 5 minutes or so.
The whole thing is really about evolution not social justice. As the world advances, everything in it advances as well. That includes methods of communication used by deaf people are advancing as well.
We don't use the telegraph any more, thats because we advanced ourselves up to using the telephones and cellphones. Thats because the technology is there and theres no resistance.
Now with the advancement of mitigation of hearing loss has gone to the point it is going to be rendering manual communications obsolete in the near future, why cant we just let it roll on and let ourselves advance with the rest of the civilization.
What I'm seeing is......a lot of resistance, a lot of whining, a lot of bickering, a lot of energies going to preserving something that could be useless in like 3 years from now. And theres the scourge cast upon people who stand behind these advancements by people who are resistant to the evolution.
The resistance is are the ones who are keeping us as second class citizens. They do that by sending out confusing signals to the hearing society. They did that by booting Fernandes out only to end up another president with same kind of spots on him. And they did that again at the AG bell workshop conference recently, not to mention the the way the Deaf Bilingual Coalition is going, and they'll do it again and again in the near future.
The price of all this childishness are being paid very dearly by people who are already trying to advance toward first class citizenship.
Come on, lets all grow up and let us our communities advance toward first class citizenship by stop resisting the evolution of deaf society.

luxe magazine wrote: Hancock: I’m working now on a big book on ancient America. Two main reasons for that; firstly, a lot of new science on the peopling of the Americas has taken a long time . It’s taken about 25 years to break the old paradigm. But the old understanding of the peopling of the Americas, which used to say there were no humans in the Americas before about 13,000 years ago, has now been completely overturned by new discoveries. Initially, those discoveries were resisted by the establishment very strongly, and many archeological careers were ruined – those archaeologists who were willing to acknowledge and older human presence. But lo and behold, they were right.
The information has now reached such a level that it has overwhelmed the old paradigm; the old paradigm cannot stand in the face of new evidence of humans in America 25,000 years ago, 50,000 years ago, and most recently, a big paper published in Nature in April 2017: Human Presence in the Americas 130,000 Year Ago. That’s 10 times as old as human beings were supposed to have been, in the Americas! That’s in a site near San Diego in California. So, not only that, but DNA work is also giving us a new story about the peopling of the Americas. We’re now beginning to understand how complicated it is. There are certain fragments of DNA that are associated with a group of humans; not anatomically modern humans, but humans that have been a bit like the Neanderthals. They have bred with modern humans and left their traces in the human DNA, just like the Neanderthals did. That DNA is present very strongly amongst Australian Aboriginal Indians and amongst certain tribes in South America.
It hardly appears at all in North America. So the notion that the whole Americas were peopled across the Bering land bridge once the sea level was lower, now the Bering Strait, and that the migration came all the way through to South America, is just wrecked by that finding. It means that people, human beings, had to have got to South America by sea directly, not coming through North America at all, and that raises huge issues about ancient navigation and ancient skills and ancient abilities.
The second reason I’m very interested in focusing in on the Americas is that they have not played a big part in my work until now, and I’m just intrigued and excited by what’s happening. I got activated on this subject when I participated at Standing Rock in 2016 and got to know the Lakota, did some interviews there, and really for the first time I think, I understood the terrible genocide that was inflicted upon the Native American peoples and how their culture, their history, their true past was deliberately obliterated by the invaders, and how so many lies were told about them. I’d like it if my new book can help correct those lies.
It’s been a big week for Graham Hancock. A South African professor endorsed his lost civilization, and a luxury magazine conducted a fawning interview. Now, Bear & Company is getting ready to publish Spirits in Stone: The Secrets of Megalithic America: Decoding the Ancient Cultural Stone Landscapes of the Northeast by Glenn Kreisberg, and Hancock has his name on the cover as the author of the book’s credulous forward. Of the book itself there is little to say. It is more than 400 pages long and seeks to explore alleged stellar alignments among various rocks and earthworks in the northeastern United States to conclude that an advanced super-civilization once occupied the future United States. Weirder, it is partly the work of Kresiberg and partly an anthology of partially related essays by other writers. It is an odd book.
​Kreisberg developed his ideas while living near Woodstock, New York, which he identified as a center of megalithic star culture. He has been promoting version of the idea since at least 2011, including on Graham Hancock’s own website. I remember reading the linked article last year and finding it so unimpressive that I didn’t think to say anything about it. Kreisberg is also the editor of Mysteries of the Ancient Past: A Graham Hancock Reader, so you can see where from where he takes his inspiration.
I feel like I should be reviewing Spirits in Stone, but I must confess that the thought of giving more than a cursory reading to 400 pages of minute arguments about stellar alignments makes my eyes glaze over. The problem is reducible to a simple point: Even if we accept that such stones and earthworks were indeed purposefully aligned to stars and constellations (and that they are all artificial constructions and not, as is the case with some, natural), it implies nothing about the existence of an “advanced” Atlantis-like civilization, for observation of the stars and the ability to point rocks at them is, in the final analysis, not an inherent development of state-level societies. Anyone with sufficient motivation and a rudimentary ability to carve records of stellar positions could do it.
Anyway, Kreisberg invited Hancock to tour some of what he views as megalithic sites in the northeastern United States, and Hancock came away convinced that Native Americans once had a scientifically advanced civilization that expressed sophisticated mathematical truths through the medium of stones aligned to stars. However, Hancock feels that Euro-Americans have destroyed these stony wonders:
"What my rambles with Glenn have shown me, however, and what this book will reveal to you, are that those fragments are indeed present, even in the intensively settled, heavily farmed, and economically developed Northeast where the barbaric forces of “modernization” have been at work the longest, erasing and confusing the record of stone."
​Here Hancock presents an infuriating mixture of fact and fantasy that marries a correct criticism—that agricultural and industrial development has disturbed or destroyed archaeological sites—to a romantic fantasy that the destroyed parts of the archaeological record would reveal a “Hermetic” civilization of staggering wisdom and complexity, one possessed of “energizing, healing, and soul-enriching effects.”
Hancock is at a loss, though, to explain why North America, if part of the same global system of megalithic construction inherited from Atlantis, lacks the kinds of massive stone sites that the Old World has in spades. With the haughty condescension of a wealthy, liberal European, he attributes the missing stone structures to deliberate destruction by us heathen colonials who lack a certain European refinement and British comfort with deep history.
"What is different in America is only the scale of destruction of this ancient worldwide system, deliberate destruction, pursued for short-term economic gains, by rude and barbarous incomers whose cultures had been cut off from the wellsprings of planetary wisdom for so long that they were literally unable to see the pearls of great price that they so carelessly and callously swept away.'
​He doesn’t quite identify who these incomers are, but when he said that “we” are their “descendants,” he makes plain that he is speaking, somewhat imprecisely, of European colonists. Perhaps stung by the repeated criticism that his hypothesis about a lost white race civilizing the brown peoples of the world is racist, or at least racist-adjacent, Hancock has here and in his newer work from the past twelve months or so overcorrected and all but falls into the trap of demonizing Europeans while fetishizing Native Americans as possessors of a purer and more harmonious ancient earth wisdom that makes them all but avatars of occult earth magic.
Regarding the Bering Straight overland route vs. arrival by sea. There was not a lot of fanfare, but the so-called "Pacific Coast kelp highway route" has absolutely supplanted the overland route from Beringia into the Americas. So arrival by boat is now accepted by nearly all archaeologists working on the larger issue of the peopling of the Americas. This may be a revelation to Hancock, but it's almost old news by now....
Regarding the Cerutti Mastodon Site, dated at 130,000 years, I had the opportunity to meet the lead author of the Narure letter, as well as his wife, one of the co-authors, and these were my impressions. From the Fall meeting of the New England Antiquties Research Association(Neara), which was held in Rhode Island:
Dr. Kathleen Holen's talk was entitled "Evidence for human activity at large animal death sites". She and her husband have been involved in over 50 excavations of mammoth and mastodon remains, in the Great Plains and elsewhere. Of course, not all those have involved evidence of human activity, but some have, and have returned dates far older then Clovis. Her emphasis in her talk was on what fresh bone looks like when it is humans doing the work of breaking those bones open. Including experimentation using heavy hammerstones with fresh elephant bones in Africa. I cannot recapitulate her knowledge, and won't attempt it, but will say she convinced me that there are reliable clues that can be demonstrated when fresh bone has been fractured by hominids wielding large hammerstones for percussion operations.
Well, it was superb. I shook his hand afterward and told him I could not speak for Neara, but that I considered it an honor that he came to speak to us about what is grounbreaking(to say the very least!) research, to be able to hear the frontier research by the lead author of the Cerutti study. He replied that he felt honored to have been invited, and that it was wonderful to speak to an audience that was actually receptive to their study.
Indeed! The blowback against them has been nothing short of relentless and fierce. They told us of one grad student, who had no experience excavating a mastodon site at all, publishing a reply stating that heavy equipment driving above the Cerutti bones while they were still buried, was responsible for the fracturing seen. Both Holen and his wife were incredulous at this suggestion, having, as stated, not only so much more experience studying megafauna sites, but being able to easily demonstrate the difference between bones broken by percussion while fresh, and bones broken when dessicated(which the Cerutti bones would have to have been if broken by heavy vehicles driving over their burial sites. Even at 130,000 +/-9000 years old, the Cerutti bones are dessicated, not fossilized. In other words, they are still bones).
Regarding what I felt was one key observation I took away. European colleagues working on sites far older then sites in the Americas, as well as African colleagues working at the famous Olduvai Gorge Early Man sites, are near universal in being of the opinion that the Cerutti Mastodon Site is an archaeological site. Everyone, both old world and new world archaeologists, are of the opinion that the dates for the site are valid. 130,000 +/-9000 years old. The old world archaeologists and paleontologist recognize the fracturing as clearly originating in percussion blows by humans. American archaeologists, in sharp contrast, have been near universal in rejecting the findings. American archaeologists are of the opinion that the Cerutti site is not an archaeological site at all. But I felt the Holen's have effectively overcome these opinions. And that is why I thanked them for the honor of hearing from the lead authors regarding what I believe will lead to a major breakthrough in understanding the peopling of the Americas.
BTW, already two additional sites have been located in California, which may show evidence of hominin activity, and both have returned dates of 80,000-100,000 years old. They told us of occasions where other sites have been destroyed because archaeologists had simply assumed a priori that the sites were simply "too old" and therefore simply not worth saving.
In short, the Holen's won me over. I wish a tape of their talks were available, and that I could offer here more then my impressions based on memory.
Regarding whether there are sites in the Northeast where Native Americans built in stone, well, archaeologist Dr. Curtiss Hoffman of the Massachusetts Archaeological Society favors an interpretation that does assign much of the stonework to prehistoric native peoples.. and has completed an inventory of such sites for the east coast of the United States. On the opposite side of the debate, archaeologists such as Rhode Island State Archaeologist Timothy Ives favors an interpretation that sees the numerous stone cairn sites that are common in New England backcountry hillsides as the product of field clearing by sheep farmers. In Vol. 43, 2015 edition of "Archaeology of Eastern North America", he outlined that viewpoint in an article entitled "Cairnfields in New England's Forgotten Pastures". Interestingly, Narragansett Doug Harris, of the Narragansett Historic Preservation Office, whom I also discussed offshore underwater sites with at the Neara meeting(the Narragansett have oral traditions locating village sites in Block Island and Rhode Island Sounds when those areas were above water), as well as many other New England tribal members do identify many of these stone structure sites in the Northeast with their ancestors, and not colonial and Post colonial sheep farmers.
Recently, the town of Hopkington, RI, together with the Narragansett Nation, preserved and dedicated an interesting site contained some 1000+ cairns, as a Narragansett Sacred Landscape Site. At the least interesting, that in the absence of firm archaeological data one way or another, that such sites are being preserved. It's sort of a "better safe then sorry" approach.
Preserving such sites has been ongoing for quite a few years now. Prior to the preservation of the Hopkington, RI, site, the most successful effort was getting the Turner Falls(Ma.) Sacred Hill Ceremonial Site protected and added to the National Register of Historic Places:
I know nothing about Glenn Kreisberg and his book about "megaliths" in the Northeast, nor what Hancock has planned. I hope it is not just a rehash of the older view that there was a connection between megalithic cultures on opposite sides of the Atlantic....

A lot of what I wrote in "Man and Impact in the Americas" is gaining common acceptance now, or being proved correct,
As far as New England megaliths go, it is interesting that Rafinesque used similarities in structures to try to date
structures in the Americas, and to gain a sequence. He had no 14C dates, no pottery sequences, and very limited data.
Andaste (X mt DNA) material culture is what it is. I have no idea about X mt DNA distribution in European coastal Atlantic, no knowledge of the
Giant lore from Ireland or Britain, no idea of any tall skeletal remains found in those areas. Hancock most likely does, or can easily run into
I myself am deeply opposed to the idea of any single master race, or master races, one of the key tenets of theosophy.
I am nor a spiritual guide, but in this case, I can point out the history of the conmen who developed theosophy:
Hancock was not part of this chain, but rather a journalist who stumbled into it while working in Africa,
There is a spiritual vacuum that has developed here in the states, and apparently in Europe as well.
besides that there are very few people around who can see in their minds' eye the paleo environment.

as very few of the NE sites have been excavated, no one knows with certainty if any of them are sites.

Although I am not, at present, allowed to reveal the location of the site, excavation at a typical conical cairn site in Connecticut revealed ceremonial grade artifacts buried beneath several of the cairns. And it was not a case of the artifacts being there prior to construction of the cairns. No burials were encountered, either. I can't publish that location in a public format, for what I hope are obvious reasons. Not sure it's been written up as yet, either.
I would also not be able to agree, at least where carefully constructed conical, or beehive shape cairns, are concerned, that they are not much different then field clearing cairns. The latter tend to be loosely tossed piles of rocks. This is what we determined at the lower cairn field at Parker Woodland, in Coventry, RI:
1. The cairns were constructed of split slabs of granite and squared-off granite blocks fitted in place, and not uncut cobbles as one might expect in field clearing.
2. The cairns often display a feather-laying technique of construction. That is, the split slabs have been tapered in thickness, with the thinnest section laid toward the center of the cairn.
3. More often then not, convex surfaces on individual slabs are face up. This, in conjunction with the slanting downward of the stones toward the center of the cairn, enables the structure to be tapered conically, as well as ensuring good drainage, thus preventing damage from frost heaving during the winter months.
4. While the average base diameter of the cairns is small, 4-5 feet, and the interior space limited, this space is filled with smaller fractured rock before the cairn is closed off at the top. Water reaching the center of the cairn will thus drain through fractured rock to the ground.
In the case of the lower field of conical cairns in Parker Woodland, and at other sites here in Rhode Island, such effort displayed seems unusual for typical field clearing. In the upper cairn field, consisting of much larger cairns known as platform cairns, they are blended into the existing topography and make use of existing erratics in a way that ensures they too are very unlikely to fall apart over time.
I will say, if I were a farmer, in the case of upland New England, a sheep farmer, I would not want the rocks tumbling back into the field over time. That said, there are plenty of sites where there does not seem to be any such concern, the rocks are simply tossed atop an ever growing loose pile. In the case of two of the largest platform cairns at the Parker Woodland site, trianguloid stones have been stood against the cairn, in one case pointing North, and in the other case pointing East.
In any event, what limited archaeology that has been conducted at these sites, and I am thinking of the undisclosed eastern Ct. site, did reveal a likely native construct for that site.
In general, study of these sites, and the debate itself, is still in a fairly early stage. I have not made up my own mind, one way or the other, and would expect a mixed bag of results. Also, that many cairns are built, and built into the topography, and taking advantage of existing features like large erratics, in a way to help ensure they last through the seasons, that aim alone certainly would not eliminate farmers, who would also not want to have to keep picking up the same rocks season after season. But, nonetheless, there is a big difference in the care displayed in construction between these and the more common loose piles of tossed rocks usually associated with field clearing activity....
Speaking of the use of stone by Notheastern tribes in general, we know there is a Winter solstice alignment at the so-called Queen's Fort in Exeter, RI. Once thought to have been built by a Narragansett known as Stonewall John in the period of King Philip's War, the Narragansett themselves have oral traditions indicating an earlier construction and purpose. There is also an Archaic Era rockshelter in Ma., I'll get the site report and post it when I have the chance, which included a stone wall built at the entrance. The point being that American archaeologists have long assumed Northeastern natives did not build in stone. Not sure there was ever any real justification for that assumption.
Edit: OK, here is the report on the Flagg Swamp rock shelter, where Northeastern natives built a stone wall. In retrospect, seems silly to consider this a surprise, but whatever:
The taller conical cairn here is 5' tall. These cairns really cannot be said to be that much indistinguishable for stone piles usually interpreted as field clearing, IMHO:
Again, may not be typical of field clearing. Retaining, or taller wall, is on the downslope of the cairn, to help prevent it falling apart through time...
Another view of the tallest conical cairn in a field of some 120+ cairns comprising the lower cairn field in Parker Woodland, Coventry, R.I.:
As mentioned a few days there are examples of , specifically X2a mt DNA in Indian populations but to be so general in the use of X shows an ignorance highlighted even further by the specificity of of Andaste .
Much depends on the age of the cairn . In Europe clearance cairns can be thousands of years old and much degraded ,often little different from equally degraded cairns that have deposits below them .
Field clearance is often found on top of erratics or large rocks as they are dead ground and it makes more sense to pile 'em high rather than take up good ground .
I had a look for pics of the putative alignment at Queen's Fort in Exeter, RI, and came across a plan (Maver &Dix ) but no pics as yet .
Just saw the pics of the cairns . They are clearly fairly recent i.e. not much older than few centuries and maybe even restored .
Field clearance in the UK and Ireland can date from the 4th millenium BC and can often covered in turf/peat with nothing of the actual stones to be seen .

Which pics are you looking for? Maybe I can help. The tree cover atop Queen"s Fort at present would not make it possible to get a clear view, and hence photos, from the northeast "bastion" to the southwest "bastion". Also, the SW bastion was built sometme between 1979, the date of my earliest photos of the SW "bastion", and 1982, at which time it had been built up higher, and the short arm creating a spiral outline for that feature had been added. Before Mavor/Dix's book was published, I cautioned Dix that neither 19th century plans nor my 1979 photos indicated a spiral shape to the SW "bastion". in 1979, as in the 19th century plan drawings, the SW "bastion" was an open semi-circle in shape. I have photos from both 1979 and from after the rebuild, but there would be no good photos available in which you could stand at the NE "bastion" and actually see the SW "bastion" and the sun, at the Winter solstice. At least to the best of my knowledge. I'm also obviously not in a position to question any oral memories of the Narragansett regarding Queen's Fort. It was not located until after King Philip's War. It was assumed a brief engagement between Narragansett and English forces took place there a day or two prior to the Great Swamp Massacre of December, 1675. Although associated at that time with a known Narragansett mason, Stonewall John, that too seems to be an assumption that cannot be proven.
This page describes some archaeological work done at Queen's Fort years ago. I do have numerous photos of features there, but, to be honest, it's a pain in the ass having to forward the photos to my computer(I use an iPad), in order to then have to use Paint to resize them for archaeologica. Not sure they would really add anything to the discussion, either. But here is lots of info, including that archaeological work:
Jim Egan, who runs a small museum across the street from the Newport Tower, delivered a talk,which I missed, entitled "Newport Tower Through the Ages: New Light on an Old Tower". As you may be aware, Egan favors an Elizabethan, 16th century, origin for the tower. He believes John Dee designed the tower. I'm really not enough up to speed on his research at all. Been too many years since I examined his writings and thoughts. I know Jim, have known him for years. Great guy and great speaker, but I missed his talk altogether. He also opened his museum on the Sunday of the meeting, when field trips around the state take place.
Two things that come to mind that could be helpful are tightening up of the dates for the build and a palynological study to see what the tree cover was like during the approximate/more accurate period of construction .
I was interested to see what the two points , the putative backsight and foresight looked like and whether there was anything to suggest that
Why would the locals build an alignment to the solstice into what appears to be a defensive structure ?

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its transitional state mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are characterized by amyloid plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) deposition within the cerebral neocortex and neuronal loss within the hippocampal formation. However, the precise relationship between pathologic changes in neocortical regions and hippocampal atrophy is largely unknown.
In this study, combining structural MRI scans and automated image analysis tools with reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aß levels, a surrogate for intra-cranial amyloid plaques and elevated CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels, a surrogate for neocortical NFTs, we examined the relationship between the presence of Alzheimer's pathology, gray matter thickness of select neocortical regions, and hippocampal volume in cognitively normal older participants and individuals with MCI and AD (n = 724). Amongst all 3 groups, only select heteromodal cortical regions significantly correlated with hippocampal volume. Amongst MCI and AD individuals, gray matter thickness of the entorhinal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus significantly predicted longitudinal hippocampal volume loss in both amyloid positive and p-tau positive individuals. Amongst cognitively normal older adults, thinning only within the medial portion of the orbital frontal cortex significantly differentiated amyloid positive from amyloid negative individuals whereas thinning only within the entorhinal cortex significantly discriminated p-tau positive from p-tau negative individuals.

Selective neurodegeneration of the cerebral cortex is a characteristic pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intracellular tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and extracellular amyloid-ß (Aß) associated plaques show a characteristic laminar and regional pattern of distribution within gray matter, with greater involvement of the medial temporal lobe and heteromodal association areas than primary sensory or motor cortices [1]–[3]. Within heteromodal association cortices, long corticocortical projections and the large pyramidal neurons in layers III and V that give rise to these projections appear to be especially vulnerable [4], [5]. As such, it has been postulated that early disruptions in heteromodal association cortices can contribute to a functional isolation of the hippocampal formation thus giving rise to the clinical hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, progressive memory impairment [6], [7].
Recent advances in neuroimaging and image analysis algorithms allow for the in vivo assessment of neuropathologic changes underlying AD. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies examining fibrillar amyloid deposition with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and MRI studies of functional and structural connectivity have observed a significant overlap in a number of neocortical regions that appear preferentially affected in the earliest stages of AD [8]–[14]. Taken collectively, these studies suggest that select heteromodal cortical regions are vulnerable to amyloid deposition and exhibit neuronal dysfunction early in the disease process. In comparison, though several studies have demonstrated a relationship between post-mortem NFT pathology and structural MRI measures of atrophy [15], [16], few have examined in vivo the effect of tau burden on atrophy in heteromodal and limbic cortices.
Cortical atrophy resulting from cellular shrinkage, dendritic spine loss, and axonal disruption is reflected as a loss of gray matter that diminishes cortical thickness [17], [18]. Prior MRI studies of AD have shown cortical thinning and gray matter disturbances in medial temporal [19]–[21], temporo-parietal [22]–[25], posterior cingulate and medial frontal cortices Benetton Low Cost Bordeaux Vneck Jumper 70z0R, [26]. Still, the precise relationship between amyloid and tau pathology, regional neocortical thinning, and hippocampal atrophy is largely unknown. In this study, using significant reductions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aß levels as a surrogate for elevated intra-cranial amyloid plaques [27], [28] and significant elevations in CSF phosphorylated tau levels as a surrogate for neocortical NFTs Dark Lee Skinny Fit Malone Jeans Stone Bw4Ig, we explored relationships between the presence of Alzheimer's pathology, thickness of select neocortical regions and the volume of the hippocampus.
All 724 participants were selected from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). The ADNI is a large multi-site collaborative effort launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations as a public–private partnership aimed at testing whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael Weiner, MD, and ADNI is the result of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, with subjects recruited from over 50 sites across the US and Canada. For more information, please see http://www.adni-info.org.
Each participant from the ADNI cohort was formally evaluated using eligibility criteria that are described in detail elsewhere (http://www.adni-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9&Itemid=43). The institutional review boards of all participating institutions approved the procedures for this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or surrogates. Briefly, experienced clinicians conducted independent semi-structured interviews with the participant and a knowledgeable collateral source that included a health history, neurological examination, the Mini-Mental State Examination [30], the CDR-Sum of Boxes Grün Jumper amp;berry New Black Friday Mint YHBYgT, and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery.
As illustrated in Table 1, participants from the ADNI database were selected if they were clinically classified as:
All ADNI MRI scans were acquired at multiple sites using either a GE, Siemens, or Philips 1.5T system. Multiple high-resolution T1- weighted volumetric MP-RAGE scans were collected for each subject and the raw DICOM images were downloaded from the public ADNI site (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/index.shtml). Parameter values vary depending on scanning site and can be found at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Research/Cores/.
All MRI scans were processed, with little to no manual intervention using the FreeSurfer software package (version 4.5), freely available at http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu. A single MPRAGE MRI acquisition for each participant was normalized for intensity inhomogeneities to create an image volume with high contrast-to-noise [34]. The intensity-normalized volume was used to automatically locate the gray/white matter boundary (white matter surface) [35] and in turn, the gray/CSF boundary (gray matter surface) [36]. Cortical thickness measurements were then obtained by calculating the distance between these two boundaries across the entire cortical mantle of each hemisphere [36].
The neocortex of the brain on the MRI scans was then automatically subdivided into gyral-based regions of interest (ROIs). To accomplish this, a registration procedure was used that aligns the cortical folding patterns [37] and probabilistically assigns every point on the cortical surface to one of the 32 ROIs [38]. For the purposes of this study, we focused on 8 ROIs bilaterally corresponding to neocortical regions that prior neuropathological [1]–[3], neuroimaging [19]–[26], and amyloid Benetton Low Cost Bordeaux Vneck Jumper 70z0R, [12] studies have demonstrated as being affected early in the course of AD. These regions included the 1) caudal portion of the middle frontal gyrus (includes inferior frontal sulcus), 2) medial portion of the orbital frontal cortex, 3) inferior parietal lobule (includes inferior parietal sulcus), 4) lateral portion of the occipital cortex, 5) inferior temporal gyrus, 6) entorhinal cortex, 7) temporal pole, and 8) isthmus portion of the cingulate cortex (includes posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices) (Figure 1). The hippocampus was automatically delineated based on an algorithm that uses a probabilistic atlas and examines variations in voxel intensities and spatial relationships to classify subcortical regions on MRI scans [39].
Figure 1. Three-dimensional representations of the 8 ROIs examined in the current study (only right hemisphere is shown).
For longitudinal analysis, the baseline and one-year follow-up structural MRI scans were rigid body registered and an unbiased template volume was created [40]. All time points and the template images were then skull stripped, intensity normalized and segmented independently. The longitudinal segmentation results were then obtained by directly mapping the linear Talairach transform and the brain mask from the template to the baseline and follow-up timepoint, and by initializing other processing steps such as the non-linear warps and intensity normalizations with the results from the template. For the baseline and follow-up timepoint, a fused segmentation image that incorporates information of both time points was used as an initial estimate to guide the final delineation of the hippocampus. Atrophy rate of the hippocampus was defined as percent volume loss over the course of one year. A more detailed description of these procedures can be found in [40].
From the current ADNI sample, a number of individuals (n = 338) underwent lumbar puncture for CSF biomarker evaluation. Methods for CSF acquisition and biomarker measurement have been reported previously for this sample [28]. In brief, CSF was collected and stored at −80°C at the University of Pennsylvania ADNI Biomarker Core Laboratory. Amyloid beta from peptides 1–42 (Aβ) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau) was measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin TX) with Innogenetics (INNOBIA AlzBio3, Ghent, Belgium) immunoassay kit–based reagents. Using a previously established CSF-based Aβ cutoff value of 192 pg/ml and a p-tau cutoff value of 23 pg/ml [28], we classified MCI and AD individuals as 1) amyloid positive (n = 193, 43% female, mean age = 74.0, SD = 7.4), 2) amyloid negative (n = 48, 30% female, mean age = 75.9, SD = 8.0), 3) p-tau positive (n = 182, 44% female, mean age = 74.0, SD = 7.5), and 4) p-tau negative (n = 59, 30% female, mean age = 76.1, SD = 7.6). Similarly, we additionally classified CN individuals as a) amyloid positive (n = 35, 54% female, mean age = 76.3, SD = 5.1), b) amyloid negative (n = 61, 50% female, mean age = 75.6, SD = 5.3), c) p-tau positive (n = 34, 47% female, mean age = 77.8, SD = 5.9), and d) p-tau negative (n = 62, 30% female, mean age = 74.7, SD = 4.4). Of note, 46% (n = 16) of the amyloid positive individuals were additionally p-tau positive and 47% (n = 16) of the p-tau positive individuals were additionally amyloid positive.
Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were first used to examine relationships between the mean thickness of the individual ROIs and total hippocampal volume. Separate linear regression models were constructed for the amyloid positive, amyloid negative, p-tau positive and p-tau negative MCI and AD individuals, with the baseline thickness of the individual ROIs as predictors for hippocampal atrophy rate. Logistic regression models and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were used to compare whether baseline thickness of the individual ROIs significantly differentiated amyloid positive from amyloid negative as well as p-tau positive from p-tau negative CN individuals. In all of the analyses performed, age, gender, education, and APOE-ε4 carrier status were additionally included.
All results are corrected for multiple comparisons by method of Monte Carlo simulation and shown on the gray matter surface (only right hemisphere). The color scale illustrates the magnitude of effect with blue indicating areas of strongest prediction strength.
Our results demonstrate that 1) amongst cognitively normal older participants and individuals with MCI and AD, select heteromodal association cortices correlate with hippocampal volume, 2) amongst MCI and AD individuals, gray matter thinning within the same two neocortical regions predicts longitudinal hippocampal volume loss in both amyloid positive and p-tau positive individuals and 3) amongst cognitively normal older adults, thinning within the medial portion of the orbital frontal cortex significantly differentiates amyloid positive from amyloid negative individuals whereas entorhinal cortex thinning significantly discriminates p-tau positive from p-tau negative individuals. Taken collectively, this indicates that cortical Aβ and tau pathology is evident even among asymptomatic older individuals, affects gray matter thinning within select neocortical regions and potentially contributes to downstream hippocampal degeneration. These findings are in agreement with prior work indicating the value of CSF Aβ as an early biomarker [41] and provide evidence that CSF p-tau and structural MRI measures are additionally informative in the earliest phase of the disease process.
The four cerebral cortical regions that best correlated with hippocampal volume follow an interesting neurodevelopmental pattern. On architectonic grounds, the regions identified on the lateral hemisphere trace evolutionary lineage from the so-called ‘paleocortical’ trend whereas regions identified on the medial hemisphere are derived from the ‘archicortical’ trend [42]–[44]. As first described by Kemper [3], these regions collectively subserve the ‘special senses of the head’ including vision, memory, emotion, olfaction, and audition and are inherently heteromodal, binding convergent input from unimodal areas, thus acting as critical gateways for information processing and synthesis [45].
Correlations between thickness of the individual regions and hippocampal volume may reflect underlying patterns of neuropathology. Thickness of the medial portion of the orbital frontal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and the temporal pole demonstrated the strongest magnitude of association with the hippocampus amongst each of the three participant groups. In contrast, parietal, occipital, and lateral frontal cortices, correlated with the hippocampus only amongst cognitively normal older adults and MCI individuals. With AD onset, these regions failed to associate with the hippocampus. Of interest, these regions showed the largest magnitude of association with each other amongst each of the three participant groups (Tables 3, 4 and 5).
One explanation for these findings may involve the evolution of the neuropathologic cascade in AD. Amyloid deposits are first noted in the medial portions of the orbital frontal, basal temporal and entorhinal cortices and tau-associated NFTs initially affect the medial temporal and temporopolar cortices [1], [2]. With disease progression, these pathologic changes involve the parietal, primary occipital, and lateral frontal cortices [1]–[3]. Thus, those neocortical regions that show early pathologic changes may correlate with each other throughout the duration of the disease process whereas regions affected later may best associate with each other rather than earlier involved regions.
Another possibility is that associations between regions reflect underlying anatomic connections and the decreased correlation coefficients noted with AD onset represent a selective disruption in cortico-hippocampal connectivity. Though several studies have noted disruptions in anatomic connectivity with AD [8], [13], [46], the fact that the cognitively normal older adults when compared with the MCI and AD individuals demonstrated decreased correlation coefficients between several neocortical regions (including the entorhinal cortex) and the hippocampus (Table 5) suggests that the gray matter associations presented here likely do not represent cortico-hippocampal connectivity. Using diffusion tensor imaging with anatomic localization [47], future work will investigate whether cortico-hippocampal circuitry is selectively vulnerable in dementia.
Significant reductions in CSF Aβ levels and elevations in CSF p-tau levels coupled with thinning within select heteromodal regions predicts longitudinal hippocampal atrophy. Prior PiB studies have demonstrated a significant relationship between neocortical amyloid deposition and hippocampal atrophy [48]–[51]. Our findings indicate that in addition to amyloid, tau may predict downstream hippocampal degeneration. Within both the amyloid and p-tau positive MCI and AD individuals, thickness of the same two neocortical regions (entorhinal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus) (Figure 2) significantly predicted hippocampal atrophy whereas within the amyloid and p-tau negative individuals none of the neocortical regions predicted hippocampal decline. This suggests that those neocortical regions that are likely affected by both Aβ and tau influence hippocampal degeneration.
Amongst cognitively normal older adults, cortical thinning of the medial orbital frontal cortex significantly differentiated amyloid positive from amyloid negative individuals whereas thinning of the entorhinal cortex significantly discriminated p-tau positive from p-tau negative individuals. Consistent with neuropathology studies, which demonstrate early amyloid deposition within the medial orbital frontal cortex and early NFT accumulation within the entorhinal cortex [1], [2], our results indicate that Aβ and tau pathology differentially affect neocortical regions even among asymptomatic older individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence that amongst cognitively normal individuals tau pathology selectively affects the thickness of the entorhinal cortex. It is important to note that almost half (47%) of the p-tau positive individuals were additionally amyloid positive and future work will involve looking at the interaction between Aβ and tau pathology.
The finding that amyloid positive individuals show selective thinning within the medial orbital frontal cortex is in agreement with one prior study demonstrating that older individuals with subjective memory complaints show significant correlations between gray matter atrophy and neocortical PiB increase within the medial orbital frontal/anterior cingulate cortex [52]. Additionally, this is compatible with functional connectivity studies illustrating that amyloid deposition amongst older individuals disrupts the ‘default network’, which includes the medial aspect of the prefrontal cortex [14], [53]. Consistent with prior work [54], [55], our results indicate that amongst asymptomatic older individuals APOE ε4 carrier status influences CSF Aβ levels but does not affect CSF p-tau levels. Taken together, this indicates that a number of cognitively normal individuals harbor preclinical Alzheimer's pathology and that intracranial Aβ pathology may represent the biological phenotype of the APOE ε4 genotype.
These findings have important clinical implications. Subtle gray matter disturbances in specific regions of the cerebral neocortex are present amongst a subset of asymptomatic older individuals and can be quantified using sensitive structural neuroimaging techniques. In combination with CSF Aβ and tau, structural MRI measures can provide an indication of disease stage and have value in identifying those who will likely benefit from early therapeutic interventions. Our results also indicate the importance of administering anti-amyloid therapy early in the disease process (at a pre-MCI stage) in order to alter or delay hippocampal degeneration and thus progressive memory loss, the harbinger of clinical Alzheimer's dementia.
Why does neurodegeneration affect select cerebral cortical regions? From a phylogenetic perspective, heteromodal and archicortical medial temporal regions constitute the oldest areas of the brain [56], operating as connectional gateways for information synthesis [44], [45], and as such, are likely subject to greater evolutionary selection pressure for degeneration than ‘newer’ brain regions such as the primary sensory areas. Another possibility is that those parts of the brain that need to sustain the highest level of plasticity are most susceptible to degeneration [57]. It is important to note that these two hypotheses need not be considered mutually exclusive. That is, the oldest and densely connected brain regions also presumably have the highest neuroplasticity demands and as such, may be particularly vulnerable to neuropathologic changes.
This study has several limitations. One issue involves the use of gyral-based neuroanatomic ROIs to examine specific neocortical regions. It is likely the case that Alzheimer's pathology does not follow the specific boundaries of these ROIs and affects areas within and across multiple ROIs. The use of regions of interest generated from a disease specific effect [19], [20] presents one approach to overcome this limitation. However, as discussed in [58], this method can underestimate or miss disease specific effects potentially leading to false negative findings. Future work will involve combining a priori anatomically defined regions with disease-based statistical methods to examine neocortical and subcortical areas in AD. Another limitation involves the use of CSF Aβ and p-tau to assess the presence of amyloid and neurofibrillary pathology in the neocortex. Though amyloid load as measured using PiB and CSF Aβ are highly correlated and likely reflect plaque deposition [59], assessments using PiB may provide a more direct estimate of neocortical amyloid. Similarly, though prior work indicates that CSF p-tau and cortical NFTs are significantly correlated in AD Dark Lee Skinny Fit Malone Jeans Stone Bw4Ig, measurements using PET imaging agents that target tangle deposits [60] may offer a more exact estimate of neocortical neurofibrillary pathology.

Our greatest objective is to spread the company name to the world. We set the objective, thinking that it helps not only for our fame but marketing for next work. (Our next work, "MonBang" is under beta test now.)
There are different commercializing strategies in ads. Many games are still using banner ads. As soon as App is executed, pop interstitial AD up or whenever play ends, it shows interstitial AD. All of these methods provide discomfort to users, which are the most afraid part for us.
We selected native ad. It will be much helpful if ad helps play in addition to changing the way to show would be better. So, among special objects, type to increase Tab count is created. Such special objects wear native ad image rather than colors. (Refer to below # Game Method)
Users will feel thankful when looking at special objects native advertisement attached when tab count lacks during play. And favor for this native ad will be helpful to click ad shown on resulted window after play.
'Other game view' is additional ad commercializing strategy. Also, 'other game view' button has also advantage, making button image like our UI such as native Ads.
Other games have this type of little button at the corner. However, we doubt if the button is efficient. We decided to make this button bigger like banner Ads. However, the button should not be seen all the time but appears naturally along with other UI not to disturb play screen. So, for the time when users don't play games, after certain period of time, it was intended to appear naturally by fade animation. In addition, like other UIs, it disappears together when appreciation mode comes out.
If Ad is sub-dish, iAP is main dish of BlocKing. BlocKing can be enjoyed freely regardless of network or consumed lift.
Basically, life doesn't reoccur even after certain time. And 'continue' increases the number of life consumed whenever used continuously. User's 'continue' is directly connected to score competition, therefore, competition factor is a key of iAP success. (Refer to below #Update Scheduled) Whenever grades of user are enhanced, by providing with great life compensation, it maintains values of grades and life high. (Refer to below #Update Scheduled)
BlocKing's commercializing model uses plain formula of iAP + AD. To induce iAP for competition is critical. New advertisement is tried. While updating, diverse commercializing models are going to be applied. (Compensation Ad or additional contents purchasing, etc.)
There are simple interactions to become particles by tabbing cube objects. Unless touching UI for certain period of time, UI disappears since it changes into 'appreciation mode' and only 3D space appears.
Objects are largely divided into common objects and special objects. Common objects should be blocked by creating blocks on the bottom of screen. Special objects should be blocked by blocks or tabs.
Common objects increase numbers which can make blocks whenever they appear from the top. However, special objects don't increase numbers. If special objects run out numbers to make blocks without tab, game will be over.
If special objects are tabbed, the ability of relevant objects will be exercise. Particularly, if special objects native ads are attached are tabbed, numbers to make blocks increase.
Falling objects sometimes change their directions when facing obstacles on the screen, which requires of concentration.
Achievement will be added. By providing with scores and levels to each achievement item, according to total sum, grades are provided to users. This grade can be increased only when games are played well and different BlocKing are enjoyed. In addition, every certain period, scores and levels of each achievement fall. Therefore, frequent access will be required.
During games, it displays remaining scores to catch up with the friend's top score and compares scores of other friends.

Brad DeLong explains why presidents are willing to reappoint Fed chairs that are members of opposing political parties:
Obama lucky to have Bernanke, by J. Bradford DeLong, Commentary, Project Syndicate: William McChesney Martin, a Democrat, was twice reappointed chairman of the … Federal Reserve by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Paul Volcker, a Democrat, was reappointed once by the Reagan administration (but not twice: there are persistent rumors that Reagan’s treasury secretary, James Baker, thought Volcker too invested in monetary stability and not in producing strong economies to elect Republicans).
Alan Greenspan, a Republican, was reappointed twice by Bill Clinton. And now Barack Obama has announced his intention to renominate Republican appointee Ben Bernanke…
The reason American presidents are so willing to reappoint Fed chairmen from the opposite party is closely linked to … confidence of financial markets that the Fed will pursue non-inflationary policies.
If financial markets lose that confidence – if they conclude that the Fed is too much under the president’s thumb to wage the good fight against inflation, or if they conclude that the chairman does not wish to control inflation – then the economic news is almost certain to be bad.
Capital flight, interest-rate spikes, declining private investment, and a collapse in the value of the dollar – all of these are likely should financial markets lose confidence in a Fed chairman.
And if they occur, the chances of success for a president seeking re-election – or for a vice president seeking to succeed him – are very low. By reappointing a Fed chairman chosen by someone else, a president can appear to guarantee to financial markets that the Fed is not too much under his thumb. …
It may or may not be true, especially these days, that what is good for General Motors is good for America and vice versa, but certainly what is good economically for America is good politically for the president.
It is here that Obama has lucked out. Ben Bernanke is a very good choice for Fed chairman because he is intelligent, honest, pragmatic and clear-sighted in his vision of the economy. He has already guided the Fed through two very tumultuous years with only one major mistake – the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.
For years, some of his closest friends did not know that Ben S. Bernanke was a Republican. … “If you read anything he’s written, you can’t figure out which political party he’s associated with,” said Mark L. Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University who has written more than a dozen papers with Mr. Bernanke. Mr. Gertler, who said he did not know his close friend’s political affiliation until relatively recently, added: “He’s not ideological. I could imagine Ben working with economists in the Clinton administration.” Alan S. Blinder, a longtime colleague at Princeton who has advised numerous Democratic presidential candidates, also said he had worked alongside Mr. Bernanke for years without having any sense of his political views. “We wrote articles together and sat at the same lunch table thousands of times before I knew he was a Republican,” Mr. Blinder recalled. “We never talked politics.” …

Timing has been postulated as one of the most important aspects of information processing in the brain, and frequency is the most intuitive of the many timing parameters. Thalamocortical circuits present a good opportunity to comprehend the importance of timing due to their well-known relay pathways to the cortex in all sensory modalities. They have oscillations that are well characterized through multisite electrical recordings during wakefulness, sleep, anesthesia and task-driven activity. The advent of optogenetics coupled with fMRI enables an unprecedented opportunity to probe the dynamics of the somatosensory thalamocortical circuit of the rat in response to differing frequency stimulation.
Geeky. Nerdy. Techie. These are not really the terms I want to use to describe myself, but I have a confession to make. I am a fan of any technology that I can use to make my life, personal or professional, easier. If that makes me a techno, nerdy geek then I guess I'll wear my pocket protector with honor. To justify my new self designated … Continue reading the story "6 of My Favorite Free Tools for Real Estate"

This was also the last time the Lakers brought back the NBA Championship to the Staples Center and the city of Los Angeles, something which James will be looking to do many times for the team over the next four years.
"He loves to compete and is an awesome leader who is about winning and making sure that his teammates are successful", Magic said in a statement. The Lakers players are excited to have a teammate who has been to nine NBA Finals.
Yet Wright, speaking on First Things First, insists that James did not join the Lakers on the basis that he would team up with Leonard and that he is relaxed about his chances of reaching a ninth straight Finals.

A growing number of American companies are moving their manufacturing back to the United States, which is referred to as “reshoring”. With increased costs and the environmental impact of shipping goods overseas, decreased wage disparity, cheaper domestic energy, and pro-business legislation, many businesses are bringing their manufacturing facilities closer to the consumer. All of the financial factors mentioned above – coupled with an increased desire for product personalization and a decreased tolerance for waiting, has resulted in a trend towards local manufacturing.
Reshoring also allows manufacturers to recover from trade secret thefts and supply chain disruptions. Supply chains that reside close to their operation will allow them to maintain lower inventory levels and meet demand for rapid adjustments to unique products.
In the past, small businesses had to latch onto a larger supply chain or cooperate with other small businesses to build their order numbers high enough for overseas manufacturing. Now that it’s proving more cost-effective to bring manufacturing back home, another phenomenon is occurring: a resurrection of Unites States competitiveness.
With big business reshoring, smaller businesses can take advantage of those newly created local ecosystems and thrive domestically. Reshoring brings back desirable jobs that have been lost to decades of offshoring. So if you are one of the few with a creative mindset for new product enhancements, or an affinity to restore local manufacturing pride, reshoring could assist you in bringing your products to the market cheaper, faster and more efficiently.
This LP is separated into two parts: the first is dedicated to instrumental dances taken from Terpsichore, the huge compilation of dances made or collected by the composer. As always with Munrow, we are in front of a festive view, which doesn't lack for poetry when needed (Gaillard or Sarabande). But the alchemy of timbres used by Munrow (Ballet des Coqs - Passameze - Bourée), allows a perfect differentiation between the dances, without risk of lassitude. Munrow's virtusity and sense of ornementation (cf. Music of the Crusades) is also highlighted here (Suite de Volte). The second part of the disc illustrates the art of Praetorius in the domain of sacred vocal music, where he proves his knowledge: all use a great number of voices and often a double choir. The joyful "Gott der Vater..." is here very well put in context. "Allein Gott..." is sung by soloists accompanied by instruments only. A good example of Lutheran liturgy during the 16th century.

Josiah Wedgwood was an English potter and industrialist born at Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. He had very high standards of workmanship and a keen interest in scientific advancements. He became well respected and his customers embraced the rich and famous, including royalty. He was also a keen abolitionist.
Because he was a respected business man, people listened to his views and he was able to convince friends and colleagues of the evils of the Slave Trade. He also had the money to provide financial assistance. From 1787, he actively participated in this cause, becoming a member of one of the abolition committees. His interest possibly developed through his friendship with Thomas Bentley, his business partner, and his association with Thomas Clarkson.
He read widely on the subject and became a shareholder in the Sierra Leone Company, (which provided a colony for the habitation of enslaved people who had been made free). On the 9th January 1792, Clarkson suggested that he might consider helping to distribute a pamphlet compiled by William Fox, calling for a sugar boycott. A man of ideas, Wedgwood wrote back suggesting the pamphlet would have more impact if the society's emblem (which showed an enslaved person in chains, kneeling, with his hands lifted up to heaven) was included in the front. The emblem's motto read: "Am I Not a Man and a Brother?" He proposed to have a woodcut made at his own expense and ordered 2000 more pamphlets.
Using his knowledge of the pottery trade, Wedgwood also had the design reproduced in a porcelain cameo. He donated hundreds of these to the Society for distribution. It became the most famous image of the campaign. The emblem was worn by fashionable ladies as a brooch or hair piece and, as Thomas Clarkson said, was the first time that "fashion, which usually confines itself to worthless things, was seen ... promoting the cause of justice, humanity and freedom." Josiah Wedgwood also conversed with William Wilberforce but did not see the end of the Slave Trade, as he died on 3rd January, 1795.

Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton was born in Essex in 1786. He was privately educated and went to Trinty College, Dublin. He became a close friend of Joseph Gurney after his mother (a Quaker) introduced him to the Norfolk based family.
He started to attend Quaker meetings with the Gurney family and married Joseph's sister, Hannah, in 1807. He became a partner in a brewing company and became involved in several campaigns for social reform. Another of Joseph's sisters was Elizabeth Fry and Buxton became involved in her campaign for prison reform.
In 1818, Buxton was elected MP for Weymouth, a position he held until 1837. He was a strong advocate for the abolition of slavery in the British Colonies. In 1823, he formed the Society for the Extinction of the Slave Trade, the committee that co-ordinated the campaign for total abolition. In 1824, he succeeded William Wilberforce as head of the anti-slavery party in Parliament, continuing the struggle until the Slavery Abolition Act, in 1833, freed all enslaved people in the British Empire.
In 1838, Buxton published The African Slave Trade and Its Remedy. In this book, he told the British government to make treaties with rulers in Africa. An expedition was sent in 1841 to put the plan into action but it failed, mainly because of the large number of deaths among the expedition members from yellow fever and malaria.
You can read an account of this expedition in White Dreams, Black Africa: Antislavery Expedition to the Niger, 1841-42 by Howard Temperley, 1991.
Thomas Fowell Buxton was made a Baron in 1840 and is famous for saying. "With Ordinary talent and extraordinary perseverance, all things are attainable."

How do I motivate him /ic/ without hurting his ego/feelings? I want him to improve, but his laziness isn't helping....
Maybe you should livestream your suicide so he can feel motivated that you're dead and out of his life?
Im looking into doing it inside to hang on the wall in our living room, where I think something like it would look nice.
Do I have to water it every now and then? Im finding mixed reviews on that one. Spray in with water every day? Leave...
I don't have any experience actually trying this, but I can tell you that it would be a bad idea to put it directly on the wall, due to the moisture. Mounted on a board shouldn't be much different from a regular houseplant, though. The moss will need to be kept moist if you want to to stay alive and healthy, they don't have roots to store water in so they're happiest when damp. It shouldn't need watering every day (might get mold) but don't let it dry out more than just a bit before you spray it again. Try to keep it green, if you don't water...

Now combine that with sex appeal and you have something to attract the good goys that would make you those Shekels. Its easier said than done.
This. I don't really draw anime at all but I'm not delusional enough to think it's easy. There's enough god-awful anime out there to testify that not any asshole can pick up a pencil and draw it.
Every time I see a retard wail that "wahh its just symbol drawing you just need to learn the right symbols!" I wish he's put his money where his fucking mouth is and slap down some of those easy symbols into something...
The difficult part are drawing ellipses since they're more prominent on a moe face, they're indeed symbols but you add elements of perspective and form to convey something that could exist in space but without adding too much form and detail to make it uncanny and jarring this is the tricky part.
Who are some artists that have a really good sense for shape design? I want to study a little more about it but don't really know where to start.

I cant draw for shit. No matter what I do my drawings still look like a 10 year old did it. I don't understand how some people can take a photo and draw the person almost exactly. I draw for hours on end and don't improve. All I want is to be able to draw photorealistically.
What is a good active forum that actually helps you instead of spouting retarded nonsense like Loomis/etc? ConceptArt is seemingly super slow
There is no place anywhere on the internet where people will hold your hand and make you get better through invaluable, mind blowing advice and critiques that you couldn't possibly have figured out on your own. If someone tells you to read more Loomis, they mean you don't have a proper grasp on perspective, construction and anatomy.
Aside from that, it's nice that the subject comes out of the background a little, and you've captured a great deal of life in the face... but the values demonstrated aren't very comprehensive outside of the face, which makes the hands, the sweater and the pants all kinda look like you gave up in the middle of rendering them. Also the hand by her mouth has some proportional issues due to a line you dragged down farther than you should...

Abrams Star Treks, while entertaining, seem to have been a tad intellectually light compared to some of the best Trek scripts from the series: original, Next Gen, DS9… So I had every reason not to like this.
It’s not the kind of SciFi I prefer, but there seems to be little of that these days. In some ways Lukas did the best of SciFi: the Asimov/Heinlein/Bradbury/Arthur C. Clarke kind, a disservice for many years. For a while special effects meant far more than script, and so many people seemed to rate SciFi movies according to their special effects. Then we had a run on fantasy posing as SciFi. No thanks. Mostly not to my taste. The next venture was an almost soap opera approach to SciFi. I really did like the new Battlestar, but it took a while to get to the core of the premise, SciFi-wise. Thank the Ceylon God it wasn’t anywhere near as shallow as the original.
The Force Awakens does have one major glitch, script-wise. What’s never made clear is why, if what’s left of the Empire is some mystical order, this mystical order seems to still be in control of all the stormtroopers, all the ships. Meanwhile, after winning big, the rebellion is still just a rebellion and, seemingly, even more marginalized. It seems not unlike one of Hitchcock’s MacGuffians: a plot device intended to keep a story going. It may not make sense, but it keeps things moving along.
No surprise with J.J. Abrams. He used a MacGuffian with the red matter in the first revamp of Trek, and a previous movie.
I know some might say that’s explained by the split between a possible Jedi (Kylo Ren) and Luke, but as bad as that was I feel they marginalize this event too much by turning it all into some “order:” painted as if their some small band of fanatics. It’s as if al Qaeda manages to control almost all of the world’s weaponry only because “Osama’s really, really an evil bastard.” Hell, that struggle alone might have make a damn good movie. Might explain a lot more than a simple rebellious Jedi student.
Otherwise they kept close to the story, though there were a few surprises I won’t reveal. OK, one hint: a major cast member stated in an interview it was going to be great to have work for the rest of his life in the next movies. Let’s just say, for what happened in the movie I almost fear that might be true. That too would be a MacGuffin and deus ex machina and very contrived. If what he said is true I see no way out of what he said being true not being “contrived.”
Again: was that quote a possible diversion just to keep people from guessing a peak point in the plot? That’s the most obvious explanation. See the movie if you want to know more. My digital lips are lightsabered shut.
The relationship between the two main characters: Rey and Finn, is interesting. It’s contentious, and while both are very independent, they also rely on each other. There’s also a subtle comic edge to it, like when he keeps grabbing her hand, saving her buttski, when she’s in danger’s way; but she keeps complaining bout it. A rebel stormtrooper joining with a somewhat Luke-like female lead adds a slight twist that certainly will be explored. The biggest plus here: we knew so little about stormtroopers before this, now we know we will discover more… or I hope so. Before this they might as well have used androids, or robots. He’s also a tad Hans Solo-ish, where he wants to run away from it all, save himself… only without the greed motive.
The story isn’t as stirring as, say, the first two episodes, (IV and V) were when released, but it’s pretty far from Jar Jar-bad. It wasn’t super original: shadowing several portions of previous Star Wars movies. But you’re reestablishing a franchise. Keeping the story somewhat linear, and familiar, are both important. A little polishing might have helped, as I previously suggested, but I understand not getting bogged down in what happened between the previous heroes’ time and the new heroes’ story is important. I just felt a tad more explanation would not have hurt and would have tied the audience into the story more.Nothing like a heroes almost win it all then some major setback makes the bad guys rally, instead of some mystical order that, at first, seems marginal, small, but very scary. Kind of like some dark side-based offshoot of ISIS in space?
The 3D was nice, though not all that crucial or effective, except when one of the old Empire’s ships is pointed right at you. Though an interesting touch, I don’t think it a necessity, if you want to save a few bucks. Because of special effects, best seen on the big screen.
Welcome to Our End of the New movie reviews. One poster: don’t bother. Two posters: eh, OK, but a lot of problems here. Three: Good movie, just at least one problem. Four: very good. Five: if you don’t go you’re missing out. Added comments at the end: “you could wait for it to come on TV,” “best seen on the big screen” and “good for all screens,” unless other comments are added, refer mainly to the nature of the movie such as special effects, incredible sound or scenery that might make it best seen in a movie theater depending on your set up at home.
On Christmas Day, I fulfilled my duty as an American consumer and took the family to see the new “Star Wars” movie. The excursion solved a mystery: Why do so many of the reviews, even the enthusiastic ones, carry an undertone of disappointment?
The simple answer is that “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” is not very good. It’s professionally made in the sense that it displays an industrial level of Quality Control. But it’s depressingly unimaginative and dull in long stretches, and — crucially — reproduces George Lucas’ original 1977 movie slavishly almost to the point of plagiarism.
This isn’t to say that it’s not an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. If you’re among the millions who plainly have done so, bless your heart. The issue is whether “The Force Awakens” deserves to be considered as a movie, because it’s not. It’s the anchoring element of a vast commercial program, painstakingly factory-made for maximal audience appeal, which means maximal inoffensiveness. The result tells us a lot about the state of entertainment today, and about the future of Hollywood.

RAKES In my opinion, the brakes would have to be counted amongst the best of Lord Nuffield's serious and successful efforts to keep development costs under control during the immediate pre-war and post-war periods. They are virtually identical to the brakes on my very first car - a 1937 Morris Eight two-seater tourer built fifteen years earlier - except that the separate steel reservoir also used on earlier Ts has been replaced by a totally inaccessible cast iron job integral with the master cylinder and hidden under the driver's floor. The only other difference I've been able to find is that the front drums have twin leading shoes.
There were a few problems, some of which, but not all, were due to poor materials, and were beyond reasonable control. The hydraulic fluid was hygroscopic, and eventually became acidic. This corroded both the cast-alloy cylinders and the steel pistons. The corroded pistons damaged the soft cylinders a bit more. The inspired location of the reservoir made it impossible to keep crap out while fluid was topped up. As the cylinder rubbers were replaced more and more often, the bleed-nipples were invariably over-tightened, with the result that eventually everything leaked to the extent that it was hard to keep the fluid up to the leaks.
Fortunately there is a solution: take all the cylinders to your friendly brake and clutch specialist and have them sleeved with stainless steel. At the same time have them reface the unions and make new pipes and swages in copper. They'll sell you modern hydraulic fluid and modern viton seals, and they'll even give you enough of the slimy red goop they use to lubricate the rubbers during assembly, so from then on you should have no further problem. For me, the only disappointment was that my guys said they couldn't sleeve the rear cylinders in stainless steel because of the slot that needs to be machined to accommodate the hand-brake mechanism, so they used brass instead on the rear cylinders; but I've since learnt that they could have done the whole job in stainless.
I was astonished how cheap all this was, and I think it's the best value I've had in the whole restoration. However, if you're amongst those who don't like my pragmatic approach to restoration, you don't have to use this cheap and effective improvement; but do make sure that the judges see and appreciate your leaky cylinders, because such commitment to originality really does deserve major points at concourse.
Just a note of caution, though: if you're planning an extended rehabilitation (like in excess of fifteen years), leave the brakes till close to the end. You don't want to leave the hydraulic fluid in the system longer than necessary, because even the best fluid is hygroscopic, and, as I have discovered, you certainly don't want to be leaving the rubbers unexpanded in the cylinders, because firstly they will get a set and secondly the slimy red goop turns out to be a chemical precursor for super-glue, and you will find it impossible to bleed the brakes and very hard to get the rubbers out. In my case, the holes in the master cylinder piston were also blocked, and the small hole - the bypass port - also looked suspiciously opaque. (Actually, it must be true about ill winds - I found that the reason the bypass port was opaque was that it had never been drilled out when the cylinder was sleeved, so the brakes would have come on, but never released. They could never have worked properly. The machine shop who had done the job originally had gone out of business - which may acount for why it had been so cheap - so I had to pay to have it done again.)
ASTER Cylinder Having complained about the master cylinder, I must now admit that it's a pretty sophisticated piece of technology (note however that my dictionary gives one of the meanings of sophisticated as "involved in sophistry, deprived of simplicity"). So I'm not sure whether the sophistication is the result of premeditated design or a series of compromises to make it work more or less as you'ld expect: it does seem to be much more complicated than you'ld think it ought to be.
To remove it, it's easiest to remove the floor board, even though this means removing the seats first. Alternatively if you prefer the brake fluid in your eyes and clothes rather than on your duco, you can struggle to undo it from underneath. In either case, undo the hydraulic pipe union and drain the fluid. The manual says you should disconnect the brake pedal return spring, and lift out the brake pedal with pushrod and rubber boot, but I prefer to undo the clevis pin on the brake pedal and remove the push-rod and boot with the cylinder. Undo the two bolts which luckily have captive nuts on the chassis bracket and you can remove the cylinder: if you're careful you shouldn't spill too much fluid onto your paintwork.
When you get it onto the bench you can take off the boot and withdraw the pushrod, then push the piston far enough down the bore to remove the circlip. Now the pressure of the return spring should be enough to push the piston and rubbers out, and the valve and valve body should come out with it leaving only the valve washer still inside, which you must also get out. Carefully note the order of components.
Have a look inside the reservoir: directly underneath the filler cap you can see two holes, one small (the "bypass port") and one larger (the "feed orifice") behind it. In its normal position, the piston is held back on the piston stop and circlip by the return spring, and the master rubber rests between the two holes. The master cylinder is filled with fluid, and so is the annular space behind the master rubber: this space is filled through the feed orifice. Fluid is prevented from draining out of the back of the piston by the secondary rubber which you stretch carefully over the end of the piston and into its groove.
When the brake pedal is pressed (the piston goes from right to left in the drawing above), fluid is forced through the holes in the side of the valve body, past the sides of the rubber valve itself and into the brake pipes where it does its job.
When the brake pedal is released, the piston is returned to its original position by the piston return spring (ie the piston and the master rubber are pushed from left to right by the spring). The fluid from the space behind the piston can flow past the sides of the master rubber allowing the master cylinder to fill quickly; to help this, the piston has a number of small holes in the head, and there is a dished washer between the piston face and the rubber (make sure the holes are clear, and make sure the washer is the right way round - concave side away from the piston head). If the brake shoes aren't adjusted ideally (and they rarely are), you can, as everyone knows, "pump" the brakes again quickly, and the extra fluid which has entered the system presses the shoes closer and more firmly against the drums.
When you let the brakes off, the piston is pushed back against its stop by the return spring, and the bypass port is uncovered. The shoes are returned to their rest position by the shoe springs; the pressure in the system opens the valve against the pressure of the piston return spring and fluid is returned to the reservoir through the bypass port. When the pressure is about 8 psi, the pressure of the piston return spring closes the valve, keeping a small pressure in the system, which keeps the wheel cylinder rubbers expanded. Occasionally the bypass port becomes blocked with dirt, or covered by the piston rubber due to poor adjustment or softening of the rubber (or because your machine shop didn't drill it out in the first place - see above). In that case the fluid can't return to the reservoir and the brakes will bind in the "on" position. Solution: make sure the piston return spring is long enough, adjust the pedal free movement, clean out the port, fit new rubbers, get a competent shop to do the sleeving properly.
Here's a question: when you pump the brakes gently so fluid flows past the master rubber from the space behind it, why doesn't the partial vacuum also draw air into the system past the sides of the secondary rubber?
A: Not much - good focus, good exposure, and and the resolution is at least good enough to show very nicely how the Micram adjuster on the top shoe is assembled back-to-front, which would have made it very difficult to adjust the shoe.
RONT Brakes I don't think there are any tricks to the front brakes. When dismantling you have to be careful not to twist the flexible brake hose, so if you're dismantling that far you first undo the union nut on the metal pipe while holding the nut on the hose itself with a spanner, then undo the locknut on the flexible hose, and then the banjo on the brake plate (taking care not to lose the copper gaskets), which releases the flexible hose. I like to put the banjo bolt back in place with its gaskets, so they don't get lost.
Take off the grease cap, remove the split pin and undo the stub axle nut - there is a left-hand-thread on the left hand side of the car, and a right-hand-thread on the right side. Prise off the brake drum, taking the outer bearing with it. Remove the inner bearing using a hub-puller if you have one, or ingenuity and persistence if you haven't. Take off the spacer and grease retainer. Note that once you've taken off the drum, you must pull off the inner bearing etc, and reassemble them into the brake drum, because otherwise you can't reassemble it properly - the bearing will not fit properly into the drum when you offer it up, and the grease retainer will have nowhere to make the seal. Undo the four nuts and bolts holding the brake plate assembly to the stub axle, and remove.
Reassembly is quite straightforward. The back plates are quite clearly assymetrical in order to accomodate the wheel cylinders, so you can't get it wrong. Bolt the wheel cylinders into place, naturally using Loctite, noting that the Micram adjuster is going to go on the bottom on the front cylinder and on the top on the rear cylinder. Fitting the shoes is a bit tricky. First note that each shoe has one plain end and one slotted end; the slot is going to fit over the Micram adjuster. The two pull-off springs fit into the front hole on the slotted end, and the second from back hole on the plain end; they go between the shoe and the backplate, not outside the shoe. So: first fit the springs onto the shoes, then on each shoe, slip the slotted end over the adjuster. Then, first on one shoe, then the other, lever the plain end into the groove in the wheel cylinder. This will be easier if the Micram adjusters are turned fully anti-clockwise, ie right off, and it is probably easier if the back plate has been bolted into place on the stub axle (the bolts are inside the drum, and the nuts outside; as always, don't forget the Loctite).
New bearings are very cheap, so I made a point of using new bearings throughout. Pack the inner bearing with grease, and push it into place in the brake drum. Fit the spacer and grease retainer into the drum on top of the bearing, making sure it's the right way round (open side towards the oil or grease you're trying to retain), and push the drum onto the hub.
EAR Brakes Unfortunately nothing can improve the rear brakes, which have one leading and one trailing shoe both operated by one wheel cylinder which is supposed to be free to move in the backplate in order to equalise the braking force between the two shoes. The manual makes a virtue of this deficiency, claiming that it gives "the advantage of equal braking action when the brakes are used in reverse". In fact this is not exactly true: eventually the works become glued up with road dirt which stops the cylinder from sliding freely and makes the trailing shoe virtually useless, and they are if anything even worse in reverse when the one effective leading shoe becomes a trailing shoe (this is also the real reason why, in the words of the manual, the front brakes "take the greater percentage of the braking load" - not because the front brakes have twin leading shoes, but because more often than not the back brakes just don't do their job).
The pictures above show the front and back of the left rear brakes. These are a little more tricky than the front brakes, and I found a couple of pitfalls.
The piston is in two halves, and the inner half has a bevelled slot for the handbrake lever. You assemble the springs and rubbers in the normal way, then the inner half of the piston, and then you have to slide the handbrake lever into position and hold it in place with the pivot pin. Then you fit the outer half of the piston with the seal and dust cover. When you pull on the brake lever, it forces the outer half of the piston outwards, and when it's assembled in the brakeplate, it forces the leading shoe (ie the bottom shoe) against the drum. The cylinder is supposed to be free to slide in its slot, and it is held in place by the rubber boot. The idea is that the reaction of the pressure of the leading shoe against the drum makes the whole cylinder assembly slide upwards in its groove, thus forcing the trailing shoe against the drum. Inevitably it becomes glued up with road dirt, and doesn't work effectively. I know of no answer to this, except to clean it frequently. A little smear of grease on the back of the cylinder will help it to move freely initially, when it should work at least long enough, hopefully, for it to pass its rego. The other problem is that the cylinder is held in place only by the rubber boot; when it starts to fray, the cylinder isn't held exactly in place. Similar systems were used on other British cars, notably Standard Triumph, but - at least on those I've had the pleasure of working on - the cylinders were held in place by a spring clip rather than the rubber boot.
The other thing I found to be wary of is the backplate. At first sight they look symmetrical, but they are not, which means you must fit the plates to the correct side. The shoes are located by a shoe steady spring. You push this spring through the hole in the brakeshoe and twist it, where it engages with a little bracket welded to the backplate. This bracket is the source of the asymmetry: it is to the rear of the triangular plate pressing on the top, and to the front on the bottom. You can just see the spotweld in the second picture, where the bracket is welded. If you try to assemble the backplates the wrong way around, the bracket will be to the front on the top, and to the rear on the bottom. You will find, as I have, that you can assemble the steady spring, with difficulty, but the brake shoes have restricted movement.
The book gives no guidance about assembly, which can be tricky if its done on the car (but quite straightforward if you've taken the backplate off). So: first wind the Micram right off, then assemble the piston into the cylinder, and rotating the piston until the slot for the handbrake lever engages with the lever. Fit the Micram, and hold it all in place with the lower shoe while you fit the lower shoe steady spring. Note that, as with the front brakes, the slotted end of the bottom shoe fits over the Micram adjuster; the other end of the cylinder has a groove, and the plain end of the other shoe engages in it. Now the return springs: these go behind the brake shoes. Once again, the manual gives no guidance: I figured that the return springs were strong enough, so I fitted them into the first hole of the doublet (ie the easiest hole!). Fit the front spring first, engaging it in the lower shoe. Engage the upper end of the front spring into the front hole on the upper shoe, then fit the front edge of the top shoe into the slot on the top of the cylinder. Now engage the bottom end of the rear spring into the rearmost hole in the bottom shoe, and lever the top shoe into position, engaging the spring as it goes. I found that bracket for the top steady spring wasn't in exactly the right place, which is a bit surprising. On the other hand, on the right hand side there was only one (lower) spring, and so, shrugging slightly, I consigned the left hand side upper spring to the spares box. Now, make sure the whole assembly is free to move up and down to the limit of the cylinder in its slot, then fit the brake-drum over the shoes, tighten the nut and use a fresh splitpin.
Now as discussed above, these brakes were never very efficient, but particularly the handbrake is hard to get on with. There is less movement in the handbrake piston lever than you might expect, and that means that although you may be pulling on the handbrake itself with considerable force, you cannot bring the shoes into contact with the drums unless both sets of shoes are adjusted properly - just skimming the brake drum when the brakes are off. In my case it was even more difficult, because the effective range of the handbrake lever was restricted (what had happened, one day, before its long rest and while it was still in daily use, and when it was parked outside my home, just around the corner from the pub, two patrons, each as sharp and bright as a bagfull of rusty hammers, had parked their car right up against mine while they went to refresh themselves. Some time later, when they were fully refreshed and ready to leave, they found themselves parked in by another car which had parked right behind their's, and had thought the easy solution was to let my handbrake off and push my car forward. Unfortunately they didn't know about fly-off handbrakes, so with two beefy idiots pushing on the button while trying to release the brake, something had to give. What gave was the pawl, which now has only two teeth, and the ratchet itself, which now has a very limited effective range. I was not able to source cheap replacement parts, and drew back from the impossibly expensive solution offered by my parts supplier. Note to self: Future precaution: don't leave the car outside a pub, don't leave it uncovered, and do leave it in gear with the handbrake off!).
So, first undo the handbrake adjuster nuts until the handbrake lever (confusing naming system - everything seems to be the handbrake lever. In this case it is referring to the operating lever, at the cylinder) is completely relaxed (no tension on it at all). Then adjust each Micram adjuster through the hole in the brakedrum until the brake pads are just skimming the brakedrum. Possibly undo the Micram one notch. Then adjust the adjuster nuts, both sides together, until the brakes come on fully, ensuring once again that they are fully off when the handbrake is released.
Friction in the hand-brake cable is another thing that makes the brakes inefficient. Because I don't remember ever having greased mine, and any residual grease from the manufacturer had long since reverted to the rocks from which it had been extracted, this was a problem in my case. I cleaned it all by soaking in mineral turps, working the cable backwards and forwards inside the outer, then flushed it through with clean turps. When it had dried, I covered the cable with heatshrink plastic,then worked molybdenum disulphide (Molyslip) into it by hanging it up from one end and dripping the molyslip in at the top until it came out from the bottom (hint: don't do this before an important meeting: your nails won't come clean until they have grown out!).
Sorry anyone who has been following this blog, but I just can't keep up with it. I have a cooking blog that I am much more focused on right now and it's using up all my blogging energy. I'm not going to take this one down, but I highly doubt I will be posting here anymore. On the other hand I will be doing weekly cat posts over at Cooking Stuff. Right now I am copying all the back posts from here, but once that is done I will be doing new posts every Sunday.
Bob is a 7 year old grey Maine Coon (mostly, we think) cat. He was adopted from MSPCA-Angell Memorial Hospital in Boston. He likes sleeping, rolling around, rubbin's, sitting in laps and stale diet food. He is also known as Tubba, Fattyboombalaty, Big-Fuzzy-Monkey-Face, Poopypants, Buddy, BigMan and Fluffy Pantaloons, among others.
Noodles is about one year old, we believe. She was also gotten through MSPCA-Angell Memorial Hospital. She is an unwed teenaged mother with two kittens from two different fathers (sounds like daytime TV doesn't it?). Her and her litter were being fostered by my brother and his wife. The kittens were easily placed in homes, but we couldn't bear to let her go. She enjoys running around like a nut, juggling toy mice, lovin's, sleeping in doorways, putting on weight (it's good), purring so loud you can hear her across the room and being uncertain of Bob. Also known as Mama, Little Girl, Pretty Lady and Knockitoff.

The 2016 IAB Summit was a truly inspiring and exciting event! Gathering industry leaders, movers and shakers in one room is bound to trigger creativity and fuel inspiration for a productive and game changing year ahead.
Effective Measure was proud to have been able to introduce Roli Okoro from Vivaki MENA as our honoured guest speaker. Roli has over 15 years’ worth of experience in both the TV and Digital industry across a variety of disciplines including media operations, technical account and product management.
Roli was an undisputed highlight of the programme with her palpable passion for digital and her relatable dissection of the complexities of programmatic, she had the audience geared up and ready for the challenges ahead in education, and the adoption of programmatic advertising in South Africa.
Effective Measures’ own Nicolle Harding, together with Peter Langschmidt from Echo, explained to the guests how the new Effective Measure Digital Survey will complement the most recent industry changes and assist Brands, Publishers and Agencies to fully embrace and utilize data in a meaningful and lucrative way.
The introduction of the new survey, together with Effective Measures’ new products, will give local publishers more exposure opportunities by making local online audiences easier to reach. After these products have been in the market for a while, Effective Measure will be able to set benchmarks and provide guidelines on issues such as ad viewability and ad recognition.
Inspiration, creativity and collaborative efforts were the major take-out of the event and all of us at Effective Measure are proud to be part of the South African digital marketing ecosystem – a group dedicated to accelerated growth, innovation and collective efforts.
To further highlight our industry’s appetite for success and growth, the 2016 Bookmark Awards, aptly dubbed “The Oscars of the digital world” was an impressive event from beginning to end. Our heartiest congratulations to all the nominees and winners! You have done the industry proud and we look forward to seeing more extraordinary achievements from you in the year to come.
We hosted our first “Leadership Lunch” on 4 March 2016 at the beautiful La Campagnola restaurant in Bryanston.
The objective of hosting events like this inaugural gathering, is to bring together industry members and stimulate a collective conversation that foster the creation of better and more diverse tools being brought into market.
We strongly believe that all industry players need to work together to help form our growing skills. Events like these will stimulate growth and nurture the seeds of creativity in our rapidly evolving industry so we can develop into a thriving and constructive ecosystem.
Starters were served as Bruno Bertrand from Estee Lauder opened up the floor, discussing a broad based funnel approach vs targeted custom audience targeting. While there was some playful arguments in the approaches, everyone agreed that there is a definite move away from environment and toward audiences for higher ROI and contextual relevancy.
A lot of animated discussion ensued around trusted and accessible audience data available to the SA market and how using this data effectively has the ability to transform our businesses.
It was recognised that South Africa is not too far behind international players, with local companies investing in programmatic and audience technology. The general consensus among the guests was that this technology is far too pricey for many Publishers to implement on their own and local, more cost effective solutions are required.
Mains rolled in and the discussions grew heartier. While it was agreed that there is limited demand for audience data right now, the need for good quality data to be available in the very near future was uncontested. Basic demographics and general behavioural statistics are no longer enough. Key stake holders and data partners, like ourselves, recognize the increasing demand for intelligent and well formulated segments. The integration of EM LSM and ECS segments aims to accelerate this framework as does the call for aggregated publisher data.
The power of aggregated data for publishers is manifold. Primary among them is the benefit of earned, scaled revenue channels as well as enhanced own customer experience. There is also a question of data protection. The emPower solution was introduced where audience data is sold blind to market as opposed to other segmentation partners who leave publishers exposed.
As the menu turned to something a little sweeter, so did the conversation. The majority of the guests agreed that ad blocking is not really a threat in South Africa at the moment, due to it being a mobile first ecosystem as well as the average user not being aware of these offerings.
Having said that, the focus on contextually purchased ads will protect advertisers from ad blocking when users do become aware of its function, by adding relevancy to users that will diminish irritation.
“Thanks SO much for having me around Friday. You’ve got my interest piqued very much” – Matt Landon, Zenith Optimedia

The last thing most parents of gifted children think their kids will have problems with is homework. After all, gifted children are cognitively advanced and learn quickly. Unfortunately, for some parents, visions of straight-A report cards are replaced by one or more (or even all) of these problems:
It's not unusual for a gifted child to have all of these problems. It is difficult to motivate a child to do homework, particularly if a child is intrinsically motivated. The first step in solving these homework problems is to understand what causes them.
A gifted child with dyslexia, an auditory processing problem, or some other learning disability may find it difficult to perform as well as they should in school and on homework. Gifted children are not immune to these disabilities and the effect of such disabilities on their learning is then reflected in their homework, including an avoidance to do it. Gifted children with undiagnosed disabilities may be confused and even embarrassed by problems they have understanding concepts or doing their homework. It is much less psychologically and emotionally threatening to avoid doing the homework than it is to do it and fail at it. If a child doesn’t try, he can easily convince himself that had he done the homework, he would have done it well.
Gifted children who are disorganized – and that is a large number of them – have a hard time doing homework because they have misplaced the assignment, forgot to bring the book or worksheet home or forgot the due date. Daily planners don’t seem to help these children because they tend to lose, misplace, or forget those as well. If they have managed to bring all the necessary materials home on the right day, they can then forget to take it to school or they may take it to school, but be unable to find it in their backpack or stuff it in their desk or locker at school, where it disappears until the end of the semester or school year.
Children who are perfectionists are often reluctant to complete their homework because they don’t feel it is good enough. If it doesn’t meet their standards, which tend to be quite high, they can become frustrated. Over time, they may procrastinate in order avoid that frustration. Perfectionist children may complete their homework, but then neglect to turn it in because they aren’t satisfied with it or don’t feel that it reflects their true ability and don’t want their teacher to see it and evaluate it. Perfectionists may also choose to put little effort into their work since they can then rationalize the lack of perfection on the lack of effort.
Work that is not challenging or stimulating can be so tedious to complete that gifted children will avoid doing it at all costs. Tasks, for any child, should be optimally challenging. That means that they should not be too easy or too difficult. Tasks that are too difficult can lead to anxiety while tasks that are too easy can lead to boredom. In both cases, children find it difficult to concentrate on the task. They will avoid the tasks in order to avoid the unpleasant feeling — either anxiety or boredom — that comes with it. When children are given tasks that are too difficult, they can get help learning the concepts or completing the task. However, when tasks are too easy, no help is necessary; children are simply expected to complete the tasks, in spite of the fact that boredom makes it just as difficult to concentrate on a task as anxiety does. Sometimes children will manage to complete focus long enough to do the homework, but they will rush through it to get it done and as a result, make numerous careless errors.
Gifted children with a learning disability may have problems with homework. Like all children with a learning disability, gifted children need to learn how to manage the disability and need specific learning strategies and classroom accommodations in order to work at their level of ability. However, it's important to recognize that gifted children are often misdiagnosed with disorders like ADHD, bipolar, and ODD (oppositional defiant disorder. Some learning disabilities can be found through IQ and achievement subtest scores. This testing, and any screenings for disorders, should be done by a psychologist who has knowledge of and experience working with gifted children. It's also important to understand that problems with homework can have many causes; looking for a disability should not necessarily be the first thing considered.
Some children have problems getting with homework because they forget to bring it home, forget the books they need to do it, forget to take it back to school, or forget when it's due. If they do remember all that, they may lose the homework, which may eventually turn up — at the end of the school year, stuffed with countless other papers in the child's desk or locker.
Eileen Bailey, former ADD/ADHD expert, had some excellent suggestions for helping kids get organized. Although most gifted kids don't have ADD/ADHD, some need help keeping their work organized. One suggestion is the Basket of Preparation. Children drop homework and books in a basket when they come home from school, get it from the basket when it's time to do homework, then put it back in the basket when it's done. In the morning everything they need is in one place, ready to take to school.
While you might get your child to do the homework and take it to school, there is no guarantee that your child will turn it in. What can you do to make sure the homework gets turned in? A plastic, expanding folder with separate compartments is a good way to help kids keep track of work that needs to be turned in. Each compartment can be labeled so that a child knows where the homework is for each class. The expanding folder can be used along with the Basket of Preparation. When homework is completed, rather than just placing it in the basket, it can be placed in the appropriate compartment of the expanding folder, which is kept in the basket.
These techniques can work for teens as well as young children, but teens might also find an electronic organizer, such as a palm pilot, useful. Teens love electronic gadgets, so they might be more motivated to keep track of their work electronically. It eliminates assignments written in numerous different places, including little scraps of paper. However, this might not be a good choice for those children who lose more than their homework.
Gifted children will often rush through homework that is too easy for them. They are eager to get it done so that they can move on to more interesting and stimulating activities. One solution to this problem is to have a set time every day to complete homework. This time must be used for study whether the child has homework or not. When children have homework, they know they must do it during this time. If the homework takes them only fifteen minutes and their assigned study time is one hour, they must fill in the remaining time with additional study.
The additional study children do can consist of enrichment activities. For example, if a child has an assignment to draw a map of the expansion of the Roman Empire, they might write an essay about the Romans or they might write a short story about an imaginary Roman soldier. Once children know they have to fill the assigned study time, they may be less likely to rush through their homework just to get it done and move on to other activities.
The daily study time should be the same time every day. Parents should discuss the options with their children so that the children can have some control. For example, children might choose to do their homework right after school or they might choose to do it right after dinner. It is important, however, that the time be the same every day. Children cannot choose to do it after school one day and then after dinner another day, depending on their mood.
Although homework time should be the same every day, children who are involved in extracurricular activities may need a more complex schedule. The may need to do homework right after school on Mondays because they have a dance class after dinner but will do homework after dinner on the other days. In other words, the schedule must be consistent and not based on daily moods. Not only will children learn that scheduling time for homework is important, they will also learn necessary time management skills.
Ideally, teachers will recognize the need for more challenging homework and will be willing to provide it. However, if a child has had issues getting homework done and turned in for so long that it has become a habit, other strategies may be needed at school, whether the teachers provide more challenging work or not. Some schools have homework hotlines that parents can call to find out about homework assignments. In addition, some teachers have Web sites, where they post assignments. Parents can check with their child's teachers to see if such a hotline exists and if so, what the teachers' extension numbers are for that hotline. Parents can also check on Web sites and get the Web address.
Parents can also arrange with a teacher to sign daily papers about homework. Every day a child writes down homework and has the teacher sign a paper, even when there is no homework. Children cannot say they have no homework when they do. On those days children have no homework, they should still spend their designated homework time studying. However, for this system to work, children and parents must agree on a consequence for failing to bring home a signed homework sheet.
Good study habits are important for success in school and these strategies can help develop those habits.
The first clue Bonnie Beavers had of her daughter’s learning disability came in the second grade. The girl scored at the 99th percentile in math on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, but when her teacher divided the class into groups for math, she was not in the highest one.
Beavers showed the child’s test results to the teacher, who was unmoved. “I caught her counting on her fingers,” she said. Then she went completely over the top by insisting none of her students knew the groups were ranked by perceived ability.
The girl was later diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and executive function disorder (an inability to self-organize), as was her older brother. Like many bright children with such disabilities, they had to endure teachers suggesting they were lazy because they could not complete repetitive assignments in reasonable time.
Such children experience frustration, even in this region of great teachers and well-run schools. Too many educators here, according to numerous parent witnesses, share a stubborn blind spot about disabilities that can be mistaken for sloth or carelessness.
Beavers’s children attended the Montgomery County schools, which appear no worse by this measure than other local districts. A Montgomery schools spokesman said specialists are training teachers on the need for accommodations. Beavers briefly enrolled her daughter in a well-regarded private school to see if that would make a difference. She was again disappointed.
A startling part of Beavers’s story is that despite her children’s inability to memorize multiplication tables in the third grade, both were admitted to the Center for the Highly Gifted at Lucy V. Barnsley Elementary School in the fourth grade. “The screening is mostly concept-based,” Beavers said. “They loved being challenged, and it was the only time they felt socially comfortable at school.”
Still, some of the teachers didn’t understand that intelligence is not measured by how much homework you can do. “One night’s assignment for just one subject was to create dialogue for a Shakespeare character, soak stationery in tea and crumple it to look like parchment, and write the dialogue in ink — in calligraphy,” Beavers said. “Sheer torture for a learning-disabled student who works slowly and can barely print legibly with a pencil.”
After two years at Barnsley, her son wanted to go to a math-science magnet school, but failed to qualify. He finished only half the math questions in the allotted time, though all were correct.
He enrolled at Westland Middle School, where Beavers asked for a 504 Plan, part of a federal law that requires schools to give children with disabilities a boost. She presented his high test scores and the contrasting Bs and Cs he was getting because of late or missing work. She asked for extra time on tests and other accommodations. The head of the school’s education management team said, “I feel sorry for your son. You are clearly pressuring him to make As,” then walked out. A spokesman for the county schools would not comment on the situation citing privacy issues.
Beavers thought her daughter would do better at Holton-Arms, a private school for girls in Bethesda. Based on her test scores she was placed in the highest math group and given extra time on tests. But when Beavers asked the school to cut back on repetitive homework as long as each concept was covered, the response was: “We don’t offer that accommodation.” When I contacted the school, a spokesperson confirmed that the school does not have that accommodation.
If you wish to believe Beavers was gaming the system for her lazy kids, that’s your right. I have studied too many of these cases to accept that explanation. Why not make more of an effort to persuade teachers with personal views on this to try accommodation anyway, and see what happens?

And here I am, once again, repeating the life in this era for another one year from 2015 to 2016. By this time, then it's about three times I repeated the life in this era.
It's not that History Correction Mission that I should do in this era was failed. It's just that I did not even start the History Correction Mission effort in this era yet. In the previous two repetitions of life in this era I mostly spent my entire time by walking around the world and enjoy the life, and just looking around on some interesting things happened in this era.
By the way, my name is Rain, I was a time avatar whose duty is to fix history in the era in which I was sent by my Time Travel Force that until now I still can not have a complete control upon.
My Time Travel Force continuously throws me across different time and place to live for one year in that era to correct some historical mistakes in the era in which I was sent into.
Where if I fail to do that, then my Time Travel Force will send me back to the beginning of that era to try once again correct the historical mistake, to as many as needed until I managed to repair the history. Only if it was successfully completed, then I will be sent to a different era, after spending one year in that era.
And here I am now, in the era of 2015's one more time. Incidentally, since this time I am not yet excited at all to perform any historical mistake correction in this year and still not completely conduct any research on some varieties of possible events in this year that should have happened in history, but have the possibility to not going to happen for a reason that will make the historical mistake to happen.
In which, if that happens, usually the life story of this universe that has deviated from the original history will form into a branch of entirely different parallel universe. While I? my Time Travel Force will not let me get into the flow of life story of this different parallel universe. My Time Travel Force will immediately grabbed me and sent me back to the beginning of the era in question to repeat the life at that era to try to correct the flow of history in that era once again.
As readers of this blog, you might think that I fake my story. It is okay. Either you believe it or not, it would not affect me. After all, I've noticed there have been so many films in this era about time exploration which may makes you think what I told you about in this blog is just a mirage story. But definitely, coupled with this year, so I've been three times to repeat the life in this era, in the 2015's.
In the first repetition of life in this 2015 I just spent my time to walk and relax around the world as a backpacker. While in the second repetition of life in this year I followed this Asian talent search contest and became the first champion, you've certainly never remember it, because that event never happened in your life in this version of universe that you and I are living in right now. The life version of 2015 in where I became the champion of Asian talent search contest had became a branch of a different parallel universe. As for this version of life repetition that I'm having right now, maybe I'll try to be a writer, especially as a personal blogger, just to share my experience as a time traveler.
Of course I'm not going to write about the things that will happen this year, because it's only going to mess up history, it would be better if maybe I write about my experiences traveling in some previous eras, in the past, present, and future.
You are free to believe my stories in this personal blog as real experiences that were really happening or want to consider it as a fantasy story. Either way, it should be interesting to see how you would react after reading this personal blog.
To identify and fix the historical mistakes in this era is my primary mission that I have to do, so if were to fail again to correct the historical mistake in this life repetition, at most, after one year, I will be sent back to the beginning of this year with the same task again, that is to find and fix historical mistakes that are currently going on.
So if in this life repetition I fail again, then what will happen to you? Well, you will be living your life in the parallel universe where in this version of your live there will be a story about me (whom you might thought as a delusional and insane person) who claimed as a time traveler who became the author of this personal blog about the life story of this time traveler's, and the existence of this mysterious time traveler author will only lasts for one year, during 2015 to 2016 alone, because after spending one year, this time traveler author will not going to live a life in that version of universe anymore. Because this crazy time traveler author will be sent to the original version of universe specifically in 2015 to once again try to find and correct the historical mistake.
But do not worry, even if your life that you are living now will be part of the life story of a different parallel universe or even if your life will still be part of the original version of universe, you would never notice it.
We prove the vanishing of the Koszul homology group$H$_{μ}(Kos($M$)_{μ}), where μ is the minimal number of generators of M. We give a counterexample that the Koszul complex of a module is not always acyclic and show its relationship with the homology of commutative rings.

In this paper we consider the computational complexity of uniformizing a domain with a given computable boundary. We give nontrivial upper and lower bounds in two settings: when the approximation of the boundary is given either as a list of pixels, or by a Turing machine.
The topological group $\mathcal{D}^k(\mathbb{S})$ of diffeomorphisms of the unit circle $\mathbb{S}$ of Sobolev class$H$^{$k$}, for$k$large enough, is a Banach manifold modeled on the Hilbert space $H^k(\mathbb{S})$ . In this paper we show that the$H$^{1}right-invariant metric obtained by right-translation of the$H$^{1}inner product on $T_{\rm id}\mathcal{D}^k(\mathbb{S})\simeq H^k(\mathbb{S})$ defines a smooth Riemannian metric on $\mathcal{D}^k(\mathbb{S})$ , and we explicitly construct a compatible smooth affine connection. Once this framework has been established results from the general theory of affine connections on Banach manifolds can be applied to study the exponential map, geodesic flow, parallel translation, curvature etc. The diffeomorphism group of the circle provides the natural geometric setting for the Camassa–Holm equation – a nonlinear wave equation that has attracted much attention in recent years – and in this context it has been remarked in various papers how to construct a smooth Riemannian structure compatible with the$H$^{1}right-invariant metric. We give a self-contained presentation that can serve as a detailed mathematical foundation for the future study of geometric aspects of the Camassa–Holm equation.
We obtain integral boundary decay estimates for solutions of fourth-order elliptic equations on a bounded domain with regular boundary. We apply these estimates to obtain stability bounds for the corresponding eigenvalues under small perturbations of the boundary.
[10] Elliptic CR-manifolds and shear invariant ordinary differential equations with additional symmetries
Vladimir Ezhov School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of South Australia Gerd Schmalz School of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science, University of New England
We classify the ordinary differential equations that correspond to elliptic CR-manifolds with maximal isotropy. It follows that the dimension of the isotropy group of an elliptic CR-manifold can only be 10 (for the quadric), 4 (for the listed examples) or less. This is in contrast with the situation of hyperbolic CR-manifolds, where the dimension can be 10 (for the quadric), 6 or 5 (for semi-quadrics) or less than 4. We also prove that, for all elliptic CR-manifolds with non-linearizable isotropy group, except for two special manifolds, the points with non-linearizable isotropy form exactly some complex curve on the manifold.

We show that the Luzin area integral or the square function on the unit ball of ℂ^{$n$}, regarded as an operator in the weighted space$L$^{2}($w$) has a linear bound in terms of the invariant$A$_{2}characteristic of the weight. We show a dimension-free estimate for the “area-integral” associated with the weighted$L$^{2}($w$) norm of the square function. We prove the equivalence of the classical and the invariant$A$_{2}classes.
We prove that weak solutions to the obstacle problem for the porous medium equation are locally Hölder continuous, provided that the obstacle is Hölder continuous.
Universal extensions arise naturally in the Auslander bijections. For an abelian category having Auslander-Reiten duality, we exploit a bijection triangle, which involves the Auslander bijections, universal extensions and the Auslander-Reiten duality. Some consequences are given, in particular, a conjecture by Ringel is verified.
We prove that the cover ideals of all unimodular hypergraphs have the nonincreasing depth function property. Furthermore, we show that the index of depth stability of these ideals is bounded by the number of variables.
Moduli of path families are widely used to mark curves which may be neglected for some applications. We introduce ordinary and approximation modulus with respect to Banach function spaces. While these moduli lead to the same result in reflexive spaces, we show that there are important path families (like paths tangent to a given set) which can be labeled as negligible by the approximation modulus with respect to the Lorentz Lp,1-space for an appropriate p, in particular, to the ordinary L1-space if p=1, but not by the ordinary modulus with respect to the same space.
We study singular Hermitian metrics on vector bundles. There are two main results in this paper. The first one is on the coherence of the higher rank analogue of multiplier ideals for singular Hermitian metrics defined by global sections. As an application, we show the coherence of the multiplier ideal of some positively curved singular Hermitian metrics whose standard approximations are not Nakano semipositive. The aim of the second main result is to determine all negatively curved singular Hermitian metrics on certain type of vector bundles, for example, certain rank 2 bundles on elliptic curves.
We show that if X is a cocompact G-CW-complex such that each isotropy subgroup Gσ is L(2)-good over an arbitrary commutative ring k, then X satisfies some fixed-point formula which is an L(2)-analogue of Brown’s formula in 1982. Using this result we present a fixed point formula for a cocompact proper G-CW-complex which relates the equivariant L(2)-Euler characteristic of a fixed point CW-complex Xs and the Euler characteristic of X/G. As corollaries, we prove Atiyah’s theorem in 1976, Akita’s formula in 1999 and a result of Chatterji-Mislin in 2009. We also show that if X is a free G-CW-complex such that C∗(X) is chain homotopy equivalent to a chain complex of finitely generated projective Zπ1(X)-modules of finite length and X satisfies some fixed-point formula over Q or C which is an L(2)-analogue of Brown’s formula, then χ(X/G)=χ(2)(X). As an application, we prove that the weak Bass conjecture holds for any finitely presented group G satisfying the following condition: for any finitely dominated CW-complex Y with π1(Y )=G, Y satisfies some fixed-point formula over Q or C which is an L(2)-analogue of Brown’s formula.
We show that if X is a uniformly perfect complete metric space satisfying the finite doubling property, then there exists a fully supported measure with lower regularity dimension as close to the lower dimension of X as we wish. Furthermore, we show that, under the condensation open set condition, the lower dimension of an inhomogeneous self-similar set EC coincides with the lower dimension of the condensation set C, while the Assouad dimension of EC is the maximum of the Assouad dimensions of the corresponding self-similar set E and the condensation set C. If the Assouad dimension of C is strictly smaller than the Assouad dimension of E, then the upper regularity dimension of any measure supported on EC is strictly larger than the Assouad dimension of EC. Surprisingly, the corresponding statement for the lower regularity dimension fails. 1
What is the shape of a uniformly massive object that generates a gravitational potential equivalent to that of two equal point-masses? If the weight of each point-mass is sufficiently small compared to the distance between the points then the answer is a pair of balls of equal radius, one centered at each of the two points, but otherwise it is a certain domain of revolution about the axis passing through the two points. The existence and uniqueness of such a domain is known, but an explicit parameterization is known only in the plane where the region is referred to as a Neumann oval. We construct a four-dimensional “Neumann ovaloid”, solving explicitly this inverse potential problem.
We derive an integral representation for Herglotz-Nevanlinna functions in two variables, which provides a complete characterization of this class in terms of a real number, two non-negative numbers and a positive measure satisfying certain conditions. Further properties of the class of representing measures are also discussed.
Let F :RN→RN be a locally Lipschitz continuous function. We prove that F is a global homeomorphism or only injective, under suitable assumptions on the subdifferential ∂F(x). We use variational methods, nonsmooth inverse function theorem and extensions of the Hadamard-Levy Theorem. We also address questions on the Markus-Yamabe conjecture.
We extend a recent result of Avelin, Hed, and Persson about approximation of functions f that are plurisubharmonic on a domain Ω and continuous on ˙Ω, with functions that are plurisubharmonic on (shrinking) neighborhoods of ˙Ω. We show that such approximation is possible if the boundary of Ω is C0 outside a countable exceptional set E⊂∂Ω. In particular, approximation is possible on the Hartogs triangle. For Hölder continuous u, approximation is possible under less restrictive conditions on E. We next give examples of domains where this kind of approximation is not possible, even when approximation in the Hölder continuous case is possible.
This paper is devoted to a functional analytic approach to the subelliptic oblique derivative problem for the usual Laplacian with a complex parameter λ. We solve the long-standing open problem of the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution for the homogeneous oblique derivative problem when |λ| tends to ∞. We prove the spectral properties of the closed realization of the Laplacian similar to the elliptic (non-degenerate) case. In the proof we make use of Boutet de Monvel calculus in order to study the resolvents and their adjoints in the framework of L2 Sobolev spaces.

HERE RESTS my sister Josephine, born july in '29 and dead these 15 years, who carried a book on every stroll. when daddy was dying she left the streets and moved back home to tend him. her pimp came too, her Diamond Dick, and they would take turns readIng hundred people. At each town, the train paused for fifteen minutes while Gon- chigdorj took a ceremonial sip from a bowl of milk, sprinkled a few drops In the air in honor of the local spirits, and gave a brief speech. Along the way; his assistants distributed calendars fea- turing Genghis Khan in a pensive pose beneath the inscription "Democratic Mongolia." Gonchigdorj is a former math pro- fessor who first made his mark in politics as a leader of the 1990 pro-democracy movement. He is forty-seven years old, and has a round face, slick black hair, and a reputation for opportunism. I met him in his private carriage on the way north; he was resting between stops, sipping tea while the scenery slipped past. "The ruling party is against privatization," he told me. "The reason is that during the Communist regime we couldn't even talk about that issue, and the M.PR.P still believes that the state should own everything. It's softening, of course, but it's still there." It seemed that Gonchigdorj was cre- ating something of a nonissue-after all, the M.P.R.P. had presided over the initial stages of Mongolia's pri- vatization. But Gonchigdorj's former party, the Social Democrats, had been part of the coalition government in 1996, and they were still coping with the backlash that had cost them the 2000 parliamentary election. Gonchig- dorj was in trouble. He was running on the bible aloud through the house. when you poem this, and you will, she would say; remember the Book of Job. happy bIrthday and hope to you Josephine, one of the east's most wanted. may heaven be filled with literate men, may they bed you with respect. -Lucille Clifton the theme of balancing the M.PR.P's majority in parliament with a Demo- cratic president, but his message wasn't coming across as strongly as Bagabandi's plea for one-party domination, as ex- pressed in the slogan "If the govern- men t is stable, the people will be peace- ful." Before the start of the campaign, Sumati's poll had indicated that only thirty-seven per cent of the voters sup- ported Gonchigdorj. The train trip did not go well. The crowds were small and unfriendly, and the northward swing ended at Altan- bulag, a town on the Russian border whose residents seemed more involved with the movement of strange goods across the border than with the drama of the election. I saw a cluster of eth- nic Buryat women packing spools of thread into empty laptop-computer cases, which they then transported into Russia. Nobody could explain this activity to me. At the border station, a sad-faced young man was trying to use a bicycle pump to inflate the left front tire of a red Lada. He paused when Gonchigdorj came through, and when the politician left he started . . pumpIng agaIn. I began to wonder what the aver- age Mongolian actually felt about democracy. Sumati's polls had shown that, nationwide, eighty-seven per cent thought the 1990 shift to democracy was the right step for the country; and fifty-two per cent had expressed sat- isfaction with the present political sys- tem. But among older Mongolians there was still a strong sentimentality for the Soviet past, when incomes were secure and the old M.PR.P made all the decisions. At rallies, I met many people who seemed disillusioned with their country's changes. "Since democ- racy came, people have just become poorer," one woman told me at an M.PR.P rally in Zuunmod, south of Ulaanbaatar. "I think if there's just one party ruling it will be better." She was fifty-two years old, trying to sur- vive with a herd of eight cows, and she struck me as a paradoxical creation of the post-Communist world-someone who longed for the clarity of old au- thoritarianism while relishing her new freedom of speech. She said that last spring she had become so fed up with the coalition government that she had organized a protest of a hundred and eight herdsmen. They had tried to ride fifty miles to the national parliament building but had been stopped by the police before they reached the center of Ulaanbaatar. Still, she was enormously pleased that the newspapers had re- ported the protest. During my last meeting with Sumati before the election, he remarked that there were indeed authoritarian ele- ments in Mongolian politics, especially in Bagabandi's camp. "He'll be quite quiet until after May 20th," Sumati said. ' d then he will create some problems. He'll try to show some principles, but I'm afraid that those principles are not democratic principles. They are author- itarian principles." Sumati grinned. He seemed to de- light in pointing out the frailties of the Mongolian system; earlier he had told me about a mudslinging campaign that was going on between the M.PR.P. and the Democratic Party. The Demo- crats had accused Bagabandi of accept- ing a million dollars in bribes from the Chinese; meanwhile, there were in- sinuations that Gonchigdorj and other former coalition leaders had hindered the investigation into Zorig's murder, and there was talk of a scandal from Gonchigdorj's days as a math professor, during which he had allegedly helped a Mongolian youth team cheat at an in- ternational math competition.

A letter written by MSgt. Glenn B. Knight, NCOIC of the Public Affairs Office, TUSLOG Det. 10, Inçirlik Common Defense Installation, Turkey, on March 29 1980 to his family in Eastern Pennsylvania.
Well I guess it's about time I got my thoughts together and put them down on paper before they get lost entirely. This has been the most eventful month so far.
Actually, everything was quite calm and normal until mid-afternoon on the 14th when the quiet under current of action which seems to precede most disasters started in earnest. Key staff members being pulled out of meetings and suddenly telephones being tied up. I got the base commander out of a meeting for a phone call-when he hung up he actually leaped over a desk and out the door to his car.
Then, the first word over the Secondary Crash Network, "We have a missing aircraft, C-130, call sign. . .we have lost radio and radar."
From that moment on we knew that, at the very least, we had a cargo aircraft which made an emergency landing on a highway or in a field.
Since there is usually a short lull in the action I decided to call our headquarters in Ankara to alert them and conduct a little business before it all broke loose.
To call Ankara we must get the operator at Inçirlik to call the Ankara operator who gives us our number. Because the equipment is so old and worn, about half the time we connected to someone trying to call out of Ankara.
The operator placed my call and click-"Hello". I asked, "Who is this?" The voice answered, "This is General Burns [Commander of TUSLOG, headquartered in Ankara], I'm trying to get the Inçirlik Command Post". "Yes sir," I replied, "I'll get the operator." By the time I got the operator the Secondary Crash Net was ringing again. "Assemble the Disaster Response Force on Main Ramp B," it directed.
Our regulations call for the Public Affairs Officer to go with the DRF on-scene. But Capt. Jackie Clark [the Public Affairs Officer, and my boss] was expecting her closest friend back that day on one of our two C-130s so I took off with our crash kit to Main Ramp B. Capt. Clark came along to drive my car back to the office.
While I reported in to the DRF she went to the Operations Center where she learned that it was not her friend's plane, but by then I had left with the explosives ordinance team to gather up equipment and meet at the main gate.
Col. Ozçan, the Turkish Base Commander, borrowed a helicopter from the Adana Martial Law Commander and he and Col. Green, the senior American Commander [Det 10/CC] headed toward the last known position. In the mean time the other C-130 was in the vicinity searching and two F-4s were conducting high level vector searches. The other C-130 spotted the wreckage and guided the helicopter to it.
By the time I got to the main gate we had a known down with 18 SOB (souls on board). Capt. Clark took my place on the DRF. I headed back to the office. It was about 4 p.m. On returning to my office I realized that we had left the lowest ranking person, Airman First Class Mark Hess, alone in the office. My administrative NCO was on emergency leave and my newspaper editor went home earlier in the day very sick.
The commander's admin NCO stopped in to see what was going on so I sent her to get my editor out of bed. I checked on the required notifications and Mark had made them and then some. So realizing that the office (we call it the Emergency Operating Area during a crisis) was in good hands I went to the Command Post.
At the Command Post I learned that the crash site was due west of the base 14.5 miles, near the edge of the Tarsus Mountains. I also learned that there were 6 crew and 12 passengers on board. SSgt. Denise Cornella, my very-sick editor, took my place at the Command Post.
I drove over to the Airlift Operations Center to get copies of the passenger list and crew orders. They were reluctant to give them to me but I finally cajoled them out of the information. As I was leaving the operations officer lowered the phone from his ear and quietly announced, "There are no survivors-I have the confirmation." The room which seconds earlier has been a hubbub of activity became ghostly silent, everyone froze in place. A second later the shock was over, the professionals returned to their sometimes grim duties.
During this time a convoy of fire trucks, ambulances, rescue vehicles, police cruisers, staff cars and carry alls was plodding past Adana being led by the Turkish Jandarma and getting directions to the crash site from the C-130 still in the air and the helicopter heading back to the base.
As they got to the crest of a hill they looked down on the smoking, splintered wreckage. It didn't look anything like an airplane.
Not having radio contact with the helicopter which had surveyed the scene and concluded that there were no survivors, the rescuers-medics, cops, commanders-started down the embankment through mid-calf mud. When their trucks and cars got bogged down they ran the remaining few hundred feet to find only small reminders that people were on board.
There were no lives to save, no bodies to look at, only pieces to be picked up for later identification. The horror was so intense that in the videotape which was taken for the local base television station, the members of the DRF could be heard in the background alternately laughing and crying while going about their grim tasks.
Returning to my office the sun was beginning to set. We went about the business of putting out a news release telling the base, and the world, officially, what we knew of the crash. We also answered a constant stream of calls on our Rumor Control Line.
Some of the rumor control calls were tough-people trying to find out who was on board because they had a husband or friend flying that day. Those flying included all of our school teachers returning from a 3-day training conference. We were able to say for sure it was not them.
But others wanted to know who died. We couldn't ask for a name because while we could probably confirm their friend's safety, there were those we knew were dead. We can not give names of deceased and to say nothing was the same as confirming it. So we did not ask! SSgt. Thelma J. Bankey, the commander's admin NCO, had stuck with Mark and I in the office and finally I asked her to get us something to eat.
At about 8:30 we heard that the DRF, now called a recovery force, had called the recovery off due to darkness and was returning. The TV crew had returned earlier so I sent Mark out for a break to review the films. He returned convinced that it was all to gory to be shown on TV but the TV people said they had clearance from Capt. Clark to run it.
Capt. Clark and the base commander, Col. Glenn Young, were the last ones to leave the scene that night and got stuck on a back road. They had to get pushed out of a hole. They got back to base just after 9 p.m. and she called the office from the command post. I asked Mark to relay his impressions of the film while I drove over to the station. Our TV service is run by military people in the same career field as mine. TV is closed circuit going only to people on base. The radio signal is broadcast to Adana. I had written the news release and there was no problem with it being broadcast-we had to tell people what happened. It was the pictures that could cause the problem.
As I walked in the studio I could tell that Capt. Clark had called and told them not to run it. I asked to see the edited film clip and decided that, while it was not pretty, it was not repulsive and I decided to back the TV station. Besides, it was now a quarter to 10 and they already had the whole news show built around that clip. On my recommendation, Capt. Clark got Col. Young to agree. The film ran.
I went back to my office, sent everyone home until 1 p.m. Saturday and drove the 15 kilometers to Adana [where my family and I lived in a penthouse apartment] and a restless sleep.
The family had [earlier in the day] talked me into going to see a movie with them-Miss Piggy in the Muppet Movie-and I had looked forward to it. They went to the movie without me but on the way home got me to laugh for the first time since mid-afternoon with recollections of the Muppet antics.
We had nothing more to do until all of the next-of-kin had been notified (we figured Noon at the earliest). But, as had been our [family] regime, we had to get up to be on base for an 8 a.m. basketball game. Chris [our son] was on the undefeated team.
At about 9:15 a.m. Bev [my wife], who had headed out the gym door looking for some coffee, came back and told me Lt. Chris Clero, casualty assistance officer, was looking for me. The notifications had been made. I went to the personnel office to get full identifications then to the office to write the follow-up story with names.
It was starting to become clear that most of the passengers were members of the local rock music group BALSÉ. They were so good that they had been asked to go on tour to some of the remote sites within Turkey. They had left that morning for Synop in northern Turkey but the plane couldn't land because of bad weather.
Another person on board was a courier for classified messages. James Webster, a 54 year old black master sergeant who was born in the Panama Canal Zone of Jamaican parents. He almost always wore a yellow jump suit and a blue raincoat with a green baseball cap. He looked odd but he was a very likable gentleman who went out of his way to be nice to everyone.
The whole aircrew was on temporary duty from Dyess AFB, Texas. The navigator, LtCol. Ben Barnette, had been the Inçirlik Director of Personnel when I arrived here. He had returned to the states about six months ago and was sent back on temporary duty. To die in Turkey. Well, I had the names and the authority to release them so I started working on the news release and called Capt. Clark to come in and help.
To shorten this considerably, Mark also came in to help and by mid afternoon I called in SSgt. Bankey to type the final message to the world.
At 5 p.m. Mark and I were alone again in the office. We had learned a lot that day about how everyone reacted-and it was all good.
Our paper [The Looking Glass] comes out on Friday but we decided to do a 2-page special edition and get it out Monday. We agreed to meet again at about 3 p.m. Sunday to start it. Well, our little special edition turned out to be 6 pages and we got it to the printer by noon on Monday-people are still telling us that what we did was impossible. I've included a copy for your review.
Never, in my 18 years in the news business, have I had as many people stop me in the streets and offices and either thank me or congratulate me on our special edition. After the special edition went to press the commander of our Office of Special Investigations called and said, "Congratulations on your Thomas Jefferson award!" We knew we were in the running but had heard nothing. The message had come in Friday afternoon and was mis-routed to him.
Winning the Thomas Jefferson Award means that a panel of professional journalists picked our newspaper as the best in the entire Department of Defense [by category, ours was mimeograph newspapers]. We had earlier been named best in our command and best in the Air Force.
This week started off kind of slow. Capt. Clark found out she will be leaving the 31st rather than the 2nd which means that I will have to play host to Col. Cole, the command director of public affairs next week, rather than her.
With no PAO, I'm in charge of the shop (I really would rather not be in charge because the management leaves too little time for the writing I love) until the new PAO comes in. That was supposed to be "before the end of April" but this week I learned he will not get there until almost mid-May. And before he gets in I will have to host Col. Cole and arrange for Mark and Denise to cover the activities of the Commander in Chief of our command, including a TV interview and a mock presentation of our Thomas Jefferson Award. On the 18th of April we are going to get a Management Evaluation Team inspection. They happen every two years and the team inspects everything we do.
Last Thursday afternoon I got a call from Capt. Mike Whitaker who told me that I was in charge of setting up a ceremony for the departure of the caskets on Friday. Thursday was also my deadline to write questions for the CinC of the command to answer in his interview on Tuesday.
Between arranging for a color guard, honor guard, chaplain, pall bearers and a Turkish honor guard I wrote the questions, got them approved by the commander and sent them off by message.
Then it started to rain hard so I checked with the weather forecasters and found out that Friday was going to be identical to Thursday. So I went to the commander with this information along with the facts that follow:
Two of the caskets probably would not go because they were to go to Spain for burial and we could not get Spanish approval to unload them.
Instead of 18, there were 19 caskets. The extra casket contained the parts that could not be identified.
The commander's decision was to have a small color guard, a chaplain and a few friends, to palletized the load and not to have the Turks. So I went back to the office and started un-arranging everything I had arranged and re-doing the whole thing.
While this was going on the Stars and Stripes [newspaper] called and wanted to know if the American prisoners had been released as they had been expected to be. It turns out they were not. Three Americans (one male, two female) have been in prison here for more than 7 years for drug smuggling. Last year the Turkish government developed an amnesty law which would include them. They were told they would be released March 12. In late fall the Turks started releasing prisoners based on the new law and had released about 600 by March 5 when they decided that they had misinterpreted the law and that prisoners would have to serve two more years before release.
As I left Thursday afternoon we were expecting to have a color guard, chaplain and a few spectators to see the two groups of caskets off. Two in a C-5 at 8 a.m. and the rest on a C-141 at about 3:30 p.m.
Before I went to work Friday morning I stopped to see the mortuary affairs officer who told me that the C-5 was broke and would be departing at noon and that all of the caskets would be on it when it departed if the Spanish clearance came in on time. I went back to the office, rearranged everything and told the commander that the afternoon ceremony would conflict with Commander's Call which my office sets up for him. I suggested he cancel the call. He said he'd make a decision after his regular Friday meeting with all the colonels on base.
About an hour later I was told the C-5 would be broke until midnight and that all but the two for Spain would go on the C-141. Then someone called telling me the ceremony would be 45 minutes later than I had planned, that it would include color guard, honor guard, chaplain and the whole base would be invited. I went to see the commander-who told me to cancel Commander's Call-and he told me the colonels had decided to do it this way. I asked him who was in charge and he said Capt. Whitaker. I called Capt. Whitaker and told him the good news-then I bailed out.
Next, Capt. P. J. Crowley [TUSLOG PAO at Ankara] with another question from Stars and Stripes-this time a formal request we call a query. They suggested that there had been a formal decision at Inçirlik not to try to identify certain kinds of drugs because too many would be identified and there wouldn't be enough people left to run the base.
As usual, it was a statement taken out of context. The statements were accurate but they did not mean exactly what they said. I'll finish it off with a formal message response Monday but it takes time.
Also on Friday we found out that the commander of the wing at Dyess AFB, Texas had held a press conference in which he suggested the C-130 was shot down by terrorists. This is absolutely false but he got a lot of news coverage.
At about 3 p.m. my command public affairs people called to ask where I got my questions from. I told them that they were all common concerns. They told me that no one knew the answers-which means they have no idea what our problems are. They also said the didn't think it would be proper for the CinC to present our award to us.
Well, this ended up with the TV interview and our award presentation being canceled. Just as we were thinking about going home after a long hard day the Rumor Control phone rang. Someone wanted to know if it was true the Adana [actually Çukarova] dam had broken and Adana was flooded.
While it had been raining heavy for two days, this did seem a bit far-fetched. On checking it out we found out that while it was wrong-there was a chance it could happen. The water level was less than 1 meter from the crest and 65 small communities along two rivers fed by the dam had already been evacuated.
Very tired at 5:30 we started for home realizing that on the way we had to cross one [actually both] of those rivers. The bridge [John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge] for E-5 [Trans-European Highway Number 5] usually stands 10-12 feet above the water level. Last evening the water was lapping across the very top of the bridge. [It turned out that the modern Kennedy bridge was damaged but the 800 year old Roman arch bridge a thousand feet down river was unhurt] Once across the bridge we found our normal turn 4 feet under water and we could see water spouting from the manholes.
They have been working on a new drainage system along Attaturk Blvd. Since mid-summer and are just now finishing it. But, the system drains into the river and with the water so high in the river the drainage system was working in reverse.
We finally made it home and looked down Attaturk but could see nothing. This morning we slept late (no basketball game) and listened to the base radio. Suddenly they announced that the base water pump was flooded and that all they had were emergency supplies. Also, travel between Inçirlik and Adana was not possible since both bridges are impassable. Also the high school band would not return from Ankara since the roads were impassable. Also, water distribution points are being set up. Also, numerous things have been canceled.
Our water has been on an off all day [normal]. So far it is not discolored. And since we always add Clorox anyhow, we are OK. We also keep about 10 gallons for drinking and flushing the toilets-we are used to it [as opposed to those on base who take drinking water for granted].
So-not being able to get to base I was forced to take my first day off in about 3 weeks. The only thing I did today was write this letter. I expect things will be close to normal by Tuesday or Wednesday.
P.S.S. I just looked outside and the whole section of the city which is under water is also without electricity. Including the American Consulate where their underground parking lot is an under-water parking lot. It's odd to see them without electric since they have an emergency generator-but their generator is in the basement. (I wish I could remember how big a cubit is)
It rained last night and the water level is higher. It now comes to within a half block of our place. The kids were watching this morning while one of the Turkish paratroopers we guard the Consulate slipped and fell into about 3 ft of muddy water. While we have heard nothing yet on the radio about conditions I assume the bridges are still closed. Unless it starts to go down this afternoon, I may not be able to get to work tomorrow.
Apparently the base is in real bad shape. 90% of the work force is Turkish and 90% of them live in Adana. When the roads were cut by the water most facilities were working with minimum staff. Those workers could not get home and the ones at home could not get to work. Part of the Turkish union contract says that we may not replace Turks with Americans if for any reason the Turk can not make it to work and we may only switch certain Turks to other jobs.
Just heard that the band is on its way from Ankara by bus and is expected at about 5 p.m. I wonder how they are going to get across the bridges. Perhaps someone knows something we don't. [The letter continues on with personal notes and family chit chat]

Isang Milyong Aklat, Isang Milyong Pangarap was featured yesterday at Emil Jurado's column To The Point at Manila Standard Today. Please visit http://www.manilastandardtoday.com to see the article.
AHON Foundation continues to spread its mission to more schools. AHON recently tied up with the community of Payatas B Annex Elementary School (PB-AES) to develop the school’s library. PB-AES will be AHON’s 9th adopted library since the organization started less than 2 years ago.
The new PB-AES library is expected to benefit 1200 students. Furthermore, the library will also support the strengthening community of Gawad Kalinga - Ateneo Blue Eagle Village where the school is situated in.
Though noticeably deficient in suitable tables, chairs and updated and well-conditioned books, students from Lucas Pascual Memorial Elementary School (LPMES) have always been eager to visiting their simple library. As Mrs. Balbanita Gomez (school librarian) reveals to AHON, “Kahit luma na, pinagtyatyagaan pa rin nila. Natutuwa na sila sa mga libro na meron dito.”
Such was the enthusiasm the students showed for reading that AHON Foundation decided to make LPMES its 8th adopted library. Initially, the task of developing LPMES’ library seemed daunting for the school’s humble community. They feared that reviving their library might entail much more resources that they can ever afford to raise. Fortunately, the community was able to prove itself wrong. Through the cooperation, innovation and hardwork exerted by volunteer parents and teachers, students of LPMES now enjoy a well-lit and colorful library furnished with the new books by donated by AHON Foundation.
The community’s resourcefulness proved vital in the transformation. Parents and volunteers alike worked everyday to refurbish old tables, chairs and shelves. Teachers and the school’s librarian used their creativity in decorating the room. The result is a library, completely evolved from its old state, that is conducive for reading and learning for the students.
“We are glad to witness the community come together to build this library,” affirms Mr. Hector Tagaysay, Chairman of AHON Foundation, during the library’s inauguration last Oct. 4. “To the students, we urge you to read these books that your parents and teachers have worked so hard for to bring to you. Huwag kayong matakot na maluma siya sa pagkagamit dahil sa ganung paraan naming makikita na minahal at pinahalagaan niyo ang mga aral at impormasyong nakuha niyo sa mga librong ito.” And indeed, it seemed the students appreciated their new books and their new library. Bright smiles lighted the room as the rustling of turned pages are heard during the library's opening.
Today, LPMES students no longer content themselves with a handful outdated books. They now enjoy good books whose information and stories can satisfy their eager young minds.
It was not too long ago when Mr. Angelito Valderama, a parent from San Bartolome Elementary School (SBES) in Quezon City, was listening to the radio to Mr. Harvey Keh (Executive Director of AHON Foundation) talk about AHON’s mission of transforming lives through developing libraries in public elementary schools in the country. Mr. Valderama shares, “Nangarap po ako na sana mapalad din ang San Bartolome na masama sa ganitong magandang proyekto. Di ko lubos akalain na matutupad ito nang dumating ang AHON sa ating paaralan. (I had hoped that San Bartolome may be so fortunate as to be included in AHON’s projects. I could hardly believe that my wish came true when AHON came to our school)”. He further continues, “Isa itong napakagandang regalo na siyang aming aalagan para sa aming mga anak (This is truly a wonderful gift that we will take care of for our children)”
Indeed, such was the appreciation, enthusiasm and support showed by the parents and the rest of the SBES community for their new library. Wherein in the past SBES students had to content themselves with a mostly outdated collection of books scattered in different areas given their small library, SBES now boasts of a bigger and better library housing entirely new sets of books donated by AHON Foundation.
The goal of SBES’ library design was to encourage the students to come to the library and make reading as their habit. As such, the staircase and hallways leading to the library were painted brightly to entice the students’ curious minds. Meanwhile, the kiddie mural designs inside the library fuel the students’ creative imagination spurred by stories and information they read from their new books.
Just as Mr. Valderama's wish came true for him, the students' dreams for their own future is now one step closer to coming true through the power of reading .
- Launched last September 25, San Bartolome Elementary School is AHON’s 7th adopted library, benefiting more than 2000 students. -
A year ago, Batasan Hills Elementary School (BHES) had few resources to offer to its students. It suffered from lack of adequate classrooms and school facilities and its’ students academic performance was 3rd to the last among Quezon City’s public elementary schools. But today, Batasan Hills fortune has seemed to turn.
With an active school community led by BHES’ school officials and parents, and a supportive local government, the students now has much to look forward to. New classrooms are currently underway, student training has been intesified, and facilities have been upgraded. Of the latter, perhaps the most invaluable token BHES has received of late is a revived library filled with new books donated by AHON Foundation.
Launched last September 20, the inauguration of this new AHON adopted marked a new beginning for the students of BHES. The new library provides an opportunity for increased learning for the students. As Harvey Keh, Executive Director of AHON puts it,
"You (the students) may not necessarily be able to travel around the world to see all that there is. But through books, you may be able to experience and learn infinite things, and journey through time and space."
BHES may have been in need of much in the past but it has gained so much now. Its library has been transformed to an educational playpen as colorful tables and shelves fill the room with every nook and cranny lined with books. Indeed, learning has been made easy, accessible and enjoyable for the students of BHES. It is hoped that through BHES new library, students will be engaged more in the enriching process of reading and learning.
Batasan Hills Elem. School is the 6th adopted library of AHON Foundation. It is expeted to benefit more than 5000 students.
Neither strong wind nor rain can stop the GSIS Village community from building a library for t heir school.
The dedication of the teachers, parents and other community members of GSIS Village Elementary School (GSISVES) paved off as they launched their new library on September 13, 2007. Their library renovation project, which started during this school year’s stormiest season yet, gathered together members of GSISVES’ GPTCA, faculty, students and baranggay (Brgy. Sangandaan) to work together for a common cause. The community, led by principal Dr. Lourdes Abalos, worked through holidays, class suspensions and weekends to finish their library. The result is a completely engaging library, lined with colorful shelves, new tables, and playful room decorations and toys donated by the GSISVES community.
In his message to the community, Mr. Maghacot stressed to the students the vital role of reading. He cites knowledge gained from books as treasures that can empower the students to achieve more in life. He mentioned how fortunate the students of GSIS ES are for being beneficiaries of these treasures and for being surrounded by a community who values their well-being.
The inauguration, held at the GSISVES AVR was attended by Mr. Pacific Maghacot Jr. (Asst. City Administrator for General Affairs for QC) Atty. Vicki Luanzon (Special Asst. Sec to the Mayor), Dr. Meleda Polita (Dep-Ed QC Asst. District Superintendent), Mr. Hector O. Tagaysay (Chairman of AHON Foundation) and Mr. Lewis Edwards (Chairman of ABC Foundation)
GSISVES’s new library benefits more than 2000 students. It is AHON’s fifth adopted library and AHON’s first in Quezon City. AHON Foundation hopes to continue to open doors for learning for students as it stretches its reach to more cities and regions in the country.

2017 ESC focused update on dual antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease developed in collaboration with EACTS: What is new?
It`s past time to put a name to people and policy that are conspiring together to enslave America and her citizens.
Let`s start with this – obamacare called by it`s rightful name is slavery, it is the act of a tyrannical group to control and force their will on a citizenry that obeys the law, that was raised to respect the rule of law- the citizens respect for Constitutional law was used to force us to our knees and bind our hands, they counted on us to shrug and say, “well, it was legally passed”
Legal does`nt mean right. Our ‘representatives” have sold us out, they believe they are safe in their hold on power, that we will “forget” and capitulate and of course, re-elect them.
The President has made many claims and his democratic co-conspirators in this anti-American law have piously told us- TOLD US, that once we have it we will understand the special genius that the democrats have displayed in giving this law to the uninformed majority of the public that continues to say NO, we do not need or want it.
They have been playing us for suckers for quite a while, long enough that they are now comfortable with showing themselves without the pretense of covering their real intentions.
Their intentions are to control and enslave us, their intentions are to put us in a position that we have no choice but to comply- that is tyranny.
Are you aware of what is written into obamacare? how about this little gem - http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obamacare-marketplace-personal-data-can-be-used-law-enforcement-and-audit-activities_762237.html
In plain talk, that means you MUST provide information that can be used to prosecute you, remember, you MUST prove you have health care now, you MUST disclose the details of your health care, cost,benefits,etc. – That will require your personal banking information to be entered, remember, the IRS is the enforcement fist of obamacare. We all know of the tactics and tendency of the IRS to consider you guilty until proven innocent- do you think they will treat you fairly?
The House Republicans have stood up to the Obama regime – and it IS a regime, with the only weapon they have, the authority to control the flow of money. They did not do this because they are principled politicians, they did this because they were getting swamped with contacts from citizens demanding they actually represent the people of America, in short, they did what self absorbed, elitist, weasel politicians have always done when presented with the possibility of loss of their power and prestige – they acted like it was their idea to actually do their job.
This time they have stumbled into a position that terrifies them, they must take a stand against the behemoth of government that allows them the stature and lifestyle they believe they deserve. They have stuck with this position simply because the other power they face is even more terrifying to them – us. They remember 2010, they will not admit it, but the thought of a united citizenry coming for them creates stains in their silkies.
The President and his co-conspirators are not accustomed to being told NO! They do not deal well with it – most tyrants and dictators have a way of dealing with that situation, they simply kill a few hundred thousand and the rest fall into line, that will not happen here and Barack Hussein Obama knows it. He does not like it, but he knows it.
Barack Hussein Obama is not one to be denied his vengeance, he is not one to be defied, after all, in his world he is king – literally.
This is why the open air Memorials, OUR PROPERTIES are the first to be blocked, why the Senate embarrassment known as Harry Reid feels comfortable calling a large segment of Americans “anarchists”, “terrorists”, ‘hostage takers”, because he has grown to believe he is above the law, he is convinced HE will determine the law – when he made the statement in a recent press conference ” what gives the House republicans the right to decide what gets funded” , surely he knows the Constitution of the United States of America gives them the absolute right, not only does it give them the right , it comes with a responsibility, it was included as a weapon to stop a tyrannical, out of control President – exactly what we now have.
This link provides clear evidence that the things closed by the shutdown are designed to cause pain to American citizens – no other reason. http://www.glennbeck.com/2013/10/07/glenn-the-presidents-treatment-of-the-govt-shutdown-is-the-sign-of-a-dictator/
The worst threat to America is not Barack Hussein Obama, Harry Reid, or any of the other gutless wonders that are entrenched in OUR government.
The true threat to Americas survival is the main stream media, they are knowingly aiding in the downfall of our Republic, they are actively engaged in helping enemies of America and Constitutional law to overthrow this Nation.
That is treason. Make no mistake, they are, in effect, supporting people that want nothing more than to see Constitutional law overturned and socialist / marxist /communist ideals and policy imposed.
The media is the ONLY entity specifically named in the Constitution for absolute protection, the Founders knew that if the king/ tyrant/ dictator controlled what information was, or was not made available to the people, they could be easily duped. We have been.
They receive and repeat the information that the administration wants to be trumpeted and they will not, under any circumstances, demand or report factual information that might cause the administrations ideology or policies to be questioned, or facts verified – even if that ideology /policy/law will lead to the enslavement of the American people. That is Treason.
We have a couple weapons at our disposal, the best one is our Constitution, but it requires US to hold it up as a shield and REFUSE to kneel.
We have to be prepared to REFUSE to comply with bad law and any law that FORCES Americans to purchase a product for their ENTIRE life, or face punishment, simply because you are an American citizen IS bad law.
A law that FORCES Americans to submit information into a government database with the stated intent that information can be stored and used to prosecute them IS bad law.
A law that is applied ONLY to individual citizens and NOT to big business or Congress simply because the President says so IS bad law.
We have one other weapon to exert our power as American citizens, much like the House of Representatives was given the power of the purse to control an out of control President, we can use the power of the purse to rein in a treasonous media, big media lives and dies on advertiser dollars, especially local affiliates.
Make a list of the advertisers to your local newscast, send them a letter, e-mail, or facebook message, calmly and factually explain that their advertising dollars are funding a local news outlet that will not present an unbiased, balanced news product, then simply say that you, your family and friends cannot in good conscience, continue to purchase products and services from them – then send a copy of that letter to the news outlet.
Here is a link to a national organization that is wielding that weapon - http://www.truthrevolt.org/join-the-fight
If we do not stop this, who will? We must support the House Republican weasels that are forcing the regime to show their true colors , if we had not forced them to stand up to the dictator, we would have already lost a big chunk of Freedom and liberty to obamacare by simply rolling over – Americans don`t do that, do we?
We`re not done, we will have to keep the pressure on for them to hold the line, after all, they are weasels, they will snatch defeat from the jaws of victory – if we allow it.
If we don `t stand up, the next generation will not only be slaves, they will be enslaved because we did not act as EVERY other American generation that was faced with a fight for Liberty has acted before us. Want to guess the name for that?

"In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution." --Thomas Jefferson, fair copy of the drafts of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 - "Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph." --Thomas Paine, American Crisis, No. 1, 1776 - "Freedom had been hunted round the globe; reason was considered as rebellion; and the slavery of fear had made men afraid to think. But such is the irresistible nature of truth, that all it asks, and all it wants, is the liberty of appearing." --Thomas Paine, Rights of Man, 1791
As the race for the Republican nomination warms up, it is too early to tell who would head the party's ticket next Fall. But there is more to understanding politics than predicting the horse races, and for those ready to look, there are already patterns emerging from the available field of potential candidates.
First, the next Republican nominee is not likely to come from the other end of Pennsylvania avenue. With the announcement of Senator John Thune (SD) that he would not be running, there are no more sitting Senators vying for the Republican nomination. There is only one former Senator thinking of running, Rick Santorum (PA); but he is not a serious contender. There is one sitting member of the House Ron Paul (TX) and one former member, Newt Gingrich (GA), who are likely run, but neither of them are inspiring much confidence.
Second, the next nominee is likely to have spent some time in a Governor's Mansion. The buzz, if there is any, revolves almost entirely on the Governors and former Governors. Among those still in office are Haley Barbour of (MS), Mitch Daniels (IN), and Rick Perry (TX). Even more exciting are the names of former Governors Mike Huckabee (AR), John Huntsman (UT), Sarah Palin (AL), Tim Pawlenty (MN), and Mitt Romney (MA), the current frontrunner.
What do these two patterns tell us? First, the Founders' aim to separate the legislative and executive functions has succeeded, perhaps even beyond their intent. Whereas there was a time when most Senators looked into the mirror and privately hailed the impending Chief, this is no more. It is true that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama once sought the presidency from the chambers of the Senate, but they were had spent only 8 and 4 years there, not like John Kerry, who lost the race to another Governor in part because of the record of his votes. Bush was able to paint Kerry as a flip-flopper only because the latter had to explain his vote authorizing the president to use force in Iraq (a problem which had also compromised Clinton's candidacy.)
The point then, is that Americans today believe that legislators deliberate.They write prose, as was said of Clinton. But executives, we have come to believe, are deciders. And they are also expected to inspire us with poetry. This Obama was able to do in 2008, and so he was an exception to the line of former Governors -- Carter, Reagan, Clinton, and Bush -- who had preceded him in the White House. Witness the low approval ratings of Congress as an institution, in contrast to the personal popularity of any president, even deep into his first term. In an age of impatience, we do not have time for the lethargy of Congress (or the Courts), but we wait with abated breath for the energy of the executive.
Second, that Governors' Mansions are better breeding grounds for a future president than either House of Congress tells a systemic story about America's (or at least Republican America's) increasing distrust of Washington, DC. The capital is not so much a symbol of a nation as it is a despised metropole of an empire, as distant from the people as it is the opposite of their virtue. And this is why Governors are able to speak the appealing language of the "outsider" untainted by beltway politics, and it points to why Haley Barbour, who has strong ties to former colleagues at K Street, may have less of a competitive advantage than would say, a Tim Pawlenty.
It is no wonder then, that Republican operatives are still waiting for a candidate who would be a breath of fresh from far far away in some state capital, who has not (yet) spent a lifetime in politics and without a record of having taken positions on various political issues. If you're now thinking that Republicans are basically looking for their Obama, then that too is my point, as it is my warning. For even Democrats have wondered in the last year if a rookie's inspiration was worth its price in inexperience. This is American politics writ large, bi-partisan, and uncompromising in the 21st century, for better and, though it is seldom emphasized, also for worse.

In the past ten years I’ve been approached to run for Mayor, City Council, and even the State House of Representatives. I’ve turned them all down because, frankly, going to meetings all day is my idea of a soul-grinding hell, and I suspect there would be a lot of work involved. Not to mention the lack of access to both a 1960 Cadillac convertible and an on-staff geisha girl with monkey feet. Who can work under those conditions? Not me, that’s who.
But now our country’s in trouble. Unemployment is inching toward the 10% mark, we’re fighting two wars and sucking around for a couple more, and the economy is crushing the monetary juice out of the ripe melon of our national productivity. A full 89% of the population feel that the current government is lower than a fresh snake turd, yet most Americans are more interested in the underwear Kim Kardashian wore to her wedding than in any policy ideas the President has to help get the economy back on track and put Americans back to work.
So at this time, I have decided to offer my leadership to help turn this ship of state back toward its rightful goal, the shining wharf of prosperity and glee. What will Bob Wire do for us, you ask? What are his qualifications? Why should we risk our future on this rare-do-well musician, this tequila-guzzling wisenheimer? Does he have any experience? Does he have a plan? Does he even know how to drive a ship?
Wow, you sure have a lot of questions. I can answer all those questions and more, with just two words: shut up. Remember when lil’ Ross Perot ran for President in ’92? He was like the irascible uncle, the one who ragged on you for parking your car on his lawn and puking in his rose bushes. In the debates and on the campaign trail, he came off as crazy. Yeah, he was crazy. Crazy like a fox with rabies. If that little Texas shorthorn would have won, he probably would have destroyed the infrastructure of our federal government (or as he called it, “gummint”) from the inside. It might have taken two terms, but our system would have been in shambles and we would have to start over. Kind of like Greece is doing now.
So that’s what I’ll do. I’ll start from Square One. I think the United States is to the point where Washington is too broke to fix. The special interest drudges who bellow long and loud that they are there to serve the people simply cannot be yanked free of the corporate teat. When I take office, they will all be issued immediate status as persona non grata in D.C., and given menial jobs with the various lobbyists whose hands are in their pockets the deepest. Big Pharm, Big Insurance, NRA, all the moneyed corporations and groups that run the country by pulling the strings on their congressional marionettes will now have to deal with these gravy-breathed sycophants in the corporate world.
But what then, Bob? Who will be making policy and legislating the legislation in Washington? Don’t worry, my trepidatious reader. I have a plan. I have the training. You may not know it, but I am an educator as well as a musician and writer. That’s right. An educator. My credentials? I spend a large part of my day teaching motherfuckers a lesson, that’s what.
So once we clear out the riffraff, we bring in the experts who are going to get our once-proud nation back on top, where it belongs. My cabinet will start with just one person: Chuck Norris. In his newly created position, the Secretary of Ass Crackin’ will begin getting the economy in line right away. A half-spin karate chop to the head of Fannie Mae will send her stumbling into Freddie Mac, and they’ll both tumble off the cliff of the crippled housing market into an angry, roiling sea of reasonable interest rates. No more upside down mortgages, no more oversold home loans. That’s payback with interest, bitch, Chuck will say as he dusts his hands off.
Secretary Norris will then don his Black Belt in International Diplomacy. He will enter the arena of multinational conflict, and will force all the squabbling, contentious factions in the middle east region to respect each other’s borders and faiths, simply by taking off his shirt. He will put his right fist (“Cannonball”) through a thick wood plank to show Israel what will happen if they don’t release the Palestinian prisoners they are holding and torturing, and allow Palestine to establish a recognized state. The he will put his left fist (“Haymaker III”) through a redwood stump to show them what will happen if they ever set foot on the Gaza Strip. I’m sick of this Zionist bullshit, he’ll say.
What about the war on terror? Enough with the war nomenclature. We will begin a new era, called the Finger Wag Against Terror (known colloquially as “uh uh UHhhh”). I will name Angelina Jolie the new Director of Homeland Security, if she’s not busy with a Lara Croft sequel. Her uncanny knack for popping up wherever there’s trouble will make her the ideal dominatrix of the skies. It won’t matter whether the terrorists are hiding bombs in their underwear, their shoes, their beards, or their Kenneth Cole man purses. AJ will root them out. She’ll appear in the aisle of that airplane, and give the babbling jihadist the bum’s rush right out the emergency door in Row 14. Sorry, she’ll say as she dusts off her hands, this flight is overbooked. Every time she thwarts another terrorist attack, I will reward her by allowing her to adopt a small child from the country of her choice.
Then I will call on my new Arbiter of National Culture, Clint Eastwood, to ensure that gay marriage is fully legal in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Why should gay Americans not enjoy the right to watch their partner take a morning growler while they’re brushing their teeth, and have sex less often than they pay the mortgage, like us breeders? As Arbiter Eastwood says, “These people who are making a big deal out of gay marriage? I don’t give a fuck who wants to get married to anybody else. We’re making a big deal out of things we shouldn’t be making a big deal out of.”
Something we should be making a big deal out of is the health insurance crisis. The whole insurance-medical complex is swimming around in way too much of our money. When I’m in office, one of the first things I’ll do is appoint Samuel L. Jackson as National Liaison to Health. I will ask Mr. Jackson (Secretary SamJack) to cap physicians’ salaries at one million dollars (I can’t even type that amount without hearing Dr. Evil say it in my head). Same for corporate CEOs. If they want to take home more, they have to provide insurance for one American family for every $100,000 they make above that. Secretary SamJack should have little trouble achieving compliance as he pays a visit to each member of the AMA. (“Say what again.”)
But, Bob, you say, these doctors went to college for eight years or more to earn their degrees they need to practice medicine. Don’t they deserve those obscenely large incomes? Oh, boo-hoo. Hey, I went to college for seven years or so, and all I have to show for it is that I can totally kick your ass in foosball.
The bottom line is that it’s not right, it’s downright un-American, to be living the life of luxury while millions of people in the U.S. go to bed hungry, have no access to decent health care, and don’t have jobs. We have a third-world country WITHIN OUR OWN NATION. This is not the United States I want to hand off to my children. If you think money is more important than people, go ahead and vote that straight Republican ticket. You’ll be rubber stamping an eventual revolution.
But if you want to get this great nation back on track and restore the values that were envisioned by our Founding Fathers, make sure you remember to write in “Bob Wire” when you vote for President in November 2012. I’ll be sure and thank you on my way to the White House, as I drive by in my ’60 Caddy ragtop with a geisha girl riding shotgun.

Exploration of how dialects of English differ from each other, focusing on grammatical variation in the US, with occasional forays into British dialects. Students come to appreciate how linguists investigate grammatical diversity scientifically, revealing the complex structure of non-standard dialects. [Prereq: CAS LX 250 or consent of instructor]
With respect to the Linguistics major, this counts in the category of 'Linguistic analysis of a specific language.'
Semantics is the study of linguistic meaning. In this course, we will examine meaning from a variety of perspectives, including: how it is encoded in words and sentences, how native speakers interpret language, and how truth and falsehood can emerge from the complexity of the grammar. We will also touch on various aspects of pragmatics - the function of meaning in a communicative setting. [Prereq: CAS LX 250 Introduction to Linguistics or consent of instructor.]
Introduction to the sound system of language. Study and analysis of physical and mental aspects of sound production in speech and the system in which sounds are organized. Phonological rules, processes, and universals are examined through consideration of various languages. [Prereq: CAS LX 510 Phonetics or consent of instructor.]
Examines the mechanisms and outcomes of language contact by surveying cases around the globe from the past and present. Topics include lexical-borrowing, code-switching, pidgins and creoles, language death, and the emergence of entirely new linguistic systems. [Prereq: CAS LX 250 Introduction to Linguistics or consent of instructor.]
Morphology, the study of the internal structure and the shapes of words across languages, straddles the boundary between syntax and phonology. This course covers the major empirical and theoretical issues in the study of morphology, emphasizing links to other components of grammar. [Prereq: CAS LX 250 Introduction to Linguistics or consent of instructor.]
Investigation of syntactic commonalities and differences across languages. Scrutiny of evidence and argumentation from past and current analyses, focusing on construction of strong arguments. Topics include movement, passives, question formation, syntactic micro-structure, and interaction with semantics, pragmatics, and phonology. [Prereq: CAS LX 522 Syntax I or consent of instructor.]
(Conducted in Spanish) The goal of this course is to introduce students to the linguistic analysis of speech, with a focus on the Spanish language. We examine the vowels and consonants of Spanish from the perspective of articulatory and acoustic phonetics. In addition, the course introduces core concepts in phonological analysis, surveying the phonemic inventory and phonological organization of Spanish. We also investigate a range of regional variation demonstrated by so-called ‘dialects’ of Spanish, with an emphasis on the historical and social significance of such variation in Spain, Latin America, and the United States. In summary, this course aims to examine the sounds of Spanish as physical, mental, and social phenomena. [Prereq: One 300-level Spanish course and CAS LX 250 or consent of instructor]
If you are trying to register for this course as CAS LS 507 and it appears full, you can just as well register for CAS LX 507. These two courses are identical, meet together, and satisfy all of the same requirements :-) .
This course can satisfy requirements for both the Spanish and the Spanish & Linguistics majors; it can also satisfy the Linguistics major requirement for a course in the linguistic analysis of a specific language, as well as counting toward both the Spanish and Linguistics minors. See http://www.bu.edu/linguistics/UG/spanling.html for further details.

The Lockheed L-1011 TriStar has been chosen by six of the Free World's ten largest airlines that fly wide-bodied jets. That's good to hear If you I ive near an al rport. TriStar is the quietest big jet in the world, as certificated by the U.S.A'.s Federal Aviation Administration, thanks to its Rolls-Royce RB.211 engines Rolls-Royce designed the RB.211 with fewer moving parts. It wrapped much of the engine sound in an insulating shroud of air Other sounds are muffled and absorbed by an acoustical honeycomb. TriStar shrinks the noise area around airports 920/0.

Older four-engine jets affect an area of about 62 square miles With TriStar that occurs during takeoff over an area of less than five square miles. (The noise diagram above shows the area difference between TriStar and older jets.) Even if you live or work within that smaller area, TriStar still brings welcome relief because it generates less than half the annoying jet noise of older jets. *Based upon passengers carned 57 . . .

And fewer of them Or at least, fewer than there would be If only the smaller noisier jets were flying TriStar's long-range good neighbor policy. Rolls-Royce is increasing the thrust of the RB.211 engines to 48,000 pounds. This means TriStar will be able to provide nonstop service to cities as far apart as 5300 statute miles.

"On September 15, 1842, the British Astronomer Royal, Sir George Biddell Airy, K.C.B., M.A., LL.D., D.C.L., F.R.S., F.R.A.S., responded to a query from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The government was considering funding an invention of one Charles Babbage. Should Parliament support the construction of the analytical engine--the first mechanical calculator and predecessor to digital computers? What would be the value of such a device? The learned astronomer's one-word reply: 'Worthless."
Can't make up your mind about new music? '"Ringo" [i.e. HOMR Now: Firefly] is a personalized music-recommendation sytstem,' Professor Pattie Maes of MIT's Media Laboratory writes in the July 1994 'Communications of the ACM.'
Of all the software agents she's considered, 'This one might have the best potential to become the next "killer application" '. Along with other entertainment-selection agents, it will help you select movies, books, and television shows, by correlating your tastes with other intelligent agents.
Now, I don't need a computer program to tell me what books or music I'll like. Friends, reviews, and browsing work just fine, thank you.
Intelligent agents are a fantasy sprouted in the tomorrowland of MIT's medial laboratory. They're believable enough to generate heavy grants for big-name researchers. But I wonder of Professor Airy's prediction may now be coming true, a century and a half late."

Abu Dhabi Classics is thrilled to announce the first of its artists confirmed to perform for its eighth season!
The season will commence on October 12 at the iconic Emirates Palace with Mozart and Satie Violin Concertos by the prestigious Camerata Salzburg Orchestra with violin virtuoso Renaud Capuçon, one of the most fascinating living performers of this repertoire. The Performance will start at 8pm.
The evening will be completed by pieces from late 19th century, early 20th Century minimalist composer Erik Satie that influenced among other musical genres, Jazz music, and also Surrealism. Satie’s clear musical lines are also reminiscent of Rossini’s and Mozart’s music. Get ready for an evening with some of the most famous works of the Viennese Classical Period and of the New Music and appreciate not only the beauty of Classical music but also its permanence and evolution over the centuries.
The highly anticipated Abu Dhabi Classics new concert season of cultural harmony, will bring a dynamic and diverse programme of classical and traditional music to the Capital.
Since its formation, the CAMERATA has been a regular ensemble in its home city of Salzburg as a concert and opera orchestra at the Salzburg Festival as well as the Mozart Week, and has its own subscription series at the Great Hall of the Mozarteum Foundation.
The CAMERATA regularly performs in Europe's centres of music from the Vienna, Zurich, Frankfurt, Ferrara, Luzern and Munich to Cologne Philharmonic and Paris; it is invited to various international festivals, as a representative of Salzburg's Mozart style, and goes on at least one major overseas tour every year.
More than 60 recordings on vinyl and CD, many of which were awarded major prizes, document the musical culture of the Camerata Salzburg spanning six decades.
Musical personalities such as Géza Anda, Sándor Végh, Sir Roger Norrington and András Schiff have influenced the CAMERATA. Famous musicians such as Clara Haskil, Alfred Brendel, Philippe Herreweghe, Franz Welser-Möst, Pinchas Zukerman, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Teodor Currentzis, Hilary Hahn and Fazil Say have performed with the CAMERATA through the decades, whose classical core repertoire with Salzburg's "genius loci", Mozart, and Viennese Classical music at the centre, extends to the Romantic and Modern periods.
As its greatest inspiration and longtime conductor, Sándor Végh's call to: "Search within yourself, then you will have something to say!" still echoes today and challenges the CAMERATA, again and again, to lay bare the "soul of chamber music" as the central element of the CAMERATA sound in the oeuvres it performs, and to bring it to life.
Born in Chambéry in 1976, Renaud Capuçon began his studies at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris at the age of fourteen, winning numerous awards during his five years there. Following this, Capuçon moved to Berlin to study with Thomas Brandis and Isaac Stern, and was awarded the Prize of the Berlin Academy of Arts. In 1997, he was invited by Claudio Abbado to become concert master of the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, which he led for three summers, working with conductors such as Pierre Boulez, Seiji Ozawa, Daniel Barenboim, Franz Welser-Moest and Abbado himself.
Since then, Capuçon has established himself as a soloist at the very highest level. He has played concerti with orchestras such as the Berliner Philharmoniker under Haitink and Robertson, the Boston Symphony under Dohnanyi, the Orchestre de Paris under Eschenbach and Paavo Järvi, Philharmonique de Radio France and Filarmonica della Scala orchestras with Chung, Orchestre National de France and Gatti and Gergiev, and the Simon Bolivar Orchestra and Los Angeles Philharmonic with Dudamel.
Recent concerto engagements include concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra with François-Xavier Roth, Chamber Orchestra of Europe with Jaap can Zweden, Detroit Symphony Orchestra with Leonard Slatkin, Los Angeles Philharmonic with Matthias Pintscher and Camerata Salzburg with Robin Ticciati. Capuçon also tours extensively as a solo recitalist and will perform in play directs with various groups such as Camerata Salzburg, Festival Strings Lucerne and Basel Chamber Orchestra.
Capuçon has a great commitment to chamber music and has worked with Argerich, Nicholas Angelich, Barenboim, Bronfman, Yuja Wang, Buniatishvili, Grimaud, Pires, Pletnev, Repin, Bashmet and Mørk, as well as with his brother, cellist Gautier Capuçon. These collaborations have taken him, among others, to the festivals of Edinburgh, Berlin, Lucerne, Verbier, Aix-en-Provence, Roque d’Anthéron, San Sebastian, Stresa, Tanglewood and Salzburg.
He is the Artistic Director of the Easter Festival in Aix-en-Provence which he founded in 2013 and was appointed Artistic Director of the Sommets Musicaux de Gstaad in 2016. He is teaching violin at the High School of Music in Lausanne since 2014.
Recording exclusively with Erato/Warner Classics, Capuçon has built an extensive discography. Recent releases include Bach and Vasks Concertos as conductor and soloist with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, and Brahms and Berg Concertos with the Wiener Philharmoniker under Daniel Harding. His latest chamber music recording is a disc of Frank, Grieg and Dvorak sonatas with Khatia Buniatishvili. His recording of Fauré’s complete chamber music for strings with Nicholas Angelich, Gautier Capuçon, Michel Dalberto, Gérard Caussé and Ebène Quartet won the Echo Klassik Prize for chamber music in 2012. His compilation “Le Violon Roi” received the “Disque d’Or” and his latest recording of contemporary concerti by Rihm, Dusapin and Montovani was nominated the best recording by French Victoires de la Musique 2017.
In June 2011 he was appointed “Chevalier dans l’Ordre National du Mérite” and in March 2016 “Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur” by the French Government.
The best type of women knows what they want. Kimberly Moss saw something on the internet, and now her desires have become twisted. She's gotten the idea that acting like a dog would be a fun kink to try. Stick a collar on her. Put on a leash. Take her for a walk outside. Treat her like you would a real bitch - the female dog kind that is. Her man does such a good job, she even brings him his shoe. That would earn any bitch and treat, and boy does her man give Kimberly a boning she won’t soon forget. Things start off kinky, but Kimberly's man ups the ante. He breaks out the ball gag and shows Kimberly no mercy while he pounds her pussy and slaps her face. Kimberly earned her reward for good behavior.
is the sixth most populous city of Iran[3] and the capital of Fars Province (Old Persian as Pârsâ). In 2009, the population of the city was 1,455,073. Shiraz is located in the southwest of Iran on the Roodkhaneye Khoshk (Dry River) seasonal river. It has a moderate climate and has been a regional trade center for over a thousand years. It is regarded as one of the oldest cities of ancient Persia.
The earliest reference to the city, as Tiraziš, is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BC.[4] In the 13th century, Shiraz became a leading center of the arts and letters, due to the encouragement of its ruler and the presence of many Persian scholars and artists. It was the capital of Persia during the Zand dynasty from 1750 until 1781, as well as briefly during the Saffarid period. Two famous poets of Iran, Hafez and Saadi, are from Shiraz.
Shiraz is known as the city of poets, literature, wine and flowers.[5] It is also considered by many Iranians to be the city of gardens, due to the many gardens and fruit trees that can be seen in the city. Shiraz has had major Jewish and Christian communities. The crafts of Shiraz consist of inlaid mosaic work of triangular design; silver-ware; pile carpet-weaving and weaving of kilim, called gilim and jajim in the villages and among the tribes.[6] In Shiraz industries such as cement production, sugar, fertilizers, textile products, wood products, metalwork and rugs dominate.[7] Shirāz also has a major oil refinery and is also a major center for Iran’s electronic industries: 53% of Iran’s electronic investment has been centered in Shiraz.[8] Shiraz is home to Iran’s first solar power plant.[9] Recently the city’s first wind turbine has been installed above Babakoohi mountain near the city.

A new inspirational comedy “Beauty on the head” appeared on the Web, with Amy Schumer playing the main role. The actress got the role of the notorious girl Rene, who in cycling training - where the poor girl tried unsuccessfully to burn calories - fell off the bike and received a strong concussion. When she awoke, Rene looked at herself in the mirror and realized that she was the most beautiful girl in the world, she just could not find it more beautiful. “No, outwardly she remained the same fat one,” Amy tells about her heroine. “But she began to feel as if she herself was Giselle, or one of the Kardashian-Jenner sisters.” In general, the pretty woman went to conquer New York and even told stunned Naomi Campbell at the casting: “I could easily become a model. But this is not what I want to do now. "

Objective: An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical support device that is used in addition to pharmacological treatment of the failing heart in intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) patients. In the literature, there are limited data regarding the clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of acute coronary syndrome patients in Turkey who had an IABP inserted during their ICCU stay. This study is an analysis of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of these acute coronary syndrome patients.
Methods: The data of patients who were admitted to the ICCU between September 2014 and March 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The data were retrieved from the ICCU electronic database of the clinic. A total of 142 patients treated with IABP were evaluated in the study. All of the patients were in cardiogenic shock following percutaneous coronary intervention, at the time of IABP insertion.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 63.0±9.7 years and 66.2% were male. In-hospital mortality rate of the study population was 54.9%. The patients were divided into 2 groups, consisting of survivors and non-survivors of their hospitalization period. Multivariate analysis after adjustment for the parameters in univariate analysis revealed that ejection fraction, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow score of ≤2 after the intervention, chronic renal failure, and serum lactate and glucose levels were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.
Conclusion: The mortality rate remains high despite IABP support in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Patients who are identified as having a greater risk of mortality according to admission parameters should be further treated with other mechanical circulatory support devices.

"After years of standing by their women, the Sisterhood's significant others have also become loyal friends. And now Jack Emery, Nikki's husband, has enlisted Ted, Joe, Jay, Bert, Dennis, and Abner to form a top-secret organization known as BOLO Consultants. Jack has two missions in mind. The first: offering some behind-the-scenes help to Nikki's law firm as they take on the all-powerful Andover Pharmaceuticals. Andover's anti-leukemia drug causes terrible side effects in young patients, but a class-action suit seems doomed to fail. BOLO Consultants have a prescription to cure that. Meanwhile, Virginia's lieutenant governor has a sideline as a slum landlord, and his impoverished tenants are suffering. Tyler Sandford believes his status puts him above the law. But when the Sisterhood and their allies decide to get involved, no one is beyond the reach of true justice" --

* Spare parts, including a block, crankshaft, transmission, open rear differential, heads, radiators and a bunch of other stuff, etc.
After following this build for year(s), and not seeing you post for some time, I'm curious about the current running condition of the Raider, and if you would drive it, say from SC to AZ? I'll forgo the "why" <img src="/forums/images/graemlins/confused.gif" alt="" /> questions, and defer to others who I'm sure will... <img src="/forums/images/graemlins/smile.gif" alt="" />
* Even if it didn't hurt, I can't see much of what I'm doing without reading glasses - and that's no fun while working on a truck.
* I almost bought a Jaguar XK convertible, but came to my senses when I realized I have a Raider and a 560SL that aren't being used, but are taking up space on my insurance policy. Both of them are now for sale.
The paint needs some elbow grease and wax - or a good paint job, but the body is straight as an arrow.
If you mean would I trust it to drive to AZ, definitely. If you mean would I deliver it, definitely not. Besides, someone needs to arrive here with a trailer to haul the extra stuff home with them.
I've seen and driven this truck, and it's worth the money. No detail has been overlooked, and the build was as careful as I've ever seen. Wish I had the jack for it, Frank, and we miss you, big man. Gettin old is a pain, for sure...
Monte3, send me there, I'll buy a trailer from Harbor Freight, put a Curt hitch on the back of that truck and bring it all back to sunny Clarkdale. Problem solved? Not really. You have to deal with your wife.
Such a great deal, but I'm too busy to hop a flight, and check this out in person. (seems I just got back from Denver picking up the '98)
Make that two of us. I even had the pleasure of installing an engine or two in that thing? I forget..
Someone's going to get a great deal here - I don't think you could build the engine for what the whole kit n caboodle is going for.
Hope you enjoy that Jaguar if you get it! I am thoroughly enjoying the convertible experience myself these days. Next time I am driving through I hope we get to meet up.
(I know that supercharger had been rebuilt since that video but it still shows for something <img src="/forums/images/graemlins/wink.gif" alt="" />

This was Rubicon’s big hit. It peaked at #22 on the charts and I remember it being thrashed on Juice TV. It’s golden novelty pop-punk.
The song is based around the assumption that Bruce is an awful name, blaming parents for naming their innocent babies Bruce. But there’s nothing back up the claim, with the song’s message being little more than, “Hey Bruce, Rubicon says your name’s dumb.”
The video is set in the grand old Auckland railway station. Paul Rubicon walks in and finds the place swarming with people in funny costumes. In fact, I’m pretty sure the Village People could be formed out of the crowd.
After musing on how Bruce sucks as a name, the chorus comes along and everyone bursts into dance. I think this means I can official declare that big, ironic formation dancing was a thing in the early ’90s. It’s pretty basic steps (at one point, everyone stands still and twirls their arms around), but it’s just the sort of thing that could have been copied at home by eager fans.
During the instrumental, the band take a break from dancing to get behind their instruments, shot in colder light to demonstrate that they have a 4 real side to them.
As the video concludes, all the costumed dancers strip down to “Bruce” t-shirts and do a joyous can-can to celebrate the name. (All except Rubicon who are wearing their own band t-shirts). We also get a close-up of a young man, smiling appreciatively. His appearance seems odd if you don’t know that in 2001 he was a Juice TV presenter named Bruce. Hey, celebrity cameo!
Any New Zealand band that can reasonably pull off a moderate Busby Berkeley-style dance routine is ok with me. But it’s a bit weird having that with lyrics that cheerfully demand “Hang his head in shame! Hang his head in shame! Hang his head in shame!”
David Schwartz (°1962, San Francisco, United States) makes photos, paintings and drawings. By demonstrating the omnipresent lingering of a ‘corporate world’, Schwartz creates intense personal moments masterfully created by means of rules and omissions, acceptance and refusal, luring the viewer round and round in circles.
His photos doesn’t reference recognisable form. The results are deconstructed to the extent that meaning is shifted and possible interpretation becomes multifaceted. By exploring the concept of landscape in a nostalgic way, his works references post-colonial theory as well as the avant-garde or the post-modern and the left-wing democratic movement as a form of resistance against the logic of the capitalist market system.
His works establish a link between the landscape’s reality and that imagined by its conceiver. These works focus on concrete questions that determine our existence. By applying abstraction, he makes work that deals with the documentation of events and the question of how they can be presented. The work tries to express this with the help of physics and technology, but not by telling a story or creating a metaphor.
His works are an investigation into representations of (seemingly) concrete ages and situations as well as depictions and ideas that can only be realized in photography. With Plato’s allegory of the cave in mind, he investigates the dynamics of landscape, including the manipulation of its effects and the limits of spectacle based on our assumptions of what landscape means to us. Rather than presenting a factual reality, an illusion is fabricated to conjure the realms of our imagination.
His works demonstrate how life extends beyond its own subjective limits and often tells a story about the effects of global cultural interaction over the latter half of the twentieth century. It challenges the binaries we continually reconstruct between Self and Other, between our own ‘cannibal’ and ‘civilized’ selves. David Schwartz currently lives and works in Richmond.
This is a hands-on studio course focusing on sculptural object-making, using wood as a medium. The course will integrate intuitive approaches and structured processes through direct engagement with the material. In addition to guiding the student through various technical hurdles encountered as the projects unfold, equal stress is placed on the development of ideas and intent. Investigations in planning and prototyping, multiples production and large-scale works will also be included.

Objective: In patients with aortic stenosis (AS), the left ventricular (LV) geometry changes due to the increased LV afterload. However, subclinical myocardial dysfunction can develop despite a normal LV ejection fraction (EF). This study was an investigation of subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in patients with severe AS with a normal LV EF using a strain imaging method, speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE), and an evaluation of its correlation with novel indices to assess the severity of AS.
Methods: A total of 45 asymptomatic patients with severe AS and 25 age- and sex-matched controls without any cardiac disease and with preserved LV EF (EF ≥60%) were studied. In addition to performing conventional echocardiography and STE-based strain imaging, novel indices (energy loss index [ELI], valvulo-arterial impedance, systemic arterial compliance) were also measured.
Results: The LV EF, and the LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters were similar in the 2 groups. The LV longitudinal peak systolic strain (10.66±1.15% to 19.66±2.62%; p=0.0001) and strain rate (0.32±0.07 s−1 to 1.85±0.32 s−1; p=0.0001) were significantly impaired in the study patients compared to the controls, demonstrating subclinical ventricular systolic dysfunction. A significant positive correlation was observed between the ELI and the LV strain/strain rate (r=0.45, p=0.002; r=0.55, p=0.0001, respectively).
Conclusion: Patients with severe AS develop subclinical LV systolic dysfunction, despite a preserved EF. Novel strain imaging-based echocardiographic techniques may provide additional data that can detect early myocardial systolic deterioration in these patients.

I'm asking Calgarians to forward this message, and perhaps post the link on sites like Twitter and Facebook, please.
For the past six years, I've been running a project called Calgary Democracy. It's an effort to compile information about all candidates in local elections and make that information easily accessible to potential voters (and anyone else who might be interested).
For this year's municipal election (voting day: Monday, October 21) the site has a list of all the candidates (Mayor, City Council and the two School Boards), their web-links, contact information, and social media links.
There's also a list (which I believe to be complete) of all the published candidate survey responses. Various organizations, from radically different perspectives, have surveyed candidates on issues such as arts, business, campaign finance, labour, sports, sustainability, taxes, transit, transportation, and more.
The site also has a calendar of events, primarily candidate forums and debates, but that's mostly done now as the election period is almost over.
Complete list of candidates, including school boards. Web-links, contacts, social media, candidate surveys. http://calgarydemocracy.ca/ #yycvote
I'm far from the only one trying to bring information to the public in this election. For example, all of the local media have special election sections on their websites, and many advocacy groups have posted candidate and issue information. I want to highlight a few non-commercial websites in particular:
This volunteer group provided live video feeds of many of the election forums, and have made the recorded videos available online.
An "aggregate" blog compiling posts from a variety of local bloggers. They have been interviewing many of the candidates, including for the School Boards.
Calgary Democracy is run, not as non-partisan but, as "omni-partisan". I have tried to include every applicable available link and source (even the ones I personally find offensive).
I actually believe that democracy is a good idea. So, I don't want to tell people who to vote for. Instead, I want people to bring their own perspectives and consideration to the issues and make their own individual choices.
For that to work, we all need access to all the information. That means not just talking about the "top job" (Mayor), and not just talking about the candidates considered "most likely to win". It means talking about all aspects of the decisions we face. This includes the "unlikely" candidates, and the positions some consider "less important" (such as the School Board Trustees).
All content on the website has been posted by me. There are a few reasons for this; the biggest being that I custom wrote the web server software and it's a hassle to write a secure multi-user system (that code is in the works, but isn't ready yet). I'm also very wary of opening up the site too much because of the high volume of political disinformation that gets posted online. It would be awful to have a candidate's info page filled with attacks on the candidate that obscure the candidate's actual message (even if I really dislike their message).
Calgary Democracy is a zero-budget project. The website is run on my personal web server (along with other websites I host). I've received no money for it this year (I did receive some personal donations in 2010 for the project to help me be able to spend less time doing job work and more time working on the project). I'm not asking for any donations this year because I just don't want to deal with that. I wouldn't say no to friends inviting me to a vegan lunch or dinner occasionally, though ;-)
I always appreciate hearing from people who may have found the site useful. Did it help you to choose amongst the candidates? Did it help you decide whether to vote or not? Are there things you would add or change?
In my understanding of democracy, it functions best when the full range of perspectives in the community can be heard as a part of the democratic dialogue. In a “representative democracy” like ours is supposed to be, this means that the representatives should probably roughly match the makeup of the population they are to represent.
Taking just one attribute of the population — gender — our elected officials don’t even come close to matching the population. Roughly half the people in Calgary are women; but only 20% of our City Council, and only 17% of candidates in the current election, are women. Further, none of the candidates or elected representatives are identified as trans.
17.24% of City Council candidates in the October 21, 2013, municipal election are women (10 out of 58).
The following factors are generalizations, not absolutes. There are certainly exceptions. Some men face some of these, but to a lesser extent than women in general. Not all women face all of these, and not necessarily to a considerable extent on an individual basis.
However, the overall effect is a considerably larger set of hurdles and barriers for women to overcome to enter, and stay in, political life than men face. Trans people face these problems and more.
• It is rare for a male candidate’s appearance to be commented on. For women, it is rare for it not to be discussed — and it is often one of the first things mentioned (especially in media).
• It is typically more expensive, in terms of personal costs, for women to run than men. Really. Social expectations for women’s appearance virtually demand the use of makeup, expensive wardrobes, and hair-styling, in order to be “taken seriously”. Men, while still expected to “dress nicely” are held to much lower standards of appearance.
• Sexist social attitudes are still prevalent in our society. Women who “dare” to stand for public office face derision just for that (where men are often lauded for having the “courage” to stand for office). Women are still seen as “less capable” than men by our social institutions (as exemplified by the fact that women in Canada receive an average of roughly 70% of the income men do for the same work).
• Gendered child-care expectations mean that women who have or intend to have children are expected to have more responsibility for taking care of those children, leaving significantly less time to pursue public life. If a parenting woman chooses to run for office, she will often face negativity for “choosing politics over her children” — something that almost never is suggested of parenting men in politics.
There are other factors not covered here, but those should be sufficient to illustrate the point of this post.
• Work to diminish, and ultimately eliminate, the factors that make it harder for women to participate.
• Recognize that gender is far from the only attribute used to diminish the participation of parts of the community. Ethnicity, disability, age, financial status, and more, are all factors that have disproportionate levels of representation.
• When you see or hear something that is a factor diminishing women’s participation: Speak out. Ask people why they are commenting on female candidates’ appearance rather than their policies. Write letters to media when they talk about how women are dressed rather than how women are campaigning.

The total number of candidates for City Council for 2013 is 62.1% of what it was in 2010, but the number of women running saw an even greater decline, being 52.6% of the number who ran in 2010.

Lest we remember that our “government” would rather spend millions advertising lies about past wars than spend a dollar to avoid having a soldier, or their family, fall into poverty.
Lest we remember the politicians who care so little about what happens to people in the military and veterans that they doze off in meetings with them.
Lest we remember that they spend our money to send our children, our siblings, our parents, our friends, our neighbours, to kill and be killed, to maim and be maimed, to destroy and be destroyed.
Lest we remember the military’s contributions to the long history of genocide and injustice against indigenous people of this land.
Lest we remember the contributions of anyone not white enough, or male enough, or “straight” enough, or Christian enough, in our reworking of history.
Lest we remember that Eisenhower’s warnings about the rise of the military-industrial complex came true.
Lest we remember that ever more and more of our resources, energy and wealth, are being siphoned away into the military and the corporations that profit from it, while poverty, disparity and injustice grow.
Lest we remember that, for all the posturing about protecting rights and freedom around the world, our military has ignored many who truly needed it, while attacking those who didn’t.
Lest we remember that war destroys not just human lives, but all other creatures and plants, and the very Earth.
There have been some concerns raised about the way the new “Municipal Complex Bylaw 38M2012” may restrict protest outside Calgary’s City Hall and Municipal Building downtown. (You can download a PDF of the bylaw. If the filename comes up as “DirectDownload.aspx” just change the name to end in “.pdf”, and hope that The City eventually fixes that problem on their website.)
Since I posted this, friendly City Councillor Brian Pincott has informed me that the old bylaw required a permit for any use of the Municipal Plaza. The new bylaw takes away that requirement, actually making it more accessible to protest.
I honestly had no idea of that particular old rule—and violated it at least dozens of times with permit-less rallies there. (Which illustrates the general leniency of bylaw enforcement in a lot of—but certainly not all—cases.)
I suspect that people expressing concern about this bylaw “banning protest” may have seen the part restricting protest inside the building. That does not apply to the exterior of the building (notably, “Municipal Plaza” and the sidewalk—which are where all of the countless protests I’ve participated in there have been held).
It’s important to note that the inside of the “Municipal Building” and City Hall, like with all buildings, have been restricted from protest demonstrations for at least as long as I am aware of, so this does not change that.
One significant provision the bylaw introduces, that I don’t recall being in place before, is that, during business hours, no bullhorns or other sound equipment can be used without approval.
(As a matter of pure speculation on my part, I’m guessing that this provision is a result of the religious evangelists who relentlessly, noisily, set up right outside City Hall many times every week.)
In addition to restricting amplified sound, some other notable restrictions that can affect protests (all of which were previously in place, if I recall correctly) include:
Candles are restricted under the fire restrictions (no candlelight vigils without express prior approval in writing). Exception for religious ceremonies (so no ban on smudges).
No free-standing signage (e.g., placards we carry are okay but no sandwich boards set up on the ground).
Not permitted to engage in “event” activities on areas designated as memorials (such as the police memorial that obstructs a big chunk of the Plaza).
The municipal plaza may be booked by groups (or The City) for events. When booked, it is designated as “exclusive use” and other activities will not be permitted. We should still be able to make reasonable use of the public sidewalks in those cases, provided we don’t interfere with the booked event.
There is a generic grant of authority to the “Complex Manager” to arbitrarily declare activities as prohibited (10.2.d). I would not expect this to impact most protests — except in cases where there is apparent or actual threat of violence, significant obstruction of individual access to the municipal facilities, or people engaging in offensive/lewd activities.
There is an interesting bit I believe they got wrong. The Bylaw includes the public sidewalk as part of the “Municipal Complex” and subject to the restrictions set forth in the Bylaw. Given what seem to be relevant precedents up to the Supreme Court level, I would not expect that to hold up in court if they tried to restrict “reasonable” protest on—and general public access to—the sidewalk.
However, there is also precedent for mass events (such as concerts and festivals) to be reasonable restriction of access to public space. So, it is legal to restrict protest and other use in those public spaces that are temporarily occupied by such an event (like when the New Year’s Eve celebration blocks off Macleod Trail and adjoining sidewalks between City Hall and Olympic Plaza).
Here is something that could potentially affect us: In the maps at the end of the Bylaw, you can see that they define all of the steps and ramp areas as “Entrance/Exit zones” and prohibit gathering in those areas entirely (10.3.a).
I’m thinking, in particular, of the steps adjacent to the sidewalk that are immediately north of the main ramp to the municipal building, since we have countless times used those as a position for people to address a crowd.
In spite of that definition and restriction, my expectation (given what has gone on before both at the “Municipal Complex” and other government sites) would be that we would generally continue to be able to make general use of those areas outside business hours so long as such use did not significantly impair access to the site for non-participants. During business hours, we could probably make limited use of those areas unless things were “quite busy”.
In any case, the provision does give the City clear grounds to direct us away from those “Entrance/Exit zones” as they may choose.
All in all, given past experience, after an initial read-through, I do not expect the changes and additions in this bylaw to notably impact most protest actions around the municipal building and city hall.
There could be cases where they call for a shutdown of use of bullhorns or p.a. systems—but I would be surprised if they use that much at all against protests (since, again, I’m guessing the primary reason for that is not protests, but the noise from the noisy religious evangelists who set up right outside City Hall annoying the City Council members in their offices there). In any case, legal restrictions governing amplified sound were already in place, so I don’t see the bylaw changing that for us.
I’ve been a part of some lengthy discussions online sparked by this comic by Kate. (I first saw the comic via my friend Lee who shared a link from imgur)
Yes, some of my language below is insulting, but that is in keeping with the flavour of the cartoon (and my frustration level).
These discussions centre around feminism in particular, but have strong parallels to other anti-oppression struggles. Here’s some of what I wrote in those discussions:
Every time some male idiot chimes in with some awful statement, like the ones the off-camera dude does in this cartoon, I mourn a little for humanity.
I’m a male survivor of sexual violence, a male survivor of non-sexual assaults, and a male survivor of extensive bullying, but I don’t feel in any way threatened by recognizing and shouting the fact that patriarchy is an extreme evil, that violence in our society is heavily gendered with females being the predominant targets, that females are systemically targeted for sexual violence and abuse, that the longest running war in human history is the war against women.
The idiot males trot out numbers of female-on-male partner violence, but conveniently ignore the context that the vast majority of those incidents are self-defence or responses to extended periods of abuse (I also consider those responses to abuse a form of self-defence).
The idiot males trot out numbers of male victims of violence, conveniently ignoring the fact that the vast majority of those are male-on-male violence. Males make up the overwhelming majority of perpetrators of violence.
By trotting out their complaints of “reverse sexism” these idiots act to reinforce patriarchy by belittling or dismissing the very real sexism, the very real systemic gender oppression, in our society.
Acknowledging and addressing the pervasive sexism in society does not mean putting men down. It does not mean “emasculating” males. It does not mean putting women, women’s issues, and women’s needs, above men. It means acknowledging the truth of our reality and working to end oppression for the real benefit of all.
As a male survivor, advancing feminism (and all other anti-oppression struggles) makes the world a better place for me and everyone I care about. It's not a “zero-sum game” where advancing women’s rights means taking away from men’s rights. The reality of anti-oppression work is that it’s more like an “exponential game” where every advance against oppression makes things better for everyone (even those who society has raised in the role of oppressors).
Yes, women who fight for their rights, who challenge oppression, are “HOT AS HELL” — because it speaks to an intense strength of character to rise above the massive forces of oppression arrayed against them in virtually every aspect of life under patriarchy.
The enforcement of gender roles harms both those placed into the role of oppressor and those oppressed. No one gets out of systems of oppression unharmed. But it remains critical to acknowledge which way the oppression flows.
I've long held that the greater responsibility for the work of feminism rests with men, being the ones that patriarchy has handed the position of "Privilege". We have greater opportunity to contribute to the work because of our privileged position.
To be clear, when I speak of men’s “greater responsibility for the work of feminism” I don’t mean to suggest that men should be leading or guiding feminist movements. In all anti-oppression struggles, those coming from positions of privilege need to spend more time listening to, learning from, and supporting the oppressed than anything else. The work of feminism needs to be rooted in meaningful, supportive and learning, partnerships.
Over the past couple weeks, I’ve been doing a pile of reading (and screencast watching) on approaches to object-oriented design when using Ruby on Rails. I always take it as a good sign when I learn a new approach that makes me think “I want to go back and rewrite all my code this way.” (Although, of course, that would not be the best choice. It’s usually better to integrate new approaches with ongoing/new development rather than start over from scratch.) There’ve been a few of those moments during this recent reading, so I’ve decided to compile a list of what I’ve been looking at — both as a reference for myself, and to reinforce what I’ve been studying.
There is a pile of good stuff in these articles (and vids), but the single biggest for me is the point about segregating “business logic” (the methods that actually do the domain work) from persistence (database calls). There are a few different ways suggested for doing that here — I’m not sure yet which I favour.
Objects on Rails is probably the most comprehensive piece on this subject. It’s an ebook (viewable free on the website, or for $5 in non-DRM PDF, ePub and Kindle formats). There is little hand-holding in this book. Unless you are already well-versed in things like ruby meta-programming, it can be a challenging read (but well worth it even if you don’t get everything right away — some of the other materials that follow should help round out your understanding). I’ll go ahead and call this the essential piece out of this collection. It’s not to be skipped.
Something that came up a few times is how to apply the SOLID principles to Ruby development (since SOLID was conceptualized around typed languages like C++ as opposed to dynamic languages like Ruby).
An Open Letter to English-Canadians, who might be feeling that Quebeckers have taken leave of their senses.
You may have heard that there has been some turmoil in Quebec in recent weeks. There have been demonstrations in the streets of Montreal every night for almost a month now, and a massive demonstration will be happening tomorrow, which I will be attending, along with my wife, Elizabeth Elbourne, and my eldest daughter Emma.
Reading the Anglo-Canadian press, it strikes me that you have been getting a very fragmented and biased picture of what is going on. Given the gulf that has already emerged between Quebec and the rest of Canada in the wake of the 2011 election, it is important that the issues under discussion here at least be represented clearly. You may decide at the end of the day that we are crazy, but at least you should reach that decision on the basis of the facts, rather than of the distortions that have been served up by the G&M and other outlets.
First, the matter of the tuition hikes, which touched off this mess. The rest of the country seems to have reached the conclusion that the students are spoiled, selfish brats, who would still be paying the lowest tuition fees even if the whole of the proposed increase went through.
The first thing to say is that this is an odd conception of selfishness. Students have been sticking with the strikes even knowing that they may suffer deleterious consequences, both financial and academic. They have been marching every night despite the threat of beatings, tear-gas, rubber bullets, and arrests. It is, of course, easier for the right-wing media to dismiss them if they can be portrayed as selfish kids to whom no -one has ever said "no". But there is clearly an issue of principle here.
OK, then. But maybe the principle is the wrong one. Free tuition may just be a pie-in-the sky idea that mature people give up on when they put away childish things. And besides, why should other people pay for the students' "free" tuition? There is no such thing as "free" education. Someone, somewhere, has to pay. And the students, the criticism continues, are simply refusing to pay their "fair share".
Why is that criticism simplistic? Because the students' claim has never been that they should not pay for education. The question is whether they should do so up front, before they have income, or later, as taxpayers in a progressive taxation scheme. Another question has to do with the degree to which Universities should be funded by everyone, or primarily by those who attend them. So the issue of how to fund Universities justly is complicated. We have to figure out at what point in people's lives they should be paying for their education, and we also have to figure out how much of the bill should be footed by those who do not attend, but who benefit from a University-educated work force of doctors, lawyers, etc. The students' answer to this question may not be the best, but then it does not strike me that the government's is all that thought out either.
And at least the students have been trying to make ARGUMENTS and to engage the government and the rest of society in debate, whereas the government's attitude, other than to invoke the in-this-context-meaningless "everyone pays their faire share" argument like a mantra, has been to say "Shut up, and obey".
What strikes the balance in the students' favour in the Quebec context is that the ideal of no up-front financial hurdles to University access is enshrined in some of the most foundational documents of Quebec's Quiet Revolution, in particular the Parent Commission Report, which wrested control of schools from the Church and created the modern Quebec education system, a cornerstone of the kind of society that many Quebeckers see themselves as aspiring to. Now, it could be that that ideal is no longer viable, or that we may no longer want to subscribe to it. But moving away from it, as Charest's measures have done, at least requires a debate, analogous to the debate that would have to be had if the Feds proposed to scrap the Canada Health Act. It is clearly not just an administrative measure. It is political through and through. Indeed it strikes at fundamental questions about the kind of society we want to live in. If this isn't the sort of thing that requires democratic debate, I don't know what is.
The government has met the very reasonable request that this issue, and broader issues of University governance, be at least addressed in some suitably open and democratic manner with silence, then derision, then injunctions, and now, with the most odious "law" that I have seen voted by the Quebec National Assembly in my adult memory. It places the right of all Quebec citizens to assemble, but also to talk and discuss about these issues, under severe limitations. It includes that most odious of categories: crimes of omission, as in, you can get fined for omitting to attempt to prevent someone from taking part in an act judged illegal by the law. In principle, the simple wearing of the by-now iconic red square can be subject to a fine. The government has also made the student leaders absurdly and ruinously responsible for any action that is ostensibly carried out under the banners of their organizations. The students groups can be fined $125000 whenever someone claiming to be "part" of the movement throws a rock through a window. And so on. It is truly a thing to behold.
The government is clearly aware that this "law" would not withstand a millisecond of Charter scrutiny. It actually expires in July 2013, well before challenges could actually wind their way through the Courts. The intention is thus clearly just to bring down the hammer on this particular movement by using methods that the government knows to be contrary to basic liberal-democratic rule-of-law principles. The cynicism is jaw-dropping. It is beneath contempt for the government to play fast and loose with our civil rights and liberties in order to deal with the results of its own abject failure to govern.
So that is why tomorrow I will be taking a walk in downtown Montreal with (hopefully!) hundreds of thousands of my fellow citizens. Again, you are all free to disagree, but at least don't let it be because of the completely distorted picture of what is going on here that you have been getting from media outlets, including some from which we might have expected more.
A quarter of a century ago I attended protest rallies to stop the then Conservative government of Canada from bringing forward legislation to take away women’s rights to decide what to do with their own bodies.
Today, there are protests against the current Conservative government of Canada’s effort to bring forward legislation to take away women’s rights to decide what to do with their own bodies.
For those opposed to abortion, prohibition won't stop it — that will just lead to more dead or mutilated women like there were before it was legalized. If you really want to stop abortions, work to prevent the unwanted pregnancies that cause them.
So, what’s the single biggest factor in rates of unwanted pregnancy? Women who are living in poverty. If you’re opposed to abortions (or pro-choice, for that matter) — the best thing to do is to work to end women's poverty.
With the way the Alberta provincial election seems to be shaping up, I’ve heard a lot of folks talking about possibly voting strategically for the Progressive Conservative Party in their ridings out of desperation to avoid having the Wildrose Party win. People are struggling with whether to vote for the candidates most likely to block the candidates they dread, or to vote for the candidate that would best represent them.
I’ll avoid, for the moment, discussing here the broken nature of our electoral system that leads to such choices…
It’s never a mistake to vote your conscience — to vote for the candidate who best represents your values — even if you expect them to “not have a chance”. Even if they don't win, showing support for those candidates shows which positions have support and does a couple things:
When the Alberta Greens saw significant increases in percentage of vote (even though we didn’t win seats from those votes) there was a corresponding increase in some of the green policies being adopted by the provincial government — a prime example being the grizzly bear hunt ban. Subsequently, when the Alberta Greens were taken over and shut down (the takeover was led by a fellow who is now a Wildrose candidate, make of that what you will), there was a corresponding backtracking on those policies — in this example, the grizzly hunt ban was lifted.
Even parties that don’t win can affect policies because the winning party wants to get some of those votes in the subsequent election.
People who vote mostly vote for who they think can win. A party that receives increasing votes in an election stands a much better chance in the next election because more people will think they have a chance of winning. It’s not good that so many people vote that way, but it’s reality.
So, we’re not just voting for this election, but for future elections, too, where there will hopefully be better chances of people we support winning.
I once (just once) voted for a federal Progressive Conservative candidate, Joe Clark, in order to prevent the election of a Reform/Alliance candidate. Clark was definitely on the “Red Tory” side of that party (before it was taken over by Reform/Alliance), and even served as parade marshall for the Calgary Pride Parade one year — so it wasn’t an utterly heinous choice.
In the end, both the strategic and conscience votes have an impact — so neither can be dismissed out of hand as invalid choices in our current system. It’s up to you, as an individual citizen, to make the hard decision which of the possible outcomes is the better focus for your vote.
Even when it doesn’t seem like it, when the media and leading parties try to marginalize diverse opinions, all of our votes do actually make a difference.

Thoracic back pain is pain that occurs in the thoracic spine. The thoracic spine is located at the back of the chest (the thorax), mostly between the shoulder blades. It extends from the bottom of the neck to the start of the lumbar spine, roughly at the level of the waist.
Researchers were asked to find out how many people got back pain and came back with the answer 'between 4 and 72 people out of 100'. Political pollsters who had never before heard such pinpoint forecasting immediately hired these researchers to predict the outcome of the next general election.
The truth is that unless the question is asked in exactly the same way, different surveys will give different answers. It's known that teenage girls are particularly prone to thoracic back pain. The dreaded backpack is undoubtedly to blame. Why anyone thought it was a good idea to get rid of school lockers and make children drag a hundredweight of books to and from school on their backs every day, I have no idea.
Surveys to find out how many people have thoracic spine pain produce very variable results. For example, when asked whether they have ever had thoracic spine pain, one survey reported a result of 4 out of a 100 people, whilst another said 72 people out of 100. It appears to be at its most common in children and teenagers, especially girls. Factors cited as causing thoracic back pain included backpack use, the height of school chairs, and difficulties with homework. Mental health problems seemed to be an associated factor. It also appeared to be common in the transition period between the early teens and late adolescence. Adults with thoracic back pain often have aches and pains elsewhere as well as difficulties going about their daily tasks.
The short answer, in most cases, is no. Most people with thoracic spine pain get better without treatment in a couple of weeks.
However, thoracic back pain is more likely to be due to a serious cause than pain in other areas of the spine. There is a whole list of things to look out for that might indicate there's a problem. The sort of red flags I'm going on about include pain coming on shortly after an accident, having a condition that causes a wonky immune system, feeling generally unwell, or having pain that's getting worse after a couple of weeks' treatment.
Thoracic spine pain is common, short-lived and of little consequence. However, it is also more likely than neck pain or low back pain to have a serious cause.
A history of cancer, drug misuse, HIV infection, a condition that suppresses your immune system (immunosuppression) and use of steroids for a long time (about six months or more).
The most common cause of thoracic back pain is inflammation of the muscles or soft tissues of the thoracic spine. This inflammation can occur for a number of reasons:
Repeating a movement persistently that involves the thoracic part of the spine (as in sport or work): also called overuse injury.
Scheuermann's disease - an inflammation of the joints of the spine which results in spinal curvature.
It shouldn't be assumed that all pain in the thoracic spine is coming from the spine itself. Other causes of pain in this area can include problems affecting the lung, the uppermost part of the gut (the oesophagus), the stomach, the gallbladder and the pancreas.
If it's a short-lived mild pain with an obvious explanation (for example, it came on after you took part in a tug-of-war contest), your doctor will probably suggest some treatment before arranging tests.
However, because back pain is more likely to be serious if it occurs in the thoracic area rather than in your neck or lower back, your doctor is likely to suggest tests if the pain persists, is severe, or is accompanied by any of the 'red flag' features mentioned in the Symptoms section.
The tests will depend on the conditions that the doctor wants to rule out. It's likely to include blood tests such as a full blood count and inflammatory markers, and maybe a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. An ordinary 'plain' X-ray doesn't give much information unless you have an unusual appearance of the spine or a fracture is suspected.
If the pain is coming from a joint in the spine (a facet joint) this may be helped by an injection performed under X-ray vision (imaging-guided intra-articular injection).
Surgery which opens the covering of the spinal canal (a procedure called laminectomy) to treat a slipped disc causing thoracic spine pain can be a dangerous operation. However, a less risky technique involving surgery through the skin (percutaneous thoracic intervertebral disc nucleoplasty) is sometimes performed.
Many cases settle down in a few weeks but it should be remembered that pain in the thoracic spine is more likely than pain in the neck or lower back to have a serious cause.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine how often the recommendations of the Turkish Hypertension Consensus Report are followed, and to draw attention to the report.
Methods: The demographic information of 1000 patients diagnosed with hypertension and the details of the antihypertensive medications prescribed at the outpatient service of a tertiary care hospital were recorded, and the data were compared with the recommendations of the report.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 62±11 years. In all, 623 (62.3%) of the 1000 patients were women, and 377 (37.7%) were men. A combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a diuretic was the most frequently observed prescription. A diuretic was the most used antihypertensive drug (58.7%), followed by an ARB (48.8%). However, as a monotherapy, a calcium channel blocker (CCB) was the most commonly used antihypertensive drug (19.2%). The most frequently used antihypertensive drug group in older patients was diuretics (63.6%), as proposed in the report. Beta blockers (49.1%) were used more often than expected. For the diabetic group also, a diuretic (60.7%) was the most frequently used antihypertensive drug, followed by an ARB (51.1%) and a CCB (45.2%). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (34.6%) were the fifth most preferred antihypertensive drug class. However, when ACE inhibitors and ARBs were considered as a single group, known as renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, these RAS blockers were the most prescribed antihypertensive drug class, followed by diuretics. In the group of patients with coronary artery disease, treatment was found to be generally consistent with the report, but the use of diuretics was greater than expected. Lastly, 124 of 160 patients who had chronic kidney disease were given RAS blocker therapy, which was in line with the consensus report recommendations.
Conclusion: Antihypertensive therapies were individualized, as suggested by the consensus report. However, there are proposals still to be considered in special patient groups.
Anchored throughout the town are the churches erected by our town's founders. They served them, and they continue to serve today. Founded in 1646, North Parish was the center of life in Andover. The original church building stood until 1669. Rebuilt five times, the present building was constructed in 1836. In 1711, as a result of Andover's growing population, North Parish divided and formed South Parish. South Parish Church has been rebuilt several times, with its present building (the fourth)
An ancient clock, described as 400 years old and as the first clock brought to Andover, Massachusetts, was seen by hordes of visitors to the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Hanging in the kitchen of the New England Farmer’s Home, it joined Peregrine White’s cradle, John Alden’s writing desk and other significant artifacts from the earliest days of Massachusetts. Sadly, there seems to be no other information about it except for a period illustration showing what looks like a 17th
Scattered throughout the pages of Andover history books are occasional references to citizens who have gone astray. Regardless of status or gender, these "black sheep" have blemished many a family tree. Their scandalous stories color Andover's past. John Beverly holds the record for longevity--not for his age but for his ability to draw from the town treasury. Returning from the French and Indian campaign of 1760, young Beverly lost both feet from frostbite when stranded in the woods during a
Once the rudiments of settlement were established in pocketed areas of Massachusetts, including Cochichewick, the Puritans turned their attention to education. These intellectual immigrants brought with them staunch Calvinist beliefs coupled with devotion to education and inquiry. By examining the laws, the demands on new towns became clear. In 1642 the General Court ordered “the chosen men of each town to ascertain from time to time if children are being trained in learning and labor and other
America has always been a destination for immigrants searching for new opportunities. From the time of 1646 and its English roots, Andover has attracted immigrants from many cultures. By the 19th century Andover, like most of America, saw an increase of other European groups. Census records from 1860 through 1920 mark an increase in Irish and Scottish residents. Early on the Irish outnumbered the Scottish, but by the 1920s those numbers were reversed. During this period English descendants made
Before paved roads and automobiles eased the pain of travel, towns maintained "public houses" for the comfort of its travelers. These travelers included ordinary folk out for business or pleasure, officers of the Colonial government, military companies, and various vagrants and peddlers. Innkeepers, often some of the town's principle citizens, had to be licensed to sell wine and strong liquor. Inns were very much a part of Andover's social and political life even through the 1800s. The Abbot
The myth of benevolent New England slavery is persistent. In the earliest days of the colonies, New England Puritans tried to balance their Christian beliefs with their slaveholding practices. Some believed those they enslaved were not human and so had no soul to save. Others, such as Cotton Mather, argued that since all men were created by God, they must have a soul and therefore should be baptized and become members of the church. By English law, a Christian could not own another Christian,
In America's earliest days, African men, women and children were sold into slavery in all parts of the country, including here in Andover. The Phillips, one of the town's most prominent families, were among those who owned slaves. Cato was born in 1768 in the household of Reverend Samuel Phillips of South Church. After the Reverend's death in 1771, Cato passed to the Reverend's son, also Samuel, but known as Esquire. Esquire Phillips lived in North Parish and already owned several slaves. He
​On April 19, 1775, 335 Andover men answered the Lexington alarm. For the next eight years fathers and sons, brothers and uncles, even servants and free men, served side by side in the historic effort for American independence. Two companies of Minute Men marched from Andover that fateful morning, followed by four foot companies. Included in the last group were eight "aged" or physically unqualified men who delivered provisions to Cambridge. The units marched under Colonel James Frye of this
Since the founding of the nation, Andover residents have welcomed presidents from George Washington to George W. Bush into this little corner of the world. Whether it was for a single meal or for years of education, Andover boasts an impressive history of presidential presence. Washington came through Andover on Nov. 5, 1789, on his tour of the eastern states following his inauguration. In his diary from that year, he writes that he enjoyed breakfast at the Abbot Inn on Elm Street. While at the
Late Phillips Academy Headmaster Ted Sizer once noted that "this (Andover) is a town that values education." Excellence in its public schools has combined with passion in the private sector to create a "common commitment that lifts the level of all schooling." For over 250 years, Andover's private school options have come in many forms. Most familiar is Phillips Academy, founded in 1778 by Samuel Phillips Jr. to educate "youth from every quarter" in the classical tradition. While today the

Have you caught yourself thinking negatively lately and want to get out of that rut? Do you need help thinking constructively about a situation that is troubling you?
Strong emotions lead to black and white, 'all or nothing' catastrophic thinking and make it difficult to consider anything realistically. If you feel angry, sad, guilty or concerned about something, it's easy to get into the habit of catastrophic thinking. However, with very little effort you can train your brain to 'forget' to think negatively and increase your mental wellbeing.
Negatively churning over a situation in your mind without resolving it is a gross misuse of the imagination and can, in the long run, lead to depression.
Simply by finding and reading this blog post you have indicated that you have the drive and self awareness necessary to change your thinking patterns, so here are four steps to training your brain to see things differently and in the long term, 'forget' to think negative thoughts at all:
The first step is to identify any unhelpful thoughts that pop up. Someone in the grip of negative thinking is in a trance state and is prone to black and white thinking. If you are trapped in this state it can get more difficult to 'catch' yourself thinking overly negative thoughts, so a good tip is to spend a day going round with a notebook, writing down any negative thoughts you catch yourself thinking. If this seems like too much hard work, then consider how much effort your brain is wasting already by thinking negatively. Committing to one day with a notebook is much less work than the time and energy taken up by decades of unproductive negative thinking.
Practicing mindfulness or meditation can help you become more aware of your thought processes and make it easier to catch negative thoughts during the day before they can do further damage.
Once you have caught your negative thought, the next stage is to challenge them. Pulling yourself out of the negative emotional trance by challenging negative thoughts is a process which will come naturally the more you do it.
Rather than just lazily letting the negative thought wash over you, actually think about whether the content of the thought is really true, and whether you have any evidence to the contrary. This works because facing a problem this way engages your logical brain rather than the emotional brain, lifting you from the negative emotional trance state.
It's important not to be fooled though. If you find yourself thinking "Well, logically I am a stupid, bad person and everything I do is useless" then you are still in your emotional brain.
Negative thoughts about any scenario and situation, no matter how dire, can be challenged. If you are in any doubt about this fact, then we recommend reading Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl, a Viennese psychiatrist and holocaust survivor who was able to see how both he and others in Auschwitz coped (or didn't) with the experience. He noticed that the sort of person the concentration camp prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances.
A purely negative thought is rarely useful. Any negative thought should always be countered with a context giving more positive thought. Making an effort to do this can be of great therapeutic benefit. This is called 'reframing' and as it becomes a habit to your brain, you will start to bypass negative thoughts entirely.
It's very easy to naturally sink into acceptance of negative thoughts, even if to an outside observer they are completely over the top ("I am a bad, useless person. I can't do anything right. Everyone hates me.") The trick is to make a habit of challenging and putting any negative thoughts into the correct perspective. Putting a situation into context is an incredibly powerful way of combating negativity, and with practice, your brain will start to automatically widen the context of negative thoughts without you even having to think about it.
"I have made some mistakes, but so does everyone and my mistakes are actually an opportunity to learn how to act and do better in the future. I can think of specific examples of times I have achieved good things so I am not a bad person at all."
"I am good at loads of things like playing the clarinet, making cakes, cycling and my job. Admittedly at the moment I am not that good at driving but I will practice and get better and pass my test eventually."
"My colleague is obviously having a bad day and has decided to take it out on me. I won't take it personally because I can think of lots of people who appreciate and love me for who I am."
This might feel uncomfortable and false at first but as you make a habit of testing out different perspectives your brain will warm to the idea. Your brain does not want to be mired in negativity because it takes up a lot of energy. Give it spare capacity by giving it a chance to get out of the negative rut and it will flourish.
Anxiety is very destructive and there are many things you can do to beat it. Here are a few links to further information and support:

Atherogenic index of plasma as a cardiovascular risk marker in manic, depressive, and euthymic stages of bipolar disorder
A recent blog on the World Travel Market suggested there were three stages for the accessibility market. Let’s call them the “Three principles of O”. They stand for:
Objective: Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) frequently suffer from cardiovascular disease (CVD), and it is a leading cause of mortality. Clinicians use routine laboratory tests, including a lipid profile, to predict cardiovascular risk. In addition, a particular lipid ratio, the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), is a sensitive, new parameter that can be used to assess high-risk groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating cardiovascular risk via AIP in different stages of BD.
Methods: The study group consisted of male patients with BD who were in a manic, depressive, or euthymic state, and age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Lipid profiles were analyzed and the AIP parameter of logarithm of triglyceride (TG) / high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) was calculated for all of the participants. The significance level was set at p<0.05.
Results: A total of 44 BD patients experiencing a manic episode, 35 depressive BD patients, 42 euthymic patients, and 41 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and smoking status were enrolled in the study. The AIP level was significantly different between groups (p=0.009). Pairwise comparisons of the groups revealed that the AIP level of depressive patients was significantly higher than that of the manic, euthymic, and control groups (p=0.013, p=0.048, and p=0.021, respectively). The AIP level was positively correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, metabolic syndrome, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride level, and was negatively correlated with the HDLc level.
Conclusion: In this study, male BD patients in a depressive episode demonstrated an increase in cardiovascular risk. The significant correlations between AIP and other conventional cardiovascular risk factors indicate that AIP may be more useful to identify individuals with BD at high risk for CVD than absolute lipid parameters.
Objective: Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of ≤45% occurring in the later stages of pregnancy or soon after delivery. Although various risk factors have been identified, the exact cause of the disease is unknown. Unlike most countries in the European region, Turkey has yet to determine the current PPCM burden. A registry for this purpose does not exist. To close this gap, the A RegisTry of pEripartuM cardIomyopathy in Turkish patientS (ARTEMIS-I and ARTEMIS-II), was planned and endorsed by the Turkish Society of Cardiology. The aim of this manuscript is to describe the rationale and design of the ARTEMIS-I and ARTEMIS-II registries.
Methods: ARTEMIS was designed to be the nationwide PPCM registry of Turkey, with the goal of identifying problems and opportunities while improving quality and consistency in the medical care of PPCM patients. A second goal is to determine the clinical characteristics pertinent to patients in this region. The ARTEMIS registry will consist of 2 arms. All secondary and tertiary cardiology centers have been electronically invited to participate in ARTEMIS-I, which will be conducted to assess the current standard of care and outcome measures. Centers will be asked to enroll PPCM patients admitted to their clinic in last 5 years retrospectively. Eligibility criteria will consist of pregnant or early postpartum woman without a previous history of heart failure (HF) or known pathology associated with HF, LV ejection fraction ≤45%, and exclusion of other causes of LV systolic dysfunction. ARTEMIS-II will consist of the prospective enrollment of patients.
Conclusion: The nationwide PPCM registries, ARTEMIS-I and ARTEMIS-II, are designed to determine the current status of medical care, provide insights into nature of the disease, and suggest solutions on how to improve care and outcomes in these patients.

Halloween parties can be a lot of fun, but you don’t have to settle for mass-printed paper decorations and a punchbowl full of candy to complete your theme. With a little imagination and a DIY spirit you can transform your gathering from vague to vogue.
Store your cold beverages in hollowed-out pumpkins and fill in the remaining gaps with ice. For a more eerie look use white pumpkins. Don’t carve a face into the gourd or you will have a watery mess on your hands.
It’s hard to keep a consistent theme when your guests come dressed as a ghost, The Joker and a space ninja. Instead of costumes, encourage your guests to come in a limited formal wear and supply them them with masks. Consider black tuxedos for the men and white dresses for the women, such as ones from our line of cotton sleepwear. You can purchase a collection of masquerade domino masks or even create your own felt animal masks to liven things up.
It’s one thing to create mixed drinks along a theme, but it pays to go one step further and give them a striking visual tie-in. Consider getting black sugar to rim the glasses and add whole blackberries into the mix, or try classic drinks like a brain hemorrhage or blood-red sangria.
Create some good mood lighting by unscrewing or disabling all the lights and use expressive candles instead. The dim lighting will give the party an inky atmosphere. You can opt for clusters of thick white candles and mix it up with a few skull-shaped candles here and there. Just make sure you have some type of barrier to restrict the melted wax so it doesn’t spill onto the carpet.
It’s routine to see a mix of orange and black candy in a dish during Halloween. Make your display stand out by limiting your candy to a single color, such as all red or all white candies in a clear glass dish. You can order bulk M&Ms and jelly beans in any color and mix in marshmallows or licorice.

Objective: A wide gap exists between dyslipidemia guidelines and their implementation in the real world, which is primarily attributed to physician and patient compliance. The aim of this study is to determine physician and patient adherence to dyslipidemia guidelines and various influential factors.
Methods: The Evaluation of Perceptions, Knowledge, and Compliance with the Guidelines in Real Life Practice: A Survey on the Under-treatment of Hypercholesterolemia (EPHESUS) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02608645) will be an observational, multicenter, non-interventional study. The study targets enrollment of 2000 patients from 50 locations across Turkey. All of the data will be collected in a single visit and current clinical practice will be evaluated. A cross-sectional survey of public perception and knowledge of cholesterol treatment among Turkish adults will be performed. All consecutive patients admitted to cardiology clinics who are in the secondary prevention group (coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease) and who are in the high-risk primary prevention group (type 2 diabetes mellitus with no prior known coronary heart disease; patients who had markedly elevated single risk factors, in particular, cholesterol >8 mmol/L [>310 mg/dL], blood pressure ≥180/110 mmHg, a calculated Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE] ≥5%, or <10% 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular disease) will be included. Demographic, lifestyle, medical, and therapeutic data will be collected with a survey designed for the study.
Conclusion: The EPHESUS registry will be the largest study conducted in Turkey evaluating the adherence to dyslipidemia guidelines both in secondary and high-risk primary prevention patients.
With the increasing number of implanted pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, removal is required more frequently. Presently described is the transvenous extraction of a 26-year-old Accufix atrial lead using a mechanical dilator sheath. A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to the clinic with a pacemaker pocket infection. The atrial lead was an Accufix Bipolar J-Atrial active fixation lead, a model that was recalled in 1994, after reports of 2 deaths and 2 nonfatal injuries related to protrusion of the J retention wire. Both the atrial and ventricular leads were extracted using a mechanical dilator sheath. The Pacemaker Lead Extraction with the Excimer Sheath (PLEXES) Trial reported that of the 57 Accufix leads randomized to a non-laser approach, only 47% were removed successfully, compared with 96% of laser-randomized cases. Since laser sheaths are not available in Turkey, use of a mechanical dilator sheath was required. To our knowledge, this is the oldest Accufix lead extracted with a non-laser sheath. During the extraction of the ventricular lead, the tip of the lead broke off inside the right ventricle and the residual part was left inside the heart. During 3 months of follow-up, no signs of infection or any other undesirable events were encountered.
Catheter induced aortocoronary dissection during percutaneous coronary intervention: successful aortoostial stenting
Iatrogenic acute dissection of the ascending aorta is a serious but rare complication of cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although treatment of ascending aortic dissection may require surgical repair, stenting at the origin of the dissection area may be sufficient in aortocoronary dissection (AD) following PCI. Described is the case of a 64-year-old female patient who was treated with PCI for a critical lesion of the right coronary artery (RCA). Immediate stenting at the source of the dissection was sufficient to repair the RCA lesions and successfully seal the site of retrograde propagation of the dissection. The ascending aortic dissection was monitored with computed tomography and the dissection was spontaneously repaired within 72 hours.
Acute myocardial infarction shortly after valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation successfully managed with challenging percutaneous coronary intervention
In recent years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been considered a novel option for the management of surgically high-risk patients requiring aortic valve replacement. Presently described is a case of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) managed with a challenging primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) shortly after a valve-in-valve TAVI intervention. This case highlights 2 important issues: PCI may be an option for the management of coronary heart disease in patients after TAVI even in the setting of demanding features associated with coronary osteal engagement, and secondly, TAVI may serve as a potential risk factor for future coronary ischemic syndromes, largely due to its potential adverse effects on coronary flow dynamics, etc. However, the latter notion is quite speculative, and should be tested in further studies.
Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infectious disease that affects the endothelium of the large intrathoracic vessels, heart valves, and intra-cardiac foreign body material. A 20-year-old woman was admitted to the cardiology department with complaints of fever and palpitations. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve, aortic root enlargement, and aortic coarctation. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a bicuspid aortic valve, but there was no vegetation. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was identified on a blood culture. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) revealed increased intensive glucose uptake on the dilated aortic segment adjacent to the distal coarctation zone. Several reports have shown promising results for radio-labelled white blood cell single-photon emission computed tomography and 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging in IE. To our knowledge, this is the first described case in which PET-CT revealed endarteritis of the descending aorta in a patient without prosthetic material.
Although the use of oral contraceptives is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease, the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) is unclear. A new, third-generation contraceptive agent, drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol, which contains less estrogen and a new progestogen, drospirenone, in a different combination, has been considered more reliable in terms of risk of MI. However, there have been some cases of MI associated with the use of drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol, despite the protective effects of this oral contraceptive. In this report, a 33-year-old woman who had used drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol for 6 months was admitted with MI and symptoms of cardiogenic shock. Coronary angiography revealed the total occlusion of 2 coronary arteries and so percutaneous coronary intervention was performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of simultaneous total occlusion of 2 coronary arteries associated with the use of drospirenone-ethinyl estradiol in the English-language medical literature.
Alveolar hemorrhage (AH) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with a high mortality rate that is characterized by extensive bleeding into the alveolar spaces. AH usually develops secondary to immunological disease and, less frequently, to drug use. Presently described is the case of an 86-year-old woman with AH who had been using rivaroxaban for 6 months.

Choosing a thoughtful gift is never easy, especially when it is for someone that you care about and want to make especially happy this season.
Chris Johnson is a web developer and technology consultant living outside of Madison, Wisconsin. He has been developing websites professionally since 2003 when he got his first paycheck as a freelancer. He believes that software development is a craft and an art form, not a science. He enjoys crafting clean code and showing what he has accomplished no matter the tools and materials. When he's not developing he enjoys tinkering with technology and mechanical things, photography, video games, playing hockey along with spending time with his wife, their daughters and their two dogs.
The other day a co-worker was talking about moving some of his sites to a cheap static web host. Most of the sites were either blogs, or CMSs that don’t change very often and don’t really need the overhead of a dynamic system. I thought back about a script I had written to do this a year or so back. The meat of the script was around a wget call which spidered a page, and then converted all the links to work with the new static documents.
So with this simple shell script you can specify where you want to save the converted site by replacing “folder_to_save” and then substituting the site you want to clone/mirror in for “mysite.com”

I do enjoy a good provocative title.... "Education is failing technology" and this article by Mark E. Weston is both provocative and thought provoking.
I haven't posted anything on the blog for the last few weeks as I'm busy working on my first assignment but I thought this was worth sharing.
Weston sets out in his post a brief history of there work of Bloom and others in identifying ways for learning in a group setting to match the progress possible with one to one tuition. Many of the approaches referenced will be familiar to anyone who quotes Hattie from time to time.
Weston argues that the current set up in schools makes the burden of achieving that 2-sigma improvement (performing two standard deviations higher than their peers) too much about the actions of the individual teacher and not enough about the system as a whole.
People who listened to Professor David Hargreaves talk just about anytime in the last fifteen years would probably recognise the argument - as the students leave school full of energy and the staff stagger to the car park exhausted.
What I don't see in the article (and this is unfair as I don't think he set out to solve all the problems, just highlight them) are examples of the kind of technology education is supposedly failing, or even an indication of what that might be.
Thank you for reading my blog and taking the time to comment. All comments are moderated - I will aim to review your comment quickly and make sure it is made available.
With the newly released 8th Generation CPUs from Intel, one feature has gone missing from the Core i3 models: Hyper-Threading (HT). For example, the new Intel i3-8100 features 4 physical cores and 4 threads, whereas the previous generation’s i3-7100 featured 2 physical cores and 4 threads.
What is the difference between having a 2-core Hyper-Threaded CPU or a 4-core CPU without Hyper-Threading?
What’s the difference between Hyper-Threading and Simultaneous MultiThreading? Essentially, nothing! Both terms describe the same technology, which doubles parts of the CPU core to help speed up multi-threaded tasks. Hyper-Threading is Intel’s brand name for the technology, while simultaneous multi-threading is the more general term.
HT/SMT is not as good as having more physical cores. It is, however, a great feature that speeds up CPUs while keeping manufacturing costs down.
Any task you do on your PC, like checking your email, requires your CPU to process a set of instructions.
A normal single CPU core can process one instruction at a time. Even when a CPU can process millions of instructions per second, this takes time.
But the instructions aren’t all the same. different instructions are processed by different parts of the CPU core.
This is where Hyper-Threading and Simultaneous MultiThreading come into play. With HT and SMT, Windows sees two CPU cores. These are virtual cores, designed to be seen by the operating system individually like physical cores. This allows various operations to be broken down into smaller parts and have those processes carried out more efficiently by the CPU core. As long as the core is not using the same data for each task, that information can be split up, queued and then processed quickly by using HT/SMT technology. Code optimized for SMT can run up to twice as fast as on a normal CPU core. Un-optimized code may not be any faster, and can even be slightly slower.
In fact, that’s the analogy Intel uses in this simple overview of the potential benefits for Hyper-Threading: (from Intel’s article here)
Yes. However, software has to be properly optimized to take advantage of HT/SMT. At a fundamental level, HT/SMT is not as powerful as having more physical cores, because only part of the core is duplicated. Since only part of the core is duplicated, SMT is cheaper than adding the equivalent number of CPU cores, allowing lower prices. For example, assuming per-core speeds are the same, A 4 core CPU with SMT (8 threads) can perform equal to 4 core CPU without SMT, or up to about 90% of the speed of an 8 core CPU without SMT.
Right now, only the new i7 chips come with Hyper-Threading. The new i7-8700K has upgraded to 6 physical cores, each with two logical CPUs for a total of 12 threads. The previous i7-7700K had only 4 cores and 8 threads.
The i5 chips have upgraded from 4 to 6 physical cores and have a total of 6 threads (one per core) because they lack Hyper-Threading. Previous i5 chips had 4 cores, but also lacked Hyper-Threading.
AMD’s new Zen architecture is AMD’s first to feature Simultaneous MultiThreading, which is featured in their Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7 and Threadripper CPUs. The appropriately named Threadripper 1950X features a staggering 16 physical cores and 32 threads.
AMD’s entry-level A-Series and new generation Athlon CPUs are based on older architecture and do not feature SMT.
HT/SMT is great, but having more physical cores is better than having HT/SMT. So, if choosing between two CPUs of similar price, pick the one with more physical cores. If it happens to have HT/SMT, that’s a nice bonus.

I hope you did not miss nVidia’s conference yesterday! Lots of tech/game demos were shown, and lots and LOTS of fancy words (two hours worth) were used to tell us that nVidia is launching the new RTX series of cards.
nVidia is adding higher ray-tracing capabilities in its new cards. And what is ray-tracing? It is a rendering technique that allows for more realistic lighting, reflections, and shadows. Unfortunately, while nVidia did show us a lot of cool ray-tracing demos, we do not know how much of a performance impact ray-tracing has.
Remember PhysX and HairWorks? They both looked cool, but the performance drop can be unacceptable. nVidia also did not compare normal performance of the new cards vs the old cards, and opted instead to only compare “ray-tracing performance”.
Pre-orders for the new cards are available now, but you may want to wait for proper third party reviews first. The new cards are expected to launch on the 20th of September, with the RTX 2070 delayed to October.
If the new cards are good (and they should be), and if cryptominers allow it, we will be adding these new cards once they become available for purchase.
Time for a quick update on the progress towards full and real ‘open data’ in public services and in businesses.
We did get some correspondence from a reader who thought that we ought to be more precise grammatically about data. It is a plural word, so we should say, ‘data are more accessible than ever …’ and ‘data are exploding with total global volume predicted to reach 6.6 zettabytes (that’s apparently 10 to the power of 21 bytes) by the end of this decade.
We discussed open data as opposed to big data in February, Open Data Is Bigger Than Big Data Once It’s Released.
In that blog we reported that Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the free world wide web, was suggesting that companies, governments, organisations and individuals should open up their data. Machines can run ever more complex data on both sides of any interaction, business, logistical or personal. ‘Machines will do it far more efficiently than humans.’
It was and is, the internet of things, ‘where inanimate objects are online communicating with each other and performing tasks that humans consider too mundane.’ He believes there is a battle of mindsets in people, but once they have got the open data bug they realise the benefits of ‘performing a service to the country.’
So, no more concerns about privacy, confidentiality and commercial angles for a greater good, both altruistic and commercial.
Sophie Curtis debated the issue in the Daily Telegraph (June 2014) and cited the Department for Education publishing open data about schools’ performance which allows ‘companies to create league tables and citizens can find the best-performing schools in their catchment area.’
There have been league tables and copious quantities of data in the past and since Ofsted arrived, they have made public loads of it. The point is now that people can draw their own conclusions from public data, that information can now be tailored without losing credibility.
She said that since January 2010, some 14,500 UK government data sets have been released. These have ‘created new opportunities for organisations to build innovative digital services’.
Sir Nigel Shadbolt of the ODI told Curtis, ‘the whole move in the 21st century to a data-driven economy means that countries need a data infrastructure that is fit for purpose and a good part of that infrastructure is going to be open data.’
Just one project as an example – the use of branded statins over cheaper generic versions – is thought to have saved the NHS £200m a year. And that is just a start.
Obviously this is not about compromising the privacy of people’s personal data that could lead to crime against them or unacceptable loss of privacy, but it is about harnessing better the plethora of data to benefit us all.
Start up companies dealing in high-tech carbon metering/monitoring and in energy consumption are areas ripe to analyse data and come up with eye-watering savings.
In every area which is regarded as ‘public’, there are potential savings and opportunities for private sector businesses to take advantage, crunch the stats themselves and generate new revenue.
In short, there are no areas of service delivery which cannot be improved from basic timetables, instructions, monitoring right up to complex systems involving millions (of pounds and lives).
If any government can crack this and prove it is really open for open business the potential is massive in tax gains, jobs, expansion and quality of life.

Operations are all the systems and process that help you deliver your product or service; this might be how you manufacture and deliver goods, how you organise work flow, how you run projects from start to completion, or how you process invoices. They are all the things you do on a repeat basis that make your business run.
To work at their best they need to be efficient and effective - ensuring your product is delivered to the best of your ability using the fewest resources.
A system is efficient when it takes the least time, using the least resources i.e. money, man-hours, raw materials. This means it should be as simple and streamlined as possible. Unnecessary parts or actions should be left out, reducing clutter and taking the fastest route to the end result, freeing time for other work.
A system is effective when it achieves the right end result - there is no purpose being efficient producing something that misses the mark. This is like speeding along in the wrong direction. It needs to be an amazing journey - but in the right direction.
It also needs to be achieved consistently and with least risk. Correcting errors is a costly exercise in any business. And we clearly need to consider and mitigate any serious risks.
If we were to travel from London to Edinburgh, we first need to consider "Why Edinburgh - will it really give us what we want?" If we want a sunny beach holiday this is clearly the wrong place!
Having established it's the right destination, i.e. effective in us getting what we want, we now need to consider how to get there. What method of travel will be most efficient? If we then decided to travel by car, we must be efficient in our route, hours travelled and fuel used.

It’s been a while since I last posted a recipe. I thought it’s time to share another favourite of my family. It’s fortunate that my children doesn’t have any allergy on seafood because they just love eating seafood specially shrimps. Shrimps have been one of the most delectable foods there is as far as I’m concerned but it can be expensive. The bigger it gets, the more expensive it is. Well, as we always hear, indulgence doesn’t come cheap. This recipe is very simple with three basic ingredients. Shrimps or prawns can be used. If you prefer to have the head on, that would be fine too.
1. Prep the prawns or shrimps. This means have it thoroughly thawed if frozen. Pat them dry with paper towel or just lay them on a double sheet of paper towel to absorb excess liquid.
2. Dust the shrimps or prawns with flour. This will further absorb liquid and will help in absorbing the sauce later.
4. Stir fry the shrimps (or prawns) until they changed color (which indicates that they are cooked through).
5. Then add the sauce. Continue stirring until all the shrimps have been coated. This will only takes a minute or two then turn the heat off.
You have a huge investment in your truck fleet. Through this program, we can help you identify and address potential problems before they occur. Since most electric lift truck problems are caused by low battery voltage, correcting these problems early should cut way down on lift truck repairs. A clean safe charger area, less down time, longer battery run time, longer battery life, electrical cost savings, and fewer truck repairs are all benefits that will save your company money.
Battery Examination – Includes recording the specific gravity of each cell, recording the loaded voltage of each cell, inspecting the cables, connectors, and contact tips for any damage, inspecting the cell covers, intercell connectors, and post connections for any problems, as well as inspecting the general condition of the battery for signs of over-watering, corrosion, or positive post growth. We will furnish a summary of our findings with any recommendations and their cost.
Charger Examination – Includes recording the start rate and finish rate of each charger, adjusting the rates according to specification, inspecting the fuses, diodes, and transformers for problems, checking for any loose wires or fillings and tightening if necessary, inspecting the cables, connectors, and contact tips for any damage, and observing the control circuit for proper start up and termination of the charge. We will furnish you with a summary of our findings with any recommendations and their cost.
Battery Watering – At TIE we have introduced a plan which will take all the responsibility of the forklift battery topping and maintenance off your hands. Meaning you will have a plug and play system with your forklift, and the cost is neutral to just your internal topping costs! You will get visited by a fully trained professional battery operative who will provide a visit report including observations of use, photographs of any damage or areas of concern and visual inspections of your cables and plugs.
Our Autofill system makes this normally difficult and dirty job simple and quick. Standard vent caps are replaced with special caps incorporating valves. These are linked together and allow the batteries to be topped up very quickly and accurately. Please see our products page for more information.

This book offers a comprehensive critique of the principle of proportionality and balancing as applied to human and constitutional rights.
The principle of proportionality, which has become the standard test for adjudicating human and constitutional rights disputes in jurisdictions worldwide has had few critics. Proportionality is generally taken for granted or enthusiastically promoted or accepted with minor qualifications. A Critique of Proportionality and Balancing presents a frontal challenge to this orthodoxy. It provides a comprehensive critique of the proportionality principle, and particularly of its most characteristic component, balancing. Divided into three parts, the book presents arguments against the proportionality test, critiques the view of rights entailed by it, and proposes an alternative understanding of fundamental rights and their limits.

"The principle of proportionality, which has become the standard test for adjudicating human and constitutional rights disputes in jurisdictions worldwide has had few critics. Proportionality is generally taken for granted or enthusiastically promoted or accepted with minor qualifications. A Critique of Proportionality and Balancing presents a frontal challenge to this orthodoxy. It provides a comprehensive critique of the proportionality principle, and particularly of its most characteristic component, balancing. Divided into three parts, the book presents arguments against the proportionality test, critiques the view of rights entailed by it, and proposes an alternative understanding of fundamental rights and their limits"--
Although the most important constitutional doctrine worldwide, a thorough cultural and historical examination of proportionality has not taken place until now. This comparison of proportionality with its counterpart in American constitutional law - balancing - shows how culture and history can create deep differences in seemingly similar doctrines. Owing to its historical origin in Germany, proportionality carries to this day a pro-rights association, while the opposite is the case for balancing. In addition, European legal and political culture has shaped proportionality as intrinsic to the state's role in realizing shared values, while in the United States a suspicion-based legal and political culture has shaped balancing in more pragmatic and instrumental terms. Although many argue that the USA should converge on proportionality, the book shows that a complex web of cultural associations make it an unlikely prospect.
To speak of human rights in the twenty-first century is to speak of proportionality. Proportionality has been received into the constitutional doctrine of courts in continental Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, and the United States, as well as the jurisprudence of treaty-based legal systems such as the European Convention on Human Rights. Proportionality provides a common analytical framework for resolving the great moral and political questions confronting political communities. But behind the singular appeal to proportionality lurks a range of different understandings. This volume brings together many of the world's leading constitutional theorists - proponents and critics of proportionality - to debate the merits of proportionality, the nature of rights, the practice of judicial review, and moral and legal reasoning. Their essays provide important new perspectives on this leading doctrine in human rights law.
Proportionality is one of the most important principles in constitutional law, relevant throughout the law and in jurisdictions worldwide. Setting out the 'state of the art' in proportionality doctrine, this book combines theoretical reconstruction with case-law examples, defending and developing the dominant model of proportionality.
The migration of constitutional ideas across jurisdictions is one of the central features of contemporary constitutional practice. The increasing use of comparative jurisprudence in interpreting constitutions is one example of this. In this 2007 book, leading figures in the study of comparative constitutionalism and comparative constitutional politics from North America, Europe and Australia discuss the dynamic processes whereby constitutional systems influence each other. They explore basic methodological questions which have thus far received little attention, and examine the complex relationship between national and supranational constitutionalism - an issue of considerable contemporary interest in Europe. The migration of constitutional ideas is discussed from a variety of methodological perspectives - comparative law, comparative politics, and cultural studies of law - and contributors draw on case-studies from a wide variety of jurisdictions: Australia, Hungary, India, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.
This book presents important new scholarship by leading figures in constitutional law on new challenges for proportionality doctrine.

French Dressing looks at the ancien régime's scenarios of libertine seduction--unsafe sex and its consequences for women's lives. It places the gender performances of male and female-authored novels in dialogue in order to recover the complexity of a century obsessed, as we are today, with writing and living plots of desire. French Dressing exposes the erotic anxieties behind a national culture of sexual self-display--French undressing.
The rise of the novel paradigm—and the underlying homology between the rise of a bourgeois middle class and the coming of age of a new literary genre—continues to influence the way we analyze economic discourse in the eighteenth-century French novel. Characters are often seen as portraying bourgeois values, even when historiographical evidence points to the virtual absence of a self-conscious and coherent bourgeoisie in France in the early modern period. Likewise, the fact that the nobility was a dynamic and diverse group whose members had learned to think in individualistic and meritocratic terms as a result of courtly politics is often ignored. The Other Rise of the Novel calls for a radical revision of how realism, the language of self-interest and commercial exchanges, and idealized noble values interact in the early modern novel. It focuses on two novels from the seventeenth century, Furetière’s Roman bourgeois and Lafayette’s Princesse de Clèves and four novels from the eighteenth century, Prévost’s Manon Lescaut, Graffigny’s Lettres d’une Péruvienne, Rousseau’s La Nouvelle Héloïse and Sade’s Les infortunes de la vertu. It argues that eighteenth-century French fiction does not reflect material culture mimetically and that character action is best analyzed by focusing on the social and discursive exchanges staged by the text, rather than by trying to create parallels between specific behavior and actual historical changes. The novel produces its own reality by transforming characters and their stories into alternative social models, different articulations of how individuals should define their economic relations to others. The representation of interpersonal relations often highlights personal conceptions of private interest that cannot be easily reconciled with the traditional narrative of a transition towards economic modernity. Realism, then, is not only about verisimilar storytelling and psychological depth: it is an epistemological questioning about the type of access to reality that a particular genre can give its readers.
Julia V. Douthwaite describes the interrelated representations of cultural and sexual difference in key French works of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The heroines of this book are foreign women, brought to France through no will of their own, and forced into the margins of a new society. The author contends that their experience resonates with larger cultural beliefs about exotic and primitive peoples in ancien régime France and illuminates some of the blind spots in Enlightenment thought.
Now in paperback, an award-winning look at French salons and the women who presided over them In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, between the reign of Louis XIII and the Revolution, French aristocratic society developed an art of living based on a refined code of good manners. Conversation, which began as a way of passing time, eventually became the central ritual of social life. In the salons, freed from the rigidity of court life, it was women who dictated the rules and presided over exchanges among socialites, writers, theologians, and statesmen. They contributed decisively to the development of the modern French language, new literary forms, and debates over philosophical and scientific ideas. With a cast of characters both famous and unknown, ranging from the Marquise de Rambouillet to Madame de Sta‘l, and including figures like Ninon de Lenclos, the Marquise de Sevigne, and Madame de Lafayette, as well as Pascal, La Rochefoucauld, Diderot, and Voltaire, Benedetta Craveri traces the history of this worldly society that carried the art of sociability to its supreme perfection–and ultimately helped bring on the Revolution that swept it all away.

Jeff Thaler’s and Jim May’s blog posts about our recent ACOEL delegation visit to Haiti captured the vibrant spirit of Haiti’s legal community and its enthusiasm to build new programs in environmental law. Haiti offered a different insight as well: dire environmental conditions have spurred strikingly innovative and creative legal thinking. In one sense, Haiti’s challenges are a frontier that can test and forge new environmental laws and concepts.
After our delegation visit finished, my wife and I visited an abandoned United Nations outpost on a dirt road over an hour north from Port-Au-Prince. Hidden behind encroaching trees and weeds, a blue-trimmed UN guard tower watched over empty concrete foundations and open gates behind a decaying chain-link fence and tangled razor wire.
This fading post is a flashpoint in history. In 2013, sewage from the UN outpost’s battalion of Nepalese peacekeepers contaminated a nearby tributary and led to an outbreak of cholera that has killed over 9,000 people and sickened over 800,000 so far. The United Nations has rejected petitions that it should fund and establish a comprehensive sanitation, medical treatment and potable water program to halt the epidemic. In response, a group of Haitians and Haitian-Americans filed a class action lawsuit in the federal Southern District of New York court for damages and injunctive relief.
The United Nations stoutly rejected any argument that the U.S. court has jurisdiction over its operations. The United States vigorously urged the trial court to dismiss the lawsuit, and the court agreed on January 9, 2015 by denying jurisdiction. The district court found that the UN had not expressly waived its immunity under the Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 1946 (despite the UN’s failure to satisfy other important obligations under the Convention).
The case took a dramatic turn when the Second Circuit decided to hold oral argument on the Haitians’ appeal of the trial court’s dismissal. In a packed courthouse in Manhattan on March 1, 2016, the three-judge panel seemed sympathetic to the claims of Haitians who will likely have no possible relief or compensation if the court upholds the United States’ assertions of strong immunity on behalf of the UN. The court will probably issue its decision in the next few months.
If the court finds that the UN lacks absolute immunity for environmental or health damages caused by its actions, the decision could have a sweeping impact on the UN’s liability for other humanitarian actions that cause environmental harm. The UN plays a central role in multinational efforts to fight climate change, protect oceanic resources, and preserve endangered species and ecosystems, and the spectre of liability could hamper its activities. Depending on the scope of the court’s ruling, this case might also affect the liability of other multinational organizations whose actions to protect the environment unexpectedly injure human health or natural resources.
Haiti’s enormous environmental and public health challenges sparked this important case, and the legal creativity guiding the lawsuit arose there as well. Our delegation had the opportunity to meet Me. Mario Joseph, who directs the L'Association Haïtienne de Droit de l'Environnement which filed the lawsuit (along with several other groups). As lead counsel he guides the team of attorneys handling the case, and he strongly believes that legal creativity and ingenuity can overcome the procedural and jurisdictional barriers to reach a just environmental outcome.
If it desires, ACOEL can help monitor and, where appropriate, contribute to the development of these types of innovative environmental legal approaches in Haiti. The Second Circuit’s ultimate decision may offer an opportunity to discuss these issues with the Haitian environmental bar and with other lawyers who want to help build Haiti’s environmental laws and enforcement options.
In the meantime, change still comes slowly. When we visited the abandoned outpost, families had moved into the vacant buildings and children were bathing in a nearby stream – directly by the unused outfall pipe where the UN peacekeepers had previously discharged their sewage wastes. Whatever decisions come from U.S. courts, Haiti will have a pressing need for innovative and effective environmental laws for many years ahead.
John Roberts’ first opinion as a judge on the D.C. Circuit was a dissent from denial of rehearing en banc in an Endangered Species Act case. His opinion famously referred to the endangered species at issue as “a hapless toad that, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California[.]” Two years later critics pointed to this flippant reference to species extinction as a reason to oppose his nomination to be Chief Justice.
On October 1st the Supreme Court will begin a new term. The first case scheduled for oral argument is another ESA case involving another amphibian, the dusky gopher frog. In this case, private landowners challenge the government’s designation of 1,500 acres of pine forest not occupied by the frog as critical habitat essential for survival of the species.
The ESA clearly authorizes the designation of private land as critical habitat; and it expressly authorizes the designation of land not occupied by an endangered species if the Secretary finds the area to be essential for the species’ survival. The fight over habitat for the dusky gopher frog in the Supreme Court involves two relatively straightforward issues of statutory construction:
Whether land not occupied by an endangered species may be designated as critical habitat if the land currently lacks one or more of the physical or biological features essential to conservation of the species; and
Whether the agency’s decision not to exercise its discretionary authority to exclude petitioner’s land from critical habitat on grounds of economic impact is committed to agency discretion.
A district judge appointed by President Reagan and generally regarded as staunchly conservative, upheld the critical habitat designation, but did so with clear distaste for the result:
“The Court has little doubt that what the government has done is remarkably intrusive and has all the hallmarks of government insensitivity to private property. The troubling question is whether the law authorizes such action and whether the government has acted within the law. Reluctantly, the Court answers yes to both questions.”
The Fifth Circuit, widely regarded as one of the most conservative federal circuits, affirmed the district court, albeit with one judge on the panel dissenting and six judges dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc.
The Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case does not bode well for the dusky gopher frog. As the saying goes, “The Supreme Court does not grant cert. to affirm.” The broad picture of this case is familiar. A small, seemingly insignificant creature is allegedly blocking the common sense path of economic development and prosperity. The arguments challenging the habitat designation are long on drama regarding supposed economic impact, despite the fact the habitat designation only affects government actions, and in the absence of a federal nexus, does nothing to change the landowners’ private use of their property. And, the arguments against the habitat designation are very short on concern over the survival of what the landowners dub as the “phantom frog.”
So far, the sturdy structure of the ESA has generally withstood this type of full frontal assault, from the snail darter to the Delhi Sands flower-loving fly, to the hapless toad, and now to the dusky gopher frog. If the dusky gopher frog wins, it will not be the first time the Supreme Court took an ESA case that seemed at first blush to be an easy reversal only to find itself ultimately affirming a decision protecting the species. That was exactly what happened with the snail darter in TVA v. Hill. And, as was the case in TVA v. Hill, a victory for the dusky gopher frog in the Supreme Court will undoubtedly fuel arguments that Congress should amend the ESA.
Brett Kavanaugh’s recent nomination to succeed Justice Kennedy has prompted speculation that he would vote against the dusky gopher frog based on his opinion in the D.C. Circuit vacating the critical habitat designation for the San Diego fairy brine shrimp and his critical view of Chevron deference. Such speculation may be overstated. It is not clear the Senate will vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation in time for him to participate in the decision regarding the dusky gopher frog. And, in any event, the record supporting the habitat designation for the frog is far more robust than that involving the fairy brine shrimp. In this case, conservative principles supporting strict adherence to statutory language may carry the day for the dusky gopher frog.
Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences.
One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so.
A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite.
I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me.
When I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless lorem ipsum dolor indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back.
In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters.
If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European.
It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Maecenas nec odio et ante tincidunt.
The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. “What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table – Samsa was a travelling salesman – and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.
The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language..
It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table – Samsa was a travelling salesman – and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

Anna has been integrally involved in widlife assistance in the wake of the fire inferno that devastated over 180 square kilometres in her home area of the Garden Route in South Africa during June and July. Also dubbed "Eden" because of its indigenous natural beauty, this paradise has been severely affected for decades to come by the disaster - the largest recorded fire in the country since the 1800's. Over 1200 human homes were destroyed, and the effects on the wild ones are widespread, with the authorities doing nothing to support displaced, injured and starving animals.
Please support our small team of volunteers called Eden Be Needin'; we need funds for animal feed and human volunteers to work in the field.
As readers of this blog may already know, Hawaii 70.3 was my "A Priority" race for this year. The entire focus of the 2010 season was to return to Ironman World Championships, without actually racing an Ironman in the process. This meant that I had to qualify at one of the few half-Ironman events around the globe that would allow me passage to Ironman if I went fast enough. And this also meant I was a bit more anxious than usual about this race (just ask my wife, who shared a condo with me as I incessantly fretted every detail of the big day) - all the way down to writing my goal times on my arm for what I figured I would need to qualify:
After spending 2 weeks in rainy Spokane, acclimatizing for the heat by performing jumping jacks and step-ups in the YMCA dry heat room and steam room, I stepped off the plane into Hawaii ready to rumble.
My nutrition protocol leading up to this race was very precise and calculated. I followed exactly the recommendations of Dr. Cohen at Bioletics - limiting my omega-6 fatty acids while taking omega-3 fatty acids, using magnesium regularly, skewing my diet towards higher protein intake and whole amino acid supplementation and elevating my testosterone levels. I also supplemented with nuun uHydration tables and liquid trace minerals during my stay in Hawaii leading up to the race, to replace lost electrolytes.
The training protocol was pretty standard Triathlon Dominator stuff. I just took my program and shortened a few of the weekend workouts, allowing me to do 9-12 training hours each week. I did make some gear modifications, however, upgrading my Specialized Transition Pro with Gray 9.5 Wheels and Vittoria 320 Clinchers.
During this training, I also kept my body as non-acidic and non-inflammatory as possible with Enerprime greens supplement and ProstElan, and took Wicked Fast Recoverease after each workout, loading with 6-8 capsules each day for the last week leading up to the race.
The tricky part about Hawaii is that your eyes pop open at about 4am every morning if you're from the Pacific Time Zone. I went to bed at about 8 every night, and used Millennium Sports ZMK and Somnidren to get my used to that sleep cycle.
I've been experimenting quite a bit with Visualization, and did several focused sessions in the last several weeks leading up to the race - most of which I picked up from Psychocybernetics and the "I Am" lecture.

Here is the beach line-up on race day. I started as far left as possible, floating in the water behind the pros. Heck, I figured even if I wasn't as fast, I should still line up where they were going and try to hop on somebody's feet.
Off we go! I'm the guy in the blue cap. Yeah, that one. If you're reading this and you're looking for race day tips, then here they are:
-don't really sweat the first buoy, which is a gradual right, but be ready for flying elbows at the second buoy, a sharp right turn...
-poor visibility, swimming into a current, and lots of choppiness during the entire middle section of the swim that cuts across Hapuna Bay...
I drafted like a gold-digger the whole swim on some huge guy with big feet during the entire swim, so it felt pretty leisurely, but my watch read 29:02 as I was coming out of the water. Perfect!
There is a fairly steep hill coming out of transition. Aside from dropping my bike shoe off a pedal as it scraped on the pavement, I had a pretty smooth transition. This is a good race to make sure your bike is in the proper gear coming out of transition, because it does go uphill immediately.
This photo below is about 10 miles into the bike. I had a very precise strategy for the bike split on this course, and after driving the course and doing a couple short test rides in the days leading up to the race, I figured I had the wind and hills figured out.
If you're looking for bike course tips, I actually shot a couple videos explaining my heat acclimatization and bike pacing strategy over at the Rock Star Triathlete Academy - but I'm going to keep it between me and the members over there...sorry folks, that's only fair. You can see the videos for $1.
Suffice it to say, my bike strategy was rock solid (yes, I am not in the aero position in that photo, and that actually happened several times due to the severe winds). In the spirit of the Island, I fueled myself with Pineapple GU Roctane, and by the 30 mile mark, I had ridden into seventh place overall, with a sizeable 2 and a half minute gap between me and the next guy back.
My bike split was 2:21, so now I had a 6 minute "pillow" for a hot and hilly half-marathon that promised to pepper us through a winding golf course, multiple black-top out and backs, and a final "Road To Hell" 5 mile slog.
I hung on to my position as 7th overall and 2nd place amateur until the 3 mile mark, where the eventual amateur winner passed me.
-Aid stations rock with cold water and ice. Use it lots, especially on your hot crotchiness (cool off those femoral arteries).
-If you start to overheat, take a short walk break. I did this myself for 60 seconds and it saved me as I started to burn up and really lose it just after the 10K mark.
-Don't eat much. Your body has a hard time cooling an digesting. I had a couple banana halves and 1 gel on the run.
-Don't wear a big shoe that will get wet, hot and soggy running on golf course grass. I used the Avia Bolts and they were perfect. Do wear socks.
Once we entered the "Road to Hell", I found my rhythm again, but at this point (about mile eight) I was passed a few times, and knew I'd have to hold on hard if I wanted my slot.
I have to say that I really did suffer those last couple miles, and looked behind me multiple times, expecting to see somebody running me down, but anybody who was going to do any damage had already passed me between miles 8 and 10.
When the smoke cleared, it turned out that I ran a 1:33 - not bad, considering I felt like I crawling for a good 2 miles of the run. That was good enough for a 4:29...
(those are the white Zeal Optics I'm wearing up there - pretty super cool shades from Boulder Colorado).
So, it's off to the Big Island in October - which means I'll start Ironman training sometime in August. And between now and then? Maybe a few small races or local half-Ironman events, but mostly, I need to teach my kids how to ride a bike. I'm going to need some company during those long runs this fall.
P.S. This November, if you want to come join me for the Laguna Phuket triathlon in Thailand, along with the Asia Ironman 70.3, just e-mail me at ben@bengreenfieldfitness.com - I'm bringing a whole group of athletes down!

Call Me by Your Name (2017): ​In Northern Italy in 1983, seventeen year-old Elio begins a relationship with visiting Oliver, his father's research assistant, with whom he bonds over his emerging sexuality, their Jewish heritage, and the beguiling Italian landscape.
I love this movie. Simply put, it is spectacular. It is gorgeous in every sense of the word: it features breathtaking cinematography and production design, wonderful dialogue, fantastic colors, and beautiful chemistry between its leads, Armie Hammer (as Oliver) and Timothée Chalamet. (As Elio) Every second of this 132 minute film had me completely entranced. I love it when a film sucks me into its world entirely, and no film has done that better than this in 2017. The hype is real, guys. Call Me by Your Name does have a few faults, but overall it is one of the strongest and most engaging films of 2017, and it's well worth your time.
There isn't much that I didn't like here, but that's where I'll start. This film reminded me of 20th Century Women in a lot of ways. I felt a similar style of dialogue between the films, as well as ties between actor Michael Stuhlbarg (who plays Elio's father) and Annette Bening's portrayal as Dorothea Fields, (the mother in 20th Century Women) and similarities in the editing. 2 of the 3 of these I don't have a problem with. (Stuhlbarg is spectacular as the father) But, like in 20th Century Women, director Luca Guadognino employees the rainbow editing style a few times, and I'm still just not a fan of that. It takes me out of the moment, and I haven't been able to fully comprehend and appreciate why it's utilized since I first saw it in 2016. Someone REALLY needs to explain this to me! It's part of a filmmaking style I think, but it's tough (for me, at least) to identify the style while it's being developed. There's also some issues with the pacing. Shots will linger for just a hair too long, and the film does choose to focus on a few things that seem, well, less-than-important. I think the length of the movie is just right, but it's about 10 minutes too long in the second act then 10 minutes too short in the third. However, the rest of the film is fan-freaking-tastic. Almost as fantastic as this gif of Armie Hammer dancing, which is applicable in literally EVERY situation. Peace in the Middle East? Well, it's funny that you should ask.....
I'll be honest with you: I could stare at that gif allllllllll day. (I even have a shirt of it which I maaaay or may not be wearing right now as I type up this review) Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet, though. They are the best things about this film. I've been a huge fan of Hammer's since he played the "Winklevii" in 2010's The Social Network, but it took until 2017 for him to finally show us what he could do. Equally as impressive is (relative) newcommer Timothée Chalamet. I hadn't seen this kid in anything before 2017, but all it took was his complex performance in Lady Bird and this to convince me that he's a star. Both Hammer and Chalamet are marvelous together. They have great chemistry, and their story arc is simply beautiful. These are very demanding roles that they have to play, and honestly it looks like they could do them in their sleep. It was wonderful. The supporting cast is small, but the one member that really stands out is Michael Stuhlbarg. He plays this whimsical, pragmatic, and wise character that almost steals the show for me. His heart-wrenching monologue to his son at the end of the film may very well be my single favorite movie moment of 2017. It alone is worth the price of admission.
As if the superb acting wasn't enough, this film is also GORGEOUS to look at. Filmed on location in northern Italy, (aka one of the most romantic spots in the world) this movie utilizes its landscape, its time period, (early 80s) and its production design to a mesmerizing degree. Look at that picture at the top of this review. Look at all the colors used on the set. The color of the costumes. Every decision here from director Luca Guadagnino was meticulous and a spectacular one The cinematography was terrific too and told the story of these characters in their own right. Kudos to Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, as this is some of the best cinematography I saw in 2017. And, finally, there's the soundtrack. "This is Me" from The Greatest Showman may be getting all the Oscar buzz for original song, but if you want a FAR better song about being different and still trying to be yourself while falling in love.....look no further than this film's major original song, "Mystery of Love." Sufjan Stevens delivers not just the best song I've heard in film in 2017, but one of the best songs I've heard all year, period. He has two other original songs here, and all of them are, like the rest of this film, mesmerizing. There are a lot of other great songs used here, too. After all..... any film that makes The Psychedelic Furs an integral part of its story is going to be good. It's impossible for it to not be!
While this film does fall just short of perfection thanks to those rainbow edits and the (slightly) muddy pacing, it doesn't change the fact that this will end up being one of the best films of 2017 and well worth your time to see this intimate, heartwarming, earth-shattering love story. Put it on the list, for sure. Now, excuse me while I go stare at that gif of Armie Hammer dancing for just a little while longer....
The Critique: Full of joy and heartbreak, Call Me by Your Name is one of 2017's best films and features dynamic performances from its male leads.

It starts with a phone conversation in which we briefly discuss your reasons for seeking therapy. We make an appointment to meet in person for about an hour to further discuss your needs and goals. If we decide to proceed with the therapeutic process, we use the next few sessions to set goals and to determine whether short-term or long-term therapy is most beneficial. Reassessing periodically our process and your progress is an integral part of the experience.
My experience and education have led me to believe that the client-therapist relationship is one of most important aspects of therapy. Therapy is a relationship-based treatment. You need to be as comfortable as possible. Together, we work toward accomplishing your goals. If the client and therapist are not a good fit, you won’t achieve your goals.
Because my approach is individually based upon your needs, I combine active listening and more directive interaction as you develop your own insights and solutions.
No. I am a licensed psychologist with a doctorate in clinical psychology. Only psychiatrists, who are medical doctors, can write prescriptions. I am trained, however, to assess whether a medication evaluation is warranted in any given case. If it appears that a client could benefit from medication, I address this with the client and refer them to their general practitioner and/or a psychiatrist for a medication evaluation. Typically, I maintain contact with that physician as the client and I continue our therapeutic work. The client also has occasional appointments with the physician who monitors the medication.
As a clinical psychologist, I am trained to work with many psychological and emotional issues and diagnoses. My experience includes working with depression, anxiety, the impact of past and present traumatic events, issues in personal and family relationships, the psychological effects of chronic medical illness, postpartum depression, life changes and personal growth.
I have developed and implemented programs and treatment regimens for numerous athletes and teams including elite amateurs, college athletes and professional athletes, ranging in age from adolescents to older adults. I am a certified consultant with the Association for Applied Sport Psychology (recognized by the American Psychological Association). To earn this designation, I met a standard of education and training in sport sciences and in psychology. I completed a practicum and was privately supervised by the head psychologist at the US Olympic Training Center. I have undergone an extensive review process, abide by the AASP ethical code and receive ongoing training in sport psychology. I have also completed study in sport psychology at the Kinesiology Department at University of Colorado in Boulder.
I have received specific training to work with this population. I incorporate into person-centered therapy the knowledge and understanding of an artist’s unique needs. Over the years I have designed and implemented treatment plans for numerous performing artists from such areas as includes artists from such areas as dance, opera, country music, musical theater, symphony, theater and comedy.
My practice is fee for service. This means payment in full is expected at the time of the session. My fee is comparable to other psychologists in the Denver area with my level of education, experience and expertise. I provide a limited number of client slots on a sliding scale. These are reserved for those with financial need. Our first discussion will include the particulars on fees.
Your insurance company may provide partial reimbursement directly to you for your therapy upon receipt of proof of payment. Please check with your insurance company for your particular plan’s coverage.
The length of treatment varies, depending upon your needs and goals. If want to treat one specific area, therapy could be short-term (3 to 12 sessions). If you are looking for deeper intervention, therapy would be long-term (4 months or longer).

RE: Request for site review from Marjolein Katsma on 2000-04-17 (w3c-wai-ig@w3.org from April to June 2000)
Maybe it's fluid on your computer - it certainly isn't on mine. Yes, maybe if you have the latest, fastest hardware and a video with lots of memory - but not everyone has that (or can afford it). Like I mentioned before, it's so slow that the mouse continues moving when the submenu and arrow on the main one stops displaying.
Testing tip: put the site (or at least the part you need to test) on a floppy disk and load the site from there. It will give you approximately the access speed of a 28.8K modem (which is not what's in the shops now - but it is what many people still use, or the effective speed they can get out of their provider...)
Study selection and assessment: Studies were selected if they were prospective trials with ≥ 3-month follow-up, enrolled consecutive outpatients with symptoms and signs suggestive of DVT, used a validated CPG to estimate the clinical probability (low, moderate, and high) of DVT before D-dimer testing or diagnostic imaging, and evaluated proximal DVT. In studies that included D-dimer testing, testing had to be done before other diagnostic tests. Studies of patients with previous DVT that was not adjusted for by the CPG or the reviewers were excluded. 14 studies (n = 8239) met the selection criteria; all evaluated the Wells CPG. 11 studies (n = 5690) incorporated D-dimer testing in the CPG. Quality assessment of individual studies was based on independent, blinded comparison of symptoms or signs with a diagnostic reference standard among patients with suspected DVT.
The prevalence of DVT in the low, moderate, and high clinical probability groups was 5.0% (95% CI 4.0 to 8.0), 17% (CI 13 to 23), and 53% (CI 44 to 61), respectively. Meta-analysis showed that the specificity of D-dimer testing (high sensitivity assays, moderate sensitivity assays, and overall) decreased as the clinical probability rose from low to high (overall P < 0.001; P value not reported for high-sensitivity and moderate-sensitivity assays, respectively) for predicting DVT, but the sensitivity of D-dimer testing did not differ among the 3 clinical probability groups (Table).
In patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT), low clinical probability on the Wells clinical prediction guide combined with negative D-dimer test results rules out DVT. High clinical probability or a positive D-dimer test result requires further ultrasonography testing.

Table. Diagnostic characteristics of the Wells clinical prediction guide (low, moderate, and high probability) and D-dimer testing for predicting deep venous thrombosis*
The systematic review by Wells and colleagues provides important confirmation of the role of clinical assessment in suspected DVT. The Wells rule works, and it is now well-validated.
Prevalence of DVT in the low- and moderate-probability categories is consistent across 14 studies including > 8000 patients. However, although those series included outpatients, this sample was probably not representative of primary care patients since a large proportion had probably already been triaged. However, the prevalence of DVT would be expected to be even lower in primary care patients with a low probability of DVT according to the Wells rule, making it even safer to rule out DVT in combination with a negative D-dimer test result. On the other hand, interobserver variability has not been examined in any of the studies included in this meta-analysis, which might be a concern because the Wells rule contains at least 1 subjective element (i.e., the likelihood of an alternative diagnosis). But this is probably not important because the rule has been validated by a vast number of physicians with varying degrees of experience.
The highly sensitive D-dimer assays have a negative likelihood ratio (−LR) about 0.1, but moderately sensitive assays have a −LR about 0.2. Despite those different characteristics, most experts would probably agree that the combination of a low clinical probability of DVT and a negative result from a D-dimer test of either sort convincingly rules out DVT with a posttest probability < 1%.
But what should we do for patients with moderate clinical probability? In a patient with a negative, moderately sensitive D-dimer assay, the posttest probability of DVT would still be over 4% and lower limb compression ultrasonography should be done. But if a highly sensitive D-dimer assay was negative, the posttest probability would only be about 1%, potentially ruling out DVT without further testing. This strategy is clearly promising but must be tested in other studies on a larger scale before it can be widely advocated.

While part of my role as a teacher is to impart knowledge and skills my students do not have, I also keep in mind that every students knows something I do not--whether that be about the students' personal lives, a hobby they're greatly invested in, or a topic they researched thoroughly in another class--and treat them accordingly. For this reason, while I often provide a general framework for class discussion with two or three questions, I allow student interest to dictate where the conversation progresses within that framework, or even outside of it. I also have students occasionally lead class and identify the key characteristics of successful texts that should serve as a standard for their work. This approach models for students the idea that education is often not hierarchical but heterarchical, which also promotes the understanding of writing as an act of communication directed towards a very real and specific audience that can talk back rather than an attempt to meet the exact demands of one person.
I see technology as a tool for further illustrating this idea of writing as having an impact outside of the classroom, particularly as a means of disseminating information. When I taught Oral English in China, students had to identify environmental problems around campus, document them with their camera phones, propose solutions, and present their findings orally and on a poster. My Writing in Professions students at SMSU use photo-editing software to create trading cards inspired by Literary Trading Cards that summarize, to the general audience, the purpose, strengths, and weaknesses of the fields they plan to enter. Both of these activities help students envision how university learning connects to their life outside of school, adapt to the demands of different audiences, and understanding writing as something more than just the traditional essay.
In my teaching, whether in physical or online classrooms, I favor collaborative and cooperative learning. Collaboration and cooperation occur between students but also between them and me. While I do contribute my expert knowledge to help guide students, I eschew a top-down classroom for one based more on partnerships because it encourages students to see themselves as developing experts with valuable input. The confidence and authority students gain from this approach is particularly important at SMSU because much of the student body has not yet developed proficiencies in academic work. For example, when I teach basic composition for international students, their rhetorical analyses of assigned readings form the bulk of essay assignment parameters, making their standards the ones that drive the class. In my first-semester composition courses, students finish the semester by forming groups, identifying a problem in the university or larger community, and then producing a researched, multimodal artifact and multi-author essay proposing a solution to that problem. They present these artifacts to the class and at least one community member who is an expert in a related field. In one instance, the university implemented an affordable solution a group found for a campus WiFi dead spot. In reflection essays at the end of this course, students invariably note that the project teaches them how to behave like professionals and empowers them to address the economic, cultural, and political problems in our country and region.

AIA Detroit has proudly partnered with the talented folks at Illuminart for the past two years, so we were super excited to see Brienne Willcock and Robert White featured on concentratemedia.com. Illuminart is the designing force behind the lighting at Shed 3 for our 2013 & 2014 Celebration of Architecture; the cobalt blue and fuschia lighting schemes that you could see from down the street in Eastern Market are all because these guys know how to light a building. They also helped to pull in Fantasee Lighting, who brings the equipment and skilled labor needed to bring to life Brienne’s concept for the building. We are eternally grateful for these folks, they certainly deserve the media attention. (more…)

Lawrence Technological University College of Architecture and Design and Design Corps are proud to announce a partnership to present the Structures for Inclusion Conference 15 in Detroit.
In October of 2000, Design Corps, a community based non-profit organization, sponsored a conference at Princeton University. The purpose of this conference is to bring together and share the best ideas and practices that are reaching those currently un-served and underserved by architecture. These efforts are often grounded on two common beliefs that communities and individuals should be included in the design decisions that affect them and architects and communities should work together to identify their shared values and goals in the collaborative process of defining quality design. Since the first SFI at Princeton University, it has been hosted at various institutions including the University of Virginia, the University of Texas at Austin, Harvard University, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis, and the Parsons New School for Design among others. The conference has become internationally recognized as a thought-provoking forum to learn about grass roots efforts and alternative practices making architecture more accessible. (more…)
My most recent art doll was featured in an art show at 105 Art Gallery downtown Albuquerque. The show was called "The Grateful Dead."
This is my "La Muerte", painted in the style of calaveras often seen at our local Día de Muertos parade.
She's made from air-dry clay, cloth, mixed media, and painted with acrylics. She's about 14 inches tall, and sits on a little shelf. I might put her up on Etsy when I have time later, although I'm not sure that she shouldn't stay in my own collection....
Here's a photo of my daughter last year before we went to the Día de Muertos parade and celebrations. This year, our Muertos y Marigolds parade will take place next Sunday. It's a wonderful event, full of celebration, music, dance, and color.
I'm an artist, a musician, a writer, and a designer. This is my studio where I share my doll art (including customized Sasha dolls) and connect with other artists and doll people. Check out my Facebook artist page (link is below) for news and updates!

Raoul Schrott is one of Austria’s most successful and prolific writers. He will read from The Sex of the Angels, an ironic take on the way we have peopled the heavens across the centuries from ancient Greek legends of the origin of light, to the medieval darkness of the eclipse.
He will be joined by Karen Leeder, a writer, translator and academic, who teaches German at New College, Oxford. Her translation of Schrott’s Desert of Lop appeared in 2004 and a segment of The Sex of the Angels was commended in the inaugural translation competition of the ACF London (2017).

I graduated in physics and philosophy and I hold a PhD in physics. I love writing and I love science, so I decided to combine both. I work as a science journalist and author in a broad field: physical sciences, mathematics, computer science, neuroscience, and technology. My specialty is being an allrounder. That’s the great thing of working as a science journalist: if you are truly interested in some topic, you can report about it. I have written more than four hundred articles for various magazines and newspapers, eight books, and I have participated in more than two hundred radio programmes explaining science to a broad audience in the Netherlands. Science and travel are for me excellent ways to discover the world around us and even the world inside us. One of my mottos is that science is culture too. On this blog you can find a selection of my published articles.
My Volkskrant-weblog in Dutch about my 2008-trip to the Arctic. I have added some extra photo’s and a few film clips.
All anticipation is keener, be it of joy or pain, than the reality whereof it is a mental forecast; but that inactive waiting at Redmoat, for the blow which we knew full well to be pending exceeded in its nerve taxation, anything I hitherto had experienced.
Secret and malign forces throbbed about us; forces against which we had no armor. Dreadful as it was, I count it a mercy that the climax was reached so quickly. And it came suddenly enough; for there in that quiet Norfolk home we found ourselves at hand grips with one of the mysterious horrors which characterized the operations of Dr. Fu-Manchu. It was upon us before we realized it. There is no incidental music to the dramas of real life.

Their article: “At best, verbal explanations beyond ‘showing the work’ may be superfluous; at worst, they shortchange certain students and encumber the mathematics for everyone.”
I can see why The Atlantic would want to sharpen their writing for the headline. They qualify themselves twice in the article (“at best” and “may be”) barely making a claim.
So if they think symbols are always sufficient explanations, let’s offer questions in the comments for which they aren’t. If they think verbal explanations are sometimes necessary, let’s let them articulate when.
There’s a place in instruction (somewhere between ages 3 and 8) where each of the symbols “3” and “+” and “4” and “=” and “7” each need explanation, which might look like
I am pretty sure that Common Core haters dislike the notion that any of that ought to be explained, that they would prefer that this just be one of the 55 addition facts that ought to be memorized, and let’s move on.
At the same time, requiring 3rd or 4th graders to explain why 3 + 4 = 7 seems ridiculous, EVEN THOUGH SOME 3RD GRADERS HAVEN’T MASTERED ADDITION.
I would ask my 8th graders to explain why 3x + 4 != 7x, but I wouldn’t ask for this in a Calculus class, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN MASTERED BY ALL.
My point is that we use symbols for efficiency, to avoid explanation. Symbols are NEVER enough explanation at the beginning of instruction.
A student’s presence in a given class presumes a level of previous mastery and efficiency WHICH IS NOT ALWAYS THERE, and instruction examples demonstrate the level of explanation that is expected.
To Chester Draws about the quadratic, I would hope for words like “Quadratic => 0, 1, or 2 solutions” in an explanation.
So a really good question is “what level of explanation should students be expected to demonstrate on a national test? (all right, multi-state, but I am in favor of a national curriculum).
I'm Dan and this is my blog. I'm a former high school math teacher and current head of teaching at Desmos. More here.
1. I think it’s possible to fully explain the factorization of x2 + 5x + 6 into (x+3)(x+2) through symbols alone. I don’t think a verbal explanation adds much, if anything.
2. The Pool Border Problem is impossible to fully explain through symbols alone. There are too many possible equivalent expressions for the number of tiles in the pool border. And a full explanation requires the student to map the coefficients and operations in each expression to features of the pool border itself.
2. Additionally, any problem that asks a student to interpret an algebraic expression in context is really tough to answer using symbols. That’s its point.
I think the headline writer did their job, excising the namby-pamby qualifiers we all use to avoid over-committing ourselves into an unsustainable position, producing instead a strong statement the full article backs up well.
That full article does not knock the assessment value of requiring an explanation per se, it says that assessment is an needlessly higher bar than executing the right algorithm in the right circumstances.
The best way to learn something is to teach it, precisely because explaining something requires a deeper mastery than does executing it. It also requires mastery from a different field: rhetoric. This why a good math student is not always a good math teacher.
1. Many problems in calculus lend themselves to symbolic answers. There is enormous elegance to graphing a polynomial, noting its x-intercepts, relative extrema, and turning points using the language of calculus — doing so much more concisely than is possible with words. Consider graphing f(x)=x^3-3x^2 as an example.
A “find the missing data point” question, given a mean and an almost-complete data set, can be found and justified very well using notation that reflects the structure of the mean of a data set. That’s a favorite of mine from middle school. Consider “You want your average to be a 90%, and your scores on the first four tests are 81, 93, 88, and 88. Is it possible to reach an average of 90? With what score?” for an example.
2. The locker problem — http://mathforum.org/alejandre/frisbie/student.locker.html — is a great example of a problem that begs explanation. It gets at some great ideas , but using formal notation would obfuscate more than it would help, particular at the middle school level where this problem is accessible and worthwhile.
Another favorite of mine is this one: Would you rather get $0.01 one month, $0.02 the next month, $0.04 the next, and so on, doubling every month for 30 months, or get $10,000 the first month, $20,000 the next month, $30,000 the next, and so on, increasing by $10,000 every month for 30 months. The solution here is not trivial, even with some knowledge of exponential growth, and has an interesting human element beyond the purely mathematical comparison that begs explanation.
There is a large volume of research on the idea of a “group-worthy task” — a task that naturally elicits the kind of thinking and collaboration that makes group work worthwhile. The premise here is that group work supports learning when the group is needed for the work, and putting students in groups when the task isn’t conducive to group work is counterproductive. I wonder if we could put together a comparable framework for “explanation-worthy task”, with the same premise — explanations are valuable when they are necessary, and can get in the way when the task does not naturally elicit a worthwhile explanation.
First, I do think it is a good idea to ask for explanations. But not because they are a good way to check for understanding. Because they often are not.
Does a diagram count as mathematical notation in your eyes? If so, I believe mathematical notation is sufficient (and preferable) for the pool problem. Draw a square with a thin path around it. Split up into squares and/or rectangles. Label relevant lengths for a square of an arbitrary size (“97” x “97”) or use a variable like “x”. Color code the diagram & the equation to connect the coefficients in the equation with the parts of the path. Multiple diagrams, obviously, for the multiple answers.
And, continuing with my contrarian nature, I don’t think symbols are sufficient for the the factoring problem. Distributing/factoring could be the posture child for getting a correct answer without understanding. Perhaps I am wrong, but I think the typical explanation would be “because you do this time this and this times this …”.
I am really glad Dan got this conversation going. It is one of those arguments where a valid point was made in a sloppy way, but it led to this conversation, and lots of clarifying thoughts… so it is OK.
My take away from the article was that Smarter Balance and PARCC test makers need to take care in designing prompts that are “explanation-worthy tasks” to use the term coined nicely by Dylan in the comment above. And further, teachers need to do the same. Teachers need to be intentional about teaching when, why and how to explain work beyond a symbolic representation. Pretty much any profession that uses math will require these skills for legal reasons, team work reasons, institutional memory reason… and there are pedagogical benefits in the process too.
My students asked today why the volume of a pyramid is 1/3 that of the associated cylinder. Symbols alone, nor words alone would do the trick here without some pictures. It would amaze me if any good problem didn’t benefit from a mix of representations.
To me the factoring problem is an exercise, a symbolic exercise, which is why symbols suffice. The interesting thing is determing the terms, though. How did you determine (2x-9) and (3x+10)? There might be a story there. If there was just a symbolic record, that’s where students’ questions would most likely come.
I spend a lot of time in lessons trying to find what there is for students to discuss. Argue about if I’m lucky.
I thought about sixth grade content since that’s where my head is these days. Here’s my nomination for a task that requires some words. I imagine that someone might come back with an assertion that kids should just memorize a bunch of different area formulas and practice until they could use them correctly, and we wouldn’t have a very productive discussion. Then there are problems where the solver has to make some decisions about constraints, and it seems like explaining those decisions necessitates using some words. Many good modeling tasks have examples of this idea, but part (c) of this task is a straightforward example.
Here’s a problem whose solution I think could be communicated only with symbols, possibly including diagrams if a student wasn’t ready for an algebraic approach.
There’s also a discussion to be had over the differences between problems appropriate for instruction-only, assessment-only, and problems that could be used for both. The authors of the original article seem to take issue with how problems are posed on assessments, and the painful procedures they observed some teachers devising to train students to maximize their scores on those assessment items, and they don’t seem to understand that problems can be written for different purposes.
Thinking of all the Lockhart’s Lament-like analogies from math to other subjects, is there an analogous article for other disciplines? Would following the authors’ recommendations move math farther away from a student’s other experiences? If I were to, say, tutor a contestant of a spelling bee, I’d discern more from a couple discussions of their process than from a definitive list of words they can spell. With that in mind, maybe this whole conversation just differentiates that it’s easy to get good at something and it’s harder to be great.
One thing that might be more unique to math: if there isn’t a good answer to “Why do I have to explain?” then there are probably many students saying, “The teacher just doesn’t explain . . .”
Isn’t the pool question impossible to answer using symbols alone because it asks for an answer in terms of a pool.
The answer would follow as pure algebra and need no explanation unless you are asking for which properties of integers you are applying in any manipulations.
The algebra is also easily extended to rectangles with area A=a x b and 3d blocks with V = a x b x c or beyond into more dimensions.
Now perhaps you really want to talk about numbers of squares and not integers. But then you are working with a problem about square lattices. That is a problem in Z^2 to give it the accepted mathematical symbol.
That sort of question would generalize to non rectangular shapes on Z^2. Again to be precise about what you are asking accepted mathematical symbols would be a good language to use.
A. Explain your work – which could use mathematical symbols or the symbols of a spoken language that is pure math or pure math and a combination of any of the following:
Yes. I have seen a few wordless proofs of the pythagorean theorem. They are beautiful. So much information and meaning is given in a symbol.
Also, the question that the article linked to (show 5*3 as a repeated addition problem) can also be done using symbolic notation alone. Writing out 3+3+3+3+3 shows that there are five groups of 3.
In problems that rely heavily on context, I would say that symbolic notation cannot be sufficient. Why? I recently read a study that asked students to think of a real world context for a given mathematical procedure. Overwhelmingly, the stories created relied on a “three component structure”: their stories gave a set up, then some necessary (and maybe some unneccesary information), and then posed a question. In essence, they have learned that “context” means write a word problem as they have seen it in textbooks.
In my personal opinion, it seems like we should go for the least explanation necessary to illustrate a concept. This is something that many mathematicians do certainly agree on, but “explanation” is not created equal. Symbolic notation is sufficient when the symbols used carry meaning that can be understood by people trained in the discipline. In the examples in 1), the meanings are unambiguous. In 2), however, simply writing symbols offers no insight into what the question was asking.
This was a thought provoking question, and the article referenced was a good (though anger inducing :)) read.
I’m a physics teacher, and feel like a lot of my effort goes into helping students be able to apply math – not just to be able to solve problems in the text.
I wouldn’t bet that the student with correct but unexplained answers understands nothing, but I wouldn’t make any confident bets on exactly what that student understands either.
To build on this, I think of students’ wrong answers: without explanation it’s tough to figure out how much work you need to do. Nothing drives me more crazy in grading than a student listing an incorrect number for a problem with no work.
Beyond understanding how to assess learning, though, I think we need to talk about the fact that the skill of being able to talk about math in words is, in and of itself, an important skill. My wife does statistics for the state government, and every day she needs to have productive conversations about what she’s doing with people who aren’t trained in statistics. People who are using math in the world usually have to interact with people who are less trained in math than they are. And that requires language.
There are 300 students at a high school and 2/3 of the students are bilingual. How many students are bilingual?
If a student writes “300*2/3=600/3=200 students are bilingual”, this student would probably get the problem right and yay for showing work!
However, does it mean that the student understands what is going on? Let’s say that this was a homework problem and the student just learned about multiplying whole numbers with fractions at school that day, the student could be multiplying the numbers that he/she sees because that is the math concept that aligns with this hw problem. Does that mean the student understands why? Will that student be able to reproduce this in a different chapter? Who knows.
Except that we factorise in order to solve, eventually, and I would not regard solving as a “symbolic exercise”.

Have you heard of the Wicked Bible? Printed in London in 1631, it was meant to be a reprint of the King James Bible. But it had a tiny omission in the 10 Commandments. There was a "not" missing from Exodus 20:14, making it read: "Thou shalt commit adultery."
Oops. The king and the archbishop got pretty upset, and the Wicked Bible's publishers were fined and lost their printing licenses.
Typos and mistakes happen to the best of us. When reviewing something we have written, we see what we think is there, rather than what is actually there. We know we are talking about a “public announcement” rather than a “pubic announcement,” and so we miss the fact we have left out a crucial consonant.
These typos not such a big deal in blog posts or website copy, which can easily be changed. But there are times you can’t have a mistake marring an important company announcement or living forever in print, as the Wicked Bible's publishers learned.
If your organization doesn't have a proofreader and you can't hire one, there are ways to make your writing error-free. Here are some tricks I use.
Spellcheck? I can hear you ask. Yes, spellcheck. It’s built into word processors, yet I see enough typos on menus and flyers to know not everyone is using it. Take a few minutes to run spellcheck.
Don’t stop there, though. Spellcheck will not tell you that you wrote “desert” instead of “dessert”. After running your copy through spellcheck, do at least one of the following things.
This is a tried-and-true method for finding mistakes you wouldn’t if reading silently. Silent reading turns into silent skimming. We skip entire words and even paragraphs, because we think we know what is there.
Reading aloud forces you to go over each word. It also makes it obvious if certain sentences are awkward, which is a nice side benefit.
Get someone else, anyone else, to read it. If it’s really important, it shouldn’t go out without having had two sets of eyes review it. Get Janice from Accounting or the summer intern to look it over. If they know English well enough to find a “their” that should have been “there”, their eyes are better than no eyes.
Don’t have someone else to read it? Let Hemingway review it for you. The Hemingway App finds mistakes, assesses readability, and suggests ways to make writing clearer.
This is a trick much-loved by editors and writers. Start from the last sentence and read the piece backwards. This will force your brain to concentrate intensely (no skimming here!) and mistakes will pop out at you.
Don’t check something for errors immediately after writing it. If you can, wait a day or two so you can look at it with fresh eyes.
For important pieces of writing, build in time to return to the piece after you’ve had a break from looking at it. Writing something under pressure without any time to spare is a great way to overlook obvious mistakes.
If any names appear in what you’ve written, triple- or quadruple-check them. Misspelling a name is a serious mistake. Some journalism schools give a failing grade to any assignments where a name is misspelled.
You don’t want your CEO’s name to be incorrect. You also don’t want to misspell a name and accidentally refer to the wrong person.
My own name is a great example of this. Alison Smith, Allyson Smith, and Allison Smyth are people out there; they’re just not me. Misspelling my name is likely to not only annoy me, but also to confuse your audience.
Avoid a sentence like “Alison Smith was at there pubic announcement” or "Thou shall commit adultery" with these six tips. You’ll catch most of your typos, for clear, error-free writing.

Please share your experiences, successes, and failures in using non-drug therapies for RLS/WED (methods of relief that don't involve swallowing or injecting anything), including compression, heat, light, stretches, acupuncture, etc. Also under this heading, medical interventions that don't involve the administration of a medicine to the body (eg. varicose-vein operations, deep-brain stimulation). [This forum contains Topics started prior to 2009 that deal with Non-prescription Medicines, Supplements, & Diet.]
I am a longtime RLS sufferer with what my sleep doc (chief of clinical sleep neurology at a major teaching hospital) says is one of his most extreme cases. I was on Clonozepam for 16 years (that's not a typo), and tried DAs but had augmentation with both Pramipexole and Ropinerole. I am now on 400 mg of Lyrica along with 1 mg of Lorzaepam; this combination is yielding about 4-5 hours of inefficient sleep per night. I also tried and failed as a subject in a study using the SENSUS device. Now my doc is recommending that I buy a sequential compression device for my legs and feet. I previously bought lymphadema bags on eBay but they didn't help me; my doc would like something that wraps around my ankles and feet (the bags were not compressed to the feet). Am wondering whether anyone has a recommendation. I've seen a lot of products online (Kendell, ArtAssist) but my doc doesn't know one from the other. Note that SENSUS provide electrical impulses which is different from sequential compression (most if not all of you know this already). Thanks!!
I haven't tried any of these but hopefully you will hear soon from someone who is familiar with their use.
In the meantime, referring to compression, brought to my mind the simple use of ACE bandages. Some members have at times used these to give compression and some element of relief My own feeling is that if ACE banadages worked very well we'd all be wearing them, but who knows, they could be worth a try at little cost.... and could be wrapped as tighly as wished. Compression stockings have also been discussed.
Opinions presented by Discussion Board Moderators are personal in nature and do not, in any way, represent the opinion of the RLS Foundation
There is so little evidence here about these devices. The only study I'm familiar with definitely showed improvements for most participants. These machines are often expensive and you have to wear the device up to an hour before bed. For many of us, that makes it hard to incorporate into our lives - so if other methods work, we tend not to try this. And, I'm not sure how you use it if you have symptoms that last many hours a day.
I think Polar Bear's idea may be a good one - at least try something like surgical quality stockings and see what happens. For many of us, it either works great or doesn't help at all. If it helps - even a bit - then you'd know trying one of these devices would be a good thing.
Opinions presented by Discussion Board Moderators are personal in nature and do not, in any way, represent the opinion of the RLS Foundation, and are not medical advice.
I'd love to try some of those, but the cost is prohibitive. If I was SURE it would work, on the other hand, I;d go for it. But definitely it would have to go around the foot and ankle.
I am a volunteer moderator. My posts are not medical advice. My posts do not reflect RLS Foundation opinion.
I don't know, Beth. I just remember reading that you treat yourself before bed, then go to sleep. They are long - cover the body from foot to top of thigh - looks like something I'd want off .
I've been suffering from RLS for decades, and it plagues me at least a few times a week. About 6 years ago, I read about an expensive compression device. It made sense to me, as I saw a possible connection between that theory and how itch "signals" to the brain can be stopped by scratching NEAR--not ON--the affected area. Anyway, I thought I might get a similar response using ACE BANDAGES-- and they WORKED! SERIOUSLY! I do have to wrap up (from my foot to my knee) ASAP, after the first tingling starts, to get the BEST results. If I put it off, it ends up taking longer or I have to wrap tighter. But, ACE bandages have worked so well for me, for the last 5-6 years, that I very rarely need to take my Clonazepam! I don't think I've needed to take it more than a few times (total) in the last YEAR! Now my husband thinks I should try compression socks, but I haven't gotten around to trying them yet.
I've used both compression socks and tensor bandages, but they are just nowhere near enough, and if I make them tight enough to help significantly, they cut off the circulation
It's great - beyond great - that the bandages are still working for you. You might like the socks. The socks come in different grades from high to low compression.
What I'd really love to do is create a set of questions for all of us - so that we could possibly identify who is helped by what. Beth and I are very similar re. how our bodies respond to treatments and how we experience symptoms. The compression bandages and Ace bandages have never worked for me, either, but they clearly work for a sizable minority of people.
As Beth noted, definitely try the compression stockings. They come in different lengths, too. Years ago, a chiropractor would stop by every year and post about how these stockings were still working for him. He used them for years. It's definitely something worth trying for everyone.
As far as I know, there are 2 studies showing the effectiveness of SCDs for RLS. Here is a link to the first one, which is a small study (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ar ... 000000.pdf). The following study did something similar, but with more research participants (it's behind a pay wall...sorry). Things that stand out to me: 1. they used an Aircast system, though it looks like they just chose that because that was the machine that they had access to. 2. The people in the study had to use the SCD before bed for an hour, but using it during sleep was "not proscribed", which means they could sleep while using it if they wanted to. So it might be nice to pick a model you think you could use while going to sleep 3. The system they used had a knee length legging, but they don't say why they made that choice. I know knee length is much more common, so maybe that's just what they had to work with.
For me, I've been looking into which systems might be best. The Kendall is nice in that the leggings look comfortable, and it monitors the rate at which your blood vessels refill, so it can maximize the rate at which it compresses and releases (ranging from every 20 seconds to every minute, I think). In the research cited above, they chose 1 compression every minute, but it might be nice to have a faster rate as long as it doesn't hamper your circulation. Sadly, it doesn't seem to let you choose how fast it goes, or how strong the compression is, so you have to hope that the automatic settings are appropriate for your RLS. I think the Aircast is more programmable, but I'm looking into that right now, so I'm not certain.
To ViewsAskew: I was thinking it could be smart to make a survey asking people about how they experience their symptoms, what has worked for them, and maybe some other factors (e.g. family history of RLS, biological sex, age of onset). There is an analysis called Cluster Analysis that might be able to tell from that data if there are distinct types of RLS, kind of like we are now learning that there are multiple disorders that all get lumped together as schizophrenia. I know how to make web surveys and analyze data, but do you have thoughts on the practical side of how to get something like this running?
As for compression stockings, about 10 years ago I got a pair when I had surgery. In the hospital they used a compression device and that was fine, soothing in fact. A few months later I wore them onto an airplane for a long flight. The plane hadn't even taken off and I was getting rid of the stockings which was pretty tricky while strapped into my seat. I absolutely hated them but if they do work for anyone—great. It seems that RLS people fall into two opposite camps with these, as with a lot of things.
Quick update: I rented the Kendall 7325 SCD with a knee-length legging (my symptoms are in both the upper and lower leg) but didn't find it to be particularly helpful. I tried using it for an hour before bed some nights, and also using it while going to sleep other nights, and neither reduced my symptoms nearly as much as just a long session of stretching or using a percussive massager. Going to sleep while using the device was a challenge in itself.
I went through a company called the Medcom Group. I paid $325 for a 1 month rental, and after a bit of a discussion about price, they said they would have been willing to apply half of that money towards a full purchase, which cost about $600 for a refurbished model. If you want to give it a try, your doctor will have to send them a prescription.
RLS/WED occurs more frequently in certain populations, including people with end-stage renal disease, women during pregnancy, and people with iron deficiency. Also, RLS/WED in the elderly and children brings other challenges. Sharing your experiences may be extraordinarily helpful to others.
badnights wrote: Actually, it's been brutal. I was to go visit my parents on Monday (tomorrow!). When it first happened, during the scream I was already feeling the bitter disappointment that I wouldn't be playing the game (it happened during warm-up! My own teammate stepped on the outside of my knee joint while running at the net. Right on the joint, not near it, on it) Then I realized, as I watched the game from the bench, that I probably couldn't play for the rest of the broomball season, which ends in February. Then after I saw the doctor at Emerg on Monday morning, I learned I would also miss the rest of hockey season, which goes til April.
You are having surgery, will miss the rest of season & your trip to see your parents, and happened by a teammate! Terrible news.
I hope you have a speedy recovery with no additional WED problems. I have had surgeries where the additional meds actually helped WED, I hope it will be the same for you.
thanks everyone for the advice and good wishes! I have seen Mr. Knee God here in Edmonton and have even worse news in a way - or better - not sure how to think of it. Worse, in terms of my life, for the same reason you have, Steve: both ligaments are indeed torn, but the MCL will be left to heal on its own (with careful and abundant PT) which will take 3-4 months. I cannot have the ACL surgery until the MCL is healed. I didn't really understand why, I was too shocked to comprehend. I shouldn't have been, I guess. I shouldn't have expected anything, then I would not be shockable.
So the soonest I could have ACL surgery would be this spring, but then I would miss my fieldwork season; if it was in the fall, I would miss almost an entire season of hockey. I can't tell which is worse; but the choice is probably not mine anyway, it will depend on the availability of surgeons. My sister skated for 3 years with a brace and no ACL, but she says it wasn't very stable. Not liking the sound of that. Sigh.
On the bright side, my daughter probably gets great results from almost anything and would be a terrific subject for a placebo trial Meanwhile I slathered on the Traumeel for my basal joint arthritis the other night, and finally got to sleep only after I went for the Bio-Freeze. Menthol trumps arnica I reckon. Now I can try it out on my coccyx which I cracked falling on ice. It's sore enough for me to feel even more empathy for your inactivity -- but doesn't come close to what you're putting up with. Keeping you in my thoughts!
I'm doing OK, in most respects, but only because I don't let myself think too much, and I signed up for a 21-day yoga thing. The sudden cessation of 5 nights a week of sports had me flirting with depression, so I have to do something. I will sign up with a gym when the yoga is over. Meanwhile I am taking 21 yoga classes in 21 days, and there's a diet to follow as well. I couldn't do it if I was working, the timing is all wrong, and the shopping and food prep take a lot of time; but I had holidays anyway from the trip I had to cancel to get my knee checked out, so I am spending them in Yellowknife. Wondering why I still feel as if I can't get everything done in the day.
I decided to use the yoga diet as an opportunity to go wheat and wheat-gluten free, but it turns out my oatmeal "may contain wheat". Does that mean I am not gluten free?
Also I think next week is supposed to be juices only. I don't think that's the best thing I could do for my knee at this point in its recovery. I think it needs all the nutrients it can get. I have been worried about going meat free, but figured I was doing OK with the beans and other protein sources. But this juice-only thing, that might leave my ligaments without something they need to heal?
I am a bit freaking out because of a discrepancy between what the Edmonton surgeon said to me in person and what he wrote on a note. He said that I should be re-assessed in 2-3 months when the MCL had healed, at which point they would decide if I was a candidate for ACL surgery (!! I thought it was a given! I'm a candidate! I want an ACL!) But in the note he gave me, it says f/u 6/12 which I found out meant follow up in 6 months. That would place it in August, AFTER my field season, but I really need to see someone before then to confirm that I can go in the field without an ACL. etc. So I am trying to get hold of him to clear that up. I don't even know if it will be him who sees me or if his job is done and he's sending my file (so to speak) back to Yellowknife. So confusing.
The only reason I was sent to Edmonton was that the guy here thought I might have some kind of complicated tear that would need surgery within 3 weeks, but the guy down there says I don't. So I missed my trip to my parents just to find that out. I had to do it, but still. It would feel like a more worth-while sacrifice if I had actually needed immediate surgery.
Per the oats, studies show they are often contaminated with as few as 5 parts per million to as many as several hundred parts per million. It varies batch to batch. So, you could be gluten free...or might not.
Um, though this isn't exactly related, I have chondramalacia and have yet to find a good solution. But, there is a guy in a chondramalacia group I'm in who's done a LOT of research about knees and how they heal. I can't think of his name, but I remember him saying some things that were at odds with what most doctors say about regeneration of tissue and how knees and knee components heal. Just like with WED, most docs are going to be behind and not up on the latest - research says an average of 15 years behind. Not sure how that might affect you....
I can see why you'd be upset about what the doc said vs wrote and how it affects your work this summer. And, how going to see this guy totally messed up your plans to see your parents when it didn't really end up mattering. Life isn't fair, is it?
Not know exactly what is going to happen, and when, or hearing conflicting versions leaves us in a limbo which in turn runs out in ripples and effects our whole circle, both social and working.
And then on top of that you are limited physically - good luck with your 21/yoga, I hope you find it beneficial.

The Office of Multicultural Enrichment released a new logo to encourage students of all cultures to become a part of its many programs.
“The whole goal was to make OME more noticeable and make people more knowledgeable about the work that we do,” he said.
Martin said he hopes that by putting the logo on groups connected with OME, such as Shades, Sanctify and Sophisticats, more students will find interest.
The logo was designed by Jeremy Robinson (’13), Graphic Design major, who also designed a logo for Macy’s Department Store.
Keri Gray, graduate student and communication intern for OME this past summer, said the office’s hopes for the logo was to increase visibility to students who would not normally identify with OME’s work.
“That reaches to any student, whether they racially identify or ethnically or culturally identify in that type of way or they just have a curiosity of different cultures but they’re not sure of how to get involved,” Gray said. “We want to reach out to those type of students.”
Gray said that much thought was put into designing the logo and one important feature is the symbolism of the sidewalk that cuts down the middle of the logo.
“When I think of the office I think of them being a place that walk alongside students,” she said. “It creates an intentional pathway for them to lead to their dreams.”
After being advertised all summer, the logo was released on the organization’s Facebook and Twitter pages on the first day of school, alongside the designated hashtag: #OMEunleased.
OME has a series of events planned to help students see OME’s new image, including Sundaes on Mondays, multicultural chapels on Thursdays and auditions for the organizations many groups.
Gray said she is excited to help other students discover that diversity includes more than just minorities.
“I want people to know that diversity exists in every person,” she said. “There’s something unique about every single person that should be broadcast.”

A full-blown meltdown ensued,

Electrocardiography and Vectrocardiography. | Annals of Internal Medicine | American College of Physicians
For the beginning student in electrocardiography this new fourth edition offers a rather brief, but sound, foundation for interpretation and understanding of basic electrocardiography. Although the number of illustrations is limited, they are clearly presented. The legends are extremely lucid for interpretation. A great deal of the theoretical considerations have been omitted, and consequently the material is quite understandable for the beginner in electrocardiography. Placing the vectorcardiograms back to back with the usual scaler electrocardiograms offers an interesting teaching approach. The choice of the cube system is perhaps unfortunate, and the author has probably neglected more recent references in the

Here is another post on Marxist Multiculturalism. In the video, I analyze, in a unique idiosyncratic way– by arguing from a Christian Gnostic perspective and linking The Frankfurt School with Chicago School NeoLiberalism.
Today’s society reflects the coming together of these two schools of thought. I call this the dialectic of The Pharisees and The Sadducees–today known also as economists!
I suggest that the Frankfurt School was and is a subconscious attempt at implementing the atheist version of the 1000 year communal millennial reign. I suggest that these atheists have ushered in a new God: one I call KA$H–which will be the subject of my next post. For now, though, it’s enough to say that the biggest ROFLMAO I have these days is when atheists declare themselves non-religious! I will attempt to argue that they are extraordinarily religious and practicing a covert form of Christendom; one installed by an alliance and cabal of Jewish people aligned with a cabal within Christendom. Someone has had a lot of fun with atheists!
I suggest early on that Christendom’s central message was inverted with the creation of the nation-state of Israel. Christian’s now cheer-lead for atheists while applauding the death of Muslim people. Christian Fascism by any other name.
This is a series of posts which explore how humans have been reduced to ‘wallets‘; that is to say, reduced to objects of exploitation via the processes of modernity, scientism, and scientism then transferred into the field of economics which ends as skewed Social Darwinism.
In modernity, this started with The Corporation whose sole purpose now seems like selling you every imaginable object, and in late post-modernity, via the processes of economic neoliberalism, these objects are now purchased via an enormous debt machine called credit. The purchasing of the objects have become a type of fetishism or religious like ‘idolism’. These corporations are now the front line method of how you’ve been reduced to ‘wallet’ status and objects now exploited for corporate profit. Their Wall St. advertising agencies have studied and spent enormous amounts of time and money coming to understand the human condition and how they can exploit it– not for good, but for their nefarious purposes. But they are by no means alone in enacting this method of control; they are merely the first front in the attempt to imprison you within The Amnesia Matrix…
Next in line in this charming web of deceit are The Central Bankers and their minions the global financiers. The Central Bankers, in the past 100-years, have set up a worldwide system of control called, Fiat Currency, and it is a debt machine pyramid scheme which has enriched them and enslaved most at the bottom of the pyramid. This topic will be my next post but for now, these players are central and explain how you’ve become objects of exploitation. For now, it is enough to say their system was enacted via stealth and coercion.
Last, but not least, are the governments and their politicians, who’ve been bought by corporations and bankers to enact their will and marginalize the only means of address the citizenry has: the political arena. This process of buying the political system was done methodically with the razor-sharp calculation of the most cunning mafia ethos. The political system has devolved into non-stop lies and one of the main methods of obscuring the modes of operations of The Control State of the Unholy Trinity— hence the non-stop fake news and propaganda. Putin became a master at this type of endless conflicting propaganda and most governments now use the same mode of confusion via their shilling media outlets.
I’ve much more to say on this topic and my next series of posts will be on The Central Banking Pyramid Scheme and how the worship of money isn’t as material and secular as it seems.
Under the Turkish-Jihadist occupation, life is no longer possible in Afrin. The city has become a ghost town.
The Yazidis, who faced the horrors of genocide, described it shortly with the words: "We have witnessed treason with our own eyes". When they fled desperately to the mountain to escape the massacre, 12 riders of legendary Derwêşê Evdî came up to meet them
The PKK’s intervention in Shengal is geared towards building a new social system. It aims to create a free and political society.
When the 74th genocide arrived at the doors of the Yazidi community, it was not the physical genocide that dealt the deadly blow to the Yazidi people. What killed them was the betrayal that clad itself with a black garment.

"We believe that in the seventh year of the historic Freedom Revolution, the peoples of Rojava Kurdistan and Syria will enhance the struggle for a Democratic Syria and Free Kurdistan, and pave the way further for a Democratic Middle East Revolution."
The protests that began last week in many cities are triggering a new process in Iraq. However, it is difficult to predict where this process will lead to.
HPG commander Egîd Kelar stated that Turkey’s invasion attempt against Southern Kurdistan was multifaceted and also aimed to disconnect Southern and Eastern Kurdistan.
As in Turkey, a political campaign of annihilation is being waged against Kurds and their institutions in the Federal Republic of Germany.

Stamp hinges are available at every stamp store or through mail order catalogs. They were invented years ago so that collectors can affix their stamps to a page and peel it off years later with no damage to the stamp. However, be careful when using hinges so that you wet only the hinge and not the stamp. This happens when you use a lot of moisture on the hinge. Then you have licked the stamp to the album page. The best way to wet the hinge is to lick the tip of your finger and then touch the finger to the hinge. This prevents too much wetness on the hinge, but will still be plenty wet to attach the stamp firmly to the page.
A stamp mount works in much the same way as a hinge in keeping the stamp in the album but without damage to the back of the stamp. Mounts are actually small plastic sleeves to which stamps are inserted and then the mount is affixed to the page by wetting the glue on the back of the mount.
Tongs are similar to cosmetic tweezers, but without sharp edges that could damage the stamp. Do not use drugstore tweezers on your stamps! Stamp tongs are very inexpensive. The logic of the tongs is that your fingers may damage a valuable stamp, either with moisture or by pulling it when placing the stamp in the correct position.

Home and Away stars Amy Mathews and Jon Sivewright are to leave the soap later this year, it has been reported.
The pair, who play Summer Bay couple Rachel Armstrong and Tony Holden, are expected to bow out on screen in the middle of the year.
A show source told Australian magazine TV Week: "Amy Mathews is definitely going in a few months' time. Then, with Amy's character Rachel out of the picture, it was decided Tony should go with her, so Jon Sivewright is leaving too."
The news follows a number of recent high-profile Home and Away exits, including those of Lincoln Lewis (Geoff Campbell), Todd Lasance (Aden Jefferies) and Jodi Gordon (Martha MacKenzie).
However, a representative for Australia's Seven Network, which broadcasts Home and Away, insisted that viewers should not be concerned about the large number of recent cast departures.
Seven's Bevan Lee told fan site Back To The Bay: "There have indeed been a larger than usual number of characters being written out in the last few years, but the vast majority of those departures were brought about by the choices of the actors playing the roles.
"The fans can rest assured that no character is ever written out without the greatest of thought and consideration being given to the decision. They simply have to trust the creators of the show, trust their love for the show and accept that we would not make any choice we did not feel was for the best for Home and Away in the long run."

If you know me in real you can also send me message through Facebook etc. if you don't want to write here. I understand English, German and Finnish if you want to make your wish in your own language. The actual post will be in English if it includes text.
If there will be more than 24 wishes, I'll choose max. 1 wish from one reader and if there's still too much, I take the ones which I find most funny/interesting or which I just would like to draw! If there's very good ones still left after December, maybe I'll draw them later as extra, we'll see ;)
Wishes don't need to be christmas related but little winter-spirit would be nice since it's advent calender. Just post whatever you want and we'll see what will happen! :)

Sigi Schmid, the most successful soccer coach to come out of Southern California, won another trophy Tuesday night when the Seattle Sounders toppled the Columbus Crew in an all-MLS U.S. Open Cup final.
Gambian midfielder Sanna Nyassi scored both goals for Seattle, which repeated as Open Cup champion with a 2-1 victory in front of 31,311 fans at Qwest Field in Seattle. MLS clubs have won 14 of 15 titles in America’s oldest soccer competition, dating to 1916, since the league began in 1996.
The Sounders are the first back-to-back champions since New York’s Pancyprian Freedoms won in 1982 and 1983. Schmid (Torrance/Bishop Montgomery HS and UCLA) has won the tournament three times, also in 2001 with the Galaxy and last year.
“We talked about being special, being the first MLS team to repeat [as Open Cup champions], the first team in a long time to repeat, and the guys really took it to heart …,” Schmid said on the Fox Soccer Channel broadcast. “Luck was on our side, we were fortunate there, but we also worked hard and deserved it.”
Schmid’s Sounders are 3-0-2 against Columbus, the team he guided to the 2008 MLS Cup title, then bolted to take charge of Seattle when it made the jump last year from the second-tier USL Division 1 to MLS.
Nyassi scored in the 37th and 66th minutes after Kevin Burns gave the Crew a 24th-minute lead in a classy encounter featuring attacking soccer from both sides.
Burns finished four-pass sequence highlighted by Guillermo Barros Schelotto’s one-touch connection between Emmanuel Ekpo on the right flank and Frankie Hejduk (UCLA) in the box.
Nyassi scored the equalizer after Tyson Wahl (Newport Beach/Newport Harbor HS) sent in a cross that Crew goalkeeper Andy Gruenebaum punched out to Seattle midfielder Nathan Sturgis. Schelotto knocked it away from Sturgis to Nyassi, just inside the box, and he whirled and fired inside the right post.
Robbie Rogers (Huntington Beach and Palos Verdes/Mater Dei HS), just back from a knee injury, nearly pulled the Crew even near the end, striking the crossbar in the 85th minute.
The Sounders beat the Galaxy in the quarterfinals and Chivas USA in the semifinals en route to the title game.

What workout program do you do? It’s a question I’m asked at least once a week – in the gym, at a social event, from a reader, from a friend – and what they’re really trying to ask is “How do you look the way you do?” I usually try to satisfy their question with some version of lifting weights, doing sprints, or rowing. This generic response will usually suffice, and the person will likely…
Why don’t you have any food? This is a question I’m asked virtually every time someone is at my house. A quick peek in the fridge reveals some fruits and vegetables, grass-fed beef, and a jug of almond milk. A peek in the pantry reveals some rice, coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, RXBARs, and baby food. This is what our fridge and pantry look like every single week. It’s not because we don’t eat. It’s…

Yes, it was a tough weekend. Thanks to all that made it out. Thanks again for everybody's support and participation from both Todd (who makes it all happen behind the scenes) and myself.
It did rain off-and-on most Friday and Saturday. However, we were all troopers and persevered. Friday evening Potluck was great. Everybody turned in such GREAT submissions. I enjoyed EVERYTHING a bunch. Thanks to Dale and Tammy for letting us set up under their trailer awning and have some light. Thanks to Frank Padilla and others for supplying tables and other required setup hardware. Thanks to BBQ Joe Miles for cooking the Friday Tritip that Todd Eves contributed. Thanks Jim Sheridan for bringing your breakfast and Smoking trailer to also assist folks get the final things heated up and ready for dinner.
Sorry to all that had expected biscuits and gravy for breakfast! I woke up under-the-weather and was physically unable to literally do much of anything except lay in bead and go to the bathroom, the rest of my time there. I forced myself to get up, mingle, a bit, take pictures, and make the Dirty-Rice submission for dinner.
Anyway, it was a great event, I appreciate all that came out and participated, made it special and hope that next years will be even better yet. I will say that it is about every 10 years that we encounter weather that makes it tougher (like last weekend) and hope we are now due sun and heat at the next 10 Q-Fests. We have already reserved all the spaces so next year is already a go... AND, you all need to start making your plans!
Everybody that brought EZ-Ups, tables, & chairs for all to use !!! Especially thanks to Brent & Kim Walton for taking the bull-by-the-horns and playing a big part in getting the dinner buffet setup going. I was doing the Dirty Rice, behind the curve of feeling poorly, and greatly appreciated all who stepped up and helped. Especially Frank Padilla who helped with a lot of little and big stuff . We all thank Frank for bringing the yellow canopy that helped a bunch with dinner also (not to mention the magic act). Also, don't forget Todd who brought and setup his two 20' EZ-Ups.
And most especially to everybody I did not mention who assisted and contributed in their own special way that helped to make the event overall so enjoyable. Please forgive me for not mentioning more names but everybody in attendance saw and know who they were!
Yes, we are as we speak planning and making commitments and reservations for next year! We have to plan this far in advance to get the premium spots and day-parking availability at East Shore RV. Thus we reserve the dates a year in advance and plan early. If for some reason the CBBQA has a scheduling conflict with this day (heaven forbid) we will always turn it into an "independent-of-any-organization" BBQ Enthusiast Weekend Campout called a "BBQ Bivouac" which uses the same model as a Q-Fest as we have successfully done in years past.
Discussion of traditional "low & slow" BBQ and high heat Grilling using the following heat sources: charcoal, propane, natural gas and wood. Discuss all equipment, merchandise and outdoor cookin in general, hints, tips, tricks & techniques, success, failures etc.
Has anyone tried that Perfect Steak marinade that they have at canadian tire and bbq stores? What do you guys think of it? I am planning on doing my first brisket this weekend, and was going to marinade and inject the brisket with this. I heard its pretty good for steak, i was wondering what it would be like for a brisket
I found to be a bit salty for my tastes but everyone has their own preferences - fun to experiment for sure.
I have never tried it as I do not marinade steaks as I only eat strip loins which do not need marinating.
My suggestion for your first brisket is to keep it simple and worry about the cooking technique. This way as time goes on you have a basis to compare. I would keep it to a basic salt and pepper seasoning or a Montreal steak spice rub.
Mix well,pour the marinade over the brisket in a large pan and refrigerate, turning it often so both sides get marinated.
If you have a marinade injector, pump about one cup of the marinade into the brisket, spaced evenly.
gotta try that mate, anything with Guinness has to be good. Remember kids, Guinness is good for you.

***For the Holidays we are including the "How-To" Guide for free with all orders. This is a full install guide that will save the novice handyman up to $400 on install costs. (free 2 page assembly instructions still comes free with all mounts.) But for this week only, install like a pro.
The Super Flush Wall Mount is very universal and able to accommodate many Sizes and VESA patterns for TVs 32-60 inch. Without spacers, this mount can get practically flush, only 5/8" from the back of the tv to the wall. Locking Mechanism secures the tv to the wall mount. Dual "kickstands" help prop the bottom of the tv away from the wall for access to cables/power. Durable powdercoat black steel construction assures an easy and long lasting installation with up to 50-75% less cost than premium brand mounts.
Low Profile Mounts like this one are intended to minimize the clearence behind the tv. Please note where your cables connect to the tv and where the outlet is located to be sure the cables can clear that distance. For many tv's, we recommend you use a recessed wall outlet, and 90 degree connectors for your A/V cables.
Always choose a solid wall mount. We love this mount for it's solid, universal wall plate that easily connects to two studs and clearence as tight or tighter than most Slimline wall mounts. Since it connects to 2 studs, it is also more secure and easier to measure and mount than the Wire Hanger mounts provided by Samsung and Sony, all while being built with a similar design.
I've installed several tv mounts now by myself. This was by far the easiest. There's no way to level except to get your holes for the screws level. But once you have done that correctly, there is no adjustment needed. Of course, this mount doesn't articulate, it is just holds the tv super flush against the wall, exactly as first reviewer stated.
Tip: check the HDMI ports and if they stick straight out into the wall, before mounting, purchase and install 90 degree (or 270 degree if you need them to face the other way) HDMI adapters so that your tv sits flush against the wall.
This is so tight to the wall. It looks just like a picture on the wall. Exactly what we were looking for. Thanks

Lemon Grass (Cymbopogon citratus) is a tall growing perennial grass that is native to temperate to tropical regions, mostly in the Old World and in Oceania. There are 55 different species of Lemon Grass in the genus Cymbopogon, but we will concentrate on Cymbopogon citratus.
This species of Lemon Grass is a very common ingredient in Asian and Caribbean food. In Asia, it is used most commonly in Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian cuisine. As this herbs name may suggest, it has a citrus flavor. Some recipes call for fresh Lemon Grass, while others use the herb in a dried and powdered form. The outside of the stalk of the Lemon Grass plant is very hard, but the inner parts are soft and edible. The outside can be used as well, but has to be very finely sliced. Whole Lemon Grass can also be added to soups and stews once bruised, as the Lemon Grass releases oils into the mixture, adding flavor.
A history lesson with Arkansas’ kings of culinary reinvention, Louis Petit and Jim Keet, at their new(ish) west Little Rock bistro
Arkansas Life magazine digs deep into The Natural State each month, unearthing surprising stories and exposing readers to new facets of a familiar place. To put it simply, we’re naturally curious—and we’re proud, like you, to call this place home.
Kept spotlessly clean, the living room location permitted the homemaker to entertain guests without their getting far into the dwelling (where messes lurked). A home maker might comfortably engage in polite and interesting conversation, and make an impression on guests in the living room. That location, the most formal, coat-and-tie room in the house, exuded sophistication as well as cleanliness and it wordlessly identified the family as rising in social status (or it did not). But, housing changed in the U.S. in the 1970's when people wanted to express themselves, to have more choice, and they cared less about what guests thought of them.
Next, consider adding mirrors to the room to make it open up. By cleverly positioning them in the room, your living space will feel even larger.
Placing decorative plants and stands in corners enhances not only the living room, but also its furniture. Cleaning the living room furniture is very important to present a lively look to the furniture. So it is better to vacuum the sofas, carpets and curtains at least once a month. To enhance the look of the living room, you could also place matching paintings on the wall.
Fortunately, you don't have to start from scratch in order to make your living room a living entity. The furniture already placed in your living room, if seems ugly, can be refurbished or even re-arranged to give a brand new look to the room. Living room can be compartmentalized by some strategic measures that may include separation by cabinets, shelves or even clever flooring and different paint patterns for the walls. The idea is to have optimum utilization of space in the living room.
Next, decide on a color to set the tone and mood you want to achieve in this space. Remember there are shades and hues of every color; find the one that best suits you and your family, and your plan. You need only to determine what you want this room to feel like before selecting your color.

We met at the venerable Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, where, over fifty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King met with Jewish leaders to develop strategies for the civil rights movement. About 40 of us were crammed into a small basement auditorium around long, thin tables—half of us Evangelical leaders from various churches, organizations and institutions and half of us Jewish leaders from various synagogues, organizations and institutions. The Jewish leaders were Orthodox, Conservative, Reformed and Reconstructionist. The Evangelicals also came from across the spectrum—Baptist, Charismatic, Anglican, and, of course, Evangelical Covenant, among others. The Jewish community has been meeting for years with leaders from mainline and Roman Catholic Churches, but this was only the second meeting of the type with Evangelicals. Over two days we considered how we might have civil but frank conversations. We explored the response of the Christian church to the foundation of the state of Israel. We explored our common commitment to social justice and our common struggle to come to terms with Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians.
Some of us had been in conversations with Jews for a number of years. I have met regularly with a Modern Orthodox Rabbi to study scripture and discuss the challenges faced by the Jewish community in the United States and Israel. For many this was a new conversation—and a fascinating one. What did we learn?
1. For the vast majority of Jews the distinction is not Zionist or Anti-Zionist, but Hawkish or Dovish. Even the most liberal Jews support Israel and value it as a place for the Jews to preserve their culture, faith and community. One leader suggested Zionism was a “cardinal tenet” of Judaism. All Jews long for peace and justice for the Jews in Israel. But they differ on how these goals might be accomplished. One Orthodox leader said that although Israel would not be fully realized until Messiah came, “It is better to wait for Messiah in Tel Aviv than Warsaw.”
2. Although much of the world looks at Israel as powerful and dominant, neither American Jews nor the Jews in Israel feel powerful. They feel fragile and threatened. Even the most liberal are discouraged. One person said, “We got out of Gaza and got rockets in return.” They feel like the rest of the world wants them to lie supine in the face of violence and aggression. They were attacked for setting up buffer zones and so they backed away from them. They were vilified for the incursion into the Gaza to halt the rocket attacks. So they set up blockades and check points, perhaps the least violent, if still distasteful, alternative to stop the rockets and other weapons from being brought to Hamas—and there were still howls of protest. What are their options to keep their homes from being shelled and their citizens from being blown up on buses and in cafes? Giving “land for peace” hasn’t really worked so far. Why would they trust their opponents to stop the rockets and suicide bombings if they eliminated the blockade and checkpoints and tore down the wall? There is little evidence to suggest the extremists among the Palestinians would restrain themselves. What would the world have them to do?
3. Nevertheless, every Jewish leader was distressed and frustrated over the suffering of the Palestinians, both Muslim and Christian. Many were unhappy with the heavy handedness of the Israeli government. At the same time they wondered where were their conversation partners? Who was willing in this difficult climate to really work with them to find peace? Many worried that the opportunity for a two-state solution was slipping away.
4. Most of them understood that Christians lived with an obligation to share their faith. But they refused to be in communication with any group that specifically targeted Jews. They were especially distressed by groups like Jews for Jesus, whom they thought were trying to redefine what a Jew was. One rabbi said, if a Jew becomes of Christian we are sad, but such things happen. But we do not like the deception of saying you can be a Jew and a Christian at the same time. Some Evangelical leaders found this difficult to grasp. I suggested that perhaps it was right that we let the Jewish community decide who was and was not a Jew.
5. The Jews have a rich history of social justice concerns, but some in the room felt that of late the word “justice” was being used as a club against them. Why, they wondered, was it peace and safety for Israel and peace and justice for the Palestinians? Didn’t the Israelis deserve justice as well? They were particularly concerned about the nearly universal hostility of the liberal mainline church to Israel. In some cases they thought the line was crossed from appropriate criticism to anti-Semitism. They had no trouble with criticisms of the actions of the government of Israel. They insisted that criticizing the government of Israel is a spectator sport among Jews in the United States and Israel. But for many Jews in this country it has become difficult to raise criticism when they sense the state is always, and often unfairly, under attack. They feel the positive things done by the state of Israel are chronically under reported and generally ignored.
It was a fascinating, provocative, and at times passionate conversation. I think we all had a sense of camaraderie and even common purpose. We all want Israel and the Palestinians to live in peace and safety and with justice. Many of the Evangelicals were involved in ministries to build bridges between the two groups. We also all wanted healthy and positive relationships between Jews and Evangelicals. We want to be able to call each other when there was a difficulty, question, or opportunity for collaboration. I think we also found common ground as believers in God who take our faith commitments very seriously. These conversations are important and will continue. I hope to be a part of them for years to come.
How wonderful, Dr. Phelah, that you can be a part of this discussion. I am glad Evangelicals are now part of this discussion. Thanks for detailing their concerns.
One year I had the privilege of teaching English subjects in an Orthodox Yeshivah in Miami Beach, Florida and was so impressed with the education in that Yeshivah and then in the homes of the Lubavichers. In the morning I taught first grade girls, who were already reading Hebrew, to read English. In the afternoon I taught second grade boys. Half a day those girls and boys had religious instruction--but only with their Rabbis. One summer I was an art coordinator for a Jewish day camp. It was such a privilege to observe their culture and exuberance.
Sometimes, however, it is hard to really get to know our Jewish neighbors, probably because of organizations such as Jews for Jesus and Messianic Synagogues. We have such a bad press with them or is it we are afraid to maintain contacts?
Thank you for this summary of such an important meeting. Not surprising that Isreal and Zionism was upfront in this conversation. It does occur to me though how strange it is that such dialogs between Evangelical and Jewish leaders haven't really taken place given that so many Evangelicals are very pro-Isreal (though perhaps for dubious theological reasons that would be unpalatable to Jewish dialog partners).
I am in conversation with members of an Arabic speaking church and know some activists who work in Palestine, and the contrast between what I hear and know in terms of the ground from the Palestinian perspective seems irreconcilable with the perspective of the Jewish perspective you presented here. It seems we have the situation you describe in a previous post of how we talk past each other and don't really listen on hot button topics.
I struggle with how to listen to both and to take seriously that some of this isn't just perspective or difference of opinion but actual suffering. Don't want to minimize the suffering and tragedy of rockets launched, or the devastation of suicide bomber and other attacks on Israel, but is really the suffering commensurate? The numbers of dead would indicate that the effect of this conflict largely falls on the Palestinians. Sure Israel is not in a secure position, but it has a state of the art modern military, it has soldiers occupying the West Bank. Palestinians do not have an analogous presence in Israel. Palestinian armed soldiers are not systematically destroying Israeli homes. Palestinian settlers are not setting up compound in Israel and then attacking on a regular basis those in the Isreali village near by.
On some level perhaps Hamas and the PA may have allies and support in the Arab world as Israel has support from the U.S. but is that really an equal and commensurate reality internationally? I don't think so, Israel's Alie is the most powerful nation (at the moment). but my point is that it seems to me on the ground the average Palestinian has no security, while most Isreali's may live in fear and anxiety but their daily lives on the ground aren't facing regular harassment from settlers and an occupying army.
This is relevant when talking about dialog because I want to listen and hear and accept the Jewish and Isreali perspective and yet, the actions not only of its government but its occupying army in the West Bank as well as the tolerance and support of vigilante violence by the settlers, are simply unjust, there is no way to justify the reports on the ground of those who live in the West Bank.
I don't know how to get beyond this impass, but it is unfortunate that I think Christian actions and attitudes I think perhaps keep us from asking difficult questions to both sides, and perhaps also as Americans we are to intertwined in the reasons the powers that be allowed and used Zionism for their own unjust ends in the first place. I wonder can dialog happen around this issue really?
While at the store yesterday picking up some Cling Wrap, I saw the Freezer paper and knew that it was time. I got the paper and today we got down to business to make this Palestine Is In My Heart t-shirt.
Create an image on your computer and print it out. Cut off a piece of freezer paper to fit the size of your image. Put the shiny side down, with a piece of carbon paper on top and then your image on top of that. Draw out your image with a pencil.
Place your freezer paper on the cutting board and with the Xacto, cut out your design. If your design is simple, you can use scissors, but since our map of Palestine had so many jagged edges on either side, we wanted to make sure we got all of them.
Place your piece of foam inside your tshirt. If you don’t have a large piece of foam, you can also use cardboard, or another piece of freezer paper. You just want to put something inside the t-shirt so that the paint doesn’t go through to the back. Place your freezer paper, shiny side down, on your t-shirt and iron it flat. The shiny side of the freezer paper will adhere to the t-shirt.
When you start painting your fabric paint on the t-shirt, you want to make sure you paint from the outside of the paper inwards. This will give you crisp edges and the paint will not bleed under the freezer paper. We ended up putting two coats of paint on our t-shirt to really get the paint into the little crevices.
Let your paint dry and take off the freezer paper. It should just rip right off your t-shirt. Take an old towel or t-shirt, place it over your image and go over it with the iron. This will help set the paint. Your t-shirt is done so wear it with pride! When someone asks you what it means, start a conversation with them about the apartheid that is happening in Palestine.

Weather and climate models are required to calculate radiative fluxes and shortwave heating and longwave cooling rate profiles on a large scale. Heating and cooling rates describe the effect that different configurations of temperature, radiatively active gases, and clouds have on the rates of interlayer energy exchange and affect circulation patterns. Meanwhile, a suite of satellite-based instruments from the NASA Earth Observing System’s A-Train provide an unprecedented set of measurements that can be used to produce quantities that can also yield radiative fluxes and heating and cooling rates. This work explores the extent to which passive-infrared hyperspectral measurements such as those made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder impart information towards infrared cooling rates. Several novel methods are explored for interpreting and retrieving cooling rates using spectral measurements.
Several special topics relating to the transient flexural vibrations of a uniform beam predicted by the usual elementary or Bernoulli-Euler equation are discussed. The effect on the beam response of the concentration of an applied transient force in space and in time is studied. In the case of an applied step force, it is shown that the dynamic team response can be larger than twice the response to an equal force statically applied. It is demonstrated that the beam response in the higher modes is independent of the boundary conditions.
Swarm intelligence is a new research paradigm that offers novel approaches for studying and solving distributed problems using solutions inspired by social insects and other natural behaviors of vertebrates. In this thesis, we present methodologies for modeling artificial, mobile systems within the swarm intelligence framework. The proposed methodologies provide guidelines in the study and design of artificial swarm systems for the following two classes of experiments: distributed sensing and distributed manipulation.
The circuitries within the spinal cord are remarkably robust and plastic. Even in the absence of supraspinal control, such circuitries are capable of generating functional movements and changing their level of excitability based on a specific combination of properceptive inputs going into the spinal cord. This has led to an increase in locomotor training, such as Body Weight Support Treadmill training (BWST) for spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. However, today, little is known about the underlying physiological mechanisms responsible for the locomotor recovery achieved with this type of rehabilitative training, and the optimal rehabilitative strategy is still unknown.
Virtual ligand screening has proven to be a successful strategy in drug design. An in house-developed procedure (HierDock), a coarse grain docking method followed by a fine grain search procedure, was used to determine the binding site for sugars in the outer membrane protein A in E.coli, a key interaction in the pathogenesis of neonatal meningitis. These results are being further extended in suggesting possible peptide antagonists and drugs for therapeutic strategies.
Air pollution causes visibility reduction in urban areas such as Los Angeles as well as in national parks and wilderness areas. In this work, alternative mathematical models are formulated that relate air pollutant emissions or ambient air pollutant concentrations to visual range or to changes in the appearance of a scenic vista.
Over the past decade, rapid advances in microfluidics have led to the creation of valves, pumps, mixers, multiplexers, along with a large variety of other devices. This technology has allowed for many fluidics applications to be performed on a chip that is approximately an inch square in area. Such applications include cell sorting, PCR on chip, crystal growth, combinatorial mixing and many others. Although the complexity of these devices may seem overwhelming, they are based on simple process called multilayer soft lithography, which uses a silicone-based elastomer to create these amazing devices. However, with the current state of technology, the applications are somewhat limited. New devices need to be created to further such fields as fluidic logic and biomimetics.
Consider a number of moving points, where each point is attached to a joint of the human body and projected onto an image plane. Johannson showed that humans can effortlessly detect and recognize the presence of other humans from such displays. This is true even when some of the body points are missing (e.g. because of occlusion) and unrelated clutter points are added to the display. We are interested in replicating this ability in a machine.
We propose mathematical models to analyze two nervous system phenomena. The first is a model of the development and function of simple cell receptive fields in mammalian primary visual cortex. The model assumes that images are composed of combinations of a limited set of specific visual features and that the goal of simple cells is to detect the presence or absence of these features. Based on a presumed statistical character of images and their visual features, the model uses a constrained Hebbian learning rule to discover the structure of the features, and thus the appropriate response properties of simple cells, by training on a database of photographs. The response properties of the model simple cells agree qualitatively with neurophysiological observation.
Nervous systems process information about the environment in order to generate adaptive behavior. Sensory information that is obtained through different modalities, gleaned from different interactions of the animal with its surroundings, generated by different neural algorithms, or used to infer different distal stimulus properties, is often processed by distinct pathways in the brain. The auditory system compares sounds at the two ears in order to derive the location of the source. In the barn owl, Tyto alba, this is accomplished by interaural comparisons of the time that a sound reaches each ear, and of the level (intensity) at each ear. Interaural time differences code for horizontal positions of sound sources while interaural level differences, due to a vertical asymmetry in the owl's ears, can encode the vertical position of a sound. These two cues together can assign unique locations to sound sources in space. The barn owl processes time- and level differences in separate neural channels that converge in the inferior colliculus. This structure is the first site of neurons with spatially restricted auditory receptive fields, and with a neural map of auditory space. Downstream projections from here provide the sensory input for accurate sound localization by saccadic head movements.
Blood flow effects on heart development and a minimally invasive technique for in vivo flow alterations
A series of experiments were conducted on zebrafish (Danio rerio) in order to gain a better understanding of how blood flow and blood flow related forces, such as shear stress, affect vertebrate heart development. Zebrafish were used as a model due to their external fertilization and optical accessibility to the heart and vasculature. The flow field inside the 4.5 day post fertilization (dpf) embryo was analyzed using a combination of manual particle tracking and digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) software. Our results present the first case of intracardiac microscale DPIV. Additionally, a minimally invasive and reversible technique of delivering and localizing magnetic microspheres inside the vasculature of the embryo was developed. The results of blocked flow induced with this method were compared with previous experiments and controls.
During development an organism undergoes many rounds of pattern formation, generating ever greater complexity with each ensuing round of cell division and specification. The instructions for executing this process are encoded in the DNA, in cis-regulatory modules that direct the expression of developmental transcription factors and signaling molecules.
Redistricting is always political, increasingly controversial, and often ugly. Politicians have always fought tooth-and-nail over district lines, while the courts, for most of their history, considered the subject a thicket too political even to enter.
Edward Lewis and radioactive fallout: the impact of Caltech biologists on the debate over nuclear weapons testing in
The work of Caltech biologists, particularly, Edward Lewis, on leukemia and ionizing radiation transformed the public debate over nuclear weapons testing. The United States began testing hydrogen bombs in 1952, sending radioactive fallout around the globe. Earlier more localized fallout was generated starting in 1945 from tests of atomic weapons at Nevada test sites. The Atomic Energy Commission claimed the tests would not harm human health.
Spatially uniform ground motion is an assumption that has often been made for structural analysis of arch dams. However, it has been recognized for many years that the ground motion in a canyon during an earthquake is amplified at the top of the canyon relative to the base. Pacoima Dam has been strongly shaken by the 1971 San Fernando earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The acceleration records from both of these events demonstrate the spatial non uniformity of the ground motion, but the amount and quality of the data made it difficult to study in detail. An opportunity to do so arose on January 13, 2001, when a relatively small magnitude 4.3 earthquake was recorded by an upgraded accelerometer array at Pacoima Dam.
Steric and electrostatic repulsions in the inhibition of alpha-chymotrypsin catalysed hydrolyses by indole derivat
The enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants, i.e., [...], were evaluated for the six isomeric pairs of C-substituted indolecarboxylate ions and carboxamides. The variation of [...] with the position and nature of the substituent indicates that the enzyme-indole complex exhibits a high degree of steric hindrance near the 4 position of the indole ring and electrostatic repulsion due to a negative group near the indole nitrogen.
We present the unification of many previously disparate results in noisy quantum Shannon theory and the unification of all of noiseless quantum Shannon theory. More specifically we deal here with bipartite, unidirectional, and memoryless quantum Shannon theory. We find all the optimal protocols and quantify the relationship between the resources used, both for the one-shot and for the ensemble case, for what is arguably the most fundamental task in quantum information theory: sharing entangled states between a sender and a receiver. We find that all of these protocols are derived from our one-shot superdense coding protocol and relate nicely to each other. We then move on to noisy quantum information theory and give a simple, direct proof of the "mother" protocol, or rather her generalization to the Fully Quantum Slepian-Wolf protocol(FQSW). FQSW simultaneously accomplishes two goals: quantum communication-assisted entanglement distillation, and state transfer from the sender to the receiver. As a result, in addition to her other "children," the mother protocol generates the state merging primitive of Horodecki, Oppenheim, and Winter as well as a new class of distributed compression protocols for correlated quantum sources, which are optimal for sources described by separable density operators. Moreover, the mother protocol described here is easily transformed into the so-called "father" protocol, demonstrating that the division of single-sender/single-receiver protocols into two families was unnecessary: all protocols in the family are children of the mother.
Homeomorphisms of the plane onto itself are studied, subject to the restriction that they should preserve the sense of orientation and have no fixed points. The author tries to determine which mappings in this general class can be embedded in one-parameter subgroups of the full homeomorphism group of the plane. Such subgroups are called flows.
Air pollution at the single-particle level: integrating atmospheric measurements with mathematical models
Particulate air pollution is of growing concern in the United States and around the world. Elevated concentrations of aerosols (solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in air) are correlated with increased cases of lung cancer, cardiopulmonary disorders, and human mortality. A detailed understanding of the size, chemical composition, and concentration of atmospheric particles is needed to assess their effects on human health, as well as on regional visibility and global climate. One can acquire such knowledge through direct measurements, or by utilizing mathematical air quality models. New and innovative instruments allow us to measure the size and composition of individual particles, rather than to infer aerosol chemical properties from bulk particulate matter samples. Concurrently, air quality models have been developed to numerically simulate the emissions of discrete particles, and their transport and chemical evolution in the atmosphere. This thesis focuses on how to integrate and compare measurements taken by state-of-the-science single-particle instruments with the air pollutant properties calculated using state-of-the-science mathematical models. A 1996 field experiment conducted in the Los Angeles air basin serves as the case study for this thesis research.
An experimental and theoretical investigation on a series of three centrifugal pump impellers has been made in order to determine the usefulness and validity of tyro-dimensional potential theory for the description of the flow. Computed values of the developed head and distribution of pressure on the vane surfaces are compared with measurements an two-, four-, and six- bladed impellers which have 30[degree] logarithmic spiral vanes and a radius ratio of about one-half.
This thesis describes a mathematical theory that interrelates the basic concepts of complexity, cost, information and reliability. The accessibility of information, as opposed to its availability, is characterized. Universal bounds for complexity distribution, implementation cost and decision reliability are estimated. These bounds give rise to a methodology for any consistent definition of a complexity measure. The basic notions of pattern recognition and information theory are directly related to computational complexity.
Due to the fact that perchloric acid resembles sulfuric acid in many respects without having many of the disadvantages of use possessed by the latter, the devising of a cheaper means of producing it would be well warranted by its increased use in both analytical and industrial work. The present work was undertaken with the above idea in view and consisted in studying quantitatively the reaction taking place between nitric oxide (NO), nitric acid, and ammonium perchlorate.
This study has increased the viability of miniature ion thruster technology, advanced state-of-the-art discharge modeling, and revealed important aspects of discharge plasma processes. These extensions of existing ion thruster technology and understanding are necessary to fulfill the needs of future space missions. Experimental comparisons of the discharge performance of an array of miniature (3cm diameter) ion thruster discharge configurations were conducted and showed that a 3-ring configuration with length-to-diameter of 1.0 exhibited the best performance. A compact and lightweight version of this configuration, using small accelerator grid holes, exhibited discharge losses of 250-550eV/ion and propellant efficiency of as much as 87%. This performance represents a significant advancement in miniature (less than 5cm diameter) ion thruster technology and demonstrates that a miniature ion thruster of low magnet and thruster weight can yield desirable performance.
In the “faster, better, and cheaper” information age, rapid technological breakthroughs create significant risks of obsolescence at the product level or the component level. Consequently, enormous challenges in jointly coordinating inventory replenishment and technology selection arise. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop analytical models to study technology selection and inventory replenishment joint optimization in inventory systems that face frequent technology innovations.
The market demand for commercialization of Photovoltaic (PV) systems depends a lot on the reliability, efficiency and performance of various components within the system. PV panels produce DC power when exposed to sunlight, and an inverter converts this to AC power in a typical solar powered building. Though stand-alone PV lighting systems have existed for a long time it hasn’t been very efficient in the past. Incandescent light sources were commonly used with traditional PV lighting systems which are inefficient. Today, fluorescent fixtures are mostly used with PV’s due to its high efficacy.
Animation is a sequence of images that people perceive as a continuous movement. These images could be hand-drawn or computer generated. Computer animation starts with models of objects then generates from the models sequences of images. Computer animation is widely used in video games and special effects in films. It also has many applications outside of entertainment such as learning and training in virtual environment, education, and information visualization.
Accounting Ebooks: Individual Investor Reaction to the Earnings Expectations Path and its Components
The Securities and Exchange Commission and popular press have expressed concern that corporations guide analysts’ forecasts with the purpose of managing> earnings surprises and producing desired market reactions. Evidence suggests that firms that guide analysts’ forecasts downward during the period and then beat the latest forecast earn a market premium. Furthermore, alternative paths by which earnings expectations evolve over the reporting period are associated with differential valuation consequences. In an experiment, I explore potential explanations (rooted in judgment effects) for observed market reaction patterns to the earnings expectations path and its components. I conjecture that the presence of uncertainty affects investor reaction to the expectations path in predictable ways. I further examine how investors respond to analyst forecasts and forecast revisions in forming their own earnings expectations. I find that investors are more pessimistic than analysts in their earnings expectations. Further, the divergence between investors’ and analysts’ expectations plays an important role in their reaction. My finding of a premium to beating the latest forecast appears to stem directly from the difference between the investors’ own expectations and the analysts’ consensus forecast. Because investors tend to be more pessimistic than the analysts, they perceive a positive (negative) earnings surprise to be larger (smaller) than reported which explains why investors appear to reward positive earnings surprises more than they penalize negative earnings surprises.
This free ebooks is an experimental investigation of the mixing of the nozzle fluid of a round, turbulent jet with the entrained reservoir fluid, using laser-Rayleigh scattering methods. The measurements, at Reynolds numbers of 5,000 and 16,000, cover the axial range from 20 to 90 jet exit diameters and resolve the full range of temporal and spatial concentration scales. The measured mean and rms values of the concentration, and the mean scalar dissipation rate, when estimated from the time derivative of concentration, are consistent with jet similarity laws. Concentration fluctuation power spectra are found to be self-similar along rays emanating from the virtual origin of the jet, and are consistent with the universal form of scalar spectra proposed by Gibson (1968 II). The probability density functions for the concentration, the time derivative of concentration, and the square of the time derivative of concentration, are compiled and are also found to be self-similar along rays. Features of the measured distributions and spectra are consistent with the existence of large-scale structures within the flow that span the local diameter of the jet's turbulent cone. On the centerline of the jet, the scaled probability density function of jet gas concentration is found to be almost independent of the Reynolds number while the local mixing rate in the inner part of jet is not. The usual assumptions concerning isotropy and correlation of derivatives are found to lead to erroneous results for the probablility density function of the scalar dissipation rate.
The purpose of this research is to examine whether accounting methods for business combinations (purchase and pooling of interests accounting) have a different effect on firms’ market value of equity in the combination year and thereafter. In particular, after the accounting method is no longer disclosed in the financial statements, does it have an impact on market value of equity of the combined firms because the accounting figures are different? A five-year period subsequent to a particular business combination is used because public companies are not required to disclose the details of the combination for more than three years after the effective date of the combination. This research, thus, tests whether market participants still take into consideration the accounting method of past business combinations when this information is no longer disclosed in the financial statements. In addition to the testing of the impact of the accounting methods, the value-relevance of goodwill amortization is investigated.

Expert: Chinese every year because of water loss of 200 billion to 300 billion yuan – Beijing map: Sichuan Guangyuan a reservoir for flood contaminated tens of thousands of pounds of fish death Li Chunguo photo Beijing, September 25 Beijing Xinhua (reporter Zhang Ni) "Chinese every year because of water shortage caused economic losses of 300 billion yuan in 200 billion." 25, 2009, Yang Zhaofei, chairman of the China Association for the promotion of industrial environmental protection, said in Beijing, the current trend of domestic water shortage intensified, protect good water, poor governance, the task is imminent. 25, sponsored by the China Association for the construction of well-off "the Fourth National Symposium on water and national security" and "China’s Green Industry Development Forum" held in Beijing. More than one thousand related fields of politics, business, academic participants, on water pollution control, promote the healthy development of China’s environmental protection issues such as in-depth discussion. At the seminar, participants to Yang Chao introduced water resources per capita is such a set of data — China only the world level of 1/4; 70% of the city water supply shortage; 20% of the city of serious water shortage; every year due to lack of water caused economic losses of 300 billion yuan in 200 billion. "The distribution of water resources in our country is uneven, and the trend of water shortage is more serious." Yang Zhaofei analysts said, facing the current situation, protect good water, poor governance is imperative. And in this regard, the State Council last year issued the "water pollution prevention action plan" proposed a series of clear objectives, including by 2020, the Yangtze River, Pearl River, the Yellow River, Songhua River, Huaihe, Haihe River, Liaohe Basin (seven key water quality at or better than the class III) reached more than 70% of the proportion of the overall national groundwater quality is poor; the proportion of about 15% in the control. Study on the social development national development and Reform Commission Director Yang Yiyong at the forum said that with the expansion of population, per capita water consumption increased, water shortage is becoming more prominent. This problem will affect the social and economic development. As a water shortage country, China should be more in-depth research in the field of water conservation, water reuse. Yang Yiyong is in the same water state of Singapore as an example, said that the country in recent years, with particular emphasis on rainwater recycling, and strive to achieve "a drop of rain water does not flow away in vain", the basic realization of the independent of external water supply, so the experience is worth learning. "A lot of cities in the country on a rainy day to see the sea, then why not think of ways to keep these water?" Yang Yiyong believes that, in contrast, China’s lack of homework to do in this area, it should increase groundwater storage, the development of water reuse, anhydrous industry, desalination and other areas to invest more energy. At the same time, the government, enterprises and citizens should actively participate in building a new water security society. Water is a strategic resource, and national security, the future of mankind is closely related to the importance of water security should be raised to an unprecedented height." Yang Yiyong said.

Counter attack Chinese high iron 10 years Multiple Anti European exports to the United States – Supe replays.net
Counter attack Chinese high iron 10 years: Multiple Anti European exports to the United States – Super textbook Beijing "was a student, and now our European counterparts parallel technology, many places and beyond, and realize to catch up and overtake, we only spent 10 years." In 2016 September 20th, entered the Chinese country artisans (Mianyang) city of science and technology activities, these words come from China Changchun rail passenger Limited by Share Ltd Luo Zhaoqiang said, causing the audience bursts of applause. Small invention EMU debugging benefits Luo Zhaoqiang responsible, mainly for troubleshooting, to ensure the safety of EMU, plays a key role, therefore, this kind of workers is also regarded as the high iron workers in the "Panda", the practitioner does not exceed 2000 people. The name of the name of the national skills Master Studio Luo Zhaoqiang, it is high-speed rail EMU debugging ace". But in 2006, they were all students. Luo Zhaoqiang still remember 10 years ago in the face of foreign high iron products embarrassing scene: we carefully debugging, but encountered new problems, but did not dare to disassemble the product inspection, in high-speed rail, we a big gap." Only foreign experts to solve the problem. However, because the other side is too expensive and other reasons, forcing Luo Zhaoqiang and other workers continue to practice learning, trying to solve new problems. In this process, Luo Zhaoqiang found that Chinese workers are more innovative than European teachers. He often tells a story: EMU debugging, the passenger seat socket wires sometimes wrong, the practice of the European counterparts are one of the inspection, particularly time-consuming. Luo Zhaoqiang colleagues invented a small device, as long as the plug into the socket, you can immediately confirm whether there is a problem, you can save a lot of time. "This is the work of the invention of the invention of innovation, smart but very practical." The workers China textbook "export" American high-speed rail EMU railway technology is the culmination, technological content of a lot of debugging equipment no less than the high iron itself. In 2012, in order to better Train EMU maintenance personnel, Changchun Zhongche railway vehicle Limited by Share Ltd intends to develop an EMU debugging training device, fault simulation and investigation. Previously, no one in the world has developed this product. No teacher to lead the way, Luo Zhaoqiang and colleagues can only be explored. They spent 10 months on the development, as scheduled to come up with qualified products. This product has 12 patented technology, is still the world’s only. Luo Zhaoqiang own experience and experience, into a textbook, not only for domestic counterparts, but also out of the country. In 2015, Changchun Zhongche railway vehicle Limited by Share Ltd beat European counterparts, the Boston subway project win, this is the first landing in North America Chinese rail transit project.

Administrative law enforcement is not law-abiding, why unlicensed vehicles have emboldened www.kepu.net.cn
Administrative law enforcement is not law-abiding, why unlicensed vehicles have emboldened the "Legal Daily" report, Henan, Zhoukou, Shenqiu, Taikang, Shangshui, administrative law enforcement car without motor vehicle plate, such as urban management in the County Department of Transportation Bureau, county, County Urban Construction Bureau, the County Environmental Protection Bureau, Bureau of organs in the yard at the administrative law enforcement vehicles, the majority is not listed. What is more, the police car parked on the roadside did not hang the license plate. The administrative law enforcement vehicles, regardless of which department is, it is first of all motor vehicles, in accordance with the provisions of the "road traffic safety law", driving a motor vehicle on road shall hang a motor vehicle plate, place the conformity inspection mark and the insurance sign, and with the motor vehicle license. The driver was driving the vehicle according to the specified license suspension not only face fines, will be deducted 12 points penalty. Now the problem is that these are rampant everywhere, without passing through the law enforcement vehicles without a license, he will be the first law enforcement? Should not, the news said, even some police roadside are unlicensed, and such a law enforcement vehicle lead not abide by the law, is not the first time reported by the media, not only in recent years. The law is there, but there are a number of top administrative enforcement in the name of official vehicles, long time in state law and law enforcement agencies will not be punished, even the Secretary of traffic management of their law enforcement vehicles are not linked to the license plate, what does that mean? At least, in front of the law is to have put it down in black and white, a group of people, some institutions can think beyond the law, and in fact it is really illegal, and will not be punished by law. In recent years not heard where the so-called is not outside the law ", which sounds like" outside the law "should not also do not exist, only in this way is consistent with" equality before the law "the rule of law. As everyone knows, this "outside the law". Since there is, it really has such a place, big dare not say, for example, the administrative law enforcement car across the mainland provinces of many times, unscrupulous. The law has become a matter of administrative law enforcement, it also holds what kind of law? The administrative law enforcement vehicles not listed, the most immediate danger, but contrary to "road traffic safety law", has become a great hidden danger for the traffic management, more seriously, all kinds of administrative act in administrative law enforcement in the name of the state is to evade supervision. In January 2016, the State Council issued the implementation of the rule of law (2015-2020), which put forward to improve the administrative law enforcement procedures, the establishment of the whole process of law enforcement record system". The administrative law enforcement should be recorded, the administrative law enforcement is not actually car license plate car, you let the public record of what? How to record? In September 2015, Gansu County Urban Management Department report users of law enforcement vehicles not listed, local officials responded that this is learning the experience of other counties and law enforcement. What experience? Why not listed as a law enforcement experience? After all, nothing more than to make the administrative law enforcement organs, is unable to supervise the public, urban beat, hit the things you want to take pictures of onlookers is of no use, a "law enforcement" hung as like as two peas brand of car, who afterwards you go to look for, and can supervise? What’s more, the administrative law enforcement.相关的主题文章：

A sensational, action packed new book called Rave Story has recently rocketed up from the streets of London and is quickly securing its place on the best seller list. Rave Story is based upon the true story and life memoirs of record producer, entrepreneur and club owner Otiz F. Angel and his meteoric rise from the ghettos of London to success as an international performer and businessman. As well as shedding light on the history of Rave culture, the clubbing scene and the origins of various genres of electronic dance music, this book comes from a different perspective as it also takes the reader on an emotional journey through the turbulence of the author’s stormy life.
Although at the outset seemingly a quagmire of violence, sex, drugs, horrifying events and traumatic experiences, by the end an astonishing reversal leaves the reader uplifted and in a positive state of mind.
The author’s style moves between first and third person, dramatising and accentuating pivotal events inside the book by telling the story from more than one point of view.
Like other titles such ‘This is Not A Rave’, and movies like ‘Go!’ and ‘Rise: The Story Of Rave Outlaw Disco Donnie’, Rave Story dishes the dirt on rave parties, ecstasy pills, weed, clubs, festivals, and some of the other drugs found at the fringes of party culture, but never seeks to glamorise, only to inform. Coupled with its insightful views on the history of house music, the book has been attracted praise from many influential people within dance culture and beyond.

The founders and core team of ProjectLocker went on a weekend retreat over this past weekend to redefine the strategy and tactics for our company. We're serving well over 100,000 customers now, and most of you are happy, but we know that we can do better in our support and product offering, and we know that if we can help our customers do their jobs better, we will ultimately achieve the success we desire as well.
We discussed mission, process, and priorities. The most important thing that came out of our discussion was a honed version of our mission. We always have known that we help software development teams, by eliminating drudgery and administrative overhead, by providing tools that are convenient and helpful. These things are necessary, but they are not sufficient. We've revised our mission statement to be, simply:
That's an aggressive and a radical goal, but it focuses us tightly on what will make your job as a developer easier. Productivity reports and rollups of what's happening on the project are great, and we will be adding those types of things. However, our focus is on the developer actually writing code. How can we help you identify dependency issues? How can we help you find hotspots where bugs may be lurking? How can we help you communicate with other developers more easily? How can we help you deploy and test faster? As we list the myriad features we could build, we'll be firing each of them in a crucible fueled by these questions. The end result? A radical improvement in developer experience, and a platform that delivers obvious time and monetary value to our customers.
You've already noticed some changes to our look and feel, and more changes will be coming soon as we improve your ability to communicate with other products that you use and with other team members. We're revising our internal process to improve accountability and allow us to deliver features on a weekly basis most weeks, so you should be seeing a lot more posts from us. We also want to hear from you, and you can write us at support [-at-] projectlocker.com or reach out on Twitter at @ProjectLockerHQ.
Keep an eye on us. Let us know what you want. And by all means, hold us accountable. It's great to write long treatises about what we're going to do better, but only time will tell what we are actually going to do, so if we come up short, yell at us to fix it.
ProjectLocker has been the premier provider of cloud-based development solutions since 2003. We are experts in Subversion hosting, Git hosting, and Trac hosting, and our services are used by developers in over 100 countries around the world.

Preparations for Rennsport Reunion IV continue, and Porsche Cars North America and Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca today released the latest race groupings and schedules for the fourth installment of the now famous event to be held from October 14 – 16, 2011. This rare occasion will reunite the cars and drivers that together have written Porsche’s motorsports history during the last 60 years on all five continents.
When Porsche Cars North America held the first Rennsport Reunion in the summer of 2001 at Lime Rock Park in Connecticut, it didn’t take long for the participants to realize they were sharing in something extraordinary. Subsequent Rennsports, II and III, were both held at Daytona International Speedway in Florida and built upon the original premise, remarkable racecars reunited with their equally remarkable drivers.
As in the past three reunions, cars will be grouped by the period in which they raced so that enthusiasts can fully focus on the different motorsports eras with their ever more ferocious machines and increasingly sophisticated technology. All fans will have full access to both paddocks and trackside to view everything from the tiny but nimble Porsche 550 Spyder through the groundbreaking 906 and 908 with their plastic bodies to the mighty 917 with over 1,000 horsepower.
A majority of the hundreds of race cars expected will be made up by the many racing versions of Porsche’s iconic 911 model. From its rather humble beginnings as 911 TR in the mid-Sixties this car was for two decades the platform of motorsports legends. Letters and numbers such as RSR, 934 or 935 to GT3 series have stood for proven winners at that time and contributed heavily to the over 30,000 victories that Porsches collected over the past 60 years.
Eight groups promise a jam packed three-day racing program with practice, qualifying and warm-up for each group. The races will be complemented by an exhibition parade and a Concours on Saturday afternoon. The weekend will conclude with a guest appearance of the Cayman Interseries and a race of modern 911 Cup cars for the Rennsport Reunion Trophy.
Porsche Rennsport Reunion IV will be the world’s greatest gathering of Porsche race cars and the drivers that drove them to victory, held at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca from October 14 to 16, 2011. Hosted by Porsche Cars North America, it will assemble the wide variety of Porsche’s most historic racing models from the nimble 550 Spyder of the mid-Fifties through the mighty 917 and 956/962 of the Seventies and Eighties to the highly successful RS Spyder of the last decade.
Special tribute will be paid to the numerous racing versions of the Porsche 911 and their countless victories on the dawn of what will become another milestone of this iconic sports car.
Additional details of the Porsche Rennsport Reunion IV will be published on Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca’s web site (http:// www.mazdaraceway.com), as they become available. Ticket information is available by contacting 800-327-7322 or online at www.mazdaraceway.com.

I like to visit Xiamen for a week in autumn. Is there possibility to buy a some days ticket or prepaid-Ticketcard for allcity- busses, airport-bus, taxis etc ?
The short answer to your question is, no. Prepaid transportation cards are only sparsely used in a couple of the major cities (Beijing & Shanghai), but even there the amount of services that use is it very small so it would probably be a waste of money.
Main international airports in Austria are: Vienna International Airport (VIE), Innsbruck Airport, (INN) Salzburg Airport (SZG), Klagenfurt Airport (KLU), Blue Danube Airport Linz (LNZ) and Graz Airport (GRZ).
The national carrier Austrian Airlines (with two subsidiaries: Austrian Arrows and Lauda Air) offers flights from many European countries to Austria. Austrian Airlines European destinations (direct flights) include:
Numerous carriers offer routes to Austria from other European countries. For example, Eurolines or National Express.
Austrian Railways (Österreichische Bundesbahnen) offers routes to many European countries, including Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine.
It is easy to get to Austria by car. At the border one has to buy a toll sticker (Vignette) as a road charge is required for driving on all motorways and expressways.
Public transport in Austria is well organized and, according to many opinions, faultless. In Vienna public transport comprises bus and tram network and an underground system. The only drawback is tickets – every form of transport requires a separate ticket. The good solution is a multi-journey card (Vienna Card) that entitles the holder to travel by bus, tram and underground. Tickets can be bought from vending machines, ticket sales offices, newsagents and tobacconists. Tickets for buses or trams can be bought on board. Children under six travel free.
Taxis have a yellow sign on the roof. All of them are equipped with taximeters (at least in the larger cities). Taxis can be found at taxi stands, hailed in the street or ordered by phone.
Driving is on the right side of the road. Foreigners need an international driving licence. Drivers must also have insurance documents and car registration documents. Drivers must not drive with a blood alcohol level of more than 0.5 grams/litre. Driver and passengers must wear seat belts. Children under 150 cm must travel in child seats. Speed limits: built-up areas – 50 km/h, motorways – 130 km/h, outside built-up areas – 100 km/h. Dipped headlights must be on even during daytime. In winter (between 1st November 1 and 15th April) the use of winter tires is obligatory. Mandatory equipment also include: a reflective safety vest, a first-aid kit and a warning triangle.

Then, all at once in the mid-seventies, homeless people seemed to be everywhere. Even today, nobody knows for sure why the problem became so bad so fast. Between 1965 and 1977, more than a hundred thousand patients were released from state psychiatric hospitals, and perhaps forty-seven thousand of them ended up in the city. At the same time, hundreds of single-room-occupancy hotels, or S.R.O.s, were shutting down; the S.R.O.s had provided low-income individuals with housing that was a step up from nothing. In 1972, the Supreme Court decriminalized vagrancy. Police became less aggressive about rousting those who were sleeping in public. The number of middle-class people in the city went down, which led to a decrease in the supply of livable and affordable apartments, leaving even fewer available to the poor. Whatever the cause, by the late seventies many thousands were “sleeping rough” (as the phrase had it) in the city’s public spaces.

BONNAUD TV – France 2 prenait, jeudi soir, le risque de diffuser en prime time un documentaire historique sur l’impératrice Catherine II de Russie, dénué de toute image d’archives – et pour cause, tout cela se passe au 18e siècle. Mais la chaîne publique a trouvé la parade pour prévenir tout risque de désertion des téléspectateurs : du cul, du cul, du cul.
Divorce is often a delicate and painful issue for all involved. If one or both parties in a divorce have a high net worth, dividing the marital estate can be even more complicated. It’s not uncommon for high net worth individuals to feel overwhelmed during the divorce process because there is so much at stake and emotions are running high.
High net worth divorce cases require more expertise than typical divorce cases because there may be an ownership interest in a business, an extensive investment portfolio, inheritances, or other complications. High net worth divorce attorneys must work closely with accountants, actuaries, business appraisers, and real estate appraisers to assess your case and provide an objective analysis.
It’s important to begin a high net worth divorce with a specific plan. First, gather all of the necessary accounting and business records to prepare a balance sheet of assets and debts. Your Columbus divorce attorney may bring in forensic accountants, business appraisers, and other experts to help during the planning stages.
In Ohio, the property that you bring into the marriage is known as separate property. Marital property is property owned by both the husband and wife. Separate property doesn’t become marital property just because you get married. If separate property is not commingled during the marriage, it typically remains separate property.
If either party in a marriage assists in increasing the value of separate property during the marriage, the appreciation in value may be considered marital property. The premarital value of the separate party is not considered marital property, however. A high net worth divorce attorney in Columbus, Ohio can help you trace the life of complex assets throughout your marriage to determine what would be considered marital property and separate property.
If one or both parties in a divorce own a business, it’s important to accurately appraise and divide that business. Simply dividing a business in half is not considered equitable under Ohio law. An attorney would take the time to understand your business and then work with experts to accurately value it. The value of a business is tied to cash flow, receivables, and tax liabilities. Getting the help of a divorce attorney is critical to achieving equitable results when appraising and dividing a business.
Spousal support is a payment from one spouse to the other that is designed to prevent financial hardship following a divorce. It is typically paid on a monthly basis. Determining spousal support can be a particularly challenging issue for high net worth individuals. Each spouse may have the expectation to maintain the same quality of life during the separation and divorce process as in the marriage. The amount of spousal support that you must pay or are qualified to get is decided on a case-by-case basis. Factors that the court considers when awarding spousal support include the age, lifestyle, financial resources, and future earning potential of both parties.
In a high net worth divorce case, choosing the right Columbus high net worth divorce attorney is crucial. You need an attorney with the qualifications, experience, and resources necessary to handle the complexity of such a divorce. Edward F. Whipps & Associates has extensive experience in high net worth divorce cases.

Over the summer I spent about a month on the island of Oahu in Hawaii for work. It has been over 10 years since the last time I visited Hawaii. There was a heavy load of work ahead of us with just a few days off. Luckily during this time, some family was also visiting so I was able to escape and do some fun activities. We went swimming with sharks, snorkeling and enjoyed some of the tastier foods available. There was also a fun 4th of July show right in the back of where we were staying. Any moment we were not working was spent in the ocean, I could not get enough of the warm water.
It was a hectic, long work trip. Feeling the aloha spirit from the locals and not being able to leave work much left me wanting to come back and explore more of what Hawaii has to offer. Small warning; many sunset pictures ahead, it is when I had most of my time off. Also, nothing quite like watching a sunset in Hawaii…
Always up for a trip by land or sea. Will bring camera. Here I will post stories and photos I would like to share, in no particular order. Enjoy!

Diane L. Goeres-Gardner makes readers eyewitnesses to frontier justice in Necktie Parties: Legal Executions in Oregon, 1851~1905. This book details the history of Oregon’s hangings during this time period. Each chapter concentrates on a single case and the circumstances surrounding it.
Today, capital punishment is a controversial topic, in the United States, and around the world. That wasn’t the case during the 1800s on America’s western frontier. Executions were public events drawing hundreds – sometimes thousands – of residents from miles around. Parents often brought their children, believing the youngsters should learn what happened to people who chose the wrong paths in life.
Goeres-Gardner also looks at the backgrounds of the condemned and their victims, the crimes and the investigations. The author uses trial records, witness testimony, newspaper reports, and other historical records to bring to life each of the more than fifty cases included in Necktie Parties: Legal Executions in Oregon, 1851~1905.
These stories give fascinating glimpses into frontier justice, early American justice reform, and jury selection techniques. Facts are footnoted and each story is thoroughly referenced. Necktie Parties: Legal Executions in Oregon, 1851~1905 will be a valuable addition to any library and a great read for all curious readers.
"Welcome to the world of frontier justice. Necktie Parties records, in chronological order, the individual stories of the men who climbed the gallows steps and faced the hangmans' noose. Oregon's history of hangings during the nineteenth century is a history of ordinary people who committed extraordinary acts. In many cases, the condemned enjoyed their notoriety, at least up to the moment the rope was tightened around their necks."
So begins the first page of Necktie Parties. The book contains fifty separate stories, separated into three sections: "Open to the public, 1851-1866," "Modern Inventions Improve Executions, 1896-1905," and "Sensational Journalism Takes Control 1896-1905." Each story includes the names of the individuals involved: judges, lawyers, jury members, witnesses, and family members. Endnotes, references, and an index are included in the book. There are 45 photographs/illustrations throughout the book, including copies of six hanging invitations and seven rare photos of the condemned standing on the gallows.
"On May 25, 1860 George mounted the scaffold and bravely faced from 1500 to 2000 spectators who had gathered to hear his dying speech. Just as he finished declaring his innocence in very broken English with a heavy German accent and stepped forward to face his death, Sheriff Sheldon B. Fargo made a surprise announcement. Governor John Whiteaker had refused to sign a petition commuting George's sentence to life imprisonment, but did grant him a thirty-day reprieve - enough time for his relatives to say their farewells. Unfortunately, the reprieve still needed to be signed by the Secretary of State, Lucien Heath, in Salem - a round trip of 65 miles from Corvallis, or six hours of hard horseback riding. Unwilling to make the decision on his own whether to honor the not-quite-legal reprieve or to ignore it and hang George anyway, the sheriff asked the audience to vote. It must have been an excruciating few minutes as the condemned man listened to people delaying his fate. Instead of going forward with the hanging, human compassion prevailed and George was taken back to jail."
"When Multnomah County Sheriff Ben Norden and his deputies led Ah Lee outside, the huge crowd shoved and jostled them. Printed invitations had been issued but the guards at the entrance of the stockade refused to intervene and the crowd rushed inside the small enclosure. Rude epitaphs and vulgar comments were hurled at the prisoner while his guards tried to push their way through the crowd. They finally reached the scaffold and took refuge on top. Above them the crowd was so thick on the balcony, the beams cracked and moaned."
"Two weeks later, during a conversation with Peter Svensen, he described what happened that day. Svensen reported what Hansen told him. "There was a club lying there that was to change the calf in the pasture and he took that club and hit his wife in the head. He said she was standing there picking berries at the time. I asked him if he had any cause for it and he said he had no cause whatever, and he didn't know at that minute what he done it for, but he said he done it and he didn't hardly know how it happened himself at the time."
"The press' influence was felt all over Oregon. Another young man living near Beaver Creek in Benton County resided with his father, two sisters and a brother-in-law. After reading the accounts of Lloyd Montgomery's murders he told everyone that he agreed with Montgomery's actions and thought it was a great thing Lloyd had done. One day there was some trouble in the family and the youth jumped up from the dinner table, seized a Winchester rifle and threatened to kill the whole family. 'I will make another Lloyd Montgomery affair,' he shouted with such emphasis that a stranger, who happened to be in the house at the time, became frightened and left."
"The most learned professors on the west coast scientifically examined the dead men's brains. They believed that the development of the gray matter rather than its gross weight indicated the amount of intellectual ability. Dalton's brain weighed 46 ounces and Wade's brain weighed 53-3/4 ounces. The doctors explained that while Wade's brain was a few ounces over the average and Dalton's was considerably less, that did not mean that Wade was more intelligent. Both men were buried in the Multnomah County Poor Farm Cemetery."
"Ms. Goeres-Gardner has presented an impressively researched and meticulously documented examination of the history of legal executions in Oregon from the beginning of the territorial period until the time when executions were moved to the state penitentiary in Salem. Her narratives of the fifty executed men, their crimes, their defenses and the stray details of late 19th century life that peek out at the reader through court sources make for a fascinating story. Whether it is the condemned man who feigned catatonia for 515 days or the medical doctors who measured the deceased brains to test theories regarding intellectual capacity of the defendant, the characters come alive with all their foibles, fears and petty jealousies which drive the human condition."
If you enjoy true crime stories, and if you are curious about Oregon history, you will really appreciate Necktie Parties: A History of Legal Executions in Oregon, 1851-1905.
Diane Goeres-Gardner of Tyee knows this because she spent five years digging through dusty files, newspapers and archives learning about the stories of some of Oregon’s biggest historic rogues, murderers and malcontents — and their untimely ends

When exactly the game of fistball was “invented”, is not known. What is certain, however, is that the roots lie in the southern part of Europe, perhaps in Italy. The earliest known written mention of the game is by Roman Emperor Gordian III and dates to the year 240. Rules for an Italian version of fistball were recorded by Antonius Scaiono in 1555. In the 16th century the game experienced a renaissance. However, it was seen less as a game of competitive nature and more as a pastime for nobles and gentry. In 1786, Johann Wolfgang Goethe mentioned fistball games between ‘four noblemen from Verona and four Venetians’ in his diary An Italian Journey. It was only in 1870 that fistball was introduced to Germany, led by Georg Weber. The sport was mainly played by gymnasts and was soon seen as a gymnastic sport. During this time the sport spread to the surrounding, mainly German-speaking, neighboring countries, and German emigrants also spread the sport in all continents, particularly in North- and South America and West Africa. Today fistball is played on all continents. Yes, there is “striking” similarity between volleyball and fistball: the object of both games is to place […]

Origin of Men’s Lacrosse What began as stickball, a native American Indian contest played by tribal warriors for training, recreation and religious reasons, has developed over the years into the interscholastic, professional and international sport of lacrosse Lacrosse was started by the Native American Indians and was originally known as stickball. The game was initially played in the St. Lawrence Valley area by the Algonquian tribe and they were followed by other tribes in the eastern half of North America, and around the western Great Lakes. The Native American games were seen as major events, which took place over several days.They were played over huge open areas between villages and the goals, which might be trees or other natural features, were anything from 500 yards to several miles apart. Any number of players were involved. Some estimates have mentioned between 100 and 100,000 players participating in a game at any one time.

Meet the Galjoens – a South African fistball team who’ll carry the hopes of the nation when they take on the best in the world later this year. I came this close to representing South Africa, but I made a fist of it. My near miss started with a trip to Switzerland and a sport called curling, which it turns out I was remarkably good at. Curling is like bowls on ice, but also with a broom. “If only curling was a South African sport,” I told Leif Petersen, a game ranger turned informal economy researcher, “I’d be a Springbok.” Petersen and I were lamenting the fact that we would never realise our childhood dreams to play for our country. Petersen was bumping up against the big Four-Oh, but unlike other men in the grip of a midlife crisis he didn’t look good in Lycra so had to find another outlet for his breakdown. Like me, he had never won a single athletic award in his life but, also like me, had held on to the belief that one day someone would see his potential and he’d get called up to a national squad – any national squad. Unfortunately, that […]

History has been made! A historical MoU has been signed between the IOC represented by IOC President Dr. Thomas Bach and AIMS represented by its counterpart Stephan Fox. The signing ceremony was witnessed by 4 Vice Presidents from the IOC, and IOC Director General Christophe De Kepper; this is a testament of the importance of the signing. AIMS, the umbrella group of 23 international sport federations, which are members of SportAccord, now have the right to be included in the “Olympic Movement Directory”. AIMS proudly supports and promotes the vision and mission of the Olympic movement by sustaining and developing sports, importantly through the education of youth through sport and to continue to be credible in sport through applicable principles of the Olympic Movement. The IOC acknowledges the role and leadership of AIMS, and its valuable contribution to support the Olympic Movement. “I must thank the IOC President Dr. Bach for his vision, for his mission and for his support of sport and for the international federations which are striving to gain individual recognition by the IOC whom nevertheless work towards good governance and the overall development of sport for the good of society. Today, 23 international sport federations showed their gratitude to the IOC […]
The place and dates of the third President’s SAMBO Cup to be held in the UK have been decided. After London and Manchester, the tournament has moved to Edinburgh, Scotland. This is where the attention of SAMBO athletes from around the world who want to fight for the prestigious challenge trophy will be focused on September 24. Meadowbank Sports Centre, Edinburgh’s main sports complex, has been chosen as the venue for the already traditional tournament. This is where all major competitions, as well as concerts (Elton John will be performing here this summer), are held. As in previous years, the organizers of the President’s Cup are planning some pleasant surprises for both spectators and SAMBO tournament participants. You may be interested to know that Princess Katarina, a descendant of two European royal dynasties, is the chair of the organizing committee. She is a great granddaughter of Queen Victoria on her mother’s side and of the King of Serbia from the famous Balkan Karađorđević dynasty on her father’s side. In turn, Michael Wynne Parker, President of the Commonwealth SAMBO Association, announced that members of several ancient Scottish clans had already expressed their intention to attend the tournament. The Consul General of the Russian […]
FIBA Secretary General Patrick Baumann has been elected President of SportAccord after overcoming the President of World Underwater Federation Anna Arzhanova at the SportAccord General Assembly. Patrick Baumann is an IOC member and International Basketball Federation (FIBA) Secretary General was elected the new SportAccord president today at the SportAccord Convention in Lausanne. Mr. Baumann said that he acknowledges his challenge and will be “trying to build an atmosphere which can bring us all together.” He says SportAccord can serve as “the voice of sport.” AIMS is looking forward to a close cooperation with the new President and will continue to play an important part within the recognised world of sport.
A historic joint welcome dinner hosted by IWGA, ARISF and AIMS was held at the Olympic Museum on the night of the 18th of April. The room was filled with representatives from over 60 international recognised sporting federations grouped together in ARISF and AIMS and many of them also members of IWGA and included in the World Games program. IWGA, led by President Jose Perurena, who is also an IOC Member; ARISF members, led by President Raffaele Chiulli and AIMS represented with Stephan Fox as President; all present to celebrate the opening of the SportAccord Convention for 2016 in the Olympic Capital of Lausanne and no place would be more fitting than the Olympic Museum in the Olympic capital. Mr Chiulli shared on the expectations of the SAC and the warmth of coming together as a family for the united love of sport. The night was especially honoured by presence of the IOC President Dr Thomas Bach along with the 4 IOC Vice Presidents, the Director General and Deputy Director General,the IOC Sport Director, the IOC Head of Relations and many others, showing the level of cooperation between the IOC, the IOC recognized umbrella groups and federations and multi sport organisations.

The opening ceremony of the Russia – SAMBO – United Kingdom exhibition took place today, April 26, in Russia’s State Duma. The event coincides with the competitions of the annual President’s SAMBO Cup in the UK and other projects of the International SAMBO Federation. Guests viewed the exhibits before the opening ceremony. Photos were arranged on stands in the style of famous British architectural monuments tracing the history of the President’s SAMBO Cup in the UK and other joint Russian-British projects. These include a meeting at Kensington Palace on the 75th anniversary of SAMBO, a performance by sambists in the style of James Bond, a meeting of Russian and British war veterans, and other events. The Challenge Cup itself was in the place of honor at the exhibition. Guests wanting a glimpse of the future had an opportunity to take photos in a special stand‑in cutout of a Scotsman in a kilt and SAMBO jacket. The third President’s SAMBO Cup will be held in Edinburgh, Scotland this September. Have a quick look at the exhibition by watching this special video: It’s interesting that the opening ceremony of the exhibition began by involving one of Russia’s best known politicians in SAMBO.

This is it guys - The Rescue mission to Earth. This is going to be intense, action-packed and an opportunity to flex those imaginative muscles.
Since his escape, Admiral Wood has quietly been putting into place a plan to rescue the Political Prisoners being held in High Security Prisons across Earth -plans he is forced to put into action early.
A small Voth Starship approaches Redemption, its commander telling of how his people - the few that survived an unknown cataclysm -fled the Delta Quadrant in search of their supposed 'Distant Origin' home. When they arrived at Earth they were ensnared by Carpathia, their ships overrun and taken from them before they could react. Only one ship escaped - the rest are due to be taken apart for study and reverse engineering, the crews - part of an endangered species - slated for execution.
The ragtag Rebel Fleet is called together - 29 ships to stand against the might of Carpathia's Capital.
2) The Rescue Operation, consisting of Marines and Security Personnel on Assault Runabouts with Fighters as close cover. Redemption's group will focus on a single target prison (the others will be hit by NPC's "offscreen".
The details, like how we're going to not be blown to smithereens by Earth's Orbital Defense Platforms, will be covered in-sim during our planning meetings. I am really excited about this sim, we can really have a lot of fun with this.
Sound off below if you're ready to rock this and if you got any ideas to help make this sim even better!
One tghing I would perhaps like to see added was a little segment written perhaps by yourself.. Carpathia's reactions as the Op progresses
(which could in turn provide intermediate check points for everyone to aim for and periodically remind folks what opposition they might be facing while adding somewhat to the scale of the occasion??..)
I agree to this and I'm glad you thought of it too. Although I do wish, as Carpathia is a force to be reckoned with and is the actual reason for the Redemptions last few sims, that he has an actual site presence (in sims only). Makes the sim a little more real, not just a side bar by Admiral Wood.
It would make identifying him and having him operate outside the Redemption's sim much easier too. I'll put one together...
I know that Cody is busy and I'm pushing through a shortened verson of it to get Thrack and Dushall back to the Redemption. For the next mission, to add some more posting and to take some of the NPC posting off of Matt, I'm going to control Zekial Zaarin and the USS Valour as an NPC ship and Zethra Kaine with as an offsite assault team... just to add some flavor.
Also brought Captain Grahm and the Albatross out of retirement to provide a point of insertion... or it can be used for the Incursion as well.
I'd wait on the point of insertion stuff until you hear the Admiral's briefing but I'm excited to see what you got in store for the rest there Thrack!
I've also started posting a series about Rear Admiral Janice Richards, so we can get to know her character better before the big role she'll play in this coming sim
Sorry I've been busy with work. I'm currently on a rig right now that is not really doing anything. So I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Lol. Been looking forward to this. Cory if you could get that last post up for us I'm sorry I dropped the ball with that one. :-/
right now the rest of us can do filler posts but not a lot more without actually knowing what and wherefore.... and that is starting to drag a bit
(come the weekend I am happy just to start a fight and move things that way if people are otherwise too busy)
Hey Tybalt - I had a chat with the folks in lead on the Valhalla. Things will start moving over there. If it doesnt - you have my blessing to start a fight come the weekend.
Just a warning 'Hell Weekend' begins for me tomorrow so don't expect me to be around much until next Wednesday. I'm working 56 hours out of 120 and that doesn't include the three hours travelling there and back every day or sleeping thus the nickname
So just as an update to the thrilling adventures of Thrack and Dush, we are where the last known coordinates of the Redemption are, but it isn't there. we have it sorta caught in the same time rift as the ship they found.
Thrack is naked in a bunk and Dushall is sitting at the helm wondering how the hell he got into thei predicament. And thrack is naked.
Once the Redemption is done with the ship, they will reappear and then Thrack (who is naked) and Dush (who could be naked) can join them.
i think the big question is.. what is his wife going to say when D comes back.. with a naked Spoonhead....in his bunk...
I apologize for my lack of communication the last few weeks. My job has been very demanding on me as of late with little to no days off for weeks at a time because of some under-staffing issues.
Thankfully, that is changing. By the end of next week, I will have additional support and will get back on a somewhat normal schedule.
So, in the meanwhile, I'd like to hear some of your ideas on how we should play out the big prison break out. Matt has heard some of mine, and it's a good start - but I want to and need to hear from you all on some suggestions. Once we have the suggestions rounded up, we'll plot them together, pull out the sorting hat, and see which person is going to which house.
Once the ideas are in, we'll put together a good outline of things to do and happen in the storyline. The storyline will get a little hectic once the ball starts rolling, that's why it's a good idea to get our ducks in a row before Matt gives the order to fire.
Feel free to post the ideas on here, of if you want to keep it super duper awesome secret, send Matt and myself a private message.
Chase is lucky they let her have any clothes *she looks around her utterly barren cell* they are too afraid she'll made some sort of WMD out of even a blanket
I envision that the big break out is going to have lots of guard killing and explosions as the marines come in to rescue us. Chase has a few 'presents' hiding around the prison to aid out breakout (or at least the guard killing part )
Bethany Moondark wrote: Chase is lucky they let her have any clothes *she looks around her utterly barren cell* they are too afraid she'll made some sort of WMD out of even a blanket
Yeah, I can just see her pulling out strands of her hair to form a garrote with which she can strangle a guard, thereby grabbing his weapon and going on a massive killing spree. She'll end up saving the Marines and singlehandedly destroying the Borg.
And yeah I am presuming the camp gets a 'liquidate them all' order even as the marines arrive.. so maybe a little breaking and entering.. governor's office with a blunt and rusty spoon?...
Excellent blog right here! Also your web site lots up very fast! What web host are you the use of? Can I am getting your associate link on your host? I desire my web site loaded up as quickly as yours lol
A medieval fortress overlooks the small predominantly Sunni town of Madiq Castle in Hama, Syria, situated on the Orontes River and along the fertile Al-Ghab plain, under opposition control today. To the south, there lies Suqaylabiya, a predominantly Christian town under regime control. Alawis live in both locations, though mostly in regime-controlled areas. When war came to this part of Hama, clashes between regime and opposition forces ended in a truce that has largely held until today. Amid dramatic offensives in Eastern Ghouta and Afrin, the Russians issued a threat to 13 villages in the area, including Madiq Castle, demanding that residents accept their entry into the region – or else. This threat against civilians demonstrates a heightened level of complicity with the Assad regime in its attacks on noncombatants in Syria, one that should warrant an immediate response from those who wish to protect the most vulnerable in Syria. While the regime’s National Defense Forces and infamous Fourth Division still occasionally shell and snipe the town of Madiq Castle, clashes have only occurred infrequently over the past two years. Social bonds that existed before the war resisted the Syrian regime’s sectarian rhetoric as the sole protectors of minorities. The head of the Majlis al-Shura in Madiq Castle town said, “We are brothers. The people of Suqayalbiya are like our family.” Priests will often intervene to assuage tensions and mediate between disputing parties. “The regime and others play the chord of sectarianism, but that is not how our society works. I am married to an Alawi woman. We have three children together and we were married seven months after the events [protests] began. I have a great relationship with my in-laws. Whatever sectarian people say, that is not how we are,” says the head of the Local Council in the opposition-held town of Madiq Castle.
His wife chimes in, “They don’t discriminate against me at all. On the contrary, they are even nicer and more respectful of me because they know I’m from a different sect. And it’s not just us. There is harmony between the people and everyone treats each other with decency.”
Fruit and vegetable traders pass through the Madiq Castle – Suqaylabiya crossing, as do students and government employees. The crossing increased in importance when the regime, in coordination with the U.N., used it to bring forcibly displaced persons from the south to Idlib province. While trade in the area decreased due to the opening of Morek crossing on the M5 highway to the east, the level of extortion and abuse at checkpoints in regime-held Suqayalbiyeh also decreased in recent months.
Given the relative peace, it came as a surprise to area residents when Russian interlocutors verbally threatened 13 villages in opposition-controlled Hama – including Madiq Castle, Kafr Nabouda, Mount Shahshbo, Bab al-Taqa, and others. The Russians demanded entry into the region and would do so peacefully or by force, depending on the response of the people. They met with the Communications Committee (known as the Reconciliation Committee by the regime), headed by a well-known former mukhtar (the official local leader) of the area to issue the ultimatum on Feb. 24. The end of the week is the deadline for the people of Madiq Castle and surrounding opposition-held areas to respond.
Within days, the news elicited a response from armed rebel groups and civilians alike. Immediately Ahrar al-Sham and Jaish al-Nasr stated that they would not allow Russian or regime forces to enter the area. Shura and Local Councils soon after followed up with statements concurring with the armed factions, adding that they hope to remain under Turkish supervision (as stipulated in the de-escalation zones agreement of May 2017). They remind their audience that many of the hospitals have been destroyed and the injured would not have anywhere to go if there was an incursion. It is unclear to people on the ground whether the United Nations or any third parties are aware of these recent threats or are taking steps to mitigate tensions.
On Feb. 14, the regime and the Russians delivered a similar threat to the remaining opposition-held areas in northern Homs. The deadline came and went with some shelling and clashes but no mobilization of ground forces. It is unclear if this threat will ring equally hollow, but its mere issuance could displace more civilians while the media and international organizations focus on the ongoing, horrifying developments in Eastern Ghouta and Afrin. Terrified of a Russian and regime incursion, civilians have already begun fleeing north, many of them already displaced from other parts of the country. Even if the regime does not invade the area, many civilians expect the deadline to bring shelling and airstrikes. Instilling fear in the civilian population has, after all, been the modus operandi of the regime since protests began in 2011.
The fact that Russia, a signatory to the U.N. Resolution 2401 that calls for a 30-day cease-fire, both assists the Assad regime in its bombardment of Eastern Ghouta and simultaneously issues threats on its behalf to civilians demands an immediate response from the international community before these areas become “hell on earth.” The residents of Madiq Castle and the surrounding towns are a reminder of the strong bonds that still link Syrians together. They are also a reminder of what could be lost.

A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Daily Star on March 10, 2018, on page 7.
BEIRUT: Prime Minister Saad Hariri Sunday announced 37 Future Movement candidates, including four women, for the May 6 elections at a rally in Downtown Beirut.
“Your votes in the upcoming elections will be the answer to a simple question: Do you want this project to continue?” he asked the audience at the packed BIEL conference hall. “If you give your votes to Future candidates, you will have given your votes to me, Saad Rafik Hariri, and [be giving] the Future Movement the responsibility to continue the movement and the possibility to continue this movement.”
As Hariri has long promised, his electoral list included a number of women and younger candidates as well as political heavyweights like former Prime Minister MP Tammam Salam, Culture Minister Ghattas Khoury and Labor Minister MP Mohammad Kabbara.
Although parties failed to agree to add a women’s quota to the new proportional electoral law agreed to last year, Hariri said his Future Movement would include a number of women in prominent positions. In addition to his aunt, Sidon MP Bahia Hariri who is widely expected to keep her seat, Hariri announced three new female candidates. There are currently only four women in Parliament.
Most notably absent from the Future candidates were former Prime Minister MP Fouad Siniora – who ruled himself out as a candidate – current Telecoms Minister MP Jamal Jarrah and former Interim Interior Minister MP Ahmad Fatfat.
In Beirut II, Hariri announced that former pro-Future independent MP Salam, current Interior Minister Nouhad Machnouk and MP Ghazi Youssef would continue as candidates. The son of former MP Walid Eido – who was assassinated in 2007 – Zaher Eido will also stand for the party in the Beirut II district.
“Whoever likes Saad [Hariri], should vote for Future Movement lists wherever they are, in all districts,” the prime minister said as he announced the party candidates in front of Future’s elections slogan, “We are the evil eye charm that protects Lebanon,” which included a picture of the blue talisman common across the region.
There are 10 candidates from Beirut II, 11 from Tripoli-Minyeh-Dinnieh and six from Akkar. Hariri notably did not announce any candidates for either the Beirut I or Baabda electoral districts. The Future Movement will look to grab one, if not both, Sunni seats from Baalbeck-Hermel, which is traditionally dominated by an alliance between Hezbollah and the Amal Movement.
MP Okab Sakr was not announced as a candidate for the Future Movement. The Zahle MP, who occupies a Shiite seat, was seen as a controversial figure during Hariri’s resignation fiasco last November. However, the prime minister said more candidates for Zahle would be announced and Sakr was present at the event Sunday.
BEIRUT: The Kataeb party launched its 131-point 2018 electoral program Sunday with a vow to tackle some of the country’s most heated topics. The “Pulse of Change” electoral program was announced at an event hosted by the party in Nahr al-Kalb. The platform covers issues related to security, foreign policy, economy, society and environment.
The program included controversial proposals, including plans for a civil marriage law and extending the reach of the Lebanese Army into Palestinian refugee camps, which despite the Lebanese government unilaterally annulling the Cairo accord 1987 are still regulated by Palestinian authorities.
“We weren’t scared of choosing controversial topics to tackle in our program. We are not afraid of debate. We won’t back down on Lebanon’s absolute sovereignty and neutrality,” head of the party Sami Gemayel said at the launch.
“The program additionally tackles civil marriage and the right of women to pass their Lebanese citizenship on to their children ... But everything will remain a mere slogan if there are no men who support this project,” Gemayel added.
During the event, head of Kataeb’s Economic Council Jean Tawila presented the economic items on the list, while Rita Boulos from the party’s political bureau explained the environmental files.
Kataeb’s environmental plan aims to impose strict fines on factories that do not make use of filters to reduce their environmental impact, to provide government incentives for sorting waste and recycling and to allocate municipality funds for sorting plants.
The program additionally includes plans to map out Lebanon’s borders with satellites and establish a ministry for expatriates.
After going through the details of the new program, Gemayel called on the public to be critical when casting their electoral vote for the May 6 elections.
“These elections are the uprising of public opinion, holding accountable every politician who considers himself above accountability and doesn’t believe in public opinion.”
In February, Gemayel explained his party’s choice of slogan, promising that Kataeb will be the “pulse of real change in political life.” Launching the campaign, he said that the party had “transformed” after its resignation from the government of Tammam Salam in 2016 and refusal to join the current government, to become a “real opposition.”
BEIRUT: The Sabaa party Sunday announced its 20 candidates running for the May 6 parliamentary elections, promising a fresh alternative to Lebanon’s traditional political parties and to create “a new generation of leaders.” In a televised event, the new party pledged to fully disclose its candidates’ assets in a commitment to transparency and to steer clear of outside influences.
The Sabaa candidates took to the stage, alongside their families, to announce their goals and focuses. In line with the party’s appeal to Lebanon’s younger generation, each candidate spoke about their children and stressed the importance of securing their future in the country.
“I don’t see a future for my kids unless there is change ... Sabaa will work on bringing this change,” Fadwa Fayiz Nassif, one of the party’s candidates for the Orthodox seat in Koura, said.
Nassif, who described herself as an environmental activist, announced the party’s vows. “We pledge to stay far from sectarianism. We won’t accept to be dependent on any foreign state. We will aim to become a civil state, working with full transparency and combating corruption.”
She also promised the full public disclosure of the candidates’ assets, before giving the stage to the party’s “star,” one of Lebanon’s leading media personalities, Paula Yacoubian.
“For decades people have been ... protesting and demanding change, but without results. Sabaa isn’t a movement that simply demands change, it’s a comprehensive transformative movement. It will create a new generation of leaders,” said Yacoubian, who is running for an Armenian Orthodox seat in Beirut.
She addressed campaign banners put up by prominent parties promising change and criticized that so far the parties have failed to fulfill their pre-election promises. “You have plenty of funds [for campaigns], but your failure is evident ... Change isn’t a slogan you can hang on a billboard.”
The Sabaa party came to the front after the “You Stink” protests against the garbage crisis, and was led by young political activists that aimed to combat sectarianism, corruption and nepotism they claimed corrupted the established political parties in the country.
The party gained more exposure after Yacoubian joined, announcing Sabaa as “the first political” party to which she has belonged.
BEIRUT: Interior Minister Nouhad Machnouk Sunday reminded public sector employees that it was forbidden for them to campaign for any candidate in the upcoming election, a statement from his media office said. Employees of the government, public institutions, municipalities and municipality unions, including contractors, are barred from campaigning or publicly supporting any candidate by Article 77 of the Electoral Law. The article also prohibits the use of government departments and public institutions and facilities from hosting campaign activities.

The Arizona Chapter of US Lacrosse is one of 63 regional representatives of US Lacrosse, the national governing body of lacrosse. Our chapter offers a nonpartisan resource for the support and growth of lacrosse in the Southwest Region of the USA
The list below is not intended to be all-encompassing as to what is required to start a new team in either our AYLL (boys) or AGLA (girls) league. It is however intended to be a good "cheat-sheet" to help you understand those areas that need to be addressed very carefully.
None of this is intended to scare anyone off. Those who can follow generally the guidelines below are simply much better prepared to weather all the pitfalls that await a new team
JHS is preferred as the starting format, not HS (varsity or JV). Why? Our experience says HS teams with no feeder program simply struggle/die in time due to the difficulty of playing against more experienced teams who draw new players from experienced JHS programs. A HS-only program is a recipe for trouble.
If you must start as a HS program, then you may be limited to a JV program until the team can show enough progress to be moved up to the HS varsity ranks
Have 4 coaches lined up. Having only one (or even 2) is another recipe for disaster. Work conflicts and other responsibilities make it impossible for coaches to be at every practice. And having only one coach (or none…..) at a practice means kids just stand around and get zero benefits.
Have a very strong parent organization to take control of the program so that the coach(es) can coach and parents can administer. If the coach has to organize area of lining the field, call/e-mail players, collect money, organize registrations, etc, he/she simply gets burned out and then the coaching is less than it should be
Find a field for practice and games. Don’t assume anything about this. One team in Phoenix had their field lined up and ready to go until the school board (or city park administration) said 2 weeks before the season "you can’t line our field". Other schools/parks have initially allowed use of the field and then pulled it weeks into the season as they noted the possibility for danger from flying lacrosse balls (windows, cars, walkers, adjacent fields, etc)
Get some parents (or students) to agree to be your full-time score table personnel who are responsible for keeping the books at each game. It is not a hard job, but if you have to train a new person for every game, they simply never catch on to all the expectations.
Be ready to have the sport cost you more money than anyone expected. Everything costs more than you budget i.e. uniforms, balls, goals, nets, field-lining equipment (and paint), scoretable items (table, horn, clocks, etc), and then player registration with USL (the national body overseeing the sport required @ appx $30 each player), team registration with league (amount changes each year), possibly having to rent a field to play/practice on, transportation to/from games, etc etc. Plus, each kid has to have their own equipment and that costs a lot.
Our league needs commitments (verbal, with money to follow) from new teams by September of each year. Why? So we can start working on schedules in October. We have had teams in the past say "count us in", then the schedule is prepared by the league, and then in December the teams say "sorry, we could not get our team/coaches/etc group together". And then the league has to re-do an entire schedule. This is a "no-no"!
Recognize the inherent liability in lacrosse of a flying lacrosse ball. And therefore, before you ever put a team out on the field for a practice (formal or informal) HAVE EVERY KID AND COACH REGISTERED WITH USL (appx $30/yr) AND THEREFORE COVERED BY THE USL INSURANCE PLAN. At $30/year, it is the best and cheapest insurance program you will ever have.
Figure each player can spend about $300+ (boys, less for girls) on equipment including shoes, stick, gloves, arm and shoulder pads, helmet, team jersey and shorts, etc.
Then the team has to spend at least $1,000 on the following at least 2 goals and nets, field liner (and paint) to put the lines on the field, scorer's table (and miscellaneous equipment there such as clocks, score book, horn, etc), lots of lacrosse balls for practice (they seem to disappear faster than cool weather as summer approaches).
And then there is the league fee for each team (varies each year) which basically covers the refs for the season.
If you do not have a field offered to you by your school (and most of our teams do not, as they are "clubs" and not school teams), then possibly you will have to pay for the use of a city park or the school field. Cost: varies.
Every number I have given you above seems to be light, as teams find ways to spend more money than anyone ever budgeted.

A few years ago, my niece desperately wanted a pair of Uggs. I briefly thought about deviating from our traditional Christmas gift of putting money into her college fund and instead buying her a pair. That was until I figured out that the pair she wanted cost nearly $200. So if you own a pair of Uggs, then you know they are not merely a pair of boots; they are actually an investment. And as with any investment, you should take good care of them.
According to Wikipedia.org, Ugg boots originated from Australia and were initially designed as utilitarian footwear worn for warmth. Today they are worn with everything from sweat pants and jeans to skirts. But still most people continue to wear them in the colder months, especially in inclement weather. That snow, slush, and salt they’ve been exposed to can cause lasting damage if they are put away before being cleaned – properly. If you are ready to retire your Uggs for the season, please don’t throw them into your washing machine before putting them away. They are made of sheepskin and need to be handled rather delicately. Here is the process we use to clean Uggs:
If you have any questions on how to care for your Uggs, please leave a comment below or contact us on our Facebook page. We are here to help.

"2nd" Sunday Game (4:25 ET). Cards were bushwacked by the Texans the previous week. Jags were 7 & 3 coming off a 19 - 7 win in Cleveland (and a 4-game winning streak). Jag defense was evolving into a powerhouse - ranked #1 in points-allowed, yards-per-play allowed, sacks and passing yards-allowed and tied for #1 in takeaways. Cards were 4 & 6 and not playing very well. They're at the stage of the season where they appear to be ready to start younger players to "see what they've got." It will be interesting to see whether Seattle's loss Monday night loss might keep the seat warm for a little bit longer in the NFL West and breathe more oxygen fumes into a Cardinal roster that seems to be close to life-support.
(A shout out to the CBS announcing crew (Spiro Dedes and Adam Archuleta) for their insight into formations, coverages, players etc. and their focus on the game-itself - a far cry from what we've been used to hearing on the FOX channels).
Gabbert??? - Not perfect, but stepped up at crunch-time to lead his team into a position to kick the winning FG with 0:01 to go - against what was arguably the best defense in the NFL.
Gabbert's mobility brings a new feature to the Cardinal offense. True, there are some remaining ball-protection issues, but these look more correctable than ingrained.
The OL executed better than it did vs. Houston (Adrian Peterson gained 79 yds and was able to rip off a couple of 10-yard gains against a very stingy Jaguar run defense). Gabbert was still pressured more than you'd like to see in your starting QB, but he was able to chalk up 27 poiints by hook or by crook.
Chandler Jones had a beast of a game with 2 sacks and 6 tackles. He also got nailed for a roughing the passer penalty - we understand why they had to call it, but are not sure it was avoidable.
Patrick Peterson benefitted from the lack of a home run threat from the banged-up Jaguar receiving corps.
Just when we were about to write off Tyrann Mathieu as still-injured, no-longer motivated, a step-late etc. he comes back and makes plays like he used to (& not only that, but his level of play was consistently high throughout the game. 4 tackles and a pick don't tell the whole story - his pressure off the edge on blitz-detail kept Bartles off balance throughout the entire game.
The one major "below the radar" stat was 3rd Down Conversions - Jags only converted 1 of 12 (8%). Cards converted 7 of 17 (41%)
There were so many interesting story-lines that you could use them to produce an Academy Award film:
David vs. Goliath - With an inconsistent running attack and shaky run-defense, the Cards faced a playoff contender with a crunching run-offense and top overall defense - especially vs, the run.
AP Not Ready for Medicare - Coming off a weak performance in Houston, Adrian Peterson gained 79 yds on the ground and also caught 4 passes.
Gabby Proves 'Em Wrong - They said 3rd string QB Blaine Gabbert's career was probably over, but he threw for241 yds, 2 Td's and threaded the needle twice to set up the winning Card FG.
The Old Man's Still Got it - Phil Dawson puts down his AARP Card and kicks a record-setting 57-yarder to win the game.
Still Fear The Badger - Amidst criticism that he lost a step, lost the fire and no longer could get the job done, Tyrann Mathieu returned to his game-breaking days of old.
"The Kid" - All we knew about DJ Foster was that he was a UDFA and a local product from ASU who was brought in to be a place-holder on the Cardinal RB depth chart. If his "toe dance" doesn't get both feet in bounds or he fails to hold onto the ball, Dawson doesn't kick the 57-yarder and we lose.
Cards won the toss but uncharacteristically deferred. TB on KO. Jags held to 3 & out. Punt returned to Card 33. A 26-yd completion to Seals-Jones and a couple of short passes to A Peterson set up a 34-yd Dawson FG. Cards 3 - Jags 0.
TB on KO. Bucannon hurt on second play from scrimmage. Jags picked up a quick 1st down but were forced to punt from their forty. Punt fair caught at the Card 25. Cards clawed their way across midfield in ten plays but were forced to punt from the Jag 46. (Jag defenders were adept at batting down wide screens). Punt downed by Bethel at the Jax 4. Fournette gained one yd up the middle to end the quarter.
Jags moved to the Card 34...Roughing the passer flag on C Jones helped sustain the Jag drive to the Card 34, where Bynes forced a fumble and Dansby recovered. Card ball at their 40. A roughing the passer penalty on Fowler, a 14-yd completion to Nelson and a 7-yd run by Peterson helped set up Dawson's second FG from 42-yds. TD. Cards 6 - Jags 0.
TB on KO. A 12-yd sack by Pierre set up a Jax 3 & out. K Williams returned the punt for 20 yds. Cards ball on Jax 41. Four plays later, Gabbert hit Seals-Jones for a 29-yd TD. Cards 13 - Jags 0.
TB on KO. Interference call on Bynes moved Jax to midfield, but Bortles was then sacked by C Jones for a minus-10 yd loss. Jax punted. TB on the punt. On the first play from scrimmage, Gabbert fumbled the the snap. A Peterson recovered. On the next play, K Williams fumbled but ruling was reversed. After two consecutive false-start penalties (What's with that?) Cards eventually punted from their own 15. Punt returned to the Jax 44 at the 2:00 mark. Bortles put together what seemed to be his best drive of the game, featuring completions for +7, +3, +11, and +13 yards, but another sack (for minuis 10) by C Jomes forced Jax to settle for a 25-yd Lambo FG with 0:20 on the clock. Cards 13 - Jags 3.
Cards received. TB on KO. (An un-sexy but important drive) - A 16-yd completion to Fitz and a horse-collar flag on Jax was enogh to move the Cards to the Jax 30, where Dawson was good from 48. Cards 16 - Jags 3.
TB on KO. A roughing the passer flag on K-Mart followed by a Bortles ramble for +28-yds around LE moved Jax to the Card 9. On the next play, Bortles scrambled up the middle and fumbled, but BOrtles recovered it at the Card 1-yd line. Bortles then scrambled around RE for a one-yd TD. Margin now less than a TD. Cards 16 - Jags 10.
TB on KO. Six-play mini-drive featuring 3 inconsequential runs by A Peterson. Lee punted from midfield. Fair caught at Jax 7. Teams exchanged 3 7 outs (one for Cards and two for Jags). Peterson ran once up the middle for 10-yds to finish the quarter.
Cards bogged down and Lee's punt was O-O-B at the Jax 17. Rucker got flagged for roughing the passer (4th time in this game for Cardinal pass rushers). Card defense tightened up and Jax punted from its own 48. Punt fair caught at the Card 15. On the 3rd play from scrimmage, Gabbert ran into Ngakoue while scrambling to avoid a sack. Fumbled the ball. Calais Campbell picked it up and rambled in for a 10-yd TD. that gave Jax the lead for the first time. Jags 17 - Cards 16
TB on the KO. Gabbert came right back, pulling up on what first looked to be a scramble up the middle and throwing a 52-yd TD pass to a wide open Jaron Brown on the 6th play of the possession. Cards went for 2 on the XP conversion. Attempt was good when Gabbert rolled right and hit Fitz in the end zone. (The additional point would prove huge). Cards 24- Jags 17.
Plenty of time (9:07) left. Grant returned the KO 68 yds to the AZ 38. Bortles shredded the Card defense with completions to Yeldon for +5, Cole for +6 and Lewis for +10. On the next play, Bortles circled LE for +17 and the game tying TD. Cards 24- Jags 24.
7:26 left. KO returned to the Card 16. Gabbert took the Cards in 7 plays to the his own 41, where, on the next play, his pass for C Williams was intercepted by Church downed at the Jax 42 with 3:38 left. (Uh oh!). Bortles moved the Jags to the fringe of FG country (at the Cardinal 48). It was here that I wondered out loud whether if and when - on a quck sideline out - a Cardinal pass defender would "jump the route." Which is exactly what happened when Bortles's throw in the right flat was jumped by the Honey Badger.
Cards ball on their own 41 with 2:42 left. Nail-biting time - Cards held to 3 & out. Punt fair caught by Jags at their own 10 with 1:14 left to play. (You got the feeling Jacksonville was playing to get into overtime and settle things there). Jags went 3 & out (Dedes and Archuleta questioned why - if Jags were playing to get into OT - Marrone would have dialed up a pass on second down - essentially giving BA a "free time out" if he planned to go for a score).
Cards held Jax to 3 & out with Peterson returning the punt 12-yds to the Card 39 with 0:16 on the clock. On the first play from scrimmage, Gabbert hit K Williams (who managed to get out of bounds) for 1-yds. Ball on the Card 49. Then Gabbert hit DJ Foster - who managed to get both toes in-bounds while hanging onto the ball as he was pushed out of bounds - which put the ball on the Jag 39 and set up a desperation 57-yd FG attempt by Senior Citizen Phil Dawson. Attempt was good. Cards 27- Jags 24.
0:01 left. Final play was an on-side kick followed by a game of "keep away" that eventually went nowhere,
Passing: Gabbert was 22 of 38 for 241 yards, 2 TD and 1 Int. (Bortles was 19 of 33 for 160 yds, 0 TD's and 1 pick).
Receiving: Non-receivers Seal-Jones and A Peterson led the Cards with 4 catches apiece. 14 other catches were spread around among 8 other receivers.	Seals-Jones and Ja Brown had one TD apiece. Drops were cut down markedly
Turnovers: Plus-One. Each team gave up 1 interception apiece. Jax gave up 2 fumbles/Cards gave up one.
Foreman's 4Q TD - Came on the first Houston play after A Peterson failed to convert a 4th down. It looked like 11 Cardinal defenders standing around as Foreman breezed around RE for a 34-yd score that broke our backs. If you want to know where the Cardinals "are" right now as a team, that one play speaks volumes.
The OL - Perfect example of the "domino effect" created by awful play - Your QB gets hurried...your RB can't find any holes...your defense stays on the field too long...your receivers don't have time to achieve separation...tight coverage results in several drops of catchable passes...penalties disrupt your rhythm,
PP21 is Mortal - Got beaten by Hopkins in two one-on-one situations. Makes me nervous that this will encourage other NFL teams to test PP21 early and often. (I've long held that some very good players catch a break because their opponents don't even bother trying to outplay them one on one. In this case, the reverse may be true - we can't automatically assume other teams will lay off Patrick).
The Badger - Looked a step slow chasing slot receivers on crossing routes. Tackling was considerably less sure-footed than the Badger we've become used to).
Coaching - That 34-yd run by Foreman should tell you all you need to know. Cards hit the US Mails in the 4Q. It reflects on BA as a leader. He looked kind of sad on the sideline, and "sad" won't cut it.
Management - Memo to SK: How goes the OL, there goes the Cardinals. How to fix it: Short cuts won't work (injuries too frequent). Only solution is to "overdraft" and "over-buy") at the position so that we wind up with 10 to 12 linemen who can open holes and protect the passes. Anything less will doom us to perennial mediocrity.
It's hard to stay fired up, but there are always young players to pull for...the up-coming draft to follow...& a couple of upsets to root for.

There are many sites on the Web opposed to DMCA and the corruption of intellectual pursuit that it represents. This is mine.

A birthday. A graduation. An anniversary. Messages are changed almost daily on the “rock.” Situated on a hillside that leads down to Southcenter Parkway, a very large boulder awaits the next coat of paint, the next message. If it could tell a story, oh, the tales it would have. For three months, though, the story had stayed the same. The message was a simple one, but has held so much meaning.
“Pray for Seth” the message read, and with it, a beautifully painted picture of young man named Seth Barronian. Seth has lived to tell us about the story that surrounded the rock for 96 days.
On Saturday, April 21, Seth and his friend, John, both who are experienced long boarders, got together to do some long boarding. Set out to try a new route in the Tacoma area, the boys did what they always do before riding a new route: they walked the road, making mental notes of its terrain before embarking on a fun adventure. Midway into the ride, cruising at 20-25 mph, something went wrong. Terribly, terribly wrong. Around a big curve, with a truck approaching the two young boys, they proceeded with caution. John glanced back at Seth, who was doing good. Seconds later, he glanced again, and Seth was down. The truck driver, seeing what happened ahead, pulled over. By the time he reached Seth, blood was pooling out from a large gash in Seth’s skull. Convulsions began. Body going into shock. Blackout. A flurry of calls to 911, Seth’s mom, family members. It remains a mystery as to the cause, but witnesses say his board looks like it hit a stick. But the fact remains: he wasn’t wearing a helmet.
“I remember getting the call,” explained Sheri Barronian, Seth’s mom. “I was at the grocery store, and heard the words, ‘Seth has been in a longboarding accident and is being taken to Tacoma General. Hurry!’”
Once at Tacoma General, Seth was treated in the trauma center with severe head injuries, and within 1 ½ hours, was taken into surgery to relieve the pressure in the brain. The situation was grave.
“He only scored 4 out of 15 in the Glasgow Coma Score,” explains Sheri, “which really means severely disabled.”
During this time, the family had been gathered and they were escorted into a room to meet with the social worker.
“It was very frightening because my experience has been when a social worker gets involved in an emergency room, things typically aren’t going very well,” said Dr. Alan Barronian, Seth’s dad. “I really didn’t want to talk to anybody. I just wanted to see my son,” he added.
Dr. Barronian is well-known Orthopedic Surgeon himself, and practices at Southwest Seattle Ambulatory Surgery Center in Burien.
Following surgery, Seth was placed in an induced coma and taken to ICU for monitoring and further testing. An early CT scan showed a temporal fracture on his skull and his hearing could be impacted. The intracranial pressure fluctuated often into the dangerous zones, and the unknown still remained heavy on the family.
Seth’s older brother, Trevor, who quit his job to support Seth, set up a Facebook page, “Seth’s Condition,” where he posted updates and prayer requests beginning the day after the accident. The number of members rapidly grew as friends found out about the accident and wanted to keep up with any updates on his condition. The number topped at over 2,500 people, some of whom haven’t even met Seth, but heard about his accident and wanted to pray for him and the family, often sending words of encouragement and support.
Within a day, Reece Oliver, a fellow classmate at Seattle Christian where Seth attends school, began making purple t-shirts with “We ♥ Seth…Romans 15:13”. Monies raised from this project went to the family.
“Two-thousand dollars were raised from this, and we are now praying about what to use the money for,” explains Sheri. Teachers, students and parents of Seth’s school bonded together for support during the difficult days that followed.
“I have never seen the school come together spiritually as it did during this tremendously difficult time,” explained Dan Edmondson, a high school teacher at Seattle Christian. “Serendipitous prayer meetings and spontaneous times of worship would break out in the hallways as they once used to many years ago. It was amazing!” he added.
“It seemed like each time we were faced with another setback, and then things turned around for the better, we found out that at that very same time, people were praying for Seth,” said Sheri, blinking back her tears.
Students at Seattle Christian would gather around the flag pole wearing their purple t-shirts to pray. People from church groups, individuals across the world, and even the Pope prayed for Seth.
“Somehow, someone contacted the Archbishop in Seattle about taking the prayer request for Seth to Rome,” explains Sheri. “He was traveling to Rome, so the timing was perfect and he did see the Pope and the prayer request for Seth was one of those he received!” she added.
Against all odds, including infections, a blood clot, pneumonia and a host of other complications, just over one week after his accident, Seth’s breathing tube was removed. He was taken off sedatives, the central line was removed, and the first words out of his mouth when he woke up were, “Hi, Pay, Pay” and “I love you Momma.” Payton is Seth’s older brother.
“[On Thursday] the doctor told my mom that when he saw/operated on Seth Saturday night he didn’t believe that he would survive the next couple of days. He believed that the brain would continue to swell and eventually shut down. I just wanted to mention this because even though Seth is not even close to being recovered, or even out of critical condition, he has still exceeded expectations and remained alive.”
Prayers were continued to be lifted up for Seth, and prayers were continuing to be answered. With the good news that Seth was going to be okay, Daniel Blagovich, a good friend of Seth’s since 1st grade, had a another way to honor Seth. Ten days after the accident, on May 1, Daniel painted the longest-standing message on the “rock” that anyone can ever remember. Daniel explains that while he was painting, people were stopping on the hill to ask him what it was about, and he began to share Seth’s miraculous story.
“I wanted a way to remind people to ‘Pray for Seth’,” shares Daniel. “Seth and I share our love of art, and this was a good way to honor him,” he added.
While each day Seth gained ground, he was also faced with challenges of coping and comprehending all that had happened. He was often irritable, in and out of reality, but still making definite progress. When Trevor told him about the Facebook group to which he replied to the number of people following the posts, “I don’t even KNOW that many people!” When Trevor asked him if there was anything he wanted to say to everyone, Seth’s response was, “I am very sexy!” adding that he also wanted to say thanks to everyone.
Seth was later moved to Children’s Hospital in Seattle to begin his rehab program in preparation to go home. Regaining and relearning how to do certain things were part of his daily therapy sessions. They practiced speech, writing, vision, coordination and strength, and eight days later he was writing his name. It was during this time that the rest of the family felt comfortable enough to travel to New York City to see Payton graduate.
On June 29, 69 days post-accident, and miracle after miracle, Seth came home to Normandy Park. He continues doing physical, occupational and speech therapy two times a week and has a whole new look on life.
“Since when I felt God’s hand catch my head before I fell to slow me down, I now have a super, super, SUPER relationship with God. I just want to share my faith with other people and share how magnificent God is,” shares Seth.
The family recently took a 12-day trip to Europe that was planned long before the accident happened.
“We never thought in a million years he would be able to go. He went in a wheelchair but didn’t need one on the way back. We learned how to say ‘pardon me’ in French and Spanish because he kept running into people due to his vision loss,” laughed Sheri.
Seth is currently writing a speech on safety to share with local elementary school students. His main message? “Wear a helmet. We used to, when our parents told us to, wear our helmets around the corner and then take them off and throw them in the yard. It was because of a stupid selfish decision that I made that caused my parents to suffer so much. It’s not worth it. Listen to your parents – really!” said Seth with a serious look on his face. Seth plans to attend his Senior year at Seattle Christian, and just last week underwent an evaluation that determined he can attend part time to finish up the requirements he has left to earn his diploma.
“The family has been supported so much! God has a purpose and a plan – we just had to cling to that through it all,” shares Sheri.
Like the rock’s other messages before “Pray for Seth” and those to follow (the rock has now been painted over), Seth will continue to share his story of the miraculous journey which has now, he believes, brought him to a better place in life.
EDITOR’S NOTE: We heard about Seth’s accident several months ago, and had been trying to do a story on him while respecting his family’s privacy. We’d like to send a special shout-out to Judy Schwanke, who we used to work with in our early journalism days at the West Seattle High School Chinook! We’d also like to send our best to Seth and his family and friends, and we’re looking forward to hearing him play saxophone again for his ska band Juice, which we play regularly on our sister site SoKing Internet Radio.
What a tragic accident, I’m glad he’s doing well! I’ve seen the Message on the rock and wondered what happened.
I hope he continues to preach the message of “wear a helmet”, too many kids have accidents like this that could easily be prevented with the use of a helmet.
This is very sad. But the heavy religious tones make me sick to my stomach. Science saved this kid, not some bull&*#t fairy in the sky.
According to science, Seth had about a 20% chance of survival and, according to science, if he survived he would’ve been brain dead, deaf, blind, and confined to a wheel chair. Clearly something greater than “science” saved Seth’s life. It is hard to comprehend without being as close to the situation, but the positive prayer and support for Seth was so powerful you could feel it. If we had listened to scientific fact, we would have written Seth’s case off as hopeless. Instead, we put our hope and faith in something greater and chose to believe in the impossible. Believe what you want, but science didn’t save Seth. His life is a miracle.
Steve, I am sorry to say I have to agree with john. You should do your research and study statistics before you post a comment which reveals your lack of education.
To help you understand the science behind a recovery like this I will explain it for you. The doctors and nurses put the patient in a room and watch his vital signs and wait.
This is not about “religion” or some fairy in the sky, but about spirituality. While we are grateful for the science that attended to Seth’s human care, we cannot ignore the power of divine love expressed by so many that attended to a recovery that even the science could not explain. What is sad is that the beliefs of others could make one sick to his stomach. Let’s be grateful it was not someone else in Seth’s place who had to rely entirely on science in this situation.
Hearing the progress that Seth has made and continues to make, is definitely a Miracle. May he be blessed with continued Improvement and Appreciation for Life, in spite of his many challenges…….Hang in there Seth!!!!!… You are Special, and Loved by many…..
Or why anyone feels that attributing this young man’s survival to science or religion is appropriate or accurate?
God saved Seth. i see him every day looking better and better. God worked a miracle and through Seth people can now see how amazing God is.

Patricia Briggs, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Mercy Thompson novels, "always enchants her readers." (Lynn Viehl, New York Times bestselling author) Now her Alpha and Omega series-set in a world of shifting shapes, loyalty, and passion- brings werewolves out of the darkness and into a society where fear and prejudice could make the hunters prey...
They say opposites attract. And in the case of werewolves Anna Latham and Charles Cornick, they mate. The son-and enforcer-of the leader of the North American werewolves, Charles is a dominant alpha. While Anna, an omega, has the rare ability to calm others of her kind.
Now that the werewolves have revealed themselves to humans, they can't afford any bad publicity. Infractions that could have been overlooked in the past must now be punished, and the strain of doing his father's dirty work is taking a toll on Charles.
Nevertheless, Charles and Anna are sent to Boston, when the FBI requests the pack's help on a local serial killer case. They quickly realize that not only the last two victims were werewolves-all of them were. Someone is targeting their kind. And now Anna and Charles have put themselves right in the killer's sights...
Can I just say, I did NOT see that twist at the end coming. Whoa. I’m so anxious for the next book to find out what happens next!
Anna and Charles are still learning each other. I like that the going is slow, but I’m a little surprised they aren’t doing better with each other since they’ve now been together two years. I guess it makes sense since Charles has been keeping himself cut off from Anna for the last year, but I guess I expected things to be less awkward between them.
I really like the world Briggs has created. We saw more of it in this novel, since the conflict is away from the pack. It did seem like the final conflict was…not anti-climatic, exactly, but a bit less exciting than I expected given the build up. The villains weren’t a surprise, so maybe that’s why I struggled with it? The very last twist is what got me. I didn’t see that coming at all.
I love these books- and i might add- i got each of them signed at recent book signing! Patricia Briggs is the best. :).
since Briggs has synced up the timelines between the Mercys and this series, I would be surprised if the twist at the end isnt a major plot point in the next Mercy book..

“Thank you, Adam,” I told him. “Thank you for tearing Tim into small Tim bits. Thank you for forcing me to drink one last cup of fairy bug-juice so I could have use of both of my arms. Thank you for being there, for putting up with me.”
“Thank you for keeping me from being another of Stefan’s sheep—I’ll take pack over that any day. Thank you for making the tough calls, for giving me time.” I stood up and walked to him, leaning against him and pressing my face against his shoulder.
His arms closed around me, pressing flesh painfully hard against bone. Love hurts like that sometimes.”

Alan and Dale Klapmeier began their company in 1984, the same year they began working on the VK-30, a composite pusher that had been on the drawing board for five years. The aircraft company began at their family’s vacation farmhouse in North Freedom, Wis.
In 1994, the brothers moved company headquarters to Duluth, Minn., and began work on the SR20, a four-passenger, single-engine, piston-powered, composite aircraft. The aircraft made its maiden flight in 1995. In 1997, Cirrus started assembly of its first production prototype aircraft. When Cirrus certified its SR20 in 1998, the company became the only GA manufacturer in the world to offer a rocket-deployed airframe parachute as a standard feature. In 1999, Cirrus made its first customer delivery of the FAA certified SR20 and announced its all-glass cockpit, which first became available in the SR22. In 2003, the all-glass cockpit became standard on all its airplanes.
Cirrus captured 11 percent of the market for single-engine piston planes in 2001, and holds a 33-percent share today. Presently the world’s second-largest manufacturer of aircraft in its class, Cirrus delivered about 700 aircraft in 2006. In November, it celebrated its 3,000th production aircraft.
The company’s latest project is The Jet by Cirrus, a single-engine, turbine-powered personal jet incorporating successful design technologies from the SR20 and SR22 series, including its newest model, a turbonormalized SR22-GTS Turbo. For their personal jet, the brothers are focused on “ease of operation, rather than on jet performance.” The aircraft, which will have more than four seats, will “be the lowest, slowest and shortest-range jet available,” and will “fly higher, faster and farther than the SR22.”
While growing up on a dairy farm in Kentucky, A.L. Ueltschi fantasized about being a pilot. He opened a hamburger stand to earn money for flight lessons, soloed at the age of 16 and, at 18, borrowed the rest of the money he needed to buy a Waco 10.
Barnstorming led to a job flying for Cincinnati-based Queen City Flying Service and later, his position as personal pilot to Pan Am founder Juan Terry Trippe. While with Pan Am, Ueltschi determined that someone should train business pilots in the same diligent manner as Pan Am, so, in 1951, he formed FlightSafety International. Today, the company designs and manufactures full-motion flight simulators for civil and military aircraft programs and operates the world’s largest fleet of advanced, full flight simulators at more than 40 training locations. More than 75,000 pilots, technicians and other aviation professionals train at FlightSafety facilities each year.
Ueltschi is also the chairman of ORBIS International, a nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating unnecessary blindness worldwide. Since 1982, when the Flying Eye Hospital took off on its first sight-saving mission, more than 124,000 healthcare workers have enhanced their skills through ORBIS training programs. Thanks to ORBIS and ORBIS-supported programs, more than 135,000 eye surgeries have been performed and more than three million individuals have been treated.
A.L. Ueltschi, FlightSafety International founder and chairman of ORBIS International, received the Lifetime Aviation Entrepreneur award.
Bob Hoover has flown more than 300 types of aircraft, performed worldwide at more than 2,000 air shows and set records for transcontinental and time-to-climb speed.
He began taking flying lessons when he was 15, and after enlisting in the Tennessee Air National Guard, trained in the Army Air Corps. As part of the 20th Fighter Group, he flew 58 successful missions in the European theater. After a German Focke-Wulf 190 shot him down in February 1944, Hoover was held for 16 months in Stalag Luft 1. He escaped April 1945, stole a Focke-Wulf 190 and flew to Holland. After WWII, he was assigned to Wright Field’s Flight Test Division, where he flew as backup pilot to Chuck Yeager on the Bell X-1, the first aircraft to exceed Mach 1.
In 1951, he began a 36-year career with North American Aviation, testing and demonstrating airplanes, and he was the official starter in his famous P-51 Mustang at Reno Air Races for more than three decades. The International Council of Air Shows inducted him as the first member of its Hall of Fame and he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988. His contributions to aviation include two terms as president of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.
On July 20, 1969, a lunar module landed on the moon’s Sea of Tranquility. Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, aboard that vehicle, took the second small step for mankind on the moon. Aldrin is an enshrinee in the National Aviation Hall of Fame.

Shoemoney was founded by Jeremy Shoemaker back in 2003, but Jeremy had already proven to be an innovative businessman. While he was attending Western Illinois University, he started his first business which sold Macintosh games, which was followed by NextPimp.com. By 2006, he was named the Best Affiliate Marketing Blog by a little publication called Search Engine Journal. In 2007, Jeremy teamed up with David Dellanave to start the eBay affiliate service AuctionAds – which was named the “eBay Most Innovative Application-Buyer” at the 6th annual eBay Developers Conference.
In 2007, life was pretty good for Pat Flynn. He was a senior drafter in a Bay Area architecture firm, a job that he loved. When the economy slowed in 2008, Pat was laid off and forced to think of another way to make a living. He took his experience of studying for the LEED – Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design – and launched a blog (GreenExamAcademy.com) that shared his study notes. This lead Pat to publish his first e-book, which resulted in $8,000 of income during its first month. Since then Pat has launched the Smart Passive Income Blog and the popular Smart Passive Podcast.
I am very impressed by Dowib, truly indeed. They come out with this brilliant internet business concept and gave many opportunities for us to make easy money without any hassle. Professionally designed and supported website, user-friendly technical and support team really opened my eyes and pleased my day! Congrats and good luck to you affiliate website business!
Make people care about you. You have to get them emotionally invested in you before you can sell them anything. In fact, Henry says that you should never try to sell something right away, at least not until people become fully vested in you and your personal journey. Russell Brunson calls this your Attractive Character. This is what's allowed both Henry and Brunson to achieve wildly-outlandish incomes from their affiliate marketing efforts.
There’s a good reason why ClickBank is still a strong contender, however it does tend to focus more on digital products which may be of questionable quality. Yes, the review process is more professional these days, but it’s still primarily focused on selling digital products, especially “how to make money” courses and the like. That being said, there are some genuinely high-quality products on offer, and few affiliate programs are bigger than ClickBank, especially in selling (primarily digital) books.
A “viral” product is one that is designed to spread (often quickly) to a great many people - this can be a great way of getting your affiliate links out there without ever having to create a website. You can produce a short 30-page eBook or a "special report" on a particular subject, insert links to affiliate products into it, then distribute your book through whatever means you like – you could tell people that they're welcome to give it away, sell it or put it on their websites. You can kick it off yourself by selling the eBook on eBay for a small amount.
I would especially like to thank your “support staff” – as I had to contact them at least 10 times for answers to things that I just didn’t understand (as I am new to this). They got back to me almost immediately and solved all my problems cheerfully – without making me feel stupid. I will most certainly recommend your site to everyone that I know that is interested in putting together a professional website without any hassles. Thank you for making it so easy.
Great article. Thanks for writing it. I am right now picking my theme and building my wordpress. I have my hosting and domain name. What I don’t get though from the article is whether you have to apply to Amazon to be an affiliate or if they accept everyone. How does that all work? Like if I build my site and post links to amazon’s products, they wouldn’t have my details to pay me my commission. Do the templates do all that for you automatically? I am finding it hard to choose one because I want one that automatically integrates the amazon products without making my blog look like a shop per se. I’m going to have a look on the amazon site to see if there’s any clues there. But I thought that was the finishing and crucial touch, which forgive me, seems missing from your well explained and detailed article.
Find and work with affiliates. Affiliates will help grow your business and help you tap into web traffic. There are many ways to meet and engage with affiliates, but the best way to access desirable affiliates is by building a reputation for yourself. You can do this by developing a popular blog or otherwise earning a large online following, or by becoming a published author of a book or article.[15] There are other ways of meeting affiliates, of course, and each method will vary in its success and required effort. Generally speaking, the basic course of action for acquiring affiliates typically involves one of the following methods:
This is one the cleanest designs I’ve seen of an Amazon Affiliate Website. It has a very professional look for a review website, but they don’t overcrowd you with product reviews right off. This site really sets itself apart with their actual videos and reviews inside of their test center. You know these testers are actually testing the product rather than copying a review from another site or making things up. It’s so legit that I will likely be back to this site for future reviews for my purchases. It really gains your trust with the photos and videos even though you know they are making money through the affiliate commissions. Plus they buy all the products themselves and never accept any products from the manufacturer to maintain objectivity, but when you bring in 3.1 million visitors per month, you can buy a few items to review.
If you have an e-book or online course that you'd like to promote, ClickBank makes that easy. Once you sign up as a vendor you can list your product with them and set the commission percentage you are willing to pay to anyone who chooses to market and promote your product for you. Once your product is listed, other ClickBank users will start promoting it on their own websites. This will drive traffic to the sales page on your website and hopefully result in sales.
First things first, choose a niche. You should choose something which interests you, you don’t mind learning about, or have the ability to pay someone else to write about. Consider the potential costs carefully before delving into something which you know absolutely nothing about. Another important aspect is to be confident that it will be a lucrative niche to work in. There needs to be an abundance of products to promote, and the commission levels need to be significant enough to give you a good profit each time a sale is made.
4. I don't reveal earnings or make income claims on the blog. Let's just say that I've been running this blog for 8 months now, often working 12hrs per day on it, and if you look at how much income the blog has generated I'd be working at below minimum wage. But that's fine as this is a long term project and it's what I expected, I'm not here for quick cash.
There are two ways to approach affiliate marketing: You can offer an affiliate program to others or you can sign up to be another business's affiliate. As the business driving an affiliate program, you'll pay your affiliates a commission fee for every lead or sale they drive to your website. Your main goal should be to find affiliates who'll reach untapped markets. For example, a company with an e-zine may make a good affiliate because its subscribers are hungry for resources. So introducing your offer through a "trusted" company can grab the attention of prospects you might not have otherwise reached.
Once you hit the green Select button you’ll end up on the domain name page. This is where the fun begins! Choose a good, short, easy-to-spell, and relevant domain name for your business. Keep in mind that the best .com names are long gone so get creative or use a .net if you need to. If you need some help please take a few minutes to read this article I wrote on the topic: domain name tips.
The product review website model is great since many shoppers use the internet to save time researching their potential purchases. If you choose this website type be prepared to face alot of competition. Since there are so many review sites out there you must find an approach or ‘hook’ that is unique to set your site apart. It’s best to drill down into a small segment of your niche and expand from there instead of casting a large net over an entire market.
Once you’ve done all the heavy lifting of niche selection, keyword research, and competition analysis, then you can finally start building your site. It’s important not to skip all the steps above. You’d hate to spend months on a site, only to learn that it won’t be profitable at all. All that hard work for nothing. You can read more about why I use WordPress for my Amazon sites.
Hi, Jamie! Very good list. I needed something like this for 2018 so that I know what to target in the future blogs I create. As for now, I’m comfortable using SiteGround affiliate network and it’s pretty good actually. Their hosting service is pretty much the best considered its price. I’ve tried others but SiteGround stands out. I’ll also try new affiliate networks, something from the list you have just provided. I think Amazon is too saturated at the moment, and I need a better network. 2018 will be interesting indeed.
Commission Junction is a long-running affiliate marketing company, and attracts some larger brand names for promoters to apply for. It’s at the bottom of my list for one reason only: They expect even the newest affiliate marketer to produce results in as little as six months, so it’s best to apply after you’ve already established your website and have some experience under your belt from other programs. That may make it sound like it’s not the best for beginners, and for those starting completely fresh in the affiliate marketing world, that’s very true. But, again, for those who have some experience with affiliate marketing (maybe you’ve been an affiliate partner with Amazon for a little while and want to move on), you can be very successful with Commission Junction.
You can make really good commissions from the eBay partner but it depends on the products which you decide to promote. Interestingly the commission levels vary according to where you are in the world not just on the products you decide to promote. One of the great reasons to sign up is that you can earn DOUBLE commissions in your first three months. They offer free to use link generators, ad creatives and widgets for you to promote different eBay items. eBay has over 162 Million active buyers which means there is a great potential to convert your traffic.
Shopify is a very popular site building platform for people interested in building eCommerce stores. It has been around for the past few years and seen significant growth in its user base over this time. You can earn a staggering 200% per sale for every new customer you refer to them, which means that there is up to $2400 per new customer on offer.
That being said, LinkConnector’s platform looks and feels outdated and is rather clumsily designed. Their dashboard also makes it difficult to find “hot” products or compare conversion rates, leaving affiliates somewhat in the dark about which products to choose. Ironically, despite their low-quality website, they offer some of the best customer service in the affiliate space.
Content is King – The more successful websites had content that was around 1,000 words per post. Google identifies this as better content and it’ll help your search rankings. It can’t just be gibberish though, it helps if you break up the content into 6-8 different sections so it’s easy for the user to navigate while still being lengthy. I used to think 300 words was good and 500 was above and beyond. I’ll likely spend even more time on articles and aim for around 1,000 words per article like my most popular article “Robinhood App Review” at 1,500 words.
Before you can even think about starting your first affiliate marketing website, you need to know what your website is going to be about in the first place. What topic(s) are you going to cover? What services will you promote and sell on your site? For those looking for advanced training on this, you can sign up for a high-quality training course like this one. Otherwise, here is a good video explaining how to find a good affiliate marketing niche:
This is a great example of an Amazon Affiliate Website that’s not a review site! It’s actually more like a food blog that recommends certain products through their blog and resource pages. With 1.6 Million Facebook Likes, Lisa Leak (owner) has become an authority on “real food” and uses this platform to sell other things like her own cook book. This example is more for a traditional blogger who wants to start monetizing their website rather than creating a review site.

Do you have any opinions about sites that got hit with Google Fred for having too much affiliate content? I think one of your other sites got hit (not TYS) and I saw you add a lot of new content but it’s not going up much. The same thing happened to me; I had too much affiliate content and got penalized; added more content but it’s not helping. I am thinking of just starting a new site and redirecting links to the new site. I feel like this penalty is unrecoverable….
After a few months, Charles was able to convert $4,000 into $1,000,000+ in profit. Of course, there were some hiccups along the way. Charles launched 14 unsuccessful campaigns and lost $4,000 before he found success. What makes Charles unique is he’s open about his failures and uses that to help advise anyone interested in affiliate marketing. Not only does his blog offer affiliate and marketing tips, Charles also shares lifestyle and career advice.
“The Rakuten Marketing team developed and executed an online marketing performance strategy that far exceeded our target goals for brand awareness, new customer acquisition and ROAS in our first-ever partnership with Disney.

We look forward to continued, long-term program success with Rakuten Marketing’s expertise and proven technologies.”
Will my target audience realistically spend this amount for the product? Again, your reputation is on the line here. Is the product you are thinking of promoting priced reasonably for your audience? When I was writing my ebook, I was stuck on pricing. I asked around for opinions. A number of people suggested I price my ebook at $47! Their idea was to price according to value, not size. In my mind that was crazy. My network was composed of a lot of stay-at-home bloggers, and my collective audience was comprised mostly of people without a whole lot of disposable income. There was no way anyone was going to pay $47 for my 30-page ebook.
The advantages of the affiliate marketing business model for the affiliate are quite obvious to anyone. Having the opportunity to effectively ‘sell stock’ without having any of the costs or responsibilities of manufacturing, buying or storing it is very liberating. In addition to this, when working with a high-paying network like MoreNiche, the profit potential is enormous.

Wealthy Affiliate is my top suggestion for two reasons: They offer in-depth training on how to be a successful affiliate marketer, and they offer round the clock support from other affiliates, both old and new, so it’s essentially a huge community of people working together to help each other be as successful as possible. It’s free to sign up, and once you get used to the way everything works, you can either upgrade to a premium membership or stick to the free one if you want to.
A relative newcomer to the affiliate space, MaxBounty was founded in 2004 in Ottawa, Canada. MaxBounty claims to be the only affiliate network built specifically for affiliates. MaxBounty is exclusively a CPA (Cost Per Action/Acquisition) company that doesn’t deal with ad banners or the like, just customer links that the publisher (blogger) chooses where to place on their website.
I do have a question, though, you state that longer articles are better (which I understand). I've found a niche that has a few keywords with very high CPC (no real affiliation program can be used though), with a few thousand searches a month. For each keyword I could probably 500 words on each keyword. Should I do this, or should I compile them into one big article? They keywords can be linked to each other, for example, "how to start running", "basics of running" etc. (Those obviously aren't the keywords, and more can be written on those). What would you recommend?

However, be aware that you need to submit an application to most of these networks to be accepted. Once you're accepted in, you're often required to apply directly to the merchant afterwards. So there are two layers or gates that you need to bypass. That's also why it's important to build up your platform and create that emotional bridge between yourself and your audience before attempting to promote anything to them.
I read this title and expected an awesome community of runners sharing their glory stories of braving the snow and rain to log in miles. Instead I’m directed to a boring treadmill site. This site is about 5 pages and a couple of additional pages for reviews for treadmills. The reviews are the only pages with any kind of lengthy content and those are still only around 800 words. The main redeeming quality about this site, is they are focusing on high price items so even a single sale of a treadmill is a nice commission. This is another example of a website you could make in a weekend. It’s motivating though because you know you can do better, right?

When promoting affiliate offers, just make sure you are fully aware of all the terms and conditions attached to your affiliate program. Some programs can be strict about how they allow you to promote their products. For example, some may limit you to banner ads and links only, while others will allow you to use paid advertising, but won't allow email marketing.
Earning income via Target affiliates, however, requires a bit of work. Cookies expire in just seven days, and commissions can be as low as just one percent, so you’ll need to be operating a high-traffic website in order to make serious cash with this program. But with Target’s much-beloved brand reputation and vast catalog, relevant product links can be a big earner for established influencers.
I relay the story of Dan Henry because it exemplifies the power of this thing called the internet that binds us all. And while Henry has succeeded on a massive scale, so many others have hit roadblocks, stumbled, fallen and failed. The large rate of failure helps to mystify and obfuscate this world of affiliate marketing because so many are trying to penetrate this market but so few are able to succeed on a large scale.

Swing trading is an investment technique where the asset is held for anywhere between a day to a few weeks with the idea of making profit from fluctuating prices or ‘swings’. Investors are not interested in intrinsic value of the stock but rather focus on price momentum.
The stock hold time usually lies between the two extreme ends – day trading, where asset is held for a day and trend trading, where asset is held for extreme long duration, to make use of the price movement.
There are lot of factors to be considered for a successful swing trading. Various technical analysis tools are used to identify the price patterns and trends. Large cap stocks perfectly fit the bill due to the fact that their fluctuation level is between the 2 extremes and their prices will move in a single direction for a few days or weeks and then over turn.
Swing trading should be performed when the market is at stalemate – the price of the specific stock gradually goes up for a few days and then comes down again near to its initial value and then this process keeps repeating. This allows the traders to invest in the stock and make profit of fluctuation as the change will be predictable.
Traders should seek an exit as soon as the stock values reach the probable limits. They should not look to wait until channel line is reached in a weaker market. The wait may be only useful if trend is stronger else it is very risky option.
For beginners, it is one the best methods out there due to low risk in initial stages. It also provides a good enough profit to intermediate and advanced level traders.

(ARA) - Your credit score affects what type of interest rates you get on credit cards or for buying a house or car, as well as your approvals for employment or apartment rental. It's important that you understand not only what your score means, but how to repair it.
By viewing your credit activity on a regular basis you can remove any items that may not belong to you, which can negatively affect your score. If you have a low credit score due to detrimental items that need to be removed or fixed, there are steps you can take to remove them.
GoFreeCredit.com teaches you how to manage your credit report and how to deal with credit bureaus and creditors. Credit monitoring, automatic notification of credit activity and a detailed personal analysis are all included in this online service.
Many times people don't realize there is negative activity on their credit report. Nor do they know which items bring the score down. These are the top damaging factors that can negatively affect your credit score:
Contrary to what most people think, it is possible to get negatively reported items removed from your report sooner than seven years. There is no law stating that it has to remain there that long, and by taking the right steps, you can get a record removed once the item has been appropriately handled.
Improving your credit increases your options for financial success. Knowing how to improve your score will benefit you the rest of your life.

This lesson discusses an often used, but rarely seen in books, method of teaching percents. Former students report this is one of the most useful algorithms learned in class.
The student solves real-world problems involving whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and common percents using one or two-step problems.
The student solves real-world problems involving decimals and fractions using two- or three-step problems.
The student solves real-world problems involving integers, ratios, proportions, numbers expressed as percents, decimals, and fractions in two- or three-step problems.
The student solves real-world problems involving percents including percents greater than 100% (for example percent of change, commission).
The student translates verbal expressions and sentences into algebraic expressions, equations, and inequalities.
The student solves single- and multi-step linear equations and inequalities that represent real-world situations.
1. Many books present 3 cases for learning percents: A) finding % of a number B) what % of a number another is C) a number is what % of another. Many present a different method for solving each of these. Students often become confused as to which method should be used, whether to move a decimal, whether to multiply or divide, and so on. Often there is trouble relating the case to a real-life problem.
2. Many veteran teachers use the -is over of- approach. Students should be familiar with solving proportions before going onto the percents.
Offer no explanation yet, but put up an example such as: WHAT IS 80% OF 30? Again without explanation (yet), fill in the proportion: X/30 = 80/100 and solve. Leaving this up, try another example and ask the students to predict to themselves in which spots the numbers will go. 15 IS WHAT PERCENT OF 25? Fill in the proportion (go slowly, draw the two lines and the equal sign, next fill in the 100, and last fill in the other two numbers) and solve. Do one more on the overhead without much explanation, just setting it up slowly and in the same method each time. Example: 20% OF WHAT IS 15? This algorithm is being taught in the -discovery- method and hopefully by now each student has a -light bulb- going on. (Students seem to remember it much more effectively if they discover what was done instead of being told.) For those who don't -get it- yet, ask for a volunteer to explain what is happening.
4. Give a few more examples, one at a time, on the overhead for each student to work individually. Circulate throughout the class, correcting errors, offering suggestions, giving one-on-one time to those who are having trouble. Keep saying outloud -IS OVER OF = % OVER 100- to drill it into the students.
5. This algorithm also works well with real-world applications, but students must first re-word the problem to fit the -IS OVER OF = % OVER 100- format . This requires some practice but incorporates valuable problem solving skills. Practice re-wording and setting up proportions for some real-life applications on the overhead.
6. Provide some examples for students to do as you circulate and check volunteer's answers. Once students -get it- they will be begging to have their's checked.
Informally assess students by circulating as students work on overhead examples. Determine mastery of concept from score on worksheet. (4 pts each)

The Beagle school has been a wonderful first educational experience for our son. He loves school, and feels supported. Our entire family has enjoyed the sense of community.
So last winter I printed out a bunch of decorative papers with the idea of covering my really ugly pattern storage boxes. Because they’re banker boxes. And really ugly. And I have access to a 60” color printer. Two, actually.
Unfortunately, in winter it was too cold to spray-glue. (It’s a verb. Yes, it is. No, really. Deal with it.) I decided to wait until spring.
Uh. Except, we didn’t actually have a spring and I forgot about it. I also might possibly have lost my spray glue. (That one is a noun…. also, I think “She has totally lost. her. spray glue.” is a fabulous idiom that we should all start using immediately. Yes. We should.)
I downloaded some free vector files, changed the colors, tiled them into 60” strips, printed them out and wrapped the boxes.
Here are the labels, which I printed on my printer at home and glued on to the box lids. Yes, “spray-glued”. They’ll probably fall off next week, at which time I’ll think of some other method for attaching them. Maybe.
You know… vinyl? That plastic stuff they used to put music on? Seriously… plastic stuff. And you put it on this round spinny thing and it made music. Then we all danced around the cave waving dinosaur bones and marveling at the miracle of fire.
Because that so is in line with what I learned in third grade science. With a cheap set of magnets. That positive energy attracts positive energy.
Statements like this are why upbeat, positive people irritate the crap out of me. Repel me, if you will.
Hey wait…. maybe opposites don’t attract. Stupid third grade science. I just can’t rely on you for anything.
This is the first page of my Pinterest “Clothes” board. (I called it Clothes Pin 1… get it? Clothes pin? Comic genius, people.)
I just randomly pin these things over months, so there’s not really any rhyme or reason to it. But this page looks pretty nice, right? Like, you’d think the person who pinned this stuff was pretty stylish, right?
There’s a name for that disorder where what you see in your head is totally different from what actually happens in reality, right?
Have you checked out The Color Of…? It’s some experimental software that Paul Overton featured on DudeCraft earlier this week. Gotta love it. They’re taking a bunch of photos pulled from Flickr based on your text parameter and then superimposing them to get an aggregate pixel color. Um. You put in a word, it finds pictures associated with that word and averages the colors. Then you get a pretty picture.
Now, one flaw so far is that this only uses Flickr for it’s photo sampling and presumably only uses tags to pull the images…. so you have a pretty limited range of images in your mélange. I could not, for instance, do “Beangirl” as it only pulled up six images when I tried that (none of them mine, since I don’t use Flickr).
I find them surprisingly evocative. For instance, the “Fargo” images had just one single landscape in the sampling and included several vintage cars and neon signs and people, and yet the end result looks strikingly like… well… Fargo. Coincidental, but amusing.
I think this will be very interesting with added options to broaden the search parameters to get a wider sampling of images. Or, uh, not so interesting. Uh, to normal people. I’m easily amused by playing with random color. Whatever. It’s my blog. I can play with the pretty colors if I want to.
I am of the belief that people intentionally pronounce their local place names in a totally ridiculous manner so as to highlight and pick off the people around them who aren’t local. Sort of a tag-and-shoot kind of thing.
I’m afraid I have a hard time taking anyone painted blue very seriously. Even Mel Gibson. No, especially Mel Gibson. No, especially especially Mel Gibson with a Scottish accent. And a kilt. Jeez, who approved that movie anyway?
Well, it's that time of year again folks. Yep. The Fourth of July. Independence Day. The day we celebrate throwing down the shackles of monarchial tyranny; we cheer casting off the chains of colonialist oppression; we raise our fists in triumph at our utter escape from having to eat things like marmite and kidney pie and kippers.
Unfortunately, this year I won't be celebrating this glorious freedom from fish-and-chips and lorries with a massive, crazily-expensive display of fireworks. Because of course this year we're in a drought. A bad drought. A really really bad drought. Everything around us is so dry that just thinking about matches or lighters or sparks is illegal. The grass in my backyard is so dry that yesterday I was afraid I might start it on fire with the lasers coming out of my eyes. Fortunately, I remembered that the lasers that come out of my eyes only have power to burn the Evil Monkeys and the Husband.
Still. No fireworks. Rather uncharacteristically I was sort of looking forward to them this year… mostly as an opportunity to get the Evil Monkeys out of the house for two hours since the Husband will in fact be working that night. And the Monkeys and I will be home together all day. And by 4 or 5 pm they'll be higher than a kite on the mounds of cheap, nasty candy they scavenged that morning at the Fourth of July parade. Because of course the only reason you go to a parade in our town is to be pelted by candy thrown by minor government officials and Shriners.
Damn. Now I'll have to interact with them and stuff. Sheesh. What next? Food and clothing? Shelter? The teaching of skills so as to become self-sufficient, productive human beings? Good grief.
Happy flippin' Independence Day. Don't mind me. I'll just be the person buried under a pile of crazed, sugar-ridden Evil Monkeys. Good thing I have lasers in my eyes.
Right. So due to the seasonal outbreak of math-geek fist-fighting, name-calling and general rowdiness, I'm sure you're all well aware (because I mean really, who isn't?) that this past Tuesday was once again Tau Day.
Anyway, I've decided that from now on all our holidays should be numerical puns. Unfortunately, this means they all have to revolve around math.
Still. Geeks fist-fighting over whether to use 3.14 or 6.28. That's pretty funny, right? Because it's just so super-hard to add "x2" to an equation. When you're, y'know… an astrophysicist.
I think we should all start a movement to use 1.57 instead. Um. That means we have to change the calendar so there's a January 57th. Let's see.... "Thirty days hath September, April, June and November. All the rest have thirty-one, excepting February... and January, which has 57."

Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL will release his forthcoming double album "Radio JXL: A Broadcast From The Computerhell Cabin" on June 2nd.
The album will be a two hour broadcast, with the radio as a central theme. One disc will be called "3pm" and represents daytime radio and dance music merged with pop music. The other disc, called "3am", reflects nighttime radio and is similar to what a DJ might do. It is very dance-orientated, it starts slowly and dubby, and builds up over 70 minutes to steaming techno.
The second CD, "3am", starts with the liquid cool ambience of Chilledand the spatial, digitised dub of Dubzilla, the journey moves through Casio'sstripped-down beats of before picking up pace with the 12" mix of Angels and the anthemic, guitar-led Breezer. The floor-rocking Nudgedrives into progressive dance territory whilst Redmounts and acid-powered assault on the senses before the 12" mix of Beauty Never Fadesintroduces Saffron's unmistakable vocals. Cosmic Curebrings an acoustically-tinged, melancholy edge before the CD closes with the grand, beatless strains of Rehsurc.
The first single will be ?Catch Up To Me Step? that Tom has made with blues legend and Grammy Award winning Solomon Burke.

A method for locating minutia in a gray scale image of a fingerprint using a pair of filters, called "Gabor" and "Minutia" filters, includes determining direction and spacing of ridges at regularly spaced pixels, aligning filters by ridge direction, determining outputs of filters where Gabor Filter has high level output when in parallel ridge flow and, due to phase discontinuity at a minutia, low level output when in neighborhood of a minutia. The Minutia filter exhibits opposite phenomenon, having low level output in parallel ridge flow and high output in neighborhood of a minutia.

A microfiche appendix containing computer program listings is provided with this application and includes one microfiche card of 69 frames.
This invention relates to an improved fingerprint identification system. Fingerprints are routinely used to identify individuals of unknown or uncertain identity, or to verify the identify of a person. A primary application is in law enforcement, and secondary applications are in security, credit, and entitlement program management.
An individual's fingerprints are unique and have been used to learn the identification of an individual by comparison searching through a fingerprint database that contains the name of the possessor of the fingerprints or by comparing a current fingerprint of claimed person to a fingerprint the person filed on record when earlier establishing his or her identity. Standard file image formats have been adopted for recording the 10 finger fingerprint images. The inked impression cards used for recording contain additional textual information specific to the individual, generally information such as: sex, race, height, weight, hair color, eye color, name, and alias names.
Prior art systems for fingerprint identification have included techniques for beating key features of a fingerprint, such as minutiae, which are features defined by bifurcations or endings of ridge flows in an image of the fingerprint, and for locating and identifying other features, such as cores and deltas, in order to classify fingerprints into class types of whorls, loops, arches, tented arches. It is important that few key features be missed and few false features be recorded. Prior art systems, however, have not provided a complete or reliable extraction of important fingerprint features.
There are generally two types of comparison searching. The first search compares a ten-print card to a file of ten-print cards. For ten-print to ten-print comparisons, the particular finger number is known for each fingerprint image; the rolled inked impression images are, in the norm, complete; the orientation of the fingers is known; and the quality of the images is normally good. This is, of coarse the result of imposing a standard format and a known process for registering the inked impressions of the fingerprints on the ten-print cards.
The second search technique is a latent print (or mark) to ten-print cards. A latent print is a fingerprint obtained in the field from the scene of a crime. A latent print image is lifted from some arbitrary surface through a variety of techniques. In contrast with ten-print cards, latent prints are generally partial prints; the finger number is generally not known with certainty; they are of poorer image quality; their orientation is often not known; and there may be only a single fingerprint available for searching.
Sometimes, a third type of search, latent-to-latent, is made when trying to determine if the same unknown person was present at two or more scene of crime locations.
Fingerprint images today are available on ten-print cards, which are digitized and stored electronic computer records. They can be received in digital electronic form via radio or wire links from external sources and remote terminals. Real-time or livescan devices obtain fingerprints by means of an optical or ultrasonic scanner that reads a fingerprint directly off of the finger. The real time sharing of information and cross searching across distributed network fingerprint databases is the current direction for fingerprint identification systems operation.
When a fingerprint database becomes large, it becomes unmanageable to use human experts to perform the searching operation, therefore the need for automated systems. Automated systems, which have been in operation for over 20 years, examine the images and extract and store the features that describe the fingerprint; they also store any supporting alphanumeric textual information appearing on ten-print cards or with the latents, the textual data is that which would be of benefit in performing comparisons.
A typical automated fingerprint identification system includes a set of repository fingerprint cards 10 (FIG. 1 ) which represent an existing database of ten-print cards kept by the FBI, other law enforcement agency, or private security, credit, entitlement or other organization. These cards contain the fingerprints of known individuals, along with other pertinent information. Card 12 represents a single ten-print card of a candidate whose fingerprints are to be compared with those in the existing database 10 and latent print 14 represents a single fingerprint of an unknown individual. The candidate and latent prints are also called search prints.
An optical Scanner 20 scans the image of each fingerprint on cards 10 and 12 and latent print 14 to provide a digitized version of the gray scale image of each fingerprint. The digitized fingerprint gray scale images from Scanner 20 may be stored in storage device 25 or sent directly to an Encoder 30. The Encoder 30 extracts certain useful information from the gray scale image, such as the location of fingerprint features of cores, deltas, and minutiae. The Encoder 30 provides certain information to a Classifier 40, which in turn determines the pattern class of each fingerprint. Some automated systems may leave the more difficult and critical operations, such as classification, to manual (operator) means or operator assisted means.
A Products File 50 stores several items of feature information in digital format regarding each fingerprint. While illustrated in FIG. 1 and described herein as a card file, the Products File 50 is typically a digitized computer database. For each fingerprint, the Products File typically stores the pattern class determined by the Classifier, and the core, delta, and minutia information determined by the Encoder 30. A manual input device 55 is also provided to enter pattern class, if necessary, along with any known textual data describing the individual whose fingerprints are recorded. A candidate Products File 60 may be created from either a Search Candidate's print card 12 or a copy of his/her latent print(s) 14.
When conducting a search comparison, the feature information of the Search Candidate is hierarchically and sequentially compared with the textual and feature record for each known individual whose fingerprints reside in the repository for the Products File database.
The components of the system used in searching are depicted in FIG. 2, where the selection and matching of one or more of a candidate's fingerprints, as contained in a candidate's Products File will be described. Information from the repository Products File 50 is made available to a Search Filter 70. This filter limits the number of repository fingerprints to be compared based on textual data and the pattern class of the Search Candidate's fingerprints, and sometimes on additional fine grain classification data. The fingerprints of selected file repository candidates fingerprints from the Search Filter 70 are then compared with the Search Candidate's fingerprints in the Matcher component 80, and finally, the best match is found in selection stage 90.
The search always seeks to find that one to one correspondence of fingerprint features that would provide strong assurance that the search prints and file prints belong to the same individual. The systems typically score the results of the comparisons and produce a rank ordered list of a fixed number of list positions (typically 4 to 10). It is then up to a trained fingerprint examiner to examine the set of search prints in comparison to file sets of prints for the list named File Candidates with highest scores. The examiner must determine whether there is indeed a match to one of the File Candidates appearing on the list.
The sequence of search typically proceeds in a down selection process, first eliminating those File Candidates whose personal descriptions are dissimilar, then those with differing classification, and finally those with differing subordinate classifications. The filter down selection processor narrows the list of File Candidates to successively smaller and smaller lists (that is, fewer candidates).
The Matcher component 80 of the system performs the final comparative analysis between search print and each file print. It matches minutiae between search print and file print. Matching minutiae is performed through mathematical calculation that evaluates and scores how closely minutiae in the search print are to having the same spatial and angular positioning as the candidate file print being considered. The evaluative process typically proceeds first to align the two prints, then attempts to find correspondence by pairing minutiae in the search fingerprint with what appears to be its most probable counterparts in the file fingerprint, and then proceeds to calculate and evaluate spatial and angular differences. The comparative process is complete when matching comparisons between Search Candidate prints and all candidate file prints have been made and a score for each file print comparison is available. The scores are then evaluated and those with scores that definitely indicate large dissimilarity in minutiae pattern are eliminated from the list. The remainder of the list contains File Candidates with similar and closely matching minutiae patterns. The higher the score the more that the Search Candidate's fingerprints closely match the File Candidate's fingerprints and the greater probability that the Search Candidate is the same as the File Candidate person on record in the repository file database. The list is rank ordered and the top scoring "n" number of candidates presented to the operator; the number "n" typically being set at the system operator's discretion.
For ten-print to ten-print searches, the operator also typically has the option to select the number of fingers to be compared (1 to 10) and to designate the specific fingers to be used in the comparative searches. Use of more fingers provides a more discriminating selection (greater selectivity) but entails considerably more time in performing minutiae matching. For latent to ten-print searches, the operator's options are greater, as it frequently is not known exactly which numbered finger the latent print is from. Hence the latent print must be searched across multiple fingers of each file ten-print record.
A coarse level of fingerprint identification is available by examining macro fingerprint features, namely cores and deltas. Core and delta placements give rise to higher level descriptors that characterize similarity. Pattern type descriptors are defined by the Henry system and the FBI's National Crime Information Center system. The loop, whorl, and arch are examples. A series of second level descriptors are used to further associate similar fingerprints into like groupings. For example, for whorls, a second level descriptor indicates whether the ridge contour just below the left delta is inside, outside, or meets the right delta.
These coarse level descriptors are stored away for each file print and are used as sort discriminates by applying various techniques such as ordered list sorting, storage binning, and retrieval access methods. These techniques aid and provide for efficiency of process in the early stages of down selection. Since the comparative discriminates are macro level features, there still remains a large number of File Candidates that posses equivalent descriptions of their characteristics, and hence must be passed on to a Minutiae Matcher for calculating comparisons to be performed.
If other pre-measured macro feature characteristics could be used in the sorting process along with the macro features, the list could be further limited before passing on to the Minutiae Matcher component. There are such features, but prior art automatic systems have not been able to effectively employ them, primarily for two reasons: prior art systems do not reliably find or accurately identify the x,y location of macro features, and they do not have processes that provide for routinely extracting ridge count measurements between macro features.
Prior art matchers try to superimpose two sets of minutiae points in order to count the number of minutiae which are in common to the two fingerprints. Some typical prior art matchers are the M19, M27, M32, M40, M41 and M82. They are described in the following publications: National Bureau of Standards (NBS) Technical Notes 538 and 878, and NBS Special Publication 500-89.
In the final analysis, the list of high scoring matches presented to the operator requires an expert examiner visually to compare the fingerprints of the Search Candidate to each of the listed close match File Candidates. This manual labor step and the number of fingerprint comparisons that the examiner must view places limits on the throughput, the turn around time of the system, and drives the life cycle cost of operation.
If an automatic system could be verified as highly reliable and as having the selectivity to always identify the exact matches, a final list could be limited to one, two or three, and the corresponding examiner workload reduced. The problem is that prior art systems are not highly reliable or selective, as commonly acknowledged and addressed in many patent applications in the area. They require uniform, high quality images to function reliably and consistently. As a result they do not handle latents very well, and they frequently have difficulty with the image variations that occur on ten-print card images.
Non ideal image quality as a result over inking, low contrast, scratches, and pencil marks cause prior art automatic encoders to produce false minutiae, fail to record real minutiae and macro features, and mis-locate real features. Additionally, acquired artifacts in the fingerprint itself, such as cuts, scrapes, abrasions, and scars, can cause the systems to similarly fail to reliably identify real features. A description of these shortcomings may be found described in prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,790,564, 4,047,154, 4,646,352, 4,015,240 and 5,040,224. In fact, there are some prior art patents that accept the automation shortcomings as insurmountable and describe systems designed with a human in the loop to perform the classification, feature checks, and other processes not reliably left to prior art automation. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,047,154 and 4,607,384 are two such examples.
When false features are inserted, or existing features missed or improperly encoded, the workload for the Minutiae Matcher will be increased and the scoring discriminate peaks reduced as a result of noise and errors that add in along with the real score contributors. Consequently, reliability is down, the final list must contain more candidates to insure a real match is assured of making the list, and therefore the human examination workload increases. The shortcomings of the prior art systems are routinely compensated for by an examiner reviewing the automatic encoder results and manually removing false minutiae, entering information on missed features and minutiae, and correcting positional errors.
The larger the database of file prints becomes, the more impractical it becomes to rely on passing on automatic machine determinations to an operator for quality checks and corrections. The more examiners involved, the greater the differences of results and biases introduced will become.
Also, latent prints and their lower quality are frequently not trusted to an automated encoder at all, but rather are manually encoded. The requirement for a human workload element has significant negative impact in throughput, response time, and costs irrespective of which step in the process it is introduced. So much so that the subject of other patents has been to find methods of performing the minutiae pairings in the minutiae matching process to minimize the detuning of discrimination that comes from the presence of false minutiae and to introduce quality reference as an adjustment in scoring. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,790,564.
Prior art systems for fingerprint identification have included techniques for locating key features of a fingerprint such as minutiae, which are features defined by bifurcations or abrupt endings of ridge flows in an image of the fingerprint, and for locating and identifying other features, such as cores, deltas, loops, arches, tented arches and other visually discernible characteristics of the fingerprint. It is important that most key features be found and few false features be recorded. Prior art systems, however, have not provided a complete or reliable extraction of important fingerprint features.
The present database of fingerprints in the FBI archives includes approximately 30 million ten-print cards. In addition to an individual's actual fingerprints, these cards contain other information about that person, such as age, eye and hair color, height, race, sex, weight and the type of crime committed.
In a comprehensive system, one must not only compare a newly created or Search Candidate ten-print card to the repository database, but one must also be able to compare a single, perhaps latent, print with the database. This requirement makes it critical that each fingerprint's features be carefully and accurately extracted and properly classified in order to make search comparison and matching possible in the shortest amount of time.
In prior art systems, an image of each fingerprint is often converted from a gray scale image to a binarized (black and white) version before feature extraction is performed which can cause valuable information to be missed and false minutia to be produced. Further, such systems cannot distinguish poor quality images from those of good quality, resulting in less than optimum performance.
Accordingly, there is a need for an improved fingerprint identifying system which provides for the accurate identification of fingerprint features and for rapid comparison of a candidate's fingerprint with those fingerprints of individuals in the repository database.
This invention relates to an improved encoder for use with an automated fingerprint identification system. The encoder of this invention analyzes a gray scale image of a fingerprint to provide an accurate identification of minutiae, their locations, and directions; to provide a quality map, a Ridge Angle Map, and a Ridge Frequency Map of the image; to provide an identification of cores and deltas and their locations and a ridge count between associated cores and deltas; and to store this fingerprint information in a Products File.
Typically, there are several steps in creating and using an automatic fingerprint identification system. First, the images of sets of fingerprints for all individuals on record in an existing paper records or stored image records database are scanned to detect and locate characteristic features; then each fingerprint is classified according to type. This information is entered as a Products File for the particular individual into the repository database for future access and reference. For digital computer processing, the repository is typically a large scale magnetic disk storage device that allows random access. Each Products File for an individual maintains a reference pointer to the source document of gray scale fingerprint images. The gray scale images are referenced by the absolute authority, the human examiner, for confirmation of machine developed identifications resulting from searches of the Products File.
Day to day requests are received to query the repository database for the identity of an individual. The query includes an image copy of latent fingerprint(s) or set of ten fingerprints on a ten-print card. The supplied fingerprint images are scanned to provide digital image representation that the automatic fingerprint identification system can evaluate. An additional source of queries may originate with the currently available livescan devices that optically or ultrasonically scan the finger directly yielding a digital fingerprint image. Livescan devices can reside in remote locations, such as police squad cars, and transmit their queries and images via radio link. The digital fingerprint images (from Scanner, or livescan) are then transferred (or translated, as necessary) to the system's Advanced Encoder and Automatic Fingerprint Classifier to extract and classify the feature data that comprises a Products File. Finally, the Search Candidate's Products File is compared to the Products File of each individual in the repository database to determine whether the Search Candidate exists in the database, and if he/she does, to learn his/her identity.
The comparative search performs successive levels of elimination of candidates from the repository database. The down selection process starts with high level information specific to the individual such as sex, race, color of eyes, etc. (as known and recorded for ten print card records) and proceeds to further limiting of the File Candidates through comparison of recorded macro fingerprint descriptions called classifications. A second stage of comparative searching is employed for those File Candidates who remain after the Search Filter process is complete. They remain as being potentially the Search Candidate individual, because they have been determined to be similar to the Search Candidate on the basis of all the macro level comparisons.
The second stage of comparisons is Minutiae Matching. In essence, the pattern of minutiae from the file print is overlaid on top of the pattern of minutiae for the fingerprint of each File Candidate remaining. The overlay is mathematically evaluated to find when the two patterns match and the Search Candidate is a particular individual in the database. More than one fingerprint is used in the comparative evaluations. Processing more fingers to assure identification of sameness of fingerprints and individual decreases throughput and increases turnaround time.
If high levels of discrimination can be built into the identification system, then confidence can be had with using only a few fingers, at times one. All the speed up and lower life cycle cost benefits are available with high levels of discrimination, commonly referred to as selectivity. High selectivity comes from choosing a set of features and classifications that are fine grain in discriminating value, employing accurate and repeatable processes, employing processes that operate reliably on poor quality images and over a greater dynamic range of image quality, and employing search separation processes that function with high levels of discrimination.
In prior art systems, selectivity is inadequate for large systems. They typically get by for small file databases where ten's of thousands file card pulls are involved and the time is affordable for using four to eight fingers. The prior art is woefully and critically inadequate for ten print and latent searches (particularly latents) through national sized databases with their 10's of millions of entries. A major contributor to poor selectivity is that existing methods employed detect too many false minutiae, and their complicated post-processing algorithms cannot reliably filter them out. This softens the discrimination ability and over burdens the Minutiae Matcher with unnecessary and non-productive workload.
In the present invention, a unique encoder (referenced as Advanced Encoder) scans a gray scale image of both search and file fingerprints to extract certain discriminating features, such as ridge angle, ridge frequency, the location of the cores, deltas, ridges and minutiae. The Advanced Encoder applies algothrims in the class of Direct Estimation of Orientated Patterns and Digital Signal Processing to: extract fingerprint features, measure quality, and identify areas void of features.
The Digital Signal Processing technique exploits global and local spectral characteristics of fingerprints. At the same time that the Advanced Encoder is extracting feature data, it measures and records the quality of the information being extracted. The quality measurements made and accumulated for each fingerprint are utilized to improve overall performance of the system. The Advanced Encoder has been designed so that it accurately extracts features while achieving very low false alarm rates.
With the exception of the Quality Map identification, many of the features extracted by the Advanced Encoder are familiar ones in fingerprint science. These features are: minutiae (location and direction); Ridge Angle and Ridge Frequency Maps; cores and deltas. Introducing measurement of quality, detecting and recording non minutiae areas and applying the quality knowledge to mathematical operations and decision processes increases selectivity in the Minutia Matcher component of the system. Knowledge of non-minutiae areas is recognized and used by examiners but is not part of prior art automated systems operations.
In the present invention, minutiae are detected using a pair of matched filters. The filters are engineered so that when they encounter the spatial neighborhood of a minutia, the output of one of the filters grows large while the output of the other filter drops to zero. In areas away from minutiae, the filter outputs fluctuate about nominal values, which are indicative of the quality of the fingerprint image. The minutiae detection filters are orientated and scaled using local Ridge Angle and Ridge Frequency, which are computed from Direct Estimation of Orientated Patterns and Digital Signal Processing theory. Cores and Deltas are located by examining the gradient surface of the Ridge Angle Map.
Each fingerprint is then automatically classified by a unique classification component of the system that utilizes neural networks and fuzzy logic, and the resulting data is stored in a comprehensive record. The unique classifier has been named the Automatic Fingerprint Classifier (AFC). The AFC can ensure operating accuracy and is compatible with manual pattern level classification. The records of all fingerprints on file are available for immediate comparison with new (Search Candidate) fingerprints which undergo the scanning, minutiae detection, core and delta identification, and classification processes.
Knowing the quality of features is a tremendous aid to decision processes. Hence, a criterion enforced throughout the system embodiment is the measurement of quality for every feature extracted and classification made. Examples of quality measurements are: What is the confidence that a detected minutia is a real minutia? What percentage of the fingerprint was interpretable? How large was the largest non interpretable area? Was it large enough to change classification, if the information within it were known? These measurements have been of great value in tuning the algorithms. This attention to quality metrics produces three additional benefits: (1) highly reliable automatic classification; (2) an automated file organization that provides for selection of best quality print pairs to be selected and used in matching; and (3) ability to update quickly and conveniently the file repository (that is, an ability on an continuous basis to renew, refresh, and improve the quantity and quality of feature data characterizing fingerprints of individuals of record on file in the Products File database).
For search comparisons a Search Filter was designed that operates using alphanumeric ten-print card textual data (and any latent print textual data), macro features, classification typing, and fine grain classification features to quickly identify a reduced number list of File Candidates whose prints have the possibility of being a match to the search prints under consideration. The limited number of candidates from the file then have their fingerprints compared with the search prints via a unique Minutiae Matcher.
The Search Filter reduces the workload that is passed forward to the Minutiae Matcher, which is the most computationally intensive component. The Search Filter draws on a unique design feature of the structure of the repository's Products File database. A unique method employed to solve the problems of fingerprint Products File organization, we've named Dynamic Binning, which allows for the search filtering to be adaptive to the quality and quantity of feature data available between the search Products File and each individual repository Products File. It allows for automatic selection of the best fingerprint combination pairings between search and file prints to be identified, selected, and used in filtering and minutiae matching without going into a reexamining the fingerprint images. This design also provides for minimal overhead operations in file maintenance and allows for easy renewal of file print records when ones of better quality become available for an individual in the file, again without laborious, time consuming reexamination of the fingerprint images.
A two-stage Minutia Matcher exploits the products from the Advanced Encoder and can compare fingerprints over a wide range of print problems, such as distortion and poor quality, while still providing performance results with excellent selectivity and reliability. The two stage matcher is also designed such that the measures of each stage are orthogonal and hence a greater level of discrimination is available when decisions are formulated based on the results from both.
Because of the care given at each step of the identification process, only a limited number of prints are compared, and as a consequence, the speed of the identification process is significantly improved over prior art systems and the requirement for manual human assistance or intervention to insure quality and reliability of operation is significantly reduced.
The quality of an image can vary significantly over the fingerprint, but if properly measured on a pixel by pixel basis, the detection of key features of the print can be enhanced, and any areas of the image of low quality can be identified.
In the present invention, the image is examined to develop a pixel-by-pixel quality map to describe the quality of the image at all locations: Ridge Angle and Ridge Frequency Maps are generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis: dual matched filters and coincidence logic are employed to detect minutiae; cores and deltas are identified by computation of gradient maps; and the number of ridges between associated features is accurately counted.
Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved Encoder which analyzes a gray scale image of a fingerprint to provide an accurate identification of minutiae, their locations, and directions; to provide a quality map of the image; to provide a Ridge Angle Map of the image; to provide a Ridge Frequency Map of the image; to provide identification of cores and deltas and their locations; to provide a ridge count between associated cores and deltas; and to store this fingerprint information in a Products File.
It is another object of this invention to provide a large measure of improvement over prior art automated fingerprint identification systems for improved selectivity and reliability. This in turn will provide for reduced human workload requirements, greater throughput, quicker response time, and lower life cycle cost investments.
Prior art systems utilize pixel-based manipulations and decision processes that are inherently heuristic, and hence open ended. Problems are fixed and improvements achieved as the problems occur because it is impossible to enumerate all the conditions beforehand. An objective is to provide a more robust and comprehensive system design where all the components from the Encoder, to Classifier, to Search Filtering, and finally to Minutiae Matcher function adaptively to achieve the best performance possible irrespective of print quality, finger number, print orientation, or limitations of available data from either the search print or the file print.
It is a further object of this invention to employ commonly established, recognized, and accepted classification characteristics so that the operation, intermediate products produced, and results obtained are understandable and familiar to the user community.
It is still a further object of this invention to provide an Encoder that effectively operates with poor quality images containing artifacts and having poor signal to noise conditions.
It is another object of this invention to measure and associate quality, with the image and those mathematical operations that detect features and those that make declarative decisions, such as delta or core determination. It is a related objective that the quality information be passed forward in the system so adaptive methods can be used along the process chain to extract the best possible performance from each element of the system. Having quality information stored for each fingerprint of the repository File Candidate, allows for an adaptive decision to be made during the conduct of comparing the Search Candidate to the File Candidates. The best quality fingers that the search and File Candidate have in common can be selected for performing minutiae matching.
It is a further object of this invention to establish dual hypothesis technique of matching for improved selectivity and reliability. Dual hypothesis matching, in addition to using minutiae matching for comparisons, utilizes non minutiae areas for matching comparisons. If an area of the search print is identified as having no minutiae within it, then if there is a possibility of a match, the corresponding area on the file print should also be devoid of minutiae; if it is not, the score is degraded.
It is another object of this invention to maintain and to use in feature extraction as much information as possible that is resident in the original gray scale image of each fingerprint. To accomplish this, image binarization as utilized by most prior art systems will not be employed. Instead algorithms will be applied which enhance the gray scale image but at the same time maintain image fidelity. Additionally the feature extraction algorithm is designed to operate with gray scale information input, not merely black and white image input data.
It is a further object of this invention to develop a capability to measure and to record ridge counts between paired features such as core-to-delta ridge counts, core-to-core ridge counts, and minutiae-to-minutiae ridge counts. Having ridge count data on core and delta pairings provides a fine grain classification feature that can be used in down selection filtering to reduce the File Candidate list and the workload passed on to the matcher component of the system.
The capability developed is applied for ridge counting between minutiae at the Matcher stage of operation. Ridge counting between minutiae is intentionally not performed in the Advanced Encoder, but deferred until matching operations. This provides a method of comparison not otherwise available with reliable function. At matching time those areas between Search Print and File Print which have in common good quality minutiae are used to perform minutia to minutia ridge counting on each print. The track that is developed between minutiae (proceeding from one to the next, and then to the next) forms what is called a minutiae constellation. A constellation is developed for each print (Search and File) and compared for being the same template pattern. Ridge counting and constellation mapping is performed dynamically. As a Search Print is sequentially compared against each candidate file print, the set of minutiae (constellation) used from the Search Print changes. The set of good quality areas available in common between search and file fingerprints determine the minutiae that will form constellations in each print. This promotes the use of as many high confidence comparison points as possible. The ridge counting between minutiae is done using Ridge Angle and Ridge Frequency at matching time as they were stored in the Products File.
It is a object of this invention to significantly reduce and comparatively eliminate the recording of false features.
It is an object of this invention to improve the detectability of image features, and to insure that the capability is maintained over a wide range of image quality.
It is a still further object of this invention to provide information to assist in reliable automatic classification of fingerprints, an improvement over prior art systems.

Reference is now made to the drawings, and particularly to FIGS. 1 and 2 which are block diagrams showing the fingerprint identification system of the present invention. In FIG. 1, repository fingerprint cards 10 represent the existing database of ten-print cards kept by the FBI, a law enforcement agency, or a private security organization. These cards contain the fingerprints of known individuals, along with other pertinent information. Card 12 represents a single ten-print card of a Search Candidate whose fingerprints are to be compared with the existing database 10. Likewise latent print 14 represents a single fingerprint or multiple fingerprints lifted from a scene of a crime or other area. Latents are from unidentified individuals. They can be of unknown finger number and are in general only partial prints.
An image Scanner 20 scans the image of each of the 10 fingerprints on individual cards 10 and 12 and latent print(s) 14 to provide a digital version the gray scale image of each fingerprint. A typical fingerprint is shown in FIG. 3. One commercially available optical Scanner 20 is a Model T3-DGS-HR manufactured by Primagraphics. This Scanner has a resolution of 500 dots per inch and for the typical fingerprint card registration window of the range of 1.4" by 1.6" generates an image of the fingerprint area that is typically 750.times.800 pixels, with each pixel being represented as one of 256 levels of gray with zero representing black and 255 representing white.
The digitized fingerprint gray scale images from Scanner 20 may be stored in storage device 25 or sent directly to Encoder 30. The Encoder 30 extracts certain useful information from the gray scale image, such as the location of cores, deltas and minutia, as well as the quality of the gray scale images over the entire image. The Encoder 30 provides certain information, as will be explained, to a Classifier 40, which in turn determines the pattern class of each fingerprint.
In the preferred embodiment of this invention, a repository Products File 50 stores several items of feature information as a readable record in digital format regarding each fingerprint. Although illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2 and described herein as a card file, the Products File 50 is typically a digitized computer database. For each fingerprint, the Products File stores several items of information including fingerprint data, such as pattern class generated by the Classifier 40, and the core, delta, minutia and quality information generated by the Encoder 30. A manual input device 55 or the Scanner 20 is used to also capture alphanumeric textual data (barcoded information also) that contains date, file control number, and individual descriptors, such as age, sex, race height, weight, hair color, and possibly data relating to the crime, in the case of latent prints.
A Search Candidate Products File 60 may be created from either a ten-print card 12 or a latent print 14. A full description of the Products Files 50 and 60 generated by the present invention is found in Table 1; its contents will be described later.
The selection and matching of one or more of a candidate's fingerprints, as contained in a candidate's Products File, will be briefly described in connection with FIG. 2. Information from the repository's Products Files 50 is made available to a Search Filter 70. This filter limits the number of File Candidates's Products Files to be compared based on the pattern class. The selected Products Files from the Search Filter 70 are used to compare fingerprints to those of the Search Candidate in the Minutiae Matcher component 80, and finally, the best match is found in selection stage 90.
In the present invention, attention will be given to the details of operation of the Encoder 30 and its input to the Products Files 50 and 60. The Encoder 30 includes the means to enhance the fingerprint image, to measure ridge angles, to measure ridge frequencies, to detect and locate minutiae, to measure and map fingerprint quality across the image, to detect and locate cores and deltas, and to count ridges between associated core and deltas. The various functions of the Encoder 30 are listed generally in Table 2.
The first step in the operation of Encoder 30 (step 1 in Table 2) is to enhance the fingerprint image. In general, gray scale images are not of uniform clarity or contrast across the image. There is also variability from image to image on a ten-print card, and from card to card, or latent to latent. This a result of the variability in taking of ten-print fingerprint rolled ink impressions or the variability in latent prints. A gray scale image could also have scratches, pencil, or pen marks as a result of lack of care in handling and processing. As will be explained, each fingerprint image will first be processed to produce the Enhanced Gray Scale Image shown in FIG. 4. Gray scale image enhancement improves overall performance results from the system processing elements that follow.
A typical example of a gray scale image and the results achieved through enhancement processes is shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, respectively. Note the uniform contrast across the inked area. Poor quality areas in the enhanced image are easily removed using a by-product of the method for finding ridge angle. FIG. 5 shows an enhanced contrast image with those areas that would yield uncertain results removed from further consideration.
The preferred embodiment includes means for producing an Enhanced Gray Scale Image. The output of the Scanner 20, or the digital image storage device 25, represented by block 100 in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, is a full scale image I.sub.FS, nominally an 800 by 800 pixel image which is applied to the image enhancement device 105. Image contrast enhancement is achieved in two steps. The first step is to attenuate high frequency noise from the full size image by passing the image I.sub.FS through a low pass filter 110. The filtered image is then enhanced using a nonlinear, local contrast enhancement filter 120. The details of the low pass filter and the nonlinear contrast enhancement algorithm may be found in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 respectively.
The only input required is I.sub.FS. The output of block 120 is I.sub.FSCE, or a full scale image, contrast enhanced, which appears in FIG. 4. FIG. 5 is the same image, but the Quality Map Q.sub.smooth was used to remove areas of poor quality. This image is an Enhanced Gray Scale Image having 256 levels of gray and an even power distribution. An enhanced image formed in this manner will be used by several components of this invention.
An alternative process could employ standard filtering for obtaining an Enhanced Gray Scale Image 100. Using this technique, a band pass filter is applied to the image. This operation could be done using convolution, but the kernel size was too large to make that practical. Instead, we multiplied the Fourier transform of the image by the Fourier transform of the impulse response of our band pass filter. By the well know Convolution Theorem, this is equivalent to convolving in the spatial domain. The filtered image was then obtained by taking the inverse Fourier transform of this product. This technique, however, does not give the uniform contrast enhancement of the present method. Global histogram transform was also used, but also proved inadequate.
To conserve computational time in some parts of the system, the full scale contrast enhanced image may be optionally down-sampled in block 130 (this is step 2 in Table 2). To down-sample the image from n.sub.row .times.n.sub.col pixels to ##EQU1## pixels, the Encoder simply takes every other point of the full size image. This process is detailed in Algorithm 3. The only input required is I.sub.FSCE and the only output is ##EQU2## means that I is a member of all nrow/2-by-ncol/2 real-valued matrices.
The next step (step 3 in Table 2) is to create a Ridge Angle Map and an Image Quality Map at a predetermined number of elements or pixels of the down-sampled, enhanced image in block 135 (FIG. 8). For each selected pixel, the preferred method determines a unit vector that gives the best fit, in a least mean squares sense, to the local ridge flow. The technique for minimizing the associated error uses a unique adaptation of mathematics originally published in November, 1993 in CVGIP Image Understanding (Academic Press 1049-9660 93), Vol. 58, No. 3, pages 383-398, by Chiao-Fu Shu and Ramish C. Jain, entitled "Direct Estimation of Orientated Patterns." For simplicity, an adaptation of this technique for finding ridge angles as applied to static fields employed in the present invention will be referred to simply as Direct Estimation.
In FIG. 8, blocks 140 through 170 represent the process for yielding a ridge angle matrix, which we also refer to as a Raw Ridge Angle Map. Determining image quality for each pixel is a two step process, which exploits the mathematics of Direct Estimation. First, the local area must have gradient support of at most 75 pixels with gradients less than 20. Monochrome background areas almost always fail this test. When a pixel fails this test, a zero quality is assigned and processing stops for that pixel; otherwise, a numeric value is computed that measures the stability of the fit, the higher the numerical value, the better. In poor quality areas, small changes in the image can result in large changes to the fit. The number computed, which has a continuous range from zero a finite upper bound, is a measure of this tendency and is used as the quality metric.
One method for measuring ridge angle and ridge frequency uses two-dimensional Fourier Transforms. Generally, a small local area, about 32 by 32 pixels, centered about each selected pixel, is transformed. In the vicinity of laminar ridge flow, a two-dimensional power spectrum exhibits a maximum value at a point in one of the quadrants of the two-dimensional frequency plane. Representing this point in polar coordinates gives the local ridge frequency and ridge angle.
A preferred method for measurement of ridge angle and producing a Quality Map is by Direct Estimation because it is simpler to implement, just as accurate, and yields an estimate of image quality that was not possible using Fourier Transforms. This is illustrated in FIG. 8 and blocks 140 through 170. The first step 140 is to compute a gradient map of I.sub.DSCE using a five-point central difference equation embodied in Algorithm 4. Because the gradient is a vector, for each (r,c) in I.sub.DSCE, the map consists of a difference value for the row and a difference value for the column.
A processing loop is initiated in which a calculation kernel traverses over the image pixels in increments of 3. In other words, the process starts at the left hand column value c.sub.l and continues through to a right hand value, c.sub.r in increments of 3. Similarly, it starts at row r.sub.b and proceeds to an end at row r.sub.t, also progressing in increments of 3. The starting and ending values are set arbitrarily by considering that there is some reasonably wide border of the image that can be excluded. As implemented in the present invention, processing starts 11 pixels in from the edge of the image.
The calculation kernel is the area viewed during processing and is a predetermined area designed to cover approximately one and one-half ridges in the preferred embodiment of this invention, or in the case of a down-sampled image, an area of n by m where n and m are each 15 pixels for an initial image having a 500 pixel per inch resolution. As illustrated in FIG. 14, the kernel 145 is shown as extending vertically from pixel 20 to pixel 50 and horizontally from pixel 60 to pixel 90, keeping in mind that FIG. 14 is a full scale image, not a down-sampled image.
For each pixel(r,c) visited while looping, a computation of ridge angle and quality value is performed. Because we are incrementing by 3's in both row and column, no computation is performed for the 8 pixels surrounding pixel(r,c). For convenience, the ridge angle and image quality values for these surrounding pixels are assigned the same values as the ones compute for pixel(r,c).
This process in detailed in Algorithm 5. The input to Algorithm 5 is ##EQU3## from block 130 (FIG. 7). There are two outputs from FIG. 8, output matrices .THETA..sub.raw and Q.sub.raw, both ##EQU4## matrices. The elements of the maps .THETA..sub.raw, ##EQU5## are initialized to zero.
The two maps produced in Block 150 by Algorithm 5 are noisy, and therefore one of two techniques may be used to smooth the maps. This is step 4 in Table 2. The first technique, smoothing by shrink-and-grow, represented in block 160, is applied only to the raw quality map, Q.sub.raw. The second technique, smoothing by Fourier filtering, is applied in block 170 to the Raw Ridge Angle Map, .THETA..sub.raw.
The smoothing of the raw image quality map, Q.sub.raw, is achieved by the well known technique of erosion and dilation. First, we erode or shrink the quality area by expanding the "poor" quality area. This removes unwanted "islands" that appear outside the inked part of the image. This process, however, generally creates unwanted "lakes" within the inked part of the image. So, we dilate or expand the resultant map to fill in these "lakes". This smoothing process, performed on he raw quality map, Q.sub.raw, is detailed in Algorithm 6. The input to Algorithm 6 is Q.sub.raw and the output is the smoothed map, Q.sub.smooth. The Q.sub.smooth map (Table 3, item 16) is used by the Classifier 40 as well as by the Encoder 30, as shown in FIGS. 40 and 41, and is eventually stored in the Products Files 50, 60 both as a coarse map Q.sub.final (Table 3, item 32) and as a part of the Ridge Angle Map, FIG. 5.
The smoothing of the Raw Ridge Angle Map, .THETA..sub.raw, is provided by Fourier filtering in the frequency domain. In general, there is a problem with smoothing angles. Angles range from 0.degree. to 180.degree., with 0.degree. being the same as 180.degree.. In essence, smoothing is averaging, but if we average 0.degree. and 180.degree. we get a wrong a answer. To avoid this discontinuity, we instead smooth the maps of the sine and cosine of twice the ridge angle and then recombine with the are tangent to recover the filtered Ridge Angle Map. To smooth each component, we Fourier transform its map and multiply it by the Fourier Transform the impulse response of the smoothing filter. The smoothed map of the component is the inverse transform of this product. The details for smoothing angle are embodied in Algorithm 7, whose inputs are .THETA..sub.raw and Q.sub.smooth. The output is .THETA..sub.smooth.
The output of block 130 is also used to create a Ridge Frequency Map, preferably by means of a Fourier Transform; this is step 5 in Table 2 and is represented by block 175 in FIG. 6 by blocks 180 and 190 in FIG. 9.
Ridge angle and ridge frequency are needed by matched Gabor and Minutiae Filters 195, which will be more fully described hereinafter, and for core and delta location, also to be described later. Hence, accurate measurement of local ridge angle and frequency is important to reliable and accurate performance of the present invention. The reliability and accuracy of the outputs generated by the present Encoder 30 determine the achievable performance effectiveness of all system elements that follow.
The computation of a raw frequency map is described in connection with FIGS. 9 and 10. At any given pixel, if we were to look at a cross section of the ridges along a line drawn perpendicular to the ridge flow, we would see a periodic function that transitions from white to black. The local ridge frequency is the frequency of this function. To measure this frequency we first create a sine wave from the ridge flow. We draw a line perpendicular to the ridge angle and centered at the pixel of interest, pixel(r,c). We then take 16 samples along this line, eight on either side of pixel(r,c). In really well inked areas, a plot of these points would show a well formed sine wave. In general, however, the local gray scale is noisy, so we want an average. To do this we draw four more lines +3, +6, -3, and -6 pixels away from pixel(r,c). The four lines are drawn parallel to the first, which is perpendicular to the ridge angle at pixel(r, c). We take 16 samples from each line and average them over the five lines to get 16 averaged points. This is illustrated in FIG. 10. The power spectrum from the Fourier Transform is computed from these points. The centroid about the maximum power point yields the ridge frequency at (r,c). We loop over the image in increments of seven and, for each (r,c) visited, we will up sample by filling it and the 15 cells that surround it with the same value.
Each pixel has a quality value (image quality) associated with it. If the quality is below a set threshold, we assume the print quality is too poor to interpret or that we are off the image (currently, this threshold value is set at 0.25), and we set the frequency for this pixel to 0.095 cycles/pixel, which is the median frequency of all prints in the NIST9 database.
The NIST9 database is one of several National Institute of Standards supplied image databases of ten-print cards. NIST contains ten-print images from 1350 individuals that are representative of fingerprint class across the U.S. criminal population. If the system were to be exclusively applied to another country whose population were to have significantly smaller or larger hand feature sizes resulting in a different dominant ridge frequency, there may be some benefit to setting the median frequency to that representative of the population. The algorithm for creating ##EQU7## is contained in Algorithm 8. There are three inputs: I.sub.DSCE, .THETA..sub.smooth, and Q.sub.smooth.
Smoothing the Raw Ridge Frequency Map is generated by block 190 of FIG. 9 and is step 6 in Table 2. Again Fourier filtering is applied when smoothing the Raw Ridge Frequency Map. In fact, the algorithm we use is nearly a carbon copy of the method used to smooth either the sine or cosine maps of twice the ridge angle. The complete process is presented in Algorithm 9. The only input is .OMEGA..sub.raw. The only output generated is ##EQU8##
The smoothed Ridge Angle and Ridge Frequency Maps are later converted to coarser maps, denoted herein as final maps, that are stored in the Products File 50, 60 as maps .THETA..sub.final (Table 3, item 37), .OMEGA..sub.final (Table 3, item 38), as shown in FIG. 40, for future use by the Search Filter 70 and Matcher 80. The smoothed maps contain quality information in that all areas where the quality is poor, or below a predetermined threshold, have been masked out. This masking occurred at the time of formation of the respective parent "raw" maps. Likewise, the quality attribute contained in the "smooth" maps are passed along to the "final" maps and are retained in the Products File. A final image quality or image state map Q.sub.final (Table 3, item 32) is also stored in the Products File.
The Enhanced Gray Scale Image I.sub.FSCE is filtered (step 7 in Table 2) using matched filters 202 and 204 (FIG. 11). The input for minutiae detection is the Enhanced Gray Scale Fingerprint Image I.sub.FSCE from block 120 of FIG. 7. The gray scale is filtered pixel-by-pixel by two matched filters 202 and 204 that are oriented according to local ridge flow and have their passbands centered at the local ridge frequency.
In the Encoder 30 of the present invention, the filters have small regions of support, generally under 32 by 32 pixels and are convolved with regions of equal size to obtain the filtered image at the pixel. One of the filters is the discrete, two-dimensional Gabor Filter 202. The Minutia Filter is a Gabor Filter with one of its halves 180 degrees out of the phase with its other half. Both filters are complex valued, that is, they map (x,y) coordinates to a complex number. Because the enhanced image for all prints has uniform contrast, the magnitude of the filtered output is indirectly normalized.
FIG. 12 illustrates a raw Gabor Filter output. This image represents the power of the filter; it should not be confused as an image used in the process of determining ridge flow. It shows that through the process leading to this point, an excellent map of the fingerprint can be obtained. It distinctly shows ridge flow and minutiae as information that is contained in the contrast enhanced image that the Gabor and Minutia Filters use. Minutiae are very distinct in the contrast enhancement image and allow the Gabor and Minutia Filters to make distinct interpretations of ridge flow and points of minutiae as seen in FIG. 12. Thusly, the declaration of false minutiae is avoided.
The important output of the Encoder 30, though, is the combination of the Gabor and Minutiae filtered images, because these filters, working as a pair, are designed to capture the phase discontinuity that occurs at a minutia. For example, FIG. 13 shows pure fingerprint ridge flow, while FIG. 14 shows ridge flow with interspersed minutiae. The response of the Gabor and Minutiae Filters to the pure ridge flow of FIG. 13 is shown in FIG. 15. The response of each filter to FIG. 14 minutiae is shown in FIG. 16. Pure ridge flow yields high valued output from the Gabor Filter and low valued output from the Minutiae Filter. Minutiae points cause the outputs of each of the filters to flip to the opposite value extreme; that is, over minutiae, the Minutiae Filter is high valued and the Gabor Filter is low valued. A description of the filter design properties that yield this sensitivity of response from each filter follows.
As illustrated for pure ridge flow shown in FIG. 13, the Gabor Filter 202 has its maximum output, the solid line in FIG. 15, in areas of parallel ridge flow. As illustrated, for the minutia in FIG. 14, it has a near zero output at a minutia, solid line of FIG. 16. A spatial domain picture of the surface generated by the real and imaginary part of a Gabor Filter is shown in FIG. 17. It is clear from the picture, that in areas of parallel ridge flow, the Gabor Filter achieves a maximum output when the filter is aligned with ridges and it cycles at the ridge frequency. Ridge flow alignment over the center of a minutia, however, causes the filtered signal to go to zero. This is because, ideally speaking, half the ridges under the filter are 180.degree. out of phase with the other half; therefore, one half cancels the other.
The Minutiae Filter 204 is designed to compliment the Gabor Filter 202. As illustrated in FIG. 13 through FIG. 16, it has near zero output in parallel ridge flow and a maximum output at minutiae. The Minutiae Filter is complex valued also, and a surface plot of its real and imaginary parts is shown in FIG. 18. It can be understood from the surface plot and the spatial response cross sections shown in FIG. 19 (real and imaginary responses) that the output vector sums to zero or low valued outputs. Further, it can be seen from considering the ridge flow with minutiae in FIG. 14, and again considering the filter response characteristics of FIGS. 18 and 19, that its real and imaginary part outputs will vector sum to high valued output when it is aligned over the center of minutia. Combining the two filtered images at 215 of FIG. 6 forms a powerful process for finding and declaring minutiae, and for measuring and recording the associated quality of the determination.
The Gabor Filter 201 and Minutiae Filter 203 kernels are each computed once in blocks 201 and 203. These filters are computationally intensive; the more pixels included in the filtering, the greater processing time grows. To bound the computational time, a wavelet kernel was selected to be 25.times.25 with the appropriate nominal frequency of 0.095 cycles per pixel. This means that the image to be filtered always has approximately 2.5 ridges in the wavelet kernel. Ridge spacing and width varies from fingerprint to fingerprint, so in order to always insure including 2.5 ridges while bounding the kernel size, we under-sample or over-sample the Enhanced Gray Scale image as necessary. These filters have a symmetric 2-dimensional exponential envelope. They are vertically oriented. In other words, the filters are tuned for an image that has a ridge angle of 0 degrees and a frequency of 0.095 cycles per pixel.
To apply the filter to any given coordinate, (r,c), in the image, the ridge angle and ridge frequency at (r,c) are used to appropriately rotate and scale the image into the 25.times.25 wavelet kernel, and then perform mathematical convolution.
The first step is to compute the master filter values, blocks 201 and 203, for each filter; algorithm 10 performs this function. This step is then followed by filtering I.sub.FSCE with both the Gabor Filter in block 202 and the Minutia Filter in block 204; these filtering steps are performed by applying Algorithm 11.
The input is the full scaled enhanced image, I.sub.FSCE. The outputs are the Gabor Filter output, ##EQU9## the Minutiae Filter output, ##EQU10##
The next step (step 8 in Table 2) is to detect minutiae in block 215 of FIG. 6 and will be described in more detail in connection with FIGS. 21, 22 and 23. In this step, minutiae are located and the quality of the fingerprint image on a pixel-by-pixel basis is determined. This is accomplished by applying a threshold-testing algorithm to the ratio of the Minutiae to the Gabor filtered images. A ratio that is greater than "1" indicates potential minutia.
To find minutiae, the invention takes advantage of the fact that the Gabor Filter output has a deep null in the vicinity of the minutia while the Minutiae Filter output has a peak. Thus, taking the ratio of the magnitude of the Minutiae Filter output to the magnitude of the Gabor Filter output should yield spikes in areas of minutia. Indeed, this is the case, and it graphically illustrated in FIG. 24 and FIG. 25 where a small rectangular region from the sample print is illustrated. There are six minutiae in this region, each of which are circled on the gray scale image of FIG. 24
The three-dimensional plot shown at the bottom of FIG. 25 is in one to one correspondence with the gray scale, and represents the magnitude of the Minutiae Filter output divided by the magnitude of the Gabor Filter output. It illustrates quite clearly that the ratio of the filter outputs very effectively identifies the presence of minutiae.
What about in areas where there are no clearly visible spikes? The answer to this question leads directly to the Image Quality Map. In "good" quality areas of parallel ridge flow, that is, areas that are minutia free, the Gabor Filter output will be high and the Minutiae Filter output will be low. A simple threshold testing algorithm can determine this and a rating of "good" can be assigned to pixels that pass the test. The threshold test requires that Gabor output be greater than 12,000. In "poor" quality areas the output of both filters will be low. It doesn't matter whether there is a minutia present or not; if the area is bad, the filter outputs tend to small numbers. Again, a simple threshold test is used to determine if a pixel should be assigned a "poor" quality rating. If image quality is less than 10, a "poor" rating is assigned.
There are several benefits derived from being able to readily measure quality across image pixels and storing the resultant quality map. First, using the Image Quality Map Q.sub.smooth and the set of identified minutiae locations, it now becomes possible to identify, with confidence, areas of the print that are minutiae free. Second, applying the quality metric to the decision process of declaring minutiae significantly minimizes the generation of false minutiae; it is now rare to declare something (image artifact or other) a minutia when it is not. It is widely recognized that prior art encoder designs generate false minutiae. Eliminating, or minimizing the generation of false minutiae (to a number near zero), significantly reduces the workload required of the Minutiae Matcher (resulting in faster throughput), eliminates the need for manual corrections at encoding time, and provides for more accurate and discriminating scoring in matching. Third, the mapped non-minutiae area can be stored and utilized by the Minutiae Matcher component of the system to do dual hypothesis matching comparisons. Fourth, the mapped and stored Quality metric data, both Image and Minutia Quality, can be passed forward to the Minutiae Matcher component of the system and applied to provide an additional discriminate for matching comparisons.
Referring specifically to FIGS. 21 and 22, minutiae extraction is achieved by identifying areas where the Gabor Filter output approaches zero and a strong support from the Minutiae Filter is found. To aid in the extraction of minutiae, the ratio of the magnitude of the Minutiae Filter to the magnitude of the Gabor Filter is defined as the key extraction feature in determining the raw minutiae list. The raw minutia list is then finalized by applying thresholds on several variables, which were determined by experimentation, to provide a high correlation of good minutiae.
Minutia extraction is performed by applying Algorithms 12 through 27 as outlined in FIGS. 21 and 22 and blocks 220 through 370. As shown in FIG. 23, the inputs for the minutiae extraction process are Q.sub.smooth and .THETA..sub.smooth from blocks 160 and 170 of FIG. 8, .OMEGA..sub.smooth from block 190 of FIG. 9, and .function..sub.G and .function..sub.M from blocks 202 and 204 of FIG. 11. The outputs are the Final Minutiae List, M.sub.final and the ratio of minutiae over Gabor, . M.sub.final contains x, y, theta and a minutiae quality value for each minutia detected. A plot of the final minutiae list for the Gray Scale Image of FIG. 3 appears in FIG. 26. The tails on the circles denote theta, the angular orientation of a minutia.
A Final Quality Map is constructed by down sampling the 256-by-256 smooth quality map, Q.sub.smooth, to a 32-by-32 map. Thresholds on the ratio of minutia over Gabor, and Gabor Filter outputs are applied to assign the value of quality in the 32-by-32 map. The threshold applied is that the ratio must be greater than 1. Quality values of one indicate the presence of a minutia in that block. Quality values of negative one indicate areas of no minutiae with good quality ridge flow. Quality values of zero are areas too poor to interpret. The Quality Map, Q.sub.final, is generated by application of Algorithms 25 through 27, blocks 350, 360 and 370. The inputs for the Final Quality Map are M.sub.final, Q.sub.smooth, , and .function..sub.G. The output is the Final Quality Map, Q.sub.final.
Referring to FIG. 27, which is a gray scale fingerprint image with minutiae detected by prior art processes identified by white circles, minutiae are identified by a circle with a tail overlaying the fingerprint image. The circles are centered over the minutiae and the tails point in the direction of the angular direction of the minutiae. The fingerprint image has areas of heavy inking in the upper center and upper left quadrant. In these areas, the image is noisy and existence and location of real minutiae are indeterminate. The prior art process detects several minutiae in these areas, most of which are false.
FIG. 28 is a map of the fingerprint shown in FIG. 28 showing an image of poor quality shown in gray, areas of good quality having no minutiae are shown in black, and areas of good quality containing minutiae are shown in white. This is the Q.sub.final map. Overlaid on the top of Q.sub.final is the M.sub.final data. Note how the gray areas correspond to the heavily inked areas in FIG. 27. This map was created by the method and apparatus described herein. Only valid minutiae are identified by the circle and tail markers.
FIG. 29 is the gray scale fingerprint image of FIG. 27 with M.sub.final minutiae detected by the present invention identified by white circles. When compared with FIG. 27, it is clear how a declaration of false minutiae or real minutiae with low confidence has been avoided.
The location of the minutiae (150 per finger in the preferred embodiment of this invention), their orientation, and their quality, are stored in the Products Files 50, 60 (Table 1, E1, E2, E3, E4) and will be used by the Minutiae Matcher component 80 at a later time.
Cores and Delta are features of the fingerprint which serve in comparative searches. Detection of Cores and Deltas and extraction of data that characterizes them is performed by the Encoder. The data is passed onto the Products File for later use and on to the Classifier for immediate use. The Classifier uses the data to determine the Pattern Class(s) that the fingerprint is representative of. The pattern class information (as noted in Background Section) identifies: 1.) Class, whether there are right or left loops, whorls, arches, or tented arches; and then 2.) Subclass categories, ridge counts for loops and whorls. Along with Classification the fingerprint identification community measures and stores ridge count information for fingerprints of the loop classification type. This is done to have an additional disriminant in performing searching and matching. The loop centers around a Core. When there is a nearby Delta or another Core, the ridges that run between the two can be counted.
A novel and unique approach was developed to determine Core to Delta and Core to Core pairs for which methods for automated ridge counting could be performed, and for which the results would correspond to practices of the fingerprint identification community (i.e. for loop classifications). We have coined the expression "associated pairs", which we search to identify and when identified perform ridge counting between. For an associated pair, there is ridge flow between them that can be counted and classified consistent with the fingerprint identification community.
A pair meets the criteria of being "associated", if we can trace a path of constant value ridge angle (reading from the Ridge Angle Map, .THETA..sub.smooth) as we traverse across the ridges from one feature to the other. The trace path must connect the two features. The path is typically a curved path. After it is verified that such a path exists, ridge counting is performed on the basis of drawing a straight line between the two associated features.
Referring to our example fingerprint in FIG. 3, a loop of ridge flow about a Core can be seen slightly left of center in the image. In FIG. 32, vectors of ridge angle (Coarse Ridge Angle Map, .THETA..sub.final) about the core clearly show the looping flow. In both figures, to the right and below the Core, a Delta is seen in the image. It can be seen in the figure that for a straight line drawn between this Core and Delta, ridge counting can be performed proceeding along the line from one to the other. An objective was to create a detector for identifying both Core/Delta and Core/Core pair associations where ridge counting was consistent with established fingerprint science practice. The name chosen to assign for such feature relationships was Associated Feature Pair (Associated Pair).
A preferred method was developed for detection of Associated Pairs. In FIG. 32, note that the ridge angle vectors between the two features transition from a Northeasterly direction, to North, and then to Northwest. At some point along each ridge, a point on the ridge can be found where the fine resolution vector of .THETA.smooth points due North. This characteristic is a result of the nature of the recurving ridge flow about the core. Hopping across ridge flow from one successive due North pointing vector to the next will trace a continuous path between the two features. The "due North" is a constant value ridge angle, as we defined as a previous criteria for an Associated Pair. Other constant ridge angle paths could also be traced.
The angular coordinate axis was selected to be orientated such that due North is zero degrees. Ridge angle vectors rotated slightly clockwise of due North have small positive angle values. Those rotated slightly counterclockwise of due North, have angular values that are in the range of 179 to 180 degrees. The point is that there is a discontinuity in angle in passing through due North. The existence of this discontinuity in ridge angle is used to implement an algorithmic process that can perform rapid "constant ridge angle" trace path building, proceeding from one feature, across ridge flow, to the surrounding area, looking for an ending at another feature.
The result of "constant ridge angle" trace path building that utilizes the 0 to 180 degree angular discontinuity is illustrated in FIG. 33. This image is for the fingerprint of FIG. 3. The trace followed and found between the Delta D1 and the Core C1, is a line defined by the transition between pure white and jet black. In FIG. 33, the fine grain resolution Smoothed Ridge Angle Map, .THETA..sub.smooth, is plotted with the angular values converted to shades of gray. Pure white is 180 degrees and jet black is 0 degrees.
The angular discontinuity method developed works very well and provides efficiency in processing. If the fingerprint of FIG. 3 were rotated off the slightly arbitrary (fingerprint recording process dictates that the image be placed on the fingerprint card in vertical orientation, within a defined vertical rectangle) vertical orientation it now possess, continuity of tracing would be found from feature to feature but the path appearing in FIG. 33 would be a different curved line. Use of the discontinuity feature depends on selection of zero degrees to have upward pointing orientation, and the fact that looping type ridge flow occurs upward on a fingerprint, not horizontal or downward. The discontinuity method is applicable to all orientations through angular transformations or through successive reorientations of the coordinate system zero pointing. The current implementation is adequate, and the need for the broadest general case implementation has not been proven necessary to implement to date.
Shown in FIG. 34 is the overall set of processes applied to Core and Delta detection and measurement and collection of data relating to them. The numbers in the processing blocks correspond to the numbered functions of Table 2. In developing the algorithmic methods, the partitioning into three distinct steps became desirable. These steps are identified in the figure. A detailed block diagram of these steps with call-outs to the particular algorithms appears in FIGS. 35 and 36. The detailed walk through the functioning is addressed in the next section. This section describes the process at the higher level of FIG. 34.
FIG. 34 depicts the preferred embodiment for finding Cores and Deltas within a fingerprint, recording their coordinate locations and other data, as per an the overall system objective recording data that relates to quality and confidence of declaration and data. The inputs to this function include the Smoothed Quality Map Q.sub.smooth from block 160 of FIG. 8, the Smoothed Ridge Angle Map .THETA..sub.smooth from block 170 of FIG. 8, and the smoothed Ridge Frequency Map .OMEGA..sub.smooth from block 190 of FIG. 9. This combination contains sufficient information to reliably extract Cores and Deltas. The processing that identifies them, extracts their location and other data, and provides a confidence metric is embodied in Algorithms 28-35, found in the appendix. The extracted information is saved to the Products File 50, 60.
Once Core and Delta features have been detected and recorded, determination of Associated Pairs is made. This is followed by calculation of the straight line distance between the two associated features as measured both in units of pixel count and ridge count.(FIG. 36). The Core and Delta pairing knowledge serves as an input to classification of the fingerprint as performed by the Classifier 40 (FIG. 1). Additionally, the ridge count information is a metric that is stored in the Products File 50, 60 so that it can be passed forward to be employed by the Search Filters in narrowing the File Candidate list passed onto the Matcher 80. Pixel count distance is useful to the Classifier. Algorithms 36-41, contained in Appendix A, perform the processing that determines Core and Delta feature associations and calculates the distances between member pairs in units of measure of both ridge counts and pixel counts.
The ridge and pixel count can be reliably determined because of the strength of the algorithms for ridge angle and ridge frequency measurements and mappings. Accurate ridge counts are obtainable even when the ridge flow between features is not continuous as a result of scars, poor inking, or generally poor image quality. The consistent availability of ridge count information measured between Core to Delta and Core to Core pairings provides another metric that is incorporated as a discriminate for the Search Filter to employ, so that a further reduction of the search field of potential File Candidates can be achieved. This subsequently reduces the workload requirements imposed on the Matcher element of the system. The benefits that result are a combination of both a faster throughput through the Matcher 80 and reduced hardware costs. Algorithms 28 through 41 identify and record the Cores and Deltas that meet the criteria of Associated Feature Pairs, and calculate and record the ridge and pixel counts between them.
Step 1 identifies all potential features through measuring the gradient across the fingerprint image and storing the measured values in a gradient map .GAMMA.. A matrix titled Feature (symbolically as .DELTA.) is created to contain all core and delta feature data. The data structure and contents of the matrix is found in Table 4. Core features are distinguished from delta features via the TYPE element of the matrix. The data that is measured and extracted for each feature is sequentially loaded into .DELTA. as procedural Steps 1 through 3 are performed.
To describe the status of the matrix as it is sequentially filled the following symbolic representations are used: .DELTA..sub.empty, .DELTA..sub.feat, .DELTA..sub.CD, and .DELTA..sub.final. Each row of .DELTA. contains all the data pertaining to one particular feature. Each column is designated to be a different data element describing features. The variables n.sub.feat, n.sub.CD, and n.sub.final are used to indicate the number of total features described and stored in the matrix; they correspond to like named states of .DELTA..
In FIG. 38 the sequential entry of data into .DELTA. is illustrated for each of the three steps. The number of entries is reduced in progressing from Step 1 through 3 as features in the list are discarded because they are cannot be authenticated as Core or Delta, or they are of low confidence value. In Step 3, the list is reduced and reordered, currently to a maximum of six features. All features of "unknown" type are discarded. Then the list is further reduced. First the three Cores with highest CONFIDENCE among recorded Core features are kept and placed within the three first positions in .DELTA.. Like wise the three Deltas with highest Confidence are kept and placed in .DELTA. row positions following the Cores.
Following the procedural steps starting at the top of FIG. 35, the algorithms function as follows. Potential features in the fingerprint are identified in block 400 by first taking the gradient of the .THETA..sub.smooth from block 190 of FIG. 11 and then determining the MAX.sub.-- GR.sub.-- POINT largest gradients. The locations of these points represent possible Cores and Deltas. Algorithm 28 calculates the gradient across the image and produces a gradient matrix .GAMMA. that maps the gradient of the fingerprint image.
Since noise in the Smoothed Ridge Angle Map can also produce high gradient areas, it is necessary to discard those feature points whose quality is less than QUAL.sub.-- THRESH. The threshold used is 0.25. In this process, the image quality map, Q.sub.smooth, is employed by Algorithm 28. Also, to limit the number of feature areas under consideration, only those points that have gradients larger than GR.sub.-- THRESH are considered. The high gradient areas of .GAMMA. that survive the quality and minimum gradient post filtering are ranked or placed in .DELTA. in order of descending gradient.
In block 410, algorithm 29 uses, as inputs, the maps Q.sub.smooth, and .GAMMA.. From these, it determines the presence of features and data related to each feature. The data determined for each feature is: location, XPOS, and YPOS; average image quality in the vicinity of the feature; QUALITY; and the maximum gradient, GRADIENT, for the feature. The matrix .DELTA..sub.empty is loaded with the feature data and becomes .DELTA..sub.feat with n.sub.feat entries.
In Algorithm 29, each feature is assigned an average image quality value (QUALITY) that is determined by calculating the average quality in a FEAT.sub.-- SIZE by FEAT.sub.-- SIZE region (typically set at 13 by 13 pixels) around the feature location.
Upon exiting Algorithm 29 (end of Step 1) each identified potential feature has values determined and entered in .DELTA. for X and Y location, maximum value gradient in the location vicinity, and the average image quality in the location vicinity.
In Step 2, the potential features listed in .DELTA..sub.feat in block 420 are examined to determine if they fall in the class characteristics of Core, Delta, or Unknown. For Cores, it is also determined if they are a Loop Core, or a Whorl Core. The type determination is stored in the TYPE element of .DELTA.. Also, a confidence number relating strength and quality of the detection is calculated and stored in the CONFIDENCE element of .DELTA..
In block 421, algorithm 30 is the primary processing algorithm for Step 2. It cycles through all the listed features and applies the Direct Estimation (DEOP) methods used to establish linear coefficient matrix of a vector field that describes the feature. Algorithm 30 utilizes Algorithms 31 through 35 in its processing. Algorithm 33 is applied after the linear coefficient matrix has been assembled by Algorithm 30 for each potential feature in .DELTA..sub.feat. From the 2 by 2 "A" matrix,
In block 422, algorithm 33 determines and returns numerical values for TYPE, CURL, DIVERGENCE, and CONDITION (Condition Number); all of which are finally loaded by Algorithm 30 into .DELTA.. Algorithms 31, 32, 34, and 35 are all support algorithms that provide text book matrix and eigenvalue operations. The functions of these support algorithms are described in Table 5, and the pseudo code for implementation included in Appendix A. The functioning of these support algorithms will not be discussed further than the descriptions provided in Table 5.
The Smoothed Ridge Angle Map, .THETA..sub.smooth, from block 170 of FIG. 8, which indicates at each point on the image the orientation of ridge flow, is used to create a vector field representation for the fingerprint image. It was found through experimentation that Core and Delta regions formed patterns that can be identified by employing algorithms which calculate the coefficients for a linear approximation to the vector field.
DEOP (Direct Estimation of Orientated Patterns) methods were adapted and uniquely applied to fingerprint images to detect and measure dynamic flow around Cores and Deltas. (A somewhat different application of DEOP methods was described earlier for ridge angle measurement of ridge flow; a static field detection and measurement application). The DEOP methods are embodied in Algorithm 30. The algorithm performs a least squares minimization of the measured field with respect to the linear approximation.
The resulting coefficients (comprising matrix A) are then used by Algorithm 33 to compute the vector curl, divergence, and deformation, from closed form expressions. These parameters are sufficient to classify the vector field data into one of the following pattern types: Node, Star Node, Improper Node, Spiral, Center, and Saddle. Experimentation with fields generated from 2*.THETA..sub.smooth data resulted in patterns at feature locations that closely resembled one of the six types. Deltas, for instance, are transformed into saddle points; whorl cores became center patterns; and loop cores were directed to one of the Node or Spiral patterns.
Computation of a reliable confidence measure was a second benefit extracted from the application of DEOP methods. The condition number, COND.sub.-- NO, of a 2 by 2 Linear Coefficient Matrix, when combined with the feature's QUALITY and GRADIENT measures, produced a value that could be used to filter out false Cores and Deltas. The computation that was established to provide a useable result is:
Algorithm 34 calculates the condition number, COND.sub.-- NO, for the 2 by 2 linear coefficient matrix, A. Algorithm 30 performs the calculation to determine CONFIDENCE and enters it and COND.sub.-- NO into the appropriate elements of .DELTA..
The third step in the process is described in connection with FIG. 36 and involves associating features and computing ridge counts. Algorithm 36 tailors the number of feature entries kept in .DELTA.. The highest confidence Cores and the highest confidence Deltas are kept and moved to the first rows of .DELTA. in .DELTA..sub.final. Unknown type features are not retained. The very first processing operations of Algorithm 36 performs this culling of the list. A maximum of 3 Cores and 3 Deltas are kept. The Cores are placed ahead of the Deltas in the list.
The first operation is computation of pairing associations for each of the three largest confidence Cores and Deltas found in the fingerprint. A feature pair is considered associated when they can be traced to one another along a path characterized by a zero and 180 degree ridge angle values in the Smoothed Ridge Angle Map. Delta to Core associations are first searched for, and then Core to Core associations. The following operation is to calculate the ridge counts between associated feature pairs. This is accomplished by calculating the line integral of the vector frequency along a straight line from one feature to the next, FIG. 37. The line integral can yield a value with a decimal component (FIG. 37), when a visual counting yields an integer number of ridges counted. The accuracy of the calculated value is .+-.0.5 ridge counts. The number is kept in decimal format because truncating or rounding would increase the potential error.
In block 431 of FIG. 36, Algorithm 36 is the main processing algorithm for Step 3. Algorithm 36 loops through all the n.sub.CD features of .DELTA..sub.CD and determines which Delta/Core and which Core/Core are of the class defined as Associated Feature Pairs.
In block 432 Algorithm 39, TRACE GRADIENT, is utilized by Algorithm 36 to trace a path of constant value ridge angle (reading from the Ridge Angle Map, .THETA..sub.smooth) while traversing across the ridges from one feature to the other. The trace path must connect the two features. The zero to 180 degree angular discontinuity is the constant value ridge angle of choice used. As earlier explained the jet black to white transition line runs from the Delta to the Core in FIG. 33, illustrates successful trace establishment between a Core and a Delta, that results in declaring them an Associated Feature Pair. The line is the trace line for constant Smoothed Ridge Angle of 0/180 degrees. A total of 5 data index storage locations for each feature has been set aside in the data structure of .DELTA. for saving the identities of the mating feature of each Associated Feature Pair. The output of Algorithm 39 is the row and column location index numbers of .THETA..sub.smooth where the trace of the path ends.
With the trace ending data from Algorithm 39 returned, Algorithm 36 in block 431 invokes Algorithm 37 in block 432, CHECK ASSOCIATION. The sequence which Algorithm 36 follows is first to look for Delta to Core associated pairings that exist, and then to look for Core to Core associated pairings. Algorithm 37 compares the XPOS, and YPOS location of all other features in .DELTA..sub.CD to determine if they are in the vicinity (within 1 wavelength) of the trace ending(s) found by Algorithm 39. For identified Associated Feature Pairs, Algorithm 39 calculates the pixel count distance between the paired features and then invokes Algorithm 38, RIDGE COUNT in block 440 to obtain the ridge count distance between them. The ridge count taken across a straight line 442 drawn between the two features is illustrated in FIG. 37.
Algorithm 38 determines the ridge count between two associated features. It utilizes .THETA..sub.smooth, .OMEGA..sub.smooth, and column and row location information to yield "ridge.sub.-- count" as a returned value to Algorithm 37. In performing its calculations Algorithm 38 is supported by Algorithm's 40 and 41, each text book level support functions as described in Table 5.
Algorithm 36 is returned the determination of associations and accompanying ridge and pixel counts from Algorithm 37. It is returned this information with the "Associated Feature" elements of .DELTA., as illustrated in FIG. 38 for Step 3, filled with the extracted data. The N.sub.-- ASSOC element indicates the total number of associations found, and the number of ASSOC.sub.-- #, RDGCNT.sub.-- #, and PXLCNT.sub.-- # locations data will appear in. The ASSOC.sub.-- # entries are integer numbers that point to the IDX index number of the associated features.
The output from Algorithm 36 (exit of Step 3) is .DELTA..sub.final and n.sub.final for which the associated feature data as illustrated in FIG. 38 has been added to .DELTA.. For each feature the element "n.sub.assoc " indicates the total number of other features found to be associated. For a given feature and numeric value of its n.sub.assoc there are a corresponding number of entries in the ASSOC.sub.-- #, RDGCNT.sub.-- #, and PIXCNT.sub.-- # elements of .DELTA. (where # is 1 to 5). This is illustrated in FIG. 38. Any element ASSOC.sub.-- # entry contains an integer number which points to the IDX element number of the associated feature. The corresponding numbered elements RDGCNT.sub.-- # and PIXCNT.sub.-- # contain the ridge count and pixel count to the associated feature.
A Products File is the file that retains the Advanced Encoder results as a readable record for later use by the Matcher 80. For a person of record (criminal or other offender of note) whose fingerprint products data is going to be retained, the Products File goes to the repository device (disk drive, optical drive, etc.) that is designated as the repository for the Products File database. The data so retained is then used by the Search Filter, and the Matcher over and over again in the future whenever search's are conducted to identify individuals arrested or at the Scene of the Crime. For a Search Candidate's fingerprints processed through the Advanced Encoder, the Products File data is sent to a storage device where it can be retained until the workload queue of the Search Filter and Matcher stage of the system are free, and a search against the Products Files stored in the repository database can be initiated.
The Products File in some cases contains data exactly as extracted and used by the Advanced Encoder. The Minutiae data is an example. In other cases the data is down-sampled to conserve storage capacity requirements, and to make searching and matching proceed faster; Ridge Angle and Ridge Frequency Coarse Maps are examples. In still other cases multiple pieces of Advanced Encoder data are combined into one Products File data element in order to provide some unique and fast processing capability to the Search Filters or Matcher. The Coarse Map of Image State, Q.sub.final, or Final Quality Map, is an example.
The Data Elements of the Products File are listed in Table 1. Fingerprint card textual data and/or any operator data is loaded into the Products File early on via optical character reader, or manual input device. Only one data element comprising the fingerprint characteristics comes from the Classifier; it is Pattern Class that includes primary and subordinate class identification.
Certain Data from the Advanced Encoder's processing of an individual's 10 print cards or a set of latents is temporarily retained for use by the Classifier, whose evaluation of the fingerprint images directly follows that of the Advanced Encoder. This transfer of data for temporary retention and use by the Classifier is illustrated in FIG. 39.
The transition of data from the Advanced Encoder Data to the elements of the Data Products file is illustrated in FIGS. 40 and 41. The creation of Products File data proceeds as follows:
The column (n.sub.col) and row (n.sub.row) dimensions of .THETA..sub.smooth, .OMEGA..sub.smooth, Q.sub.smooth, .function..sub.g and .function..sub.m are each purposefully established so that they are each an integral multiple of 16. Where control of the column by row dimensions of the full scale image is possible it would be adjusted to insure this correspondence. Where it is not possible, and the down sampled image does not support the integral division by sixteen, then the 5 matrices and I.sub.DSCE are set to nearest next larger n.sub.col by n.sub.row dimensions which are divisible by 16. The extra cells in I.sub.DSCE created to accomplish this are filled out with null information (i.e. data that is characteristic of the background, the fingerprint card with no inking).
Looking to FIG. 40, it is seen that the Products File matrices .THETA..sub.final, .OMEGA..sub.final and Q.sub.final are each formed from a combination of data, rather than just the smoothed source matrices of similar name. The objective is to form matrices that enhance the decision process, and the efficiency of processing in the Matcher 80. As illustrated in Table 1, .THETA..sub.final, and .OMEGA..sub.final have been defined to be coarser by a factor of 16 than their source matrices. Q.sub.final, has been designated not to be as coarse, it is coarser by a factor of 8, compared to its source matrices. The matrix Q.sub.final is determined from data held in 4 source matrices. These matrices map the fingerprint and are very powerful support to the Matcher operation and performance.
In order to form the data inputs for .THETA..sub.final, .OMEGA..sub.final, and Q.sub.final, an intermediate and temporary matrix is first formed. It is Q.sub.coarse, which has the dimensions of ##EQU11## For a full size gray scale image of dimension 512.times.512, the "smooth" matrices have the dimensions 256.times.256, and the dimension of Q.sub.coarse is 16.times.16. The 256 cells of Q.sub.coarse are filled by sequentially considering the data within each of 256 16.times.16 cell submatrices of Q.sub.smooth that in total comprise all the cells of it. Each of the 16 cells within a submatrix are examined to determine if the stored cell value is below a fixed poor quality threshold. If 75% of the cells are below a quality of 0.5 for Q.sub.coarse, then the cell is dubbed as poor quality.
If 75% (12 cells) are below the threshold then: the corresponding Q.sub.coarse (i,j) is set to 0; otherwise Q.sub.coarse (i,j) is set to 1.
Sequentially select each of 256 16.times.16 submatrices of .THETA..sub.smooth. Each submatrix maps to a cell of Q.sub.coarse.
For the Products File map, Final Quality, a set of algorithms are employed that combine Quality data and minutiae data outputs of the Advanced Encoder. This process is described in the descriptions of operation of Algorithms 25, 26, and 27 that are described in with the Minutiae finding and recording description. The map is a unique product that is very effective in the Minutiae Matcher for speeding the matching evaluations, incorporating Quality level in the matching evaluations, and implementing dual hypothesis matching into the matching process. The following provides a summary level description of the process of entering data into the cells of Q.sub.final :
1. Initially set all cells of Q.sub.final- =0. In Q.sub.final, zero represents that the 16.times.16 pixel area of the full resolution gray scale image is either fingerprint card background, or poorly inked, where it cannot be determined if there is ridge flow or minutia
If the average Gabor Filter value stored in the 8.times.8 region of f.sub.g >fixed threshold of 12,000;
3. Sequentially loop through the Minutiae List, matrix M.sub.final. Considering the position in the image (XPOS and YPOS) of each minutia, set each cell of Q.sub.final- to +1 if its placement in the image is within one unit of the minutia's position. The +1 is defined as signifying a minutia's neighborhood.
The result of these operations is the matrix of Q.sub.final- which provides the Final Quality Map which is actually a composite Image State Map of the fingerprint with both quality, minutiae area, and non minutiae area information contained in it. This three state image map is illustrated in FIG. 30. The white areas are the +1 valued cells, the black are 0 valued cells, and the gray are the -1 valued cells.
The three states are conveyed into the matrix in the above operations through a layering process, starting out with the Q.sub.final- cells at first all set to 0 or low (poor/unusable) image quality. Step B changes areas from poor image Quality, 0, to -1 indicating good image quality areas containing no minutiae. Step 3 further sets poor image quality "0" cells to +1 reflecting good image quality areas that contain minutia of high confidence. As a result of this process "0" takes on an additional meaning. The 0 cells left in the zero state for lack of ability to qualify for the other two states, are not necessarily just of the state of poor image quality, as a result of being remaindered. They could also represents areas where there is some indication of a good quality of the image where minutiae were detected, but by not above the threshold established to consider their existence with confidence. The definition in Table 3 delineates the three states. FIG. 31 shows the Image State map of FIG. 30 overlaid with minutiae
Products File data elements associated with Core and Delta data comes directly from retention of the data of .DELTA..sub.final from the Advanced Encoder. CONFIDENCE is transferred to the Products File element CD.sub.-- QUALITY.
There are three Products File Data Elements that are used to provide a global characterization of each fingerprint. They are 1) Average Print Quality (item C.1.b. in Table 1); 2) Dominant Mode Ridge Frequency (C.1.c.); and 3) Feature Area Count (C.1.d.). They have been defined as global level descriptors of the data available for each fingerprint image. There are a total of 10 entries, one for each of ten fingers. In the Matching phase, they assist the decision process of which sets of fingers to use between Search and File 10 prints (or multiple latents) based on the consideration of best quality of available data. They are derived in the following ways:
This Products File element is obtained by averaging all the values stored in all of the cells of Q.sub.smooth, that exceed the fixed threshold of value 0.5.
A histogram is calculated for all the elements of .OMEGA..sub.smooth whose corresponding cells in Q.sub.smooth exceed the fixed threshold of value 0.5. The frequency that has the maximum count occurring in the histogram is the value that is stored as being the Dominant Mode Ridge Frequency.
The Search Filter selects those File Candidates for the Matcher which are a close likeness of the Search Candidate with regard to personal descriptive data and pattern classification (primary and subordinate class). A new additional sort, or down selection, criteria is used as a result of the Dominant Mode Ridge Frequency which is calculated and saved to the Products File by the Advanced Encoder for each of the 10 fingerprints on the ten-print card. When Dominant Mode Ridge Frequency is not near the same value for each of the ten fingerprints, with each finger Average Print Quality (also calculated and saved by the Advanced Encoder) showing "good quality" then the Search Candidate and File Candidate are not the same person and the Matcher is not employed.
After the Search Filter has produced a list of File Candidates for matching, with prior art systems the matching process begins and proceeds to perform the comparison by matching one to ten fingers, dependent on the number set by the system operator. Prior art systems proceed to use the specific finger numbers for the comparison as identified by the system operator, or programmed into the system. The specific fingers used are fixed set from one File Candidate to the next. The current system considers the quality of available data as stored in the Products File of the Search Candidate and each File Candidate. It functions to automatically adapt from File Candidate to File Candidate Products File so that finger numbers are designated for comparison such as to insure the use of the best quality and quantity of data available to conduct the total "n" finger comparisons on. It selects the "n" number of fingers as set by the operator, but it chooses the exact finger numbers to be used based on "best available data" between the one to ten search fingerprints and the corresponding file fingerprints.
Two data elements calculated and saved to the Products File by the Advanced Encoder provide for this capability. They are Average Print Quality and Feature Area Count. For each file there are ten pieces of data (one each finger). What is sought is that for each of the "n" fingers chosen to be used, that the Average Print Quality is simultaneously of high or good value for both the search print and the file print. Additionally the fingers are sought for inclusion on the basis that they are the set of fingers that have the most feature area for comparison, i.e.--that Feature Area values when added for all fingers on an assembled list of "to be matched finger numbers" are as high as possible and that feature area in Search Print and corresponding File Print fingers be as high and be similar valued so that there is a like area of features available from each to conduct the comparison.
In prior art systems it is unknown and uncontrollable whether the comparisons between a search fingerprint and file fingerprint are being performed with good or poor data. The dynamic selection process of the current embodiment provides for knowledge and control with regard to quality of data available in search and File Candidate's Products Files and regard to the extent of feature data available.
Selection of a specific finger number for comparison when, for instance, the Search Print is of good quality and the File Print of poor quality is avoided. However, a good quality ratings for both Search and File Prints is not taken as the sole discriminant for inclusion of a numbered finger on the list of fingers to be used in comparisons. The set of fingers that will yield the highest confidence comparisons are sought for inclusion on the comparison list. The availability of the Features Area Count Metric for each finger provides an additional discriminant to identifying the fingers which can yield high confidence comparisons. For example, using a finger having good quality data and great extent of feature area over which to conduct the comparison provides higher confidence in the results than a finger with good quality data but a limited feature area over which to compare. The occurrence of reduced feature area from fingerprint to fingerprint can be due to major scars, poor inking, or ink smudges.
The Matcher 80 includes two matching elements, a Coarse Matcher 81 and a Fine Matcher 82. Each Search and File Candidate Fingerprint pair to be compared are first processed through the Coarse Matcher 81, which scores the closeness of match between prints. Data from the Coarse Matcher is stored in a Coarse Matcher Products File 83.
The Fine Matcher 82 utilizes data produced by the Coarse Matcher as first order inputs to its matching algorithms. The Fine Matcher also scores the closeness of match. The processes used by the Coarse Matcher and the Fine Matcher have been determined to be fairly orthogonal in the mathematical sense, that is, they are fairly independent determinations or measures of the closeness of the match between prints.
FIG. 42 shows the major components of the Coarse Matcher 81 and the Fine Matcher 82. The algorithms for both the Coarse Matcher and the Fine Matcher have been implemented in MATLAB and/or in C programming language. These algorithms are documented in Appendix B. A brief description of the algorithms precedes a step by step description of the algorithmic process that follow.
The Coarse Matcher 81 reads the file and search fingerprint data from the Advanced Encoder Products File 50, 60 and performs an alignment of the fingerprints in block 84 from which a search quality map in block 85 is refined. Section B-1 of Appendix B lists the algorithms that form the process of Coarse Matching of the fingerprints. Outputs of the Coarse Matcher are placed in a Coarse Matcher Products File 83 for later use by the Fine Matcher and use in collectively scoring the results of both the Fine Matcher and Coarse Matcher.
The Fine Matcher 82 includes three components: 1) a Minutiae Pairer 86, 2) a Ridge Count Verifier 87, and 3) a Conflict Identifier/Resolver 88. The Minutiae Pairer 86 utilizes the refined quality map from the Coarse Matcher Products File 83 and data from the Products File 50, 60. The algorithmic processes employed pair up the minutiae using search fingerprint and file fingerprint data; the minutiae data being from the elements of M.sub.final. The pairing of the minutiae between the file and search data is achieved by employing a relaxation method. The relaxation method pairs minutiae based on Support Functions, which provide a measure of the consistency of each minutiae pair with all other pairs, from which the most consistent set of pairings are extracted. Section B-2 of Appendix B describes the algorithmic processes of the Minutiae Pairer 86.
The remaining two components 87 and 88 of the Fine Matcher develop the metric of the scoring of the closeness of all minutiae matching evaluations performed between minutiae in good quality areas of the file fingerprint and corresponding overlapping areas of good quality in the search fingerprint. Those good quality areas known with high confidence to not contain minutiae (referred to as non minutiae areas) are also used in the scoring process based on the containment of such data stored in the image state map, Q.sub.final, of the Products File 50, 60.
Non Minutiae Areas of one fingerprint (search or file) are compared to the corresponding area in the other fingerprint. If they are like areas (both minutiae bearing, or both non minutiae) then the scoring that measures "a match" is adjusted to strengthen the "good match" indication. If they are not like areas, then the scoring is adjusted to weaken the possibility of a "good match" indication. The comparison scoring of closeness of fingerprint match based on both knowledge of non minutiae and minutiae content we refer to as Dual Hypothesis Matching.
The Ridge Count Verifier component 87 forms constellations for the minutiae appearing in the Search Fingerprint and File Fingerprint. It can be said to dynamically form constellations because the selected group of minutiae from the search print will be different from one file fingerprint data record comparison to the next. (i.e. the constellation of the search fingerprint may change from one file fingerprint to the next) A different constellation results from always using minutiae from only those areas of the fingerprint that are of good quality in both the search fingerprint and the file fingerprint. It compares the closeness of match of the constellations to one another by counting the ridges between neighboring minutiae within each constellation.
Two ridge counts are obtained, one for the File Fingerprint and one for the Search Fingerprint. Ridge counting is accomplished using data stored in the Products File 50, 60 and an algorithmic process developed in Advanced Encoder for finding ridge counts between associated feature pairs of Core and Delta and Core and Core (Appendix A, Algorithms 38). The sequence of minutiae in each constellation having been previously established by the Minutiae Pairer 86 component of the Fine Matcher. A score of one is given if the ridge count difference is zero or one for each matched paired minutiae; if the ridge count difference is greater than one, then decrement the score by one. The score is recorded in block 89. Section B-3 of Appendix B describes the algorithmic process.
The Conflict Identifier 88 determines where conflict exists between minutiae of the Search Fingerprint and Minutiae in the same area neighborhood of the File Fingerprints. Conflicts which naturally arise due to plastic distortion and other factors are handled by degrading the score output in block 89 by the Ridge Count Verifier 87. This component utilizes the Image State Map, Q.sub.final, from the produced Products File 50, 60, particularly those areas on both prints where there are no minutiae. The minutiae captured by the relaxation method are those that are in common on both print images.
On matching images, there are generally a number of unpaired minutiae because one print has poor quality in an area where the other print was clear, or because part of one print was not inked where the other was, etc. In the scoring algorithm, the unpaired minutiae on the search fingerprint are mapped to the file fingerprint using a least mean squares to refine the fit, or by simple rotation. If the unpaired minutiae from the search fingerprint maps to an area of the file fingerprint known to have no minutiae, subtract one from the score. Similarly, the unpaired minutiae from the file print is mapped to the search fingerprint and the score is adjusted as required. Section B-4 of Appendix B provides the detail of this algorithmic process.
Scoring occurs throughout processing of a fingerprint in both the Coarse Matcher 81 and the File Matcher 82, but the score is finalized at the end of the process in the scoring block 89 of FIG. 42. A final score is derived using the score outputs of both matchers 81 and 82, using the scoring method of algorithm B-5 of Appendix B. The scores from each matcher element are statistically combined to take advantage of the fact that scores from either matcher 81 or 82 are mathematically orthogonal.
The coefficients necessary for statistical combination such as to take maximum advantage of the orthogonal properties are obtained by analyzing the scores from both the Coarse Matcher 81 and the Fine Matcher 82 across a population of fingerprints (such as NIST9) for known "matched" pairings and for known "unmatched." A distribution of scores is obtained for matched and unmatched condition for both the Coarse Matcher and the Final Matcher. The two score distributions are plotted with abscissa of each being the Coarse Matcher score and the ordinate the Fine Matcher score. Distribution plots on the match and non-match coordinate systems may overlap at points. Proper statistical combination will minimize the overlap, i.e., maximize the score separation between match and non-match for the final combined score. The coefficients that achieve minimum overlap will be different for latents than for ten-print cards, so a limited set of maximizing coefficients would be determined and stored for appropriate application in scoring the particular kinds of fingerprints being compared.
Appendices A (relating to the Encoder 30) and B (relating to the Matcher 80) lists the Algothrims mentioned in the specification are contained in a microfiche attached to this application. These computer algothrims are described as a combination of mathematical symbolic expressions and computer pseudocode.

Inhibition of mild steel corrosion in 60 ppm chloride medium by Polyacrylic acid (PAA), Trisodium citrate (TSC) and Zn2+ ions was investigated by weight loss measurement, potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance studies (EIS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning electron spectroscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicated that the TSC acts as an optimum in the inhibition efficiency (95%) is observed for a concentration close to 100 ppm, addition to increase in TSC concentration decrease the inhibition efficiency. Potentiodynamic polarization studies inferred that this mixture functions as a cathodic inhibitor. EIS studies of the metal/solution interface indicated that the surface film is highly protective against the corrosion of mild steel. Surface characterization techniques (FT-IR, SEM, EDS and AFM) are also used to ascertain the nature of the protective film. The mechanical aspect of corrosion inhibition is proposed.

Since Rick Miller appears to know more about me than I do, I’ve asked him to be my webmaster and maintain this blog. Here you’ll find up-to-the-minute news and a wealth of archival material—interviews, press clippings, and pieces that I’ve written through the years—all organized by subject and equipped with an efficient search engine.
That’s right. The man who, in 1976, began chronicling the gay movement in San Francisco, came from a conservative family in Raleigh. His father, so the story goes, led the entire family out of church when the minister preached for integration.
A few years ago, Maupin told an interviewer: “My only regret about being gay is that I repressed it for so long. I surrendered my youth to the people I feared when I could have been out there loving someone. Don’t make that mistake yourself. Life’s too damn short.”
In October, Transworld will release Maupin’s first memoir, “Logical Family,” where he recounts, according to the Guardian, “his evolution from a conservative son of the Old South into a gay rights pioneer, via Vietnam and the bathhouses of 1970s San Francisco.”

Willing to work but stuck at home is the fate that many immigrant spouses face every day. Some of them are having a hard time to land a job in the same profession, even if they’ve beem working in the same field for years back home. Depending on the job, American companies won’t hire you unless you’re retaking classes and get an American degree or license for it.
But there are also ways to earn some money from the convenience of your home. You’ve probably noticed these “Get Rich from Home” ads in the newspaper or online, that promise you to earn an insane amount of money by putting in very little work from home. I’m sure you can earn some money with whatever is mentioned in the ad, but you’re probably not getting rich with it and they usually require a small investment upfront, which kills the deal for most of us.
A little while ago I stumbled over a neat way to earn some money on the side without investing a lot of money, if any at all. It’s called Affiliate Marketing and a lot of businesses and private people are already doing it behind the scenes to have an additional source of income. Some people have been so successful with it, that they were able to quit their job and go full time with it. Others just supplement their income with a few bucks a day earning commissions as a form of passive income. Let me tell you more…
Have you ever searched for product reviews or just some information online and landed on some of these “The Best 20 xyz” sites, that showcase a bunch of products with links to buy them? The owner of this website is earning commissions by placing affiliate links and driving traffic to online stores and services. Links can lead to all kinds of sites like web hosting services, travel sites, cell phone providers and a whole lot more. And I’m not talking about web banners. That is a different stream of income. Affiliate links can be placed by either an image or a simple text link like this one here to Amazon.
Or take a look at this image on the left. If you click on it, you’ll get on Macmall.com through my affiliate link and if you buy anything on there, I will get a small commission on the purchase. The reason why Macmall.com would pay me is because I brought in the customer. So you’re not actually selling product, you’re just referring customers to the seller.
Yes, I am using Affiliate links on Live Work Travel USA, too. Not on all links, but on some of them. And I’ve learned that it totally works and helps me to get back some money that I spend on web hosting and my Domain name, let alone the countless hours that I put into this blog researching and writing articles. So, if you find this Blog helpful and would like to say thanks, I do appreciate if you go through my links before making a purchase.
Amazon, ebay or Expedia are probably some of the better known companies, who offer Affiliate Programs (Did you pick up on the text links?). But there are thousands of other websites worldwide that offer the same thing. Commissions are either paid as a percentage of the purchase price or a predetermined commission per sale. It varies for each merchant.
Let’s take a look at Amazon as an example, because everybody knows Amazon and what they’re selling. Imagine you wrote a review about a blender and placed an affiliate link to the Amazon product page of this blender. Whenever somebody clicks through this link, a cookie is being placed in the person’s internet browser, that tracks all purchases made on Amazon within a 24 hour time period. The tracking results go to Amazon, not to the Affiliate, so don’t worry, everything is totally anonymous. And here’s the best part: You, as the Amazon affiliate who brought in the customer, will get a commission on not only the blender, but all other products that have been purchased by this customer within 24 hours. This person might not even buy the blender, but an expensive watch or a book and you’ll get commission on that too. And we all know how good of a job Amazon is doing in upselling customers by recommending relevant products before you complete your purchase.
Some merchants like Amazon stopped paying their Affiliates residing in Connecticut, Arkansas, Illinois, Colorado, Rhode Island and North Carolina, because these states are trying to force online merchants to charge sales tax on purchases made by their residents. Have you ever wondered why you don’t have to pay sales tax on Amazon purchases in most states? Online stores just have to charge sales tax, if their customers reside in the same state the store operates in. If you’re trying to earn money with Affiliate Marketing in the states mentioned above, you’re out of luck for the moment. At the time of writing this article, a Marketplace Fairness Act is being discussed, that will allow states to collect taxes from internet merchants. This might bring back affiliate programs to the states mentioned above.
FTC regulations also require every Affiliate to disclose that you are a part of an Affiliate program and that you earn money with these links.
No, absolutely not! Whoever makes a purchase through your link will pay the same amount that they would have paid, if they went to the merchant’s website directly. Your commission is a cut of the total purchase price, so it’s been taken away from the merchant’s profit.
Pull up an online merchant’s website and look for their Affiliate Program in either the header or footer. They usually don’t draw too much attention to it. For some others you would have to google “Affiliate + merchant’s name” to get to their hidden page about the program. If they have one, and not all merchants do, you would have to apply to be an Affiliate, which may or may not be approved.
If you get approved, you will have access to a page where you can generate affiliate links with a tracking code. This code tells the merchant who referred the customer, so that they can pay you a commission on the purchase.
The opportunities are endless and you have the opportunity to participate not only in the U.S., but in a lot of other countries as well. Affiliate Marketing is wide spread and has been out there since the late 90′s. You don’t necessarily have to have a website in order to place affiliate links. Forums, Social Networks, Chat Rooms, Email – there’s no limit where you couldn’t share an Affiliate Link to earn a commission. Some internet forums might not like it, because they’re earning money through affiliate links, too, and don’t like to share the extra money.
If you do run a blog or website already, you should look into Affiliate Marketing to monetize your hard work and dedication. Loyal readers sometimes even welcome the opportunity to repay you for all your good information, that you are providing for free.
I’ll go into more detail about Affiate Marketing in a future post, because it’s a very fascinating stream of income, that not a lot of people are aware of. If you have any questions or topics that I should write about, please let me know in the commenting section below.
What many people do not know is that ClickBank will not pay you a dime if you do not meet the following conditions:
Not receive a single penny if you only made ​​two sales. You must make at least 5 to receive your first payment.
This requirement is implemented to prevent affiliates from abusing the ClickBank Affiliate program by using their accounts for the sole purpose of collecting rebates or discounts fraudulently in their own purchases.
When you have met the customer distribution requirement, your account will begin issuing payments normally, in accordance with our accounting, from the next air date of payment.
This means that 10 people can buy the product you are promoting but if you only do it through Pay Pal, though not otherwise comply with the requirements.
That is some thing to think about if you want to be an affiliate with clickbank, you should give other platforms a chance. An maybe you will find a path to cash
Hi,the guide i just read is a teaching-one.But please how can i get started in Nigeria without having to pass through the dubious means already flocking the internet.
Ope, check out online stores that you would be interested to be an affiliate for and see if they have an affiliate program. It’s usually at the footer of the page. If you can’t find it just google the name of the store plus “affiliate”. Sometimes the affilate page is a little hidden.
Not sure if your country is eligible for everyone’s affiliate program, but there’s still Google AdSense to earn a few bucks with your site.
With this blog I share my thoughts and experience about the expat life in America. No matter if you're a new or veteran expat or just love everything USA, you'll find plenty of tips and ideas in this blog. Enjoy!
It's been a while since I've posted a new article. Life has been happening all over and around me. A lot of people see an idea that catches their eye and inspires them to read this blog. But, like most of us, we're looking for the magic pill, the secret elixir that will transform our lives from a place we're not happy or comfortable to that perfect life we're all seeking.
Well, that's not how it works. There are no magic pills or secret elixirs. Achieving the idealistic objective of living free and being happy takes time, research, energy, effort and - yes, just plain old WORK. There is no one size fits all. There are approximately 7.5 billion people inhabiting this piece of space dust we call home . . . planet Earth. And, every one of us is different and individual, even twins, triplets, etc.
There are so many things to discuss in an article like this. But, it seems like only a very few, basically countable on less than two hands, are willing to stick our necks out and introduce topics, ideas, concepts, philosophies, possibilities, realities, etc. I could suggest we few are the ones who may be closer to the answers for our own lives. I can only think that all those who are sitting in the background expect me and a few others to reveal a path to living free and ultimately being happy. Sadly, that isn't how it works in life.
Yesterday I read a blog post by a fellow nomad (he refers to himself as a vagabond). His name is Wade Shepard and his blog is titled "Vagabond Journey." He titled his September 21st blog article, "The USA Is 'Unlivable.' Ouch! This guy is un-American. If he doesn't like it here he should leave.
Have you ever taken a moment to do some reverse thinking? No! I don't mean negative thinking. I mean reverse thinking.
I read an interesting guest post in one of the many blogs I subscribe to and read semi-regularly (because I only have the same 24 hours in a day everyone has). The title of the post was "Imagine Life Without This." The author, Nataly Kogan, is an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, who fled with her family at 13 and lived in refugee camps with little food, comfort or any idea if they had a future. She is now, happily in the U.S. and has a new book coming out on May 1st titled "Happier Now: How to Stop Chasing Perfection and Embrace Everyday Moments (Even the Difficult Ones)."
She makes some excellent points, coming from her own experiences. If you read what most of us write about, somehow it always seems to be how tough our lives are, how deprived we are of certain things we know would make our lives better and happier and how we always seem to want more as soon as we achieve a goal or acquire something new that we want. As soon as the novelty or exhilaration passes, usually within a very short period of time, we want MORE or BETTER.
Those were three questions that crossed my mind the other day as I was doing some reminiscing about my own life and, sort of, comparing my life to the lives of some of my family, friends and associates.
Superficially, these don't necessarily seem like deep questions. But, when you begin peeling away the layers, we will each find some pretty interesting, probably amazing and, quite possibly, awesome things about ourselves. For most of us, it took a long time to get “here,” wherever here is for you. In many instances, probably the better part of a lifetime. Perhaps you were fortunate enough to start gleaning these answers when you were quite a bit younger than me and my contemporaries. Consider yourself ahead in the game of life.
If we are like most normal people, we begin forming who we will eventually become at a very early age during our childhood. As we grow, our minds expand. We learn more and more about people, history, the world around us, what people do for a living (occupation/profession), what they do for recreation, hobbies, past times and family life. And, of course, we learn more and more about responsibilities, accountability, ethics, morals and the social system we reside in including government, social and civil controls on our lives.
If we are born and raised in a developed, western nation we are told we live in a free society. That is, we are free to do anything we want to do and live any way we want to . . . providing it doesn't cross the lines of the laws, regulations, codes, statutes, rules, limitations, restrictions, etc. established for everyone to live by. That may not seem like such a big deal until you realize that no one actually knows how many federal laws there are today. Back in 1980, the federal laws filled 23,000 pages. Today, there are some 20,000 laws just on gun use and ownership (yet, the public wants more laws – are we enforcing the 20,000 already existing laws?). And, there are currently 4,450 federal crimes with new ones added every year. Here's a thought, how many of these federal criminal laws have you broken?
And, guess what? These don't include state, county, local, homeowners association, work related, school related, religion-related and other laws, codes, statutes, regulations, rules, etc. we are expected to abide by. Do you feel a bit overwhelmed?
So . . . It's January 1, 2018. As you may have guessed about my philosophy on New Years Resolutions, I don't believe in them.
But, here is a question for you, and I hope you'll take just a few moments and contribute your thoughts and ideas.
What ONE THING can you do this year to make this your best year ever? It doesn't have to be Earth shattering or world saving. I can be about yourself, your family/friends, it can be about your community or country or the world at large. It doesn't have to be complicated, time consuming or costly. I trust it will be POSITIVE. It's just ONE THING you can do to, by your own definition, make this the best year of your life, ever.
If you recall, in the last post on Regret #1, I told you about the article Richard Rosen sent me from Dr. Joseph Mercola's Health Newsletter. The title was "What You Can Learn From Other People's Regrets."
He gathered his information from a book titled, "The Top Five Regrets of the Dying," by Bronnie Ware, a former palliative care nurse who interviewed many dying patients during her career. And, remember I'm not approaching this topic from a negative perspective. I simply want to address the regrets as discussion points.
When I woke up this morning, early, actually well before sunrise, I scanned my email, as I regularly do. I deleted those that held little interest this morning and then went back and opened those from friends or blogs I usually read or news feeds to scan the headlines. There I found an email from a friend and reader of this blog, Richard Rosen. He forwarded a link to a newsletter article, suggesting it was something I could have written.
Long story short, Richard was on the right trajectory. I've touched on some of the topics in some of my blog articles in the past. So, I thought I'd share some of the points made in the article with you with the hope of stimulating some open discussion. Remember, everyone has their own perspectives on these kinds of topics. There are no right or wrong ideas.
The title of the article was "What You Can Learn From Other People's Regrets." The author, one Dr. Joseph Mercola, who publishes the Mercola Health Newsletter. But, more specifically Dr. Mercola expounded on the regrets people have as they approach death. He gathered his information from a book titled, "The Top Five Regrets of the Dying," by Bronnie Ware, a former palliative care nurse who interviewed many dying patients during her career.
I'm not opening this up from a negative, we're all dying, approach. Rather, as a way to do something NOW to avoid these regrets when we reach our "user expiration date," someday.
But, even before I address that idea, what do I mean by an unfree world? Don’t we live in a free country? Aren’t we free to do anything we want to? Doesn’t the U.S. Constitution (for those who are U.S. citizens or residents) guarantee our freedom? Even if you live in other developed countries claiming to be open and free societies, are you really free?
Here is a hard fact. If you live in any society with any kind of governance: democratic, parliamentary, republic, monarchy, dictatorship, socialistic, communistic, totalitarian or any other form of governance you can name . . . you are NOT free. As long as there is any kind of authority that prescribes laws, regulations, rules, restrictions, limitations, covenants, constraints or any other form of control over your thinking and/or actions that you must subscribe and adhere to, you are not free.
So, is it actually possible to be 100% free? From what I can tell, as long as you live on this planet and interact with other people and live within the borders of any area considered to be some form of jurisdiction under some organized, societal structure, I have to say no. It’s not possible to ever be 100% free.

The Empire Cinema Malta is an impressive high tech movie complex, situated on the main road leading to the center of Bugibba.
This touristic resort is very popular and is usually extremely busy during weekends and the Summer months.
All the theatres are equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and are fully air-conditioned throughout the year. Nevertheless, prices are not expensive and start from only € 4.65 per adult, even for the latest blockbuster movies.
During weekdays, movies start showing at around 1pm and the latest ones at 9pm. On weekends there are movies playing as early as 11am and the program is longer too, with the last ones starting around 11:30pm. Within the Empire Cinema, there is also a fully stocked bar and restaurant.
If you’re looking for a complete list of all movies showing now at the Empire Cinema Complex, I suggest you to visit the official website. Here you will find information about upcoming movies, high resolution previews and can even book the tickets online.
Online since 2002, LivinginMalta.com (formerly Malta.cc) is arguably the most popular blog about Malta and the Maltese people. We encourage you to have your say and start contributing too!
Dave May and I met today to shoot this week’s test vehicle, the 2012 Infiniti QX56. Eager to find a location that suited the vehicle and always up for something new, we decided to photograph the QX in a parking garage.
I took a photo of Dave on the scene (top left) with my phone’s camera, but it couldn’t handle the low light. Then Dave offered me a “real camera.”
So, I’m no Dave May, but it was fun to play around while the professional did the hard work. And while many of the photos were out of focus – Dave doesn’t allow any stinking auto focus, even for me – others provide a bit of a behind-the-scenes look.
The location presented certain challenges, but also opened up new possibilities. I look forward to sharing them in the review of the QX.

He hasn't arrived yet. Damn... This is going to be a very long week... That's what I want most. Of course, I didn't tell her.
Can you drive me to the airport? Masanao talked Duncan into going to Boston with him. Sofia came back home covered in mud. At last, they reached the top of the mountain. The services at the hotel are first-rate. I want to drink something cold. I've never been good at singing. On the one hand, the place is cheap. On the other hand, it's too hot.

The group withdrew their support for the Government. It was impossible to come up with a really satisfactory solution. Blaine is going to be punished for what he did. At least they should have a map.
I let them in the house. There's no telling what kind of trouble this proposal might stir up. The result is certainly going to be something to see. What made it difficult for you to carry out the plan? Don't you find me pretty?
Jesse doesn't have a full-time job. It's necessary to wait just ten days. Nadeem is absolutely terrified. That's exactly what I want to know. There is a mysterious legend surrounding this lake.
Let's review the evidence. She is as beautiful a model as I have ever seen. I believe that's what you said. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand. Are you going to school today? Do you need me to pick you up?
That's nice. How about inviting John and Kylo? I should quit. My phone has a caller ID that lets me screen my calls.
They asked Mrs. Lincoln where she wanted her husband buried. Biologists assert the losses are severe. Richard is just trying to make us feel guilty. This basement is huge.

Although men may generally find it easier to suffer or live with hair loss, for women the situation is quite different. Hair loss in women can have serious emotional and social implications. At Confident Hair we understand your needs and with our experience....... We will provide a free consultation and support.To help you out of your hair loss is our topmost priority.

Everybody has a story about their cracked windshield. I have heard them all in my years of operating A Discount Glass mobile windshield replacement service.
There’s the one about the gravel truck. You know, the 18 wheelers that always sling rocks all over the place. At least that is what the myth is. But when it happens to you, that makes it truth. Rocks can come from anywhere. A motorcycle can even flick a rock into the air when hit on the edge of the tire.
When it does happen, it’s like a slow motion movie. You see the rock bouncing and spinning on the road surface and it is heading right for you. You can’t swerve out of the way. You just have to concentrate on the road and let the rock hit you.
It’s an awful sound too. Sometimes it starts as a small chip and works itself into a spider crack. Then from there, over the months, the crack grows as your windshield is heated from the sun during the day and cooled over night. Constantly expanding and contracting, ever so slightly.
No, it’s not. The law says that you can not place or mount anything that obstructs your view. In fact, the annual inspection does not include an item for windshield cracks. Just as long as it does not damage the windshield wipers. Those are inspected.
So what do you do about it? Do you drive all over Huffman, Crosby or across to Humble to find a shop to replace it? Frankly, that is a waste of time. Once you find shop you’ll have to make an appointment and go back, drop off your car, truck, SUV, big rig…and have someone pick you up. That’s a lot of unnecessary hassle!
Skip the hassles of windshield replacement shops. My shop is on four wheels. We come to you. You keep working, watching or playing with the kids. Heck, go to the movies! I’ll work right there in the parking lot while you enjoy the latest action movie.

August 31 is the annual deadline for most truckers to file their federal vehicle use tax return – form 2290 and pay any taxes they owe. By law, the IRS may assess penalties to taxpayers for both failing to file a tax return and for failing to pay taxes they owe by the deadline. Taxpayers who owe 2290 tax, and failed to file and pay on time, will most likely owe interest and penalties on the tax they pay late. To keep interest and penalties to a minimum, taxpayers should file their tax return and pay any tax owed as soon as possible.
The Federal Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Form 2290 is imposed on vehicles operating in public highways with a gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more. August 31 is the general due date for taxpayers reporting 2290 returns, however the due date for any taxable vehicles first used on a public highway during or after July 2018 by the last day of the month following the month of first use.
The taxable period for form 2290 begins on July 1 of the current year and ends on June 30 of the following year.
File Form 2290 electronically, you must e-file your Form 2290, Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Return, if you are filing for 25 or more vehicles, IRS encourages e-filing for anyone required to file Form 2290 and who wants to receive quick delivery of their watermarked Schedule 1. With e-file, you’ll receive it almost immediately after IRS accepts your e-filed Form 2290.
Before the due date of the return, you may request an extension of time to file your return by writing to:
In your letter, you must fully explain the cause of the delay. Except for taxpayers abroad, the extension may be for no more than 6 months. An extension of time to file doesn’t extend the time to pay the tax. If you want an extension of time to pay, you must request that separately.
As President Obama heads to the Climate-Change Summit, I'm sure he has factored in that there are less people in our world due to Islamic terrorism.
Did you see the new pre-K curriculum? Individualism part 1, Personal Accountability part 1, wow, don't we wish!
Did you ever notice that, with 7.2 billion people in our world, nobody looks and acts exactly the same. When will the Socialists/Progressives realize this?
Water boarding is designed to protect future generations. Planned Parenthood is designed to destroy future generations.
Sometime in the middle of the night, the Liberals rebranded themselves as Progressives. However, if it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.
The liberal Democrats painted Governor Romney as "out of touch with the American people" because he was rich, however the Clintons have more money!
The liberal Left expects the "have nots" to be taken care of by the "haves." But the "haves" have left!
Know I now why President Obama brought Obamacare to the American people. He's divided us, created a massive budget deficit, developed a social network that will eventually implode upon itself and all while using a gift of shallow rhetoric. He's made us all sick!!!
OMG! Our President has successfully insulted the leaders of Canada, Israel, and France, all within the same month. He has established a foreign policy on the fly and orchestrated useless political rallies. He wants community college tuition to be free and he recently interviewed nonentities on YouTube. He has increased the debt to $18 Trillion. WAE! (what an embarrassment) LOL! The joke is on us.
If you're an accountant, then you'll know how important it is to concentrate on the numbers your clients send you. Do you really want to be distracted by your phone ringing?
I think that accounting is one of the most mentally intense professions. You have to get the final balances and taxes due absolutely penny perfect and if you don't, your client could get into trouble with HMRC and your reputation could go down the pan.
So we recommend a call handling service to take that worry away from you. Many of The Office Genie's clients are professionals, who really need to concentrate. From creative types to certified pros, all of them need to focus on client work.
And regardless of whether you're a solo accountant or work within a team, there's always going to be times when you can't ... or don't want to ... answer the telephone.
Research shows that it takes 20 minutes to get back into the zone following a phone call, so if you want to keep your concentration while working for your clients, then call handling is for you!
And how about your clients? When they want to talk to you about something completely unrelated to what you're doing, trying to switch your brain from one to the other is stress you don’t need. Maybe letting the call divert to us to take a message would be a great idea?
The Office Genie offers a range of call handling packages for you. From simply answering the phone (the way you would) and emailing a message to you, to becoming your full-on receptionist service working with multiple team members and diaries, we can help you.
In the midst of snow-filled days, we look for those “clean well-lighted” places written about by Ernest Hemingway—a place to escape to when we’ve grown weary of our own four walls.
There’s a winter wonderland in Chautauqua County waiting to escape to—a place to embrace the winter rather than endure it. From cozy teahouses to softly lit restaurants serving bowls of steaming soup, and warm lodges nestled in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains, there’s something for everyone here that will make believers out of the most serious of winter curmudgeons.
It could be that the best time to pull up to Lana’s The Little House is in the midst of winter. The beautiful storybook cottage in Forestville is right out of a European fairytale, and guests say there’s nothing better than scurrying out of the cold to alight inside for a hot cup of tea and a tour of this art-filled cottage and gift shop. Owner Lana Lewis only gives out the address and details upon reservation, and hundreds of happy visitors from around the world have done just that. (Phone: 716-965-2798. Website: Lanasthelittlehouse.com)
If you’re looking for a cup of coffee to warm your toes, Stedman Corners Cafe in Mayville makes for a charming stop, and the locals swear by the coffee. Once a general store, breakfast and lunch are served in a cozy and eclectic atmosphere. They serve and sell locally-roasted coffee, too, which is probably why it’s so good. (Open Tue– Sat, 7 am –2 pm. Sunday at 8 am. 6335 Magnolia-Stedman Rd, Mayville. Phone: (716) 789-5047)
This restaurant’s simple elegance invites the winter traveler in for a warm meal and a tall glass of wine, but it’s the roaring fireplaces that seal the deal. Built as a replica of an old English inn, Ye Hare and Hounds Inn in Bemus Point has been warming travelers and locals alike since 1921. Choose the “Bar Bites” menu for lighter fare along with a special coffee drink. (64 Lakeside Dr., Bemus Point. Phone: 716-386-2181. Call for winter hours.)
This charming restaurant at Peek ‘n Peak Resort offers an award-winning Sunday brunch piled high with homemade muffins, fruits, cheeses and other offerings, but the atmosphere is just as delicious as the food. A grand fireplace welcomes you in from the cold, enhanced by old-world ambience with warm wood furniture and beveled glass windows in the dining room. (B,L,D served daily. 1405 Old Road, Peek ’n Peak Resort, Clymer. Phone: 716.355.4141 ext. 7155. Website: www.pknpk.com)

"Maclaine’s powerhouse vocals...she belts in a way that would lift the roof" Alex Galbraith, Offbeat Magazine
Jesse Maclaine's Aural Elixir records and performs original songs as well as popular covers of folk, jazz, rock, pop, classic hits, and more! Many people note this music is reminiscent of Sara Bareilles, Regina Spektor, Fiona Apple, Joni Mitchell, Tori Amos, Jewel, Carole King, Judy Collins, and even Edith Piaf! Classically trained and rooted in Jazz traditions, mezzo soprano-pianist-composer Jesse Maclaine creates Aural Elixir music. 20+ years as a successful professional performer and recording artist, still within a sturdy framework of popular covers, obscure treasures, and finely crafted originals lives an irrepressible wave of inspiration and a deeply rooted desire for improvisation ensuring each expression of a song is a unique experience. Whether solo, duo, or larger ensemble, Aural Elixir's Jesse Maclaine delivers beautiful, soulful music that is both accessible and defies categorization!
In April 2018, Aural Elixir opened for Melissa Etheridge on 4/20 at Denver's International Church of Cannabis! Never one to shy away from musical adventures, Jesse's regional and national tours performing Aural Elixir music have led her to work with Grammy award winning engineers like David Glasser at Airshow Mastering, and share stages with truly remarkable musicians like Johnny Vidacovich (Bobby McFerrin, Charlie Hunter), Ryan Elwood, Lynn Drury, Alex McMurray, Carlo Nuccio (Tori Amos, Emmylou Harris), and many more. You can hear Aural Elixir music on popular radio stations across the country (like our fav WWOZ New Orleans!) as well as on internet radio and streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, Amazon, and iHeart Radio.
Last year Jesse was commissioned to score a musical for a popular Colorado based production company, and this year she has officially completed that project... her first full length musical! Also in 2017, she produced and released the 6th Aural Elixir CD, a live EP entitled "Better" and she is touring the US sharing her new music while also working on a series of singles to be released this year and next. 2018 has seen some exciting new developments too! Aural Elixir has founded the Musical Women Show and Social Hour to increase visibility of women in music and strengthen the Colorado community of professional and aspiring female and female identified musicians, played over 100 shows, composed/arranged/performed the music for "Witches and Harlots" an original play presented by Mercury Cafe and Allied Witches Theater, contributed a song to the compilation CD for the Musician's Resistance, and recorded/produced quite a few new live videos. As if that's not enough, this year Jesse has begun composing her first symphonic piece, due for release next year, entitled "St. Gertrude's Symphony for Cats."
At just 21 years old, shortly after she moved to New Orleans, entrepreneuse and visionary Jesse Maclaine dreamed of an adventurous, refined yet light hearted multi-genre musical group balancing both complex arrangements and improvisation - a vehicle for her to express her panoply of musical interests, artistic fancies, social commentary, and tales of real or imagined experiences - so she founded Aural Elixir. While the Crescent City remains an indelible influence, Aural Elixir has been based in Colorado for over a decade.
Jesse Maclaine has dedicated her life to being a musical pioneer with Aural Elixir - successfully composing, performing, recording, and producing music which defies categories and uniquely shines as a refreshing alternative to the derivative, over-produced music that dominates our modern world. Classical training, jazz studies, pop sensibilities, and decades of experience as a professional entertainer inform Jesse Maclaine's compositions and performances, empowering her to craft each concert into a truly one of a kind special event.
Aural Elixir is currently accepting concert bookings, commissions for custom songs, soundtracks, short term or ongoing composition projects, vocal overdubs (lead, background, or multiple parts), private parties, music lessons, workshops, songwriting coaching sessions, freelance vocal/piano/keyboard performances and recording sessions. Feel free to contact Jesse with any questions or for a complimentary consultation and estimate: jesselixir@gmail.com or 720-442-0789.
Click the links above for your favorite social network and stay connected with Aural Elixir to hear new songs, enjoy new videos, get all the latest updates, share your thoughts, and interact with an open-minded community of music lovers. Peace, Love, & Music!

Video Game Bundles - There is unlikely to be much variety when it comes to video game bundles this year. A price will be set early, and most retailers will copy the established deals. Expect Amazon and Best Buy to both have Microsoft Xbox One X Bundles for $399.99, Microsoft Xbox One S 1TB Bundles for $219.99, Microsoft Xbox One X consoles for $374.99, Nintendo Switch Bundles starting at $299.99, and Sony PS4 Pro bundles for $274.99.
An Apple sale is rare, and seeing Apple products for sale on Amazon is even rarer. This Prime-only deal, which knocks $14 off the original price is perfect for Apple fans who are ready to declutter their daily life and embrace the best true wireless headphones we've ever tested. Their small size gives them a leg up over the other, often bulky and uncomfortable, options out there, not to mention they deliver decent sound quality, have a long battery life, and work flawlessly with other Apple devices.

You also can sign up to receive daily, twice-a-week or weekly emails with deal alerts.
So what's worth buying? Well, you can't go wrong with the second generation of the flagship Echo, which we named the best overall Alexa device. It's got great sound quality, can hear you well, and has interchangeable "skins" so you can match any decor. The Fire TV Stick, while it's not our top pick for streaming devices, is perfect to add to less-used rooms like guest rooms and garages, especially when it's on sale. But, realistically, every Echo has the same Alexa software inside it, and every Fire TV gives you access to the Amazon streaming platform, so go with the one that speaks to you, your needs, and your budget.
Before picking up this excellent book, I was wary of online shopping -- and I still am, but now I'm intelligently wary. The authors do a marvelous job of helping understand what you can trust and what you can't, how online shopping works in all its various manifestations, and what strategies to use when you do shop online. The book showed me that online shopping is not (as I had thought) just for shopping addicts who need a fix 24 hours a day, but a great space for intelligent and discerning consumers. I'm still not a big spender online (or anywhere), but I've used the book to help me find some things I couldn't find anywhere else and at surprising prices. I think this book is going to go down in the so-far brief history of online commerce as a milestone achievement. It has certainly changed my views about WWW commerce and made me a better consumer. I can't say enough about this expansive, easy-to-use, fun, and informative work. I hope they plan to update this work regularly.

As the weather gets colder and the holidays start packing on, we're gravitating towards sugary goods and comfort foods. To help get more vegetables in your diet in between feasts, you should invest in a spiralizer. These fun cooking gadgets transform vegetables into "noodles," so you can still enjoy lighter versions of your favorite meals like shrimp lo mein and sweet potato noodles with goat cheese. The Paderno is the best countertop spiralizer we've ever tested and right now, it's at one of it's lowest prices. We loved this model because it quickly shreds through vegetables and comes with four interchangeable blades, giving you endless veggie noodle options.
At first I thought, why do I need amazon on my tv? But then, I thought, of course I need amazon on my tv! It’s actually pretty handy, and I’m not talking about just ordering shows or movies. If you just want to look at something quickly, there’s no need to fire up the computer or tablet or look for your phone (which I can never find quickly). If you want to show someone a product, poof, it’s on the tv which is so much easier to look at than my tiny phone screen! Also, if you use your alexa voice control, it’s all hand free. Admittedly, mine often has to be told a couple of times and the transition isn’t seemless by any means, but in all, it works out pretty well when I remember it’s available!
Because the browser does identify the small print from the reader's screen (window size, font measurement relative to window etcetera.) the browser can make user-unique format changes to fluid layouts, although not set-width layouts. Though such a Exhibit might normally change the relative placement of major content material units, sidebars can be displaced underneath entire body textual content as opposed to on the aspect of it. This is the a lot more versatile Display screen than a tough-coded grid-based mostly layout that does not in good shape the device window. Specifically, the relative position of articles blocks may perhaps improve while leaving the content inside the block unaffected. This also minimizes the consumer's have to horizontally scroll the web page.

The Department of Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering of the University of Naples was founded in 1983, and presently gathers about 90 people (teachers-researchers, technical staff and PhD students), with research activities in the fields of Microelectronics, Electromagnetic fields, Telecommunications, and Biomedical Engineering.
The “RF device modelling and characterization” team of the Microelectronics group at UN, leaded by Prof. N. Rinaldi, has recently focused its research activity on the modelling, characterization and simulation of self-heating effects, and more in general, on reliability issues which limit the safe operation area of bipolar devices. This activity is supported by in-house developed characterization systems not commercially available including: i) a RF pulsed characterization system which allows measuring RF characteristics (S parameters) under controlled temperature conditions; ii) a direct chip temperature measurement system.
UN is involved in WP1 (WP leader) and WP4. The research activity in WP1 include 3D thermal simulation (goal: understand thermal properties of SiGe HBTs, and the effect of scaling); Safe-Operating-Area analysis by 2D and 3D electro-thermal simulation (goal: investigate the SOA limiting effects in aggressively scaled devices). The research activity in WP4 include: development of predictive dynamic thermal models of SiGe HBTs including multi-finger structures.

Southwest, Texas, Gulf Coast of the United States, South Atlantic United States, Middle Atlantic states
The North Texas Snowstorm of 2022 was a historic snow event that buried the Southern United States , most notably North Texas, with over 2 feet of snow from January 16 to January 19. It had origins from a shortwave trough extending from British Columbia down to Baja California during January 14-15. A state of emergency was declared for 5 southern states on January 15, with blizzard warnings issued in 2 states. Over 15 million were affected by the snowstorm, including over 2 million who lost power. The storm also claimed 16 fatalities . On the RSI, the storm ranked as ''Category 4 Crippling''.
On January 14, a shortwave trough formed over British Columbia, Canada. During the next two days, it moved southward through the Pacific Coast region. The National Weather Service began monitoring it on the day it formed for possible storm development. On January 15, it became clear that it would soon develop into a storm. Forecasters in the Southeastern U.S. began predicting up to 8 inches of snow in certain areas. On January 16, the trough spawned a surface low over Baja California, a defined-low pressure area. At the time, the minimum barometric pressure was 1,004 millibars. The system then began to track towards the east while frontogenesis took place. As a result of that and other moisture coming in from the Pacific Ocean, rain began falling in Southern California and Arizona, becoming snow in mountainous areas. During the afternoon hours of January 16, the low began to weaken over the mountainous terrain of Central Mexico. However another weakening low pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico began feeding the original low. At that time, forecasters began upgrading their snowfall totals. By the afternoon of January 17, the system had absorbed all of the secondary lows energy while it was located over South Texas and bombogenesis took place . Subsequently, the system moved into the Gulf of Mexico and bombed out to 976 millibars while it was located 100 miles offshore of Houston, Texas. Afterward it began to weaken during January 18-19. By the morning of January 19, the minimum barometric pressure increased to 1,000 millibars as it moved ashore of Florida. After crossing Florida, the system then tracked off the coast of Georgia and the Carolinas, while precipitation totals decreased. It reached the Mid-Atlantic region on January 20 before turning toward the northeast. By January 21, the system had completely left the East Coast of the United States.
The National Weather Service issued watches and warnings from their offices in 4 states on January 15. Winter Storm warnings were issued for Northeastern Texas, Northern Louisiana, Northern Alabama and Northern Georgia. On January 16, the warnings in Northeastern Texas and Northern Louisiana were upgraded to Blizzard warnings. Storm warnings were issued in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. On January 15-17, the governors of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia declared a state of emergency due to high forecasted snowfall totals. Over 2,500 flights were canceled between January 15-19, mainly at Dallas/Fort Worth and Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airports. As a result ripple effects were felt internationally. Amtrak suspended service on the Texas Eagle, City of New Orleans, and the Crescent. Some concerts and sporting events were also postponed by the storm. Also because of the storm, an 850 mile section of Interstate 20 was closed.
A snow emergency was declared for several northeastern counties on January 16 including Dallas and Fort Worth. People were forbidden from parking on snow emergency routes after 4:00 CST. Schools in the Dallas-Forth Worth area were cancelled for January 17 due to impending blizzard conditions. The Texas Department of Transportation deployed over 7,500 snowplows and salt trucks to keep roads clear. The state's national guard was mobilized for January 15. On January 16, DART and TRE service was shutdown for January 17 and 18. All flights all Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Love Field were cancelled on January 16 for January 17 and 18. In South Texas, advisories were also issued for heavy rain and coastal flooding including urban areas like Corpus Christi and Houston. Strong winds and storm surges also posed a threat to coastal areas. Waves were expected to reach 7 to 8 feet.
A state of emergency was declared for Northern Louisiana on January 15. Schools in the Shreveport and Monroe areas were closed for January 17-18. Over 4,500 salt trucks and snowplows were deployed to clear roads. The state national guard was placed on standby on January 16. On January 17, a travel ban was issued for Shreveport due to numerous snow related incidents. Further south, Storm surge and Coastal flood warnings were issued. Storm surges were expected to reached 8 to 9 feet. In southern areas of the state, heavy rainfall was also anticipated.
A state of emergency was declared for Mississippi on January 15. Schools in Meridian and Jackson were closed for January 17-18. The state's national guard stood by beginning on January 16. Salt trucks and snowplows in numbers of 3,000 were put on duty to clear roads. Coastal areas received Storm surge and Coastal flood warnings. Southern areas of the state were also expected to receive heavy rain.
A state of emergency was declared for Northern Alabama on January 15. Heavy snowfall projections caused flights to be cancelled at Birmingham and Huntsville airports for January 18. Schools in the major metro areas were closed for January 18. Salt trucks and snowplows in quantities of 4,000 were deployed to keep roads clear of snow and ice. Near Mobile, Coastal flood and storm surge warnings were issued. Southern areas of the state were projected to receive heavy rain.
A state of emergency was declared for Northwestern Georgia on January 15. A snow emergency was declared for Atlanta on January 17. Salt trucks and snowplows were deployed as well as the state's national guard on the same day. Cars were forbidden from parking on snow emergency routes after 2:30 PM EST. Schools in Atlanta were closed for January 18. All flights at Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport were cancelled for January 18, 19, and 20. Further south, heavy rainfall was projected.
Although snow was not forecast to fall in Florida, heavy rainfall, coastal flooding, and storm surges were expected to pose a threat to residents in the northern areas of the state.
More than 15 million were affected by the snowstorm. It claimed 16 fatalities, 3 in Texas, 6 in Louisiana, 2 in Alabama, 3 in Georgia, 1 in Mississippi, and 1 in Florida. More than 2 million people lost power, 640,000 in Texas, 410,000 in Louisiana, 50,000 in Mississippi, 50,000 in Alabama, 800,000 in Georgia, and 50,000 in Florida. In the South and Southeast, the RSI number was 17.183 ranking it as ''Category 4 Crippling'' in those two regions. Travel was also disrupted. In Dallas/Forth Worth and Atlanta, it became the biggest snowstorm on record.
Heavy rain fell across Southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico, turning to snow at higher elevations. All of the major mountain passes in Southern California were closed due to heavy snow. San Gorgonio Pass recorded 6.3 inches of snow, a new daily record for January 16. Trace amounts fell as low as 1,000 feet, causing traffic on the low mountain to slow to a near-standstill. In El Centro, two people were injured after their car skidded on wet pavement from heavy rain, and crashed into a brick wall. In Arizona, heavy rain and snow caused mudslides in the Phoenix area. As a result, 24 cars became stranded. Up to 18 inches of snow fell at higher elevations. I-17 was closed between Camp Verde and Flagstaff due to snow drifts blocking the highway. In New Mexico, heavy rain and snow caused many mountain roads to be closed. Heavy snow fell across the Eastern Plains on the afternoon of January 16, peaking at 22.3 inches in Ruidoso. One person in Roswell was injured after hitting himself in the head with a snow shovel.
Heavy snowfall occurred across North Texas. Dallas-Forth Worth International Airport set a new all-time record of 21.2 inches of snow. Here are other snowfall totals from other parts of the metro area

Printer manufacturer OKI Data Americas announced the addition of the B700 Series of monochrome printers, priced from $625 to $1,249 and designed for small to medium-size workgroups. The B700 Series has a variety of performance-enhancing features, including an alphanumeric keypad with a five-line blue backlit LCD display for navigation and menu access. A USB port located on the control panel allows users to print directly from a flash drive. Additionally, all models can print up to 95 envelopes without the need for a separate external feeder.
All B700 Series models come with 128MB of memory and the option of increasing memory to 640MB for processing large files. The mono printers offer standard security features through user access controls, administrative management solutions, storage device security and security protocols. All models can be purchased through OKI Data Americas' authorized partners.
Registered User Database works in conjunction with OKI Job Accounting software (standard) to limit user access, Protocol Admin enables or disables individual protocols, and Password Access via the Web provides general administrative control and access to a library of secure prints. Finally, with six-digit Strong PIN and the capability to auto-delete coupled with the secure erase functionality, administrators can require a PIN for stored jobs on hard disk drive or flash memory, delete stored jobs after designated expiration date, and erase data on hard disk or flash memory.
In addition, the printers offer a variety of environmentally friendly features. Toner-Save Mode, a user-selectable setting, reduces the use of consumables when lower resolution output can be utilized. One-piece consumables decrease waste by lowering the number of items to dispose of or store, while duplexi printing saves energy and paper. The company also noted all B700 Series models are Energy Star-complaint and engineered to perform with low power requirements during regular operation.
The B700 Series comes in six configurations that deliver a compact footprint and up to 52 pages per minute, with first page speeds of up to 8 seconds. With a monthly duty cycle of 200,000 pages, the line also features a 700-sheet standard paper capacity (which is expandable to 1,800 with optional second and third paper trays). The B700 Series is also flexible enough to handle paper weights to 216 gsm. With a high paper capacity and toner yields of up to 26,000 and a print resolution of 1,200 by 1,200 dpi, the B700 Series provides output on a variety of media from small cards to banner-size sheets.
"The full-featured, energy-efficient B700 Series brings professional quality and functionality for small to midsize workgroups at a cost-effective price, enhancing overall office efficiency," said Carl Taylor, director of marketing for OKI Data Americas. "With the addition of this series to our diverse portfolio of printing technologies, our partners have more choices in providing reliable printing solutions to customers, meeting the ever-changing and -demanding workplace requirements within the SMB market."

ExEdUK members are invited to regular (usually quarterly) meetings to learn about recent developments in the international education sector, insight into ongoing policy and political discussions, and hear from expert speakers about issues of relevance to all international educators.
We will be joined at this meeting by David Ramsbotham, Head of Sponsorship (Citizenship, Work, Study & Premium) at UK Visas and Immigration, who will provide an update on the Sopra Steria roll-out and other Tier 4 developments.
The meeting will focus on supporting members to engage with the APPG for International Students on its forthcoming Inquiry: A sustainable future for international students in the UK? Following the meeting, members are also invited to observe the first oral evidence session from 5pm-7pm in Parliament.
At this meeting of Exporting Education UK, we welcome the education team from the Department for International Trade (DIT), who will present on their current projects and activities before leading an interactive session with members. You will meet with DIT’s Education Sector Lead Geoff Gladding and specialists from his team, learning about emerging export opportunities and the support that DIT can provide, as well as being able to feed in your views and experiences of any barriers you may have faced in making the most of international markets.
DIT was established in 2016 after the Brexit referendum, absorbing the investment and export functions of UKTI as well as taking responsibility for developing new UK trade policy. DIT ministers see the export of education in all its forms as a major potential growth industry and therefore a priority for the UK. They have therefore recently established an Education Sector Advisory Group chaired by the trade minister Graham Stuart MP in order to shape government strategy in this area.
Our staff will close the meeting with our regular update on key developments in UK politics and international education, as well answering any particular questions you may have.
At this meeting of Exporting Education UK, we have as our guest speaker Stephen Earl, who is head of policy for the Migration Advisory Committee and leading on the MAC’s work to assess the economic and social impacts of international students in the UK.
We will also have an update from Pat Saini, head of immigration at City law firm Penningtons Manches, on student visas including the changes made to the Immigration Rules in December and other recent developments.
Our staff will finish off with an update on key policies and activities related to international education, and answer any questions you may have.
This meeting of Exporting Education UK will focus on making an impact in the ever-changing UK policy environment for international education. The sector’s drive to make the UK more welcoming is sometimes at odds with the political rhetoric on immigration, Brexit and access to education.
Our facilitators will set out the key opportunities over the next 12 months where the education sector needs to come together to make a positive change for international education in the UK.
Group discussion on areas where international education providers can work together to lobby for changes in government policy
ExEdUK is a network for international educators, providing a forum for sharing good practice and working to support, protect and promote the UK’s international education sector.

Use the Sun’s unlimited FREE energy to provide you with lower electricity costs and a clean energy source.
When these savings are combined with government incentives, a ‘solar smart’ solar electricity system is the obvious economical choice.
Design and Specification, All Systems are designed and sized by All Solar Systems to specifically suit your house.
Reliable Performance, every cell is individually inspected, strictly adhering to ISO 9001 quality and ISO 14001 environmental standards .
Solar cells are made of semi-conducting materials such as silicone and convert sunlight into electricity. When sunlight is absorbed, the solar energy knocks electrons loose from their atoms, and the electrons flow through the material producing low voltage electricity.
This process of converting light (photons) to electricity (volts) is called the PHOTOVOLTAIC effect.
When the thin silicone wafers, or cells, are wired together their combined electrical output is increased. So different sized panels are produced depending on the number of cells contained therein and they are commonly sized by their output of Watts.
Because PV panels are modular and can be connected together easily, they are often referred to as ‘solar modules’. Two types are commonly used, Mono-crystalline and Poly-crystalline. Mono-crystalline cells perform better in low light conditions.

The child's primary role model will be the maladaptive, dysfunctional parent. He or she will not have the benefit of growing up with the most well-adjusted parent and all that this parent can contribute to enrich the child's life. Many of these children come to experience serious psychiatric problems.
Will they ever grow up and realize what happened to them? Without someone who can recognize the syndrome and counsel them about it, it isn't likely that they will ever figure it out. However, there have been exceptions where the child and the alienated parent have been successfully reunified later in life.
Those people who are typically called upon to handle such difficult situations, such as the police, social workers, attorneys or psychologists assume that what the frightened mother is saying is true. These things DO happen. There are men who are seriously disturbed, violent, out of control sexually, and stalk, who are rightfully feared. The mother is very convincing in her desperation and vivid in her descriptions. The clincher is that the alienated child collaborates with the mother by saying, "Yes, I am afraid of my father." "Yes, my father did touch me down there." "Yes, he does beat me." What would you do if you were faced with having to decide how to protect a child in such a situation? Therapists
Some therapists don't realize the severity and depth of the problem. In fact, they may unwittingly side with the alienating parent and even testify in court that the child is afraid of the alienated parent. This can be a serious stumbling block in getting an accurate diagnosis. Indeed, it can tip the scale into the alienating parent's agenda and do real damage.
Our courts, social services and mental health workers are all committed to stop child abuse and neglect when they see it occurring. Unfortunately, in parental alienation situations a dramatic and loud complaint from the alienating parent often ends up being acted upon without an investigation as to the accuracy of the allegation. This frequently removes the alienated parent from the children and allows the alienating parent considerable additional time to proceed with the alienation. By the time all of the evaluations are in place and the case is heard by the court, considerable damage has been done to the child. It is an irony that the very people we turn to for help in such a difficult situation can often be those who most contribute to allowing the on-going abuse and neglect of the child to continue. What can be done about the problem? First, it takes a sophisticated mental health professional to be able to identify that parental alienation is occurring. Most forensic evaluators such as psychiatrists and clinical psychologists have studied the underlying disorders and are able to recognize them.

This parenting plan option presents a two day / two day / five day / five day approach to timesharing, and limits separation from the other parent to five days (generally tolerated by children ages five or older). All transitions can take place at school or daycare to eliminate the opportunity for parental conflict. By establishing a consistent midweek residence routine, both parents get both midweek and weekend time allowing full involvement in their children’s work and play, and permitting relief from parenting on a predictable basis.
Not surprisingly, the adult children with parental alienation syndrome believed that this experience had negative long-term consequences for them. Many spoke of suffering from depression, turning to drugs and alcohol to numb the pain, failed relationships and multiple divorces and, most sadly, becoming alienated from their own children later in life. In this way, the intergenerational cycle of parental alienation syndrome was perpetuated.
The key function of a child's family is to raise the young person in as healthy amanner as possible (e.g., see ). The parents' role is to provide the childwith a safe, secure, nurturant, loving, and supportive environment, one that allows theoffspring to have a happy and healthy youth; this sort of experience allows the youth todevelop the knowledge, values, attitudes, and behaviors necessary to become an adultmaking a productive contribution to self, family, community, and society .
Regardless of how the cult is abandoned, leaving represents only the beginning of the recovery process. Considerable time and effort is required (usually in therapy) to process the experience and undo the negative messages from the cult that have become incorporated into the self. The same may be true of adult children of parental alienation syndrome.
This parenting plan option imposes seven days separation from the other parent, often quite difficult for children younger than six or seven years of age. It eliminates the opportunity for face-to-face parental conflict by minimizing transitions, and allows both parents and mature children to “settle” into a routine. The children’s cyclical residence can, of course, complicate management of scheduled lessons, activity commitments and daycare arrangements. Some adolescents may even prefer a schedule with two week blocks at each household.
The research and clinical literature on recovery from cults offers useful ideas for therapists working with adult children of parental alienation syndrome. For example, the way in which a person leaves a cult has ramifications for the recovery process. Cult members can walk away from a cult, be cast out of a cult, or be counseled out of a cult. Those who walk away (come to the realization on their own that the cult is not healthy for them) and those who are counseled out (those who are exposed to a deliberate experience designed to instigate the desire to leave) tend to fare better than those who are cast out (those who are rejected from the cult for failing to meet its regulations and strictures) (Langone, 1994).

The new sixth edition -- the only comprehensive psychiatry textbook to integrate all the new DSM-5(R) criteria -- provides the most up-to-date, authoritative, insightful foundational text in the field. Its contributors include authors of the definitive texts in their areas of specialization.
This manual attempts to provide simple, adequate and evidence-based information to health care professionals in primary health care especially in low- and middle-income countries to be able to provide pharmacological treatment to persons with mental disorders. The manual contains basic principles of prescribing followed by chapters on medicines used in psychotic disorders; depressive disorders; bipolar disorders; generalised anxiety and sleep disorders; obsessive compulsive disorders and panic attacks; and alcohol and opioid dependence. The annexes provide information on evidence retrieval, assessment and synthesis and the peer view process.
Sleep Medicine is one of the fastest growing fields of medicine and of strong interest to neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, pulmonologists, otolaryngologists, and the technologists who perform sleep studies. Almost all of the major medical centers in the US now have centers for sleep disorders. In 2007, sleep medicine will become an official medical subspecialty, with board examinations being administered by the American Board of Medical Specialties. Sleep Medicine: Essentials and Review will cover this new field by providing a book that can be used both as a practical, outline-style text for managing sleep disorders and as a "high yield" review for preparing for the sleep medicine board exam. In addition to the text, the author will include 150 board-type multiple choice questions with answers and explanations. Dr. Lee-Chiong is a major authority in the field and author of a comprehensive sleep medicine textbook.
Do you suffer from panic, anxiety, and fear in your day-to-day life? Do you often avoid social situations, activities like driving, or even going to the store because of a fear of being overwhelmed or triggering a panic attack? You might be interested to know that anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the United States. In Anxiety and Avoidance, psychologist and anxiety disorder expert Michael Tompkins presents a universal protocol to help you cope with anxiety, panic, and fear, regardless of your particular mental health diagnosis. This universal protocol is based on David H. Barlow's "unified protocol," and is a cognitive behavioral approach. Tompkins also draws on mindfulness-based therapies such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) that have been used successfully in the treatment of anxiety disorders for years. The book includes present-moment awareness (mindfulness) techniques, motivational tools for overcoming experiential avoidance, and cognitive tools for reframing anxiety and fear. In addition, you will learn how to use your personal values as a vehicle for lasting change. While most anxiety treatments have focused on symptom reduction, this book teaches you the skills needed to better handle the underlying emotional reactions that lead to anxiety and panic in the first place. If you are ready to stop avoiding situations that cause you to panic and get back to living a full life, this book is a powerful resource that can help you make a lasting change using an innovative, transdiagnostic approach.
Play Therapy: Treatment Planning and Interventions: The Ecosystemic Model and Workbook, 2e, provides key information on one of the most rapidly developing and growing areas of therapy. Ecosystemic play therapy is a dynamic integrated therapeutic model for addressing the mental health needs of children and their families. The book is designed to help play therapists develop specific treatment goals and focused treatment plans as now required by many regulating agencies and third-party payers. Treatment planning is based on a comprehensive case conceptualization that is developmentally organized, strength-based, and grounded in an ecosystemic context of multiple interacting systems. The text presents guidelines for interviewing clients and families as well as pretreatment assessments and data gathering for ecosystemic case conceptualization. The therapist's theoretical model, expertise, and context are considered. The book includes descriptions of actual play therapy activities organized by social-emotional developmental levels of the children. Any preparation the therapist may need to complete before the session is identified, as is the outcome the therapist may expect. Each activity description ends with a suggestion about how the therapist might follow up on the content and experience in future sessions. The activity descriptions are practical and geared to the child. Case examples and completed sections of the workbook are provided. It provides the therapist with an easy-to-use format for recording critical case information, specific treatment goals, and the overall treatment plan. Workbook templates can be downloaded and adapted for the therapist's professional practice. Presents a comprehensive theory of play therapy Clearly relates the theoretical model to interventions Provides examples of the application of both the theory and the intervention model to specific cases Describes actual play therapy activities Workbook format provides a means of obtaining comprehensive intake and assessment data Case examples provided throughout

Sometimes called an afterthought thumb, I first read about it in Elizabeth Zimmermann's Knitter's Almanac.
This method is used in fetching but it is also very common in a lot of stranded, and Norwegian style type mittens.
I really like this method because it's seamless; sometimes when patterns have you place stitches on a holder and then cast on the top stitches you can get an odd seam right in the crease where your thumb meets the hand, and that can be uncomfortable.
The only trouble that some people may have with this method is that you cannot immediately try on your mitten in progress, as you can with mittens where the stitches are put on holders. But if you want to you can just knit a few more rows and then pick up the stitches instead of waiting until the mitten is done, threading the waste yarn through them so you can try on your mittens as you knit.
Knit to where you want to place the thumb hole, and take a length of contrasting yarn, and knit the thumbhole stitches with it instead of your working yarn:
(Fetching uses a ribbed pattern. When knitting with the waste yarn, just knit plainly, and when knitting back across the waste yarn, knit plainly again, then pick up any stitch patterns again once you've passed the thumb. If using colour patterns, they can be resumed right away as you are knitting over the waste yarn. It is just easier to pick up the stitches later if they are all knit.)
As it begins to get awkward to fit them on the needle, slide them onto the cord and continue picking up all along the top edge:
When you get to the end of the row, there will be a stitch where the waste yarn only holds half of it; you want to pick that stitch up too:
The top row will have one more stitch than was originally knit onto the waste yarn, and the bottom should have as many as was originally knit.
Usually, patterns will say that after picking up stitches you'll have one side equal, and one side with one less stitch, but I find that the method I use results in fewer holes.
Now, start puling out the waste yarn, with no worries of a dropped stitch, since they are all already on the needles!
(The fetching are open at the top, so I stuck them out the top, if making a closed top mitten, just send them out the wrist.)
I like to make sure the top and bottom are equal in stitch count, and it really helps to tighten things up and prevent holes if one more stitch is picked up and put on bottom needle:
If things are still a bit loose at the sides of the thumbhole, just pick up one more stitch at each end and knit it together with the next stitch on each needle on your first round.
From here you can either move all the stitches to DPNs or you can keep up with the circulars and knit the thumb magic loop style.
Knit your first round through the back loop for extra security and tightness, to further help prevent holes.
If doing colour work that requires a certain number of stitches, simply decrease or increase evenly along your first row to achieve that number.
I've been wanting to make a pair of these for a friend of mine, but the thumb had me a bit confuzzled. Now that I can see it, it makes perfect sense though.
You should crosspost this at Knitting; I'm sure there're plenty of people there who'll find it useful too.
I have made afterthought thumbs for mittens, but I didn't use the contrasting yarn stitch holder - I just cut a stitch, unraveled it to make an opening, put the stitches on several dpns and knit the thumb. EZ encouraged me not to be afraid of cutting knitted fabric.
I like the snip and ravel too, but I usually prefer this method because I can see where my thumb is going right away. (I may make tons of changes to knitting patterns, and often fly by the seat of my pants, but I'm not that spontaneous! :D)
I too am making "fetching" fingerless gloves, and this is the exact spot I was stuck. Your tutorial was just what I needed to continue. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
I am exactly like Sarah--I did a web search for pictures of this technique and found this post. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
I always relied on my Mom to help me out of a knitting jam, but she died from breast cancer and I can no longer ask her for help. I miss her and her help.
Any chance you have photos of what to pick up when picking up the two stitches between the bottom and top of the thumb on the Fetching pattern? I've tried several times, and just end up with large holes in the fabric. I'm not sure exactly which loop to pick up on the sides. Thanks.
Thanks very much for your clear narrative and illustrative pictures. I have been struggling with how to learn to make a thumb on a mitten. I have too many knitting books already, and not one of them had as good of pictures. Many thanks.
Thank you so much for this tutorial and helpful, clear photos. I'm an intermediate knitter but have never used this technique before and was having trouble finding step by step instructions. Sheryl in Providence, RI, USA
Every time i try and learn a new technique the pix always get in the way.I mean ,the picture shows the step but it always left me feeling like i was missing part of the step or if icould only see it in motion...
Your pictures were so clear it clearly showed the steps instead of a shot of the needles and a typed tutorial it had an accurate visual accounting of the technique.
Thanks! I'm knitting the Fetching fingerless gloves, and I couldn't quite figure out this trick from the directions... (It seems I'm not the only one!)
I have made mittens, but not with this thumb type. Before I found your very easy to follow directions, I used sock yarn, then dental floss, to hold the shiches. It didn't work. I found your website, used a thicker yarn, followed your directions, and it was EASY, it WORKED, and THANK YOU!!!!
Realize this is an older post, but had to compliment you on the tutorial. It's a text-book example of how to write & illustrate a potentially confusing technique. Brava, & thank you.
Very easy to understand and I loved the pictures! I am not afraid of mittens and the thumbs now. My grandchildren thank you :-)
It IS easy to understand with the pics,but mine certainly doesn't look as easy as your picture shows it ought to be to see the 'live' stitches on the reverse side, especially if you are knitting a mixture of k and p.Also,my pattern says to slide the needlesinto the live stitches above and below the waste yarn, whereas yours says the ones between the waste yarn stitches.As there is only one little 'row' of waste yarn there isn't a 'between' anyway!! You show a rowof waste yarn sts, then 2 rows of live stitches and then another little row of waste yarn. VERY CONFUSING!
Howmany row with the waste yarn ought there to be? When you slide the waste yarn stitches from the r.h. needle back to the left and re-knit them, are you really doing thi with your live yarn or are you doing it again with the waste yarn. Or do you actually only ever knit these the one time with the waste yarn? If so, how did you end up with live stitches to pick up in between those waste yarn stitches if there is only one row of them?
and howdo wetell which is one stitch from another when the row has k and p stitches, because they don't all look like neat little 'v' shapes in this case!
Is it ok if I link to you on my blog? I got really stuck on doing what you covered in this post so I put a link in the post to this article. And I listed you in my favourate blogs bit. Fairly determined not to lose this page. Well also I'm one of those people you put the "would it kill ya to comment" picture up for. I read but don't say much.
I've just linked to this again and it occured to me that this time i should try harder and remember to ask if it is ok. I'll remove it if you want. I'm http://spydergryphon.blog.co.uk/ here now if you want to check.
Thank you for posting this article with all the pics. I'm making the Fetching fingerless gloves right now. I'm a new knitter and had no idea what waste yarn was or how to make thumb holes. Can't wait to try this technique. Your post was the only one I found that explains each step clearly. Thank you again!
As my circular needles were not available - waiting to be unpacked - I used dpn's for picking up the stitches;
slid the dpns until needle tip could just be poked through one side of thumb hole to right side, while holding onto last stitch near tip;
then slid the needles through all the stitches until other end of needle could just be poked through opposite side of thumb hole to the front. Knit on from there.
This was the finishing of self designed long wrist warmers for an exchange project the next day. Love the technique, wonderful results. Thank you Thank you! (linked from Ravelry)
HI again, in appreciation I have posted your knitting aid to my knitting and completion blog. www.birdsinflight.typepad.com.
Thank you for clarifying this method. I tried following a pattern where it asked me to do this, and I ended up making the thumb hole about half the size it was supposed to be. What a disaster! Thanks for helping me fix my mess!
Thank you for taking the time to do this...even if I already understood it, it's nice to read someone's well-thought-out explanation!!! (to see if I realllllyyyy understood it haha)
Thank you for the clear explanation and step-by-step photos. I'm making my first pair of mittens, and this tutorial has been extremely helpful!!!
In fact, I've just finished picking up the stitches inside, turning the mitten right side out and now I'm ready to knit my first thumb ever. Whew. It was easy because of your directions. Thanks again!
I've been stuck at the thumb on some arm warmers and this is the first set of instructions that has even begun to make sense. I'm going to give it a try. Thanks for the assist.
I have been looking for help with the thumb. I was totally stumped until I saw this page. Thank you for posting it! Maybe I can finish my daughters (My first time knitting mittens) mittens before Christmas!
The fear of dropping stitches had me afraid to try Fetching. Your post offered such clear instruction that I was able to successfully knit the pattern and I'm wearing them right now.
CAL-apparently you didn't read the entire tutorial. It clearly says to KNIT the stitches with the contrast yarn and then KNIT again with the working yarn over the thumb stitches so it will be easier to pick the stitches up.
Thank GOD for your willingness to explain, take wonderful pics AND for your ability to do so. I am doing the "Fetching" mitts as recommended by my LYS owner. I had all the questions that every one else did. Now, in two minutes, I am ready to go forward. YEAH!!! Yesterday was my 73rd Bday. I began learning one year ago, from YouTube. When I can understand and do something like this thumb (which I could not quite visualize)it is sooo exciting. You are assuredly in my "How To's" Folder. Thank you again!!!
Yes, very nicely done. I didn't see this on YouTube and it should definitely be there. You could do a slide show format with your pictures and the instructions. So much better than what is posted there now.
Yes! I was ready to jump into my car and head to my knit shop an hour away to get help. Now I can do this. Thank you.
Thank you so much for this! I was totally perplexed by the patterns instructions - this made it so clear.
Don't wear the same old boring white shirt everywhere. Designer shirts have taken off in the last few years and can make any man stand out and look great.
I’m knitting a peasant thumb for the first time and I was concerned about not being able to try the mitt once I knitted in the waste yarn. I was considering putting the stitches on a holder. Following your advice resolves the problem, thank you!
I might have gotten a little too ambitious. I'm learning Selbuvotter mittens and I thought this would work better than the knitted instructions (cast off 13 stitches, reverse loop cast on 13 stitches). I wanted to maintain the colorwork pattern through the inside of the thumb, but when it came to pick up the purl stitches on the reverse side between the waste yarn purl rows, I couldn't find the purl for the contrasting color because of all the stranding (mc mc mc cc, mc mc mc cc, etc), and what I ended up picking up was the stranding so that the stitches were too big. (I'm working on 2.5mm needles with Dalegarn Falk.) I grabbed my size 0 circulars and nearly went blind trying to find the right thing to pick up. Then I knit the first round. I thought I had done everything correctly as possible, but when I pulled out the waste yarn, I discovered I had inadvertently knitted the thumb hole together again. I don't understand how I did that. I carefully pulled out the new stitches leaving live stitches exposed. Not so scary with Falk; it's a pretty grabby wool. But it is superwash, so I'd be concerned about steeking it partly because the thumb needs to move and steeking can impede movement. So I picked up the live stitches and started again. I'm now halfway through the thumb, but I will definitely need to go back in with waste yarn and patch the holes on either side of the thumb. I think what I need to do is try this on a swatch instead of Christmas mittens with a bigger yarn and needle so I can see what I'm doing. It was an adventure to say the least. But I know it will work. It will just take some practice.

This relatively nontechnical book is the first account of the history of statistics from the Fisher revolution to the computer revolution. It sketches the careers, and highlights some of the work, of 65 people, most of them statisticians. What gives the book its special character is its emphasis on the author's interaction with these people and the inclusion of many personal anecdotes. Combined, these portraits provide an amazing fly-on-the-wall view of statistics during the period in question. The stress is on ideas and technical material is held to a minimum. Thus the book is accessible to anyone with at least an elementary background in statistics.
These volumes present a selection of Erich L. Lehmann’s monumental contributions to Statistics. These works are multifaceted. His early work included fundamental contributions to hypothesis testing, theory of point estimation, and more generally to decision theory. His work in Nonparametric Statistics was groundbreaking. His fundamental contributions in this area include results that came to assuage the anxiety of statisticians that were skeptical of nonparametric methodologies, and his work on concepts of dependence has created a large literature. The two volumes are divided into chapters of related works. Invited contributors have critiqued the papers in each chapter, and the reprinted group of papers follows each commentary. A complete bibliography that contains links to recorded talks by Erich Lehmann – and which are freely accessible to the public – and a list of Ph.D. students are also included. These volumes belong in every statistician’s personal collection and are a required holding for any institutional library.
Over Half a Million Copies Sold--an Honest-to-Goodness Bestseller Darrell Huff runs the gamut of every popularly used type of statistic, probes such things as the sample study, the tabulation method, the interview technique, or the way the results are derived from the figures, and points up the countless number of dodges which are used to full rather than to inform.
Equivalence: Elizabeth L. Scott at Berkeley is the compelling story of one pioneering statistician’s relentless twenty-year effort to promote the status of women in academe and science. Part biography and part microhistory, the book provides the context and background to understand Scott’s masterfulness at using statistics to help solve societal problems. In addition to being one of the first researchers to work at the interface of astronomy and statistics and an early practitioner of statistics using high-speed computers, Scott worked on an impressively broad range of questions in science, from whether cloud seeding actually works to whether ozone depletion causes skin cancer. Later in her career, Scott became swept up in the academic women’s movement. She used her well-developed scientific research skills together with the advocacy skills she had honed, in such activities as raising funds for Martin Luther King Jr. and keeping Free Speech Movement students out of jail, toward policy making that would improve the condition of the academic workforce for women. The book invites the reader into Scott’s universe, a window of inspiration made possible by the fact that she saved and dated every piece of paper that came across her desk.
Past, Present, and Future of Statistical Science was commissioned in 2013 by the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) to celebrate its 50th anniversary and the International Year of Statistics. COPSS consists of five charter member statistical societies in North America and is best known for sponsoring prestigious awards in statistics, such as the COPSS Presidents’ award. Through the contributions of a distinguished group of 50 statisticians who are past winners of at least one of the five awards sponsored by COPSS, this volume showcases the breadth and vibrancy of statistics, describes current challenges and new opportunities, highlights the exciting future of statistical science, and provides guidance to future generations of statisticians. The book is not only about statistics and science but also about people and their passion for discovery. Distinguished authors present expository articles on a broad spectrum of topics in statistical education, research, and applications. Topics covered include reminiscences and personal reflections on statistical careers, perspectives on the field and profession, thoughts on the discipline and the future of statistical science, and advice for young statisticians. Many of the articles are accessible not only to professional statisticians and graduate students but also to undergraduate students interested in pursuing statistics as a career and to all those who use statistics in solving real-world problems. A consistent theme of all the articles is the passion for statistics enthusiastically shared by the authors. Their success stories inspire, give a sense of statistics as a discipline, and provide a taste of the exhilaration of discovery, success, and professional accomplishment.
This book was written for those who need to know how to collect, analyze and present data. It is meant to be a first course for practitioners, a book for private study or brush-up on statistics, and supplementary reading for general statistics classes. The book is untraditional, both with respect to the choice of topics and the presentation: Topics were determined by what is most useful for practical statistical work, and the presentation is as non-mathematical as possible. The book contains many examples using statistical functions in spreadsheets. In this second edition, new topics have been included e.g. within the area of statistical quality control, in order to make the book even more useful for practitioners working in industry.
Like many other scientists, I have long been interested in history. I enjoy reading about the minutiae of its daily unfolding: the coinage, food, clothes, games, literature and habits which characterize a people. I am carried away by the broad sweep of its major events: the wars, famines, migrations, reforms, political swings and scientific advances which shape a society. I know that historians value autobiographical accounts as part of the basic material from which the stuff of history is distilled; this should apply no less to statistical than to political or social history. Modem statistics is a relatively young science; it was while pondering this fact sometime in 1980 that I realized that many of the pioneers of our field could still be called upon to tell their stories. If, however, biographical material about these eminent statisticians was not gathered, then one might lose the chance to gain insight into the origins of many an important statistical development. The remarkable experience of these colleagues could not be readily duplicated. Fired by these thoughts, I took it upon myself to plan the framework of this book. In it, eminent statisticians (probabilists are included under this title) would be invited to sketch their lives, explain how they had become interested in probability and· statistics, give an account of their major contributions, and possibly hazard some predictions about the future of the subject.
Written by one of the top most statisticians with experience in diverse fields of applications of statistics, the book deals with the philosophical and methodological aspects of information technology, collection and analysis of data to provide insight into a problem, whether it is scientific research, policy making by government or decision making in our daily lives.The author dispels the doubts that chance is an expression of our ignorance which makes accurate prediction impossible and illustrates how our thinking has changed with quantification of uncertainty by showing that chance is no longer the obstructor but a way of expressing our knowledge. Indeed, chance can create and help in the investigation of truth. It is eloquently demonstrated with numerous examples of applications that statistics is the science, technology and art of extracting information from data and is based on a study of the laws of chance. It is highlighted how statistical ideas played a vital role in scientific and other investigations even before statistics was recognized as a separate discipline and how statistics is now evolving as a versatile, powerful and inevitable tool in diverse fields of human endeavor such as literature, legal matters, industry, archaeology and medicine.Use of statistics to the layman in improving the quality of life through wise decision making is emphasized.
Celebrating the life of an admired pioneer in statistics In this captivating and inspiring memoir, world-renowned statistician George E. P. Box offers a firsthand account of his life and statistical work. Writing in an engaging, charming style, Dr. Box reveals the unlikely events that led him to a career in statistics, beginning with his job as a chemist conducting experiments for the British army during World War II. At this turning point in his life and career, Dr. Box taught himself the statistical methods necessary to analyze his own findings when there were no statisticians available to check his work. Throughout his autobiography, Dr. Box expertly weaves a personal and professional narrative to illustrate the effects his work had on his life and vice-versa. Interwoven between his research with time series analysis, experimental design, and the quality movement, Dr. Box recounts coming to the United States, his family life, and stories of the people who mean the most to him. This fascinating account balances the influence of both personal and professional relationships to demonstrate the extraordinary life of one of the greatest and most influential statisticians of our time. An Accidental Statistician also features: • Two forewords written by Dr. Box’s former colleagues and closest confidants • Personal insights from more than a dozen statisticians on how Dr. Box has influenced and continues to touch their careers and lives • Numerous, previously unpublished photos from the author’s personal collection An Accidental Statistician is a compelling read for statisticians in education or industry, mathematicians, engineers, and anyone interested in the life story of an influential intellectual who altered the world of modern statistics.

For the last 20 years, notorious activists the Yes Men have staged outrageous and hilarious hoaxes to draw international attention to corporate crimes against humanity and the environment. Armed with nothing but thrift-store suits and a lack of shame, these iconoclastic revolutionaries lie their way into business events and government functions to expose the dangers of letting greed run our world.
In their third cinematic outing (after The Yes Men and The Yes Men Fix the World), they are now well into their 40s, and their mid-life crises are threatening to drive them out of activism forever – even as they prepare to take on the biggest challenge they’ve ever faced: climate change. More than the first two films, The Yes Men Are Revolting is as much a character study as it is an entertaining depiction of their latest interventions. Revealing the real people behind the ruses, at its heart lies a hopeful message about fighting for change.

If you’re a dog owner, as many of us are, you should be aware that the Lubbock Animal Shelter has advised that there's been a significant rise in cases of Canine Distemper Virus in the Lubbock area.
Our City animal shelter has recently undergone many changes. One of which is our common goal of increasing our total live release rate, while preserving high quality of life. We strive to reach this goal, while being mindful of our responsibility to keeping our community safe.
One challenge that we face every day is the high numbers of sick animals that come into the shelter. One such illness that is particularly concerning is Canine Distemper Virus. Distemper is a very serious contagious disease that is deadly if not treated and may be deadly even if treated. Symptoms of distemper do not appear immediately, may first mimic kennel cough, and later show up as vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, seizures and, finally, death. The only way to fight distemper is through prevention: early and continuous vaccination throughout the pet’s life.
We are particularly concerned that we are seeing a rise in distemper in both our surrounding community as well as in dogs rehomed through the shelter. Because this illness is so dangerous, we need to act with urgency. I want to share with you the steps that are already in place to address with this very serious disease:
Sanitation: A thorough review of sanitation practices within the shelter revealed several procedures that may be improved. Specifically, we are changing our disinfectant agents to Rescue and Wysiwash, which have proven track records in eliminating distemper and parvovirus (another deadly contagious disease that mainly affects puppies).
Medical care: Every pet that comes into the shelter is now vaccinated, dewormed, treated for fleas and ticks, and provided medical care if needed. Any pet that displays signs of illness is immediately isolated and treated by veterinary professionals either within the shelter or transported to a veterinary clinic.
Renovations: Crucial renovations have already begun at the animal shelter. We have just finished installing new ventilation systems, which will greatly improve air quality and reduce the transmission of pathogens. In 2 weeks’ time, we are set to begin a very important addition to the facility – adding epoxy to the concrete floors of the kennels. Because unsealed concrete is porous, it harbors germs that cannot easily be washed away. This renovation will allow us to finally be able to eradicate pathogens during daily cleaning.
Expert outside consultation: We are in the process of obtaining an outside in-depth consultation from world-expert, Dr. Ellen Jefferson. Dr. Jefferson and her team will provide a lengthy on-site evaluation and staff training in order to overcome any remaining deficiencies within the shelter. With their help, we will solve the current and prevent any future distemper outbreaks.
Even with all of the steps that we are taking within the Lubbock Animal Shelter, we need the help of citizens in order to overcome this dangerous disease. We need your help in vaccinating every pet in our community. If you have not yet done so, please visit your veterinarian as soon as you can and ask for the distemper vaccination for your dog. If you have newborn puppies, it is especially crucial that they are vaccinated prior to being rehomed. We recognize that not every citizen has funds to provide life-saving vaccinations for their pets. Please stay tuned to hear more about our upcoming community campaign, Furry Five Hundred, to provide free microchips and vaccinations to 500+ pets in need. This initiative will be the largest to date in the city of Lubbock and is set to occur on June 9th of this year. The Lubbock Animal Shelter also has support for the spay and neuter of pets in low-income homes; please visit or call the Lubbock Animal Shelter for more information.
We are all in this fight together and I hope that we will see an end to distemper in our community in the near future.
Please do your part in keeping your pets vaccinated and protected to help prevent the spread of contagious diseases among our furry family members.

Professional awning cleaning services keep your awnings looking great while preserving their longevity.
While cleaning your awnings may seem to be a simple task that most anyone can do, it is important to know that improper cleaning (often performed by window washers or day porters) can void the manufacturer’s warranty and even damage your awning fabric. In addition, manufacturer warranties require proof of proper maintenance to protect them against claims of fabric defects. ISCC can provide a cleaning history report to the manufacturer in the event your awning is damaged due to a fabric defect rather than neglect or lack of proper maintenance.
It’s no secret that maintaining your awnings is less costly than replacing them. There are so many diverse fabrics used in awning manufacturing for appearance and durability. Manufacturer-approved cleansers and protectants used in conjunction with ISCC’s specialized cleaning techniques are the only way to ensure proper maintenance and extending useful life of your awnings.
Awning purposes include providing store-front shelters, signage and most popularly, aesthetics. Building architects commonly incorporate awnings in their designs for attraction and exterior appearance purposes. Properly cleaned awnings along with regularly scheduled pressure washed store-fronts are more inviting. Often it is the first impression a customer forms of your business.

Businesses with food courts and patio dining often employ ISCC’s services weekly to maintain a clean and sanitary environment for their customers.
As mentioned, steam pressure washing is the most effective method of removing tough dirt, gum, oil and stains from concrete. It requires slow, even pressure and just the right size nozzle to yield the best results. Cold treatment, while less expensive to provide, often yields inconsistent surface cleaning. Too much pressure applied to one area can also permanently “pit” your concrete.

Flat feet can be a burden, but they don’t have to be a curse. Understand the challenges of having flat feet and use these tips to care for them.
Flat feet are misshaped and cause misalignment in your legs and hips. In all fairness, our flat feet are doing the best that they can under their circumstances. Helping your “flipper feet” to perform at their best, therefore your best, requires some special attention.
Within the realm of genes, our skeletal structure is the most difficult to affect, and within our skeletons, our feet take the most abuse. Some of us are blessed with strong feet that are built with a high arch and instep; a strong football aligned with the heel, and perfectly shaped toes.
On the other hand, most of us have some disadvantage to our feet. One of the worst afflictions is a completely flat foot, which if not managed correctly will afflict the body with knee, hip, back and neck pain. This circuit can eventually affect mobility, which then creates a laundry list of other damaging health conditions.
Flat feet are such a disadvantage that “flat foots” have historically been exempted from military service and are a huge detriment for jobs which require walking, running, long periods of standing, and the participation in sports (with the exception of swimming where flat feet are actually an advantage).
The long-term effects of flat feet are chronic pain, damage to the spine and systemic inflammation. As we age, these ailments become more commonplace and can eventually affect our quality of life in middle and senior years.
No one wants to end up being pushed around in a wheel chair because of some malady that he or she could have had a hand in preventing. So if you have flat feet, use this information to your advantage and start caring for your frying pan feet now.
First, the issue of misalignment may be mitigated by the type and brand of shoe you wear. Know your feet! Do your ankles roll in or do you walk on the outside of your foot? What about your toes – do they all lay flat when your foot is on the floor?
And your ankles – a shortened Achilles tendon is one of the most common side effects of flat feet. It would be best to begin your quest for flat foot and body re-alignment with a visit to a podiatrist. Your doctor will look at your feet, take measurements, and provide very useful suggestions for what to do and not do.
Personally, my podiatrist advised that I have “the flattest feet” she “has ever seen in her entire career.” Sort of a daunting comment but not insurmountable.
Second is the application of specific foot exercises. These reps are really good for almost all feet, but they are especially important to flat footer.
These are not walking or running exercises, but isolated exercises that target specifically your feet. You can do some of these in the morning when you wake up, while sitting at a desk, before sports, while taking a walk, and before going to sleep. These exercises are tippy toes, toe curls, heel dip, golf ball roll, toe lift, foam roller, and foot massage.
Know when to get help. When pain interferes with activities, it’s time to see the doctor for a thorough exam and treatment.
Ask your doctor or a physical therapist to show you stretches that can prepare you for feet-intensive activities.
Limit or treat risk factors that can make fallen arches or flat feet worse, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity.
You can set a towel on the floor and to start pinching it with your toes to strengthen and lengthen the ligaments as you open and close your curling toes.
Place the ball of your foot on an edge of a rise no higher than 2 inches and, while leaning into your foot, to gently apply pressure to stretch your Achilles tendon.
When you squat, make sure your weight is on your heel so you can are elevate your toes off the ground.
Below is a list of shoe brands that I recommend for flat feet. Not all shoes are built the same and not all brands fit the foot in the same way. Flat footers need to try on shoes before buying and wearing them. Online shopping for shoes is not the best way to go.
Sports that are good for flat footers: Swimming, Bicycling, Weight training, Crew. Almost any sport with low foot impact. Walking is good as long as you have the correct foot support.
Finally, high impact sports for those of us with flat feet are not an impossibility. One needs only to apply some logic and common sense.
If a high impact sport is not right for you, find some other exercises. Be creative. Your feet are the key to your overall good health.

"Rising producer Midsplit is beginning to find his own with this one. Entitled “Dawn”, his latest track is a flurry of pop, electronic vibes that is bound to take your breath away.
The track is a continuous flow of chill vibes, filled with the lush vocals of Casey Cook and encapsulating chords. “Dawn” is put together very well, running seamlessly from start to finish and never breaking stride. It is a chill dance tune that stands on its own and its no wonder it caught the eye of Steve Void owned label “Strange Fruits.”

Avida is an artificial life software package allowing for research into evolutionary processes using digital organisms. Avida was first coded in the 1990s, and has developed through numerous versions since then. The software is freely available for multiple platforms, including Unix, Mac OS X, and Windows.
This page is meant as a repository of my personal notes on Avida resources. As such, this is not now and likely never will be a finished document; it will be revised as I am able to incorporate materials and add my own commentary to it.
This may be redundant, but I will list some Avida publications where the full text is freely available and append some summaries as I have time. Primarily taking bibliographic entries from Prof. Ofria’s page.
Experiments with Avida show how complex features can be acquired via evolutionary processes gradually building that complexity. The experiments demonstrate that some critical changes can, in fact, be deleterious on first appearance.

Every week, we announce a new recipient for our BLOG SOULMATE AWARD! This is our way of helping spread the word about awesome bloggers we love!
I've been blogging in general for years. I started out with a livejournal, I imagine, and eventually moved onto Wordpress where I blogged about my teenage life and how unfair it was! Eventually I moved that stuff to a written diary, thank god, but I started blogging about a game I play, World of Warcraft, about 2 and a half years ago now. There's a huge community surrounding the game and it was so much fun that once I decided to quit (which didn't last), I didn't want to stop blogging so I looked into the other hobby I'm particularly passionate about. Reading. And slowly my personal blog which I kept on the side evolved into the book blog I still write today.
I love the community! I doubt I would have continued without it. There are so so many amazing and fun people involved in book blogging. You can make friends from all over the place, near to home or on the other side of the world. There are events, read-alongs, read-a-thons, giveaway hops, memes, twitter chats... all sorts of things that you can join in with and it's so fun. I love the people I've met while doing this.
My least favourite thing has to be the attitudes. Some people get greedy, some people get bitchy, and some people get a little up themselves (not everybody, I feel I should add. I stick by 'I love you guys'). Sure, that's something you'll come across in all walks of life but I just feel as though all of the drama-inducing negative attitudes completely goes against the idea that this is a book blogging community. You know?
Oh my god! I'm terrified of meeting authors I love and respect in case they're awful. Haha. Though I know that's pretty unfounded. I don't know though. Hmm.. there's a pretty big difference between meeting an author and hanging with them. Maybe Belle Whittington? She's a lot of fun to talk to!
It varies depending on the person's reading tastes, but I'll go with Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle #1) by Patrick Rothfuss. I adore this book and I think I've recommended it to every fantasy lover I've come across! The story is fantastic and rich, and the writing style is simply...wow. There are two layers to it. The modern day, and the story being told, and it's written in such a lyrical style I found myself swooning over the words.
I always consider chick lit to be my guilty pleasure but at the same time I don't feel at all guilty reading them, haha. I love how light and fluffy and fun chick lits are. There's little to no darkness in them, and sometimes I just find it nice to have a little break. I really do enjoy a good chick lit with a decent sense of humour!
I'm a gamer. I've already mentioned that I play World of Warcraft in which I used to raid, amongst other MMORPGs, single player RPGs, and simulation type games (i.e. Sims 3).
I'm pretty much addicted to Pepsi Max. I like the caffiene and yumminess and I can't enjoy full fat cokes, diet drinks, or even stuff like coke zero, so Pepsi Max it is and I pretty much always have a glass next to me.
I don't drink alcohol. And you should see the looks I get when I say that! It's scary how large a part of our culture drinking is...but anyway. I just don't enjoy it, so I don't spend the money.
I'm currently living in South Wales with my other half, also known as Dan, in our first flat. We're engaged, have been together for four years, and actually met in World of Warcraft!
I really really love pugs and one day, when we're out of this flat, I want to have a little pug called Muffin!
So Hannah is pretty much a DELIGHT! Hit her up on Twitter and check out her blog to see what we mean :)
Hooray for gamers! I play Xbox, most recently Skyrim (+165 hours and counting over the past 6 months). I didn't drink all through college until I turned 21 -- yes it's illegal in the states but since 80% of my college classmates spent their freetime trying to get their hands on alcohol, it freed me up for some of my best memories. I'm grateful for my college memories sans any horrifying blackout stories!
@Stephsco I still need to start on Skyrim! I'm terrible at getting around to single player games, especially of the console variety.
@Ashley Gotta remember the two taste different over here. We don't use corn syrup and Pepsi Max is a lot nicer than Pepsi! Nom.

Compatibility: When looking at the biorhythmic relationship between two people, the key thing to understand is that we are looking at phase compatibility. In other words, 100% physical compatibility between two people does not mean that the relationship will be in a physical high all of the time - it means that all of the highs and lows between those two people will match. With this in mind, it may be clearer that when you look at a biorhythmic compatibility chart, you are looking at the highs and lows of the relationship as a whole.

Let’s agree to the fact that we have all seen our mothers and fathers worrying over the increasing number of grey strands on their head. Although, NOW, I see grey mane becoming a trend but the majority of our older population still likes to keep those grey strands under cover with a coat of colour.
Today’s youth too is facing early greying for various reasons, stress being one of them. I have seen my friends fretting over that single grey strand that has cropped up in their otherwise charcoal black mane (I too freaked out when I saw the one and only grey strand in my hair). And at 24 they definitely do not want to flaunt a grey mane. That is when hair colour comes to their rescue.
Traditionally a lot of people used henna or mehendi (natural dye prepared from plants), for its nourishing qualities and the colour. But no one with a white/grey mane wants to adorn an orange coloured head anymore. However, they are also extremely hesitant about the hair colours available in the market.
Besides the ones facing the grey hair blues, women today, otherwise also want to add a streak of colour to their hair to make a statement. And I say why not? If something makes you feel good about yourself, just do it! While some go ahead with it, the others remain apprehensive about the after effects and the maintenance.
But ladies and gentlemen, you have now got the perfect opportunity to get all your queries about hair colour answered.
Wella, in association with Ripple Links gives you a chance to interact with Maria Castan, a Senior Scientist at Procter & Gamble from Darmstadt, Germany and to find out the Truth Behind Hair Colour.
So, if you have been torturing yourself keeping those hair colour worries tucked in a corner of your mind, now is the time to get some guidance from the expert herself.
If you have any questions regarding hair colour be it the appropriate colour for your skin tone or its application or the tips to maintain coloured hair, feel free to post it on the blog. They will be answered soon.
P.S.: the answers might give you the courage to go the salon and get that perfect coloured mane that had only been a pipedream until now.
Is there a difference in the hair quality/texture of men and women and how does that govern their hair colour choices?
is it safe to use hair colour after every 15 days and what should we do to keep them soft as after haircolouring, the hair become dry and start falling.

The Best Uses For Color Led LightsColored LED lights have many uses from professional to recreational. Green, red, blue, and ultraviolet lights have all found their way into the realm of LED flashlights. The uses are varied and each color has particular uses that they are best suited for. All of the colored lights are great for night vision applications because they do not bleach out the chemicals that allow for the human eye to see at night. The red LED bulb has been added to flashlights to enhance night vision. It provides great contrast and is not visible to the human eye over long distances. It also works well with night vision scopes and goggles. Photographers use the red colored light when doing night-time photography because it provides contrast while preserving the natural shadows developed by darkness. It cuts through smoke better than white light and, with the exception of red lines and marks on maps and charts, it makes reading in low, or no, light possible. Police and military units like the red LED for night operations because it will not interfere with night vision technology and cant easily be picked up by other people. The green LED light is preferred by hunters and fishermen because it is a very soft light that will not spook their prey. Green also does not attract insects like white or yellow light does. It is not easily picked up, unless looking directly at it, so it is useful in covert operations. It is another color that is useful in smoke filled environments. The blue LED hand-held light is good for map or chart reading in situations where night vision, and avoiding detection, are important. Blue light is also helpful in locating blood and other bodily fluids at crime scenes or during search and rescue operations. Hunters also find the blue light helpful in following blood trails of injured animals. Blue lights are often used in small keychain lights because they are a soft light that works well to illuminate locks, keys, and small items. It does not have the same harsh glare as the bright, white LED. These lights are also good for cutting through fog. Ultraviolet LED lights have found many uses in the professional world. They are used to detect counterfeit money, art, and antiques. They are also used to detect trace blood proteins and chemicals in soils from crime scenes. Just like blue light, this one will pick out blood and other bodily fluids that might be missed by the naked eye. Ultraviolet light acts like a black light in entertainment uses. It can bring out hidden messages and enhances neon and fluorescent colors. Ultraviolet lights can be used to recharge luminescent objects like fishing lures, watch faces, compass needles, SAR signals, etc. It is important not to shine ultraviolet LED lights directly into the eyes, as it can cause injury. Whether looking to preserve night vision for hunting applications or to cut through smoke in a burning building colored LED lights are great for many applications. Their multitude of uses make them a must have for everyone. Flashlights are offered in single color lighting or with multiple bulbs for a choice of lighting options. This means that the right light is always available when it is needed. So, whether looking for a single light color for a specific application or multiple choices for whatever comes up, colored LED flashlights are a great choice. ~ Ben Anton, 2008 ...

On December 12 I entered the last year of my 20's and now, here we are on the doorstep of 2015. It's been a big year for me, full of new friends, new clients and mammoth growth for my business. I'm feeling like my direction is becoming much more clear and precise as I'm figuring out exactly which part of this world I'd like to carve out for myself.
It was a whirlwind year. I've never been one for "five year plans" and my life philosophy up to this point has simply been "say yes to everything". This can make life hectic, but always exciting and full of endless possibilities. The universe has plunked me down right where I ought to be.
1, 2, 3 / I traveled. A lot. A solo trip to Indonesia was by far the highlight (Turns out I love traveling alone, who woulda thought?), a romantic getaway to Palm Springs, my first Toronto Fashion Week with fashion bestie Caroline, and a weekend gallivanting and giggling in Jasper with Anya. More global adventures await me in 2015.
4 / I joined StartUp Edmonton, the co-working space that saved me from going completely bonkers working from my couch. I found an incredible community at StartUp and an environment which has provided undeniable momentum behind my brand.
5 / I worked with a lot of great non-profits this year including Calgary-based PARK to help bring its first major fashion event to Edmonton in support of Alberta designers.
6 / I welcomed Deema, the first ever Dress Me Dearly Intern to the team, a program I'm excited to continue in 2015. Stay tuned to meet the new fleet...
7 / I joined forces with Golden West Music Fest, an indie, outdoor music festival that had me frolicking under the sun and stars in absolute glee this past summer. I'll be working hard with them to bring you the best fest yet in 2015. Get ready to melt your face off.
8 / Poppy Barley held an intimate gathering of Edmonton's most kick ass female entrepreneurs called The Founders Assembly in partnership with Bloom. This was monumental for me. To be included in a group of entrepreneurial women I hold in very high regard was a significant indicator I'm on the right path. Mega thanks to Poppy Barley for letting me be the poster girl for this event. Beyond honoured.
9 / I hired my best friend. Andrea and I have been partners in crime since we were five years old. She is the smartest woman I know and hugely influential in the success of Dress Me Dearly. She's going to keep me in check in 2015 as my Project Coordinator and Creative Assistant.
10 / I attended/coordinated/hosted a lot of parties and gained some really awesome new clients. Mega thanks to FLARE Magazine, French Connection, Doc Martens, Oak + Fort, DKNY, Latitude 53, Edmonton City Centre, Kingsway Mall, Kate Hewko, American Apparel, Simons, Flatter Me Belts, Vitamin Daily Edmonton, the list goes on.
11 / I was in the media – a lot. In November alone I hosted six media segments on behalf of clients and organizations I volunteer with. For the second year in a row I was voted Edmonton's Best Fashion Blog in Vue Weekly (whoop whoop, thanks!). I showed up in some cool fashion stories in local publications. I had my first piece published in the Edmonton Journal about Edmonton designer Malorie Urbanovitch. Great thanks to Global, CBC, CTV and Breakfast Television for letting me gab fashion on your air waves.
12 / I announced a rad partnership with Simons as its first ever Simons Fashion Ambassador. This has been an incredible collaboration, and I'm excited about the momentum we've created with the SIMONSxDMD campaign. Stay tuned for more fashion fun in the new year.
Found your blog via Caroline and it's wonderful! I will definitely be following. Keep up the amazing work!

I was reading the letter submitted Jeanine in her letter called My Story: A Woman's Realization: I Abused The Man I Love. I am in a similar position and wanted to respond to her. Please forward to her. Thank you. D
I couldn't figure out which email address belonged to the author of the email you responded to. So, I did the next best thing: I posted it; hopefully she is checking in and she'll respond to the board, if she wants to. Best wishes, Dr. Irene
I read your letter posted by Dr.Irene and was completely struck by the similarities of your and my position. I was in a relationship that ended several months ago. Reading your letter was like a laundry list of what my ex girlfriend did to me over the course of a year. And similarly I played a co-dependent role in it. She consistently tested my trust. In the end she said she didn't trust me at all.
In the end, I had stopped watching any TV shows that had woman in them. Which of course meant I watched the Discovery Channel and the Learning Channel. In the end, I made sure not to look around when we were outside. If a woman was in my line of sight, it started a whole argument that I was "looking around." I allowed myself to become more and more compliant even though she still had all the same fears. I'm glad you now see this is not OK!
If she asked me to stop doing something, I did. The problem I had was that, yes I did have codependent tendencies, but I also was in love with her. As I think she was with me. But, you always need to love YOU more...
You see she had a lot of good reasons to be the way she was: child sexual abuse and rape. At the time, I did not take care enough of these things. I even feel now that I could have made it safer somehow for her.
As I work on my stuff in therapy, I see the places I dropped the ball. Yes, I was angry at her for a while. But it passed. I also see the places where I could and can set boundaries, not arbitrary ones, but ones that 2 people can discuss. I think there is a difference between " I would like it if you didn't watch that show, because I feel insecure" and " Don't watch any shows with women in them." Yes. IF the person making the request can accept "no" for an answer.
When I read what you were writing, I wanted to tell you that he probably still loves you very much. If you did reach out to him, he might respond.
But, you know, you too have needs. I think that if my girlfriend said that she didn't want me to slowly browse through a Victoria's Secrets catalog, I would see that differently than walking with my eyes to the ground.
I know I didn't do a good job of meeting my ex girlfriend's needs, and it fueled the fire of her insecurities. Talking is the key. Communication. We fought a lot, but really talking - not a lot. If I knew what she wanted, I would have given it within limits.
It was so easy to just say, "my girlfriend is an insecure freak." And many times I did. If I had spent more time looking at and understanding her - and looking at my own stuff - we would probably be together too. But maybe not, maybe my greatest fear was that I would set a limit and she would say, "See ya." Which is exactly what happened. The acid test: she's not worth your time. After all the many times she verbally assaulted me when she thought I was looking around, I said, "You can't talk to me like that." She said, "I talk to a lot of people like that." I said, "That's too bad for them." and she stormed off. I know it hurts, but, you're better off.
My grandma used to say, "it takes 2 to polka." Don't be too hard on yourself. It sounds like you are well on the right path. Sorry I couldn't forward your reply; hope this forum is OK. Dr. Irene

Usually, when you lose a tooth, it is best for your oral health to have it replaced. Missing teeth can affect your bite as well as your ability to speak and chew. Their loss can increase the burden on your remaining teeth and can cause muscle pain in your jaws and headaches. And of course, losing a tooth can affect your appearance. The following information reviews replacing missing teeth with an implant retained denture.
Although many patients have no problem wearing an upper denture, some people find it difficult to wear and eat with lower dentures. Several implant-supported replacement options are available if you are missing all of your lower teeth.
One option is to have two implants placed in your lower jaw and a denture made that snaps onto these implants. This option allows your lower denture to be more stable while chewing than without implants. However, there will still be movement of your lower denture, and sore spots will occur if any food particles, especially seeds, are caught under it. As with all removable replacement teeth, you still will need periodic appointments for denture adjustment.
Another option involves placing four to six implants, depending on your jaw size or shape, into your lower jaw. After healing is complete, the implants are connected with a custom-made support bar. Your denture will be made with special internal retention clips that attach onto the support bar, enabling the denture to snap firmly into place. This is called an “overdenture.” The advantage of this option is that it is much more stable than the first option and allows very little denture movement. Your denture is still removable for easy cleaning and maintenance.
A third option involves placing five or more implants in your jaw and attaching a permanent denture. Your denture is held in place by screws or clasps that secure it to the support posts or bar. It doesn’t touch the gum tissue, which allows you to clean under the denture without removing it. This denture will replace all your missing lower teeth and will not be removed except at maintenance visits. Although cleaning under your denture without removing it is more time consuming and requires more dexterity, many patients who want a permanent denture prefer this option.
A similar range of treatment options is also available for your upper jaw. However, because the bone is not as hard as that in the lower jaw, people often need more implants to support their new replacement teeth. Depending upon the number of implants to be placed, it may be possible to eliminate the need for covering the roof of your mouth with a complete denture. This option allows you to fully taste your food and gives you a better sense of its temperature. Your denture will feel more natural. You will still have a removable denture, which makes cleaning the support bar and denture much easier.

All it took was a few minutes of soaking her feet at a cousin's spa party for Nakia to fall in love with Soul Purpose all-natural scrubs. She started selling on nights and weekends to supplement what she earned as a full-time commercial property manager and subsidize her children's school trips, extracurriculars and proms. As she grew her team (which includes her mom and husband Robert, 39), she realized this was a great opportunity for teens too. "They always need money but have limited time to work," she says. Her son, James, 18, had already made some sales to friends and teachers. But Nakia envisioned a formal entrepreneurship program, with training and mentoring from seasoned sellers, teaching teens how to grow businesses that fit around schoolwork and activities.
This company is still able to shine through, even though they are in tough competition with other well-known competitors such as Mary Kay and Avon. This company does promote their focus on having cruelty-free products for consumers and au natural ingredients, and from their stand point it looks like they could sling shot into the league of their rivals at any time. You can anticipate to watch them enter the billion-dollar yearly revenue stream pretty soon!
If the official site of the MLM program you want to join does not have any of these features, you will probably have a hard time with making sales, especially if you have limited experience with selling products. A program that provides you with resources designed to help you become a better seller wants you to succeed and will help you generate more revenues.
I'm personally not that motivated by health and fitness (I'm proud if I make a smoothie for myself in the morning and consider hauling my toddler up and down the stairs exercise enough...) so I don't think this would be the right company for me. But for someone who values those things and has the tenacity to truly sell and stand by this line of products, this looks like a great route. You may not need to throw parties to succeed (it's even suggested the you lose money at parties since you'd have to let guests try out the expensive products you've purchased yourself) but you'll stay plenty busy networking, advertising, and fulfilling orders. This is also a product you definitely need to go out of your own social-circle to sell. I live in a snowy, middle-sized town where my friends are much more likely to drop a hundred bucks on a pair of Patagonia gloves than a toning-wrap.
This company was living life in the lime light, and they were trending for a good while there. They deflated out a bit, however they are still pretty big. There are over 50 countries currently promoting their immunity-boosting nutritional products, and the rave reviews from the former and current associates makes things seem pretty superb. Although it’s mentioned that the commissions aren’t great, but maybe that’s okay as long as their reps have continued happiness?
Good companies find ways to intelligently leverage technology. Thanks to Amazon and Wal-Mart, we’re all spoiled. We want what we want, we want it NOW and we want it delivered for free. Smart network marketing companies are eliminating as many barriers as possible to make it easier for consumers to place and receive orders. They’re finding ways to make it easier for consumers to connect via mobile apps, tell stories via social media tools, provide best-in-class web experiences and leverage as much data as possible to stay ahead of consumer demand. The corporate team also needs to leverage technology to enhance workflows.
The company. Too many people get lured by the hype, without stopping to consider the company or its product/service. What does the company sell and can you get excited about it? What are the compensation plan, marketing system, and policies, and can you work with it? Is it a member of the DSA, and through your research, been found to be a legitimate company?
Well done Melaleuca, they hit over a billion dollars in yearly sales…there’s a reason they are a part of the select few considered to be at the top. Adding to this is their longevity, because they’ve been in the MLM industry for over 20 years, and now they’ve reached the status of the “largest online wellness shopping club” (which can sound fancier than it is, because are they aren’t selling anything more than a fantasy diet pill).

As far as the retirement saving crisis is concerned, more and more people are coming to terms with the fact that they probably aren’t going to be able to save enough money to just sit around and slowly deplete their nest egg from age 62 to 100. With the average 50 year-old estimated to have less than $50,000 in retirement savings, there is an obvious need to find alternative ways to either save more or generate supplemental income starting now, and continuing throughout retirement. Moving beyond just the dollars and cents, boomers are growing tired of feeling guilty or bad about their past savings habits and are interested in moving towards possible solutions.
I recently joined USI Tech a company that has been in business already for some time and it may seem like an odd choice for me to jump into something that is not in pre-launch but the fact is : this is not like most other online businesses. Let me be clear, this is not a revshare. I moved away from revshares due to their shorter and shaky lifespan in the past couple of years. What we are looking at here is a long term, a real, stable and proven company that excels in IT technology, building trading software to be more precise. For some time now the team behind USI Tech have been trading on the Foreing Exchange Market but their services were only open to the high players, the serious investors (with a minimum entry threshold of 100 000 euros). This was an exclusive, invitation-only service that has provided great track record over time, building their brand and securing their place on the market. Later they were approached by Mike Kiefer and his friend Horst Jicha to form what later became USI Tech and this is how it all started. Their business has now grown a lot and reached the mainstream where the competition is stiff and companies are looking at new ways of expanding their member-base. Which brings USI Tech to my attention now, as they recently rolled out a new division to their brand, structured around Bitcoin trading and mining, with packages starting at 50 euros and with an impressive multi level marketing affiliate plan. The company is planning another very exciting new product very soon, so this is what we can expect in near future. The vision is for a long-term passive income and they have a history already with many a happy customer and an impeccable image in the industry. CEO Joao Fernandez Severino is from Portugal and is the brains behind the Expert Advise Software product. Him and his partner, co-owner Ralf Gold, have been trading and developing the software for the past 8 years predominantly for private VIP clients until they were approached by network marketing guru Mike Kiefer and his business partner Horst Jicha, who became the founding members of USI Tech and structured the company around their vision for a bigger scale business venture that we are seeing today. The compensation plan is another great feature of the business, it is unilevel with 10% commissions on direct referrals and 3% on indirect (these can go 12 levels deep provided you obtain a license and qualify for all) and luckily we have a guaranteed spillover which is something very rare in this industry. I have been in many mlms and matrix systems where you have to hit targets and volume is the key to your bonus payouts, but in this case we dont have to worry about these, such complicated twists and limitations are absent from the USI Tech is affiliate program and that makes it ever more appealing.comprehensive webinar with the CEO of the company and I would like you to take the time and watch the whole video so that you can understand the reasons why I am so excited to add this great opportunity to my portfolio Here is a presentation and interview with one of the owners:
My advice to someone looking into DS is to find something that you actually love and know that you could share with other people, not sell it to them, but share with them why you love it. I do fairs and events and I share with people how amazing these little hair clips are. I get excited about them and it shows. 90% of the women who try them on, end up buying them because they love them. So find something you LOVE and not something just to sell.
Umm...ever heard of Amway? No direct sales / mlm list is complete without it. Founded in 1959, they are (and by a significant margin I might add) the largest global direct sales company in the world...#1. With over 450 exclusive products, 750+ patents and counting, best selling vitamin and nutrition line, top 5 skincare and makeup line, plus the legacy home products...come on now.
I think when you made comments about a company you should have kept them neutral or not only commented part of a story. Ambit did have a lawsuit, but it also has several JD Power awards, A+BBB, and many other accolades. I don’t know details of the suit, it may have been 100% justified, but I do know lawsuits are not always justified. Sometimes people are looking to make a buck
The aforementioned are some of the best MLM companies in the world currently. You need to perform some research before joining the most suitable MLM company which would depend on the products you choose to promote. Hard work and some dedication to the cause would eventually bring great results and good profits for you and your company. Check out these companies right now.
Oh, Arbonne. In the past I have had several friends and acquaintances become Arbonne consultants. Some were successful, some were not. It really came down to the time and energy they were willing (and most importantly, able) to invest in this company. Those with young kids failed. It's time consuming and requires a lot follow up with potential customers.
Thank you for this article! I’m with Doterra, like a lot of other people I didn’t start out selling. I just wanted to use the product. But, when you see such great results you can’t help but tell people. I love working for this company!! I have worked for Tupperware, Amway, Jafra, It Works, I never made money like I am with doTerra. Hands down its the best!! I’m working hard to build my business and it is paying off and I’m reaping the benefits for my health. God’s Design for our Natural health care is top notch! I give God all the glory and I couldn’t do this without him.
I don’t know much about World Ventures, Greg. I do have some very respected friends in the business who build that business and I do trust them. In ANY network marketing business, it more often comes down to what the independent business owner is putting IN to their business. Are they following the plan religiously? There is no company out there that can legitimately promise a get-rich-quick plan. You have to assume MLM is a 4+ year build – and only then when you’re going full-out. Most people don’t have the stamina for that – but if they do or can learn it, people can make a lot of money in many different companies.
Im glad that I have found your blog. I came here through google search, and I have been reading all the reviews and comments on DSD, and honestly speaking I have been convinced by your explaination. I have submited my email address recently and I think I am only one step behind to join your team, and I am thinking to do this together with my wife. Just one question though: Is it possible to use my wife Credit Card for the payment, but I will use my name for joining your Team site and Facebook group, as well as the refferal program if later I decide to join thereferal program as well. Thank you in advance and looking forward to your reply.
They have a slew of stay-at-home associates mixed in with some ready to excel entrepreneurs on their team. Meaning? They have the products that everyone needs and wants, as well as those entrepreneurs to sell it! Anyone who is a follower of the MLM world knows you have to have a practical product, so people buying it know what they are going to use it for and how to use it. doTERRA has found the fine balance needed to succeed.
If the official site of the MLM program you want to join does not have any of these features, you will probably have a hard time with making sales, especially if you have limited experience with selling products. A program that provides you with resources designed to help you become a better seller wants you to succeed and will help you generate more revenues.
It's a typical workday in the Fiscella home: Ginny, leader of Silpada jewelry company's top sales force, makes phone calls in her home office, while husband Doug handles her administrative tasks from his laptop in the kitchen. The arrangement gives him time with daughters Caroline and Molly and frees Ginny to focus on what she does best—selling, recruiting, and motivating her team.
Hi Jesse, That does help some…thanks for answering my questions. My other questions are: I am not connected with nearly as many people as it sounds like you are. How can I be successful in this business? Also, morally I struggle with charging someone more money for something that they can get somewhere else? I know…not much of a business acumen. Lol thanks,

According to Forever Living, aloe enhances the body, inside and out, and its products ranging from age-defying facial treatments to delicious, antioxidant rich drinks.
Just hitting their 5-year anniversary in the MLM health and wellness niche, they have already gained so much popularity. The company has won the Bravo Growth Award from the Direct Selling News Global. Yes, they won this award about two years ago, and yes that is when they were just starting out. They had so much potential, but eventually they came to booming halt, shattering into a bunch of tiny pieces (meaning a lot of MLM affiliates without jobs).
Lu La whaaa? If you love bright, flashy and fun leggings then take a look at Buskins Leggings which sells patterned leggings for a fraction of the price of other MLM clothing companies and offers customers the opportunity to find and buy their favorite prints from the your own personalized Buskins website. That means you don't have to spend days sorting through inventory and creating outfits out of mismatched patterns and sizes and hope that they catch one of your FB friends' eyes and budget before shipping off bundles of product. You're busy. You don't have time for that. (Time is money, remember?)
I would love to share with everyone how AMAZING Scentsy is! The main product offered are warmers and wax which is a much safer alternative to scented flame candles. BUT Scentsy is so much more than that with something for everyone including the kids. Skin care, Laundry care and much more. Honestly you don’t need sales experience because everything basically sells itself. I haven’t met anyone who after smelling and sampling Scentsy didnt love it and come back for more! As a DS company, Scentsy offers so many lucrative incentives like trips around the world and amazing commissions. Please allow me to share my love of Scentsy with you! Contact me today to change your life for the better! http://www.sharethelove.Scentsy.us or tiffanyciara@yahoo.com Thanks and have a blessed day!

This might not look great on a resume. If you think working for an MLM company is a way to build your resume or patch a hole in your work experience, think twice about that idea, experts say. Does direct selling look good on a resume? "Probably not," Mariano says. "And the reason I say that is the reputation of direct selling in the marketplace is not typically that great."
Awesome benefits to Distributrs like monthly gifts, travel and vacation incentives. I am bold to say that Swissgarde is the best MLM business in Nigeria. A lot of pyramid schemes come into this country and promise get rich quick compensation plans. No wonder they fizzle out in a short period of time after swindling people of their hard-earned money. Swissgarde has been here for over 16 years, with effective herbal products for health and beauty. The monthly pay out is so transparent that you can easily calculate your take home even before it arrives. Distributors get lots of incentives even while making money for themselves. It's an awesome opportunity for anyone who loves network marketing. You can contact me for more information.

Cucumis sativus is the scientific name for a cucumber plant, the popular plant in the gourd family. Generally, cucumber as a beauty ingredient serves one of two functions. As a skin conditioning agent and emollient, cucumber and its extract versions lubricate the skin, giving it a soft and smooth appearance. Thanks to its function as an emollient, cucumber and its extracts can be found in products such as facial cleansers, masks, and moisturizers. It also can repair dry and damaged skin, helping to reduce unsightly flaking. Moreover, it can restore skin’s suppleness, giving it the moisture it needs to look its best. Skin that has been out in the sun for too long can be soothed by cucumbers, which have a cooling effect that can help treat sunburn.

I can not estimate the number of times during my life that my family has enjoyed some time looking over old photographs. Those captures of long forgotten moments accompanied by ” I remember this” always said so delightfully.
It’s my job as a professional photographer to give you the joyful confidence of knowing that “I will remember this”. I look for emotion, connections, and atmosphere in my photographs; I want you to be able to remember who was with you, what was felt and where it all happened.
I would love to be a part of your special moments. So if the prices below work with your budget, or if you are looking for a different level of service/coverage, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
But now the new official Zentangle pattern Quib has truly gripped me and I couldn't ignore the Diva's Weekly Challenge #145! I really enjoyed when drawing this combination of Quib with Beadlines and Diva Dance.
Wow wow, that is one exuberant tile! So much energy and movement. I love the shadows that make the eadlines look suspended. Great work, and glad you are back too

Well, it’s 5.18pm on a balmy winter’s night in Perth. While Canberra drops to -5 in temps, Perth remains in double figures till evening closes in. It’s been so relaxing and I don’t think I’ve ever visited a city where everyone seems so chilled and laid back. Well, Portland, Oregon was the closest and admittedly I’ve spotted a fair share of hipsters, bicycles, beards, barista’s and ‘forage’ dining places that Perth is not far behind becoming the next ‘cool capital’ to visit (after Canberra of course!).
Mmm…what we have discovered that drinking or eating here is really expensive. It is a town of boom or bust and its economy clearly props the wealthy. I’ve been lucky and managed to find a few cute and affordable places for lunch but dinner proves to be very expensive. So what do I recommend? Moore & Moore located in Fremantle is housed in a historic building and a fave for Notre Dame uni students. Food is fresh and the homemade lemonade refreshing. Source Foods located on crn of Brisbane and Beaufort Street serves the best coffee and none of this little glass business! It’s a proper size Alice cup that seems never ending. Adam’s fave is The Royal and when he first came here, as part of his contract, he ate there 11 nights running!! I limited it to two nights as I like variety…
So, what have I done while Adam was working…I’ve been pounding the pavement as I always do when I visit a new city. Perth is pretty much flat with a few hills. They have free transport in the city and luckily our apartment is on the fringe so I can get on and off whenever. So, sandstone. The city is built on sand. You can see it creeping through pavers, the garden beds and at building sites. Most of the older/heritage architecture are built from sandstone and in immaculate condition.
Even the art deco style buildings look like they have just been painted. I can’t get over how clean the city is and all the public gardens are manicured within a inch of perfection.
Sun. Sunrise and Sunsets – this city sure knows how to put on a show. We’ve seen some stunning weather and who needs TV when you can look out the window and soak up the colours of orange/pinks/golds. While we’ve had a few showers, they come and go and the sun keeps the winter feel at bay.
Shopping – oh! my! I’ve managed to do a little shopping – 3 tops (Morgan & Morgan, Method), a pair of earrings, a set of hair clips , three gifts (Beau Est Mien in Northbridge, Ware, Mt Lawley) and resisting the urge to keep on spending. It’s only been four days and I’ve been very conservative. Well, maybe not. I totally indulged yesterday and had a few treatments at Djurra Day Spa. I’ve never treated myself to something like this.
I felt the need as I’ve been working flat out since Boxing Day and have had two weekends off. It was crazy but all for good causes – an up and coming exhibition I’ll be in (3 July 15 opening at Nishi Gallery, Canberra) and my newest venture – an online shop showcasing my porcelain earrings. I’m very excited as this will be launched 14 July on Bastille Day. Why Bastille Day? Because my earrings are chic and I’d like think my range is as fashionable as the women are in France.
It’s now Wednesday 10 June and I have a slight hangover. We caught up with friends the night before and enjoyed a drop or two..or three…I worked with Naomi in the AFP and we realised its been nearly five years since we’ve seen each other. In the meantime she studied law, got married and moved to perth. So lots to catch up on. I took it easy yesterday as the walking is taking its toll on my little toe. I spent the day working on my marketing plan, content for the website and liasing back and forth on emails.
It was hard work as I sat in the gardens of City Farm Cafe eating Chickpea, roasted carrot and zucchini dill salad and later a guilt free (my phrase for gluten free) coconut, pistachio lime cake! Our final night (well my last night as Adam goes back to Perth in a week’s time to continue his work) was an all out meal at Lallah Rookah – a semi-fine dining restaurant/bar in the business district where the meals were just divine.
So, if you are thinking of visiting Perth, I highly recommend it and if you get the chance go to Vasse Felix in the Margaret River as they have the best cabernet’s. Cheers, Anne
Have you got my best side? Says the kookaburra ;) This little one posed for 10 minutes while we took lots of photos!
I thought a change from words would be good and I’d take you on a virtual 2hr walk through the town of Skælskør. Imagine it snowing lightly, crunching beneath your feet, seeing Christmas wreaths on graves at a cemetery (with the best views of the water), avoiding dog poop on the pavement and bitterly cold finger tips from taking way too many photos! Enjoy! Hint: if you click on the photo, it will take you to another page, then click on that photo to get the full size 6 x 4 photo. I’m still figuring out a better way to display photos but limited by software…
WASHINGTON -- David Duke announced today he will run for the Republican presidential nomination next year in most states, including Maryland.
The former Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leader criticized President Bush and predicted immigration would be the "big issue" in the campaign.
"We've got to begin to protect our borders," Duke said. "We've got to begin to protect our Christian values."
Duke, a Louisiana state legislator, also emphasized the themes -- criticism of welfare and affirmative action hiring programs -- he used when he ran unsuccessfully for governor this year and for U.S. Senate last year.
The U.S. should tell Japan, he said in a mocking imitation of a Japanese speaking English, "You no buy our rice, we no buy your cars."
While Duke spoke inside the National Press Building, protesters demonstrated outside. One got close enough to the press conference to be heard shouting "Nazi! Nazi!"
Maryland Republican Party leaders said they wouldn't welcome Duke in the party primary, which will be held March 3.
"I wish he would stay in Louisiana," said W. Blan Harcum, an Eastern Shore Republican leader. "There's no way for him to win and he's just going to distract from the real issues. It'd just be a nuisance."
Maryland Secretary of State Winfield M. Kelly Jr. already has decided to place Duke's name on the Republican ballot alongside that of Bush and columnist Patrick Buchanan, who has indicated interest in running for president.
State law gives the secretary of state authority to place on the ballot the names of candidates "generally advocated or recognized in the news media throughout the United States or in Maryland," according to V. Onzell Ward, assistant secretary of state.
MIAMI -- Two financial powerhouses from Japan took possession of Calder and Gulfstream racetracks Friday in a deal that freed Virginia horse breeder Bertram Firestone of $168 million in debt he couldn't repay.
Operations of the tracks, two of the biggest in the country, will not change immediately, said representatives for the new owners and state officials. Gulfstream will reopen on Jan. 8, as scheduled.
The deals were completed in New York at 5 p.m. Friday. In public statements shortly thereafter, nothing was mentioned of Firestone's well-publicized financial problems.
In a prepared statement from their farm in Upperville, Va., Bert and Diana Firestone said they gave up the tracks to devote themselves to breeding and racing horses.
"While I have enjoyed the racetracks, one cannot fall in love with any business," the statement said. "The offers we received made it more attractive for us to sell than to remain in these businesses."
The sale to two leading Japanese lenders brought a subdued reaction from racetrack executives in South Florida, including Hialeah Park owner John Brunetti, who had tangled with Firestone over racing dates ever since Firestone came on the scene nearly four years ago.
"It's unfortunate for the industry, and regardless of our differences I'd hate to see any extreme hardship exerted on the Firestones," Brunetti said. "This is not a high-five, thumbs-up, slam-dunk time. We've got a long way to go. We've got to go ahead and expand the industry."
Said Douglas Donn, who will be retained as president at Gulfstream: "I'm very fond of Bert and Diana Firestone. I'm not familiar with the circumstances involved and I'm not going to speculate on it."
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Arizona Cardinals coach Buddy Ryan, intent on restructuring his team's offense before next season, plans to make three prominent veterans available to the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars in the NFL expansion draft in February.
Two days after the Cardinals ended their season with a 10-6 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, Ryan informed quarterback Steve Beuerlein and wide receivers Gary Clark and Ricky Proehl in private meetings yesterday that he plans to include them among the six players the team exposes in the veteran allocation draft.
"I was not surprised at all," Proehl said in a telephone interview from Phoenix. "I have had no contact with Buddy all year. As far as the offensive side goes, nobody has had much communication with him."

SAN DIEGO — Carol Phinney thought nothing could be as painful as the death of her 2-year-old son--until the county said she killed him.
Phinney, a 28-year-old former Oceanside resident, was found innocent this week by a San Diego Superior Court jury of felony child abuse, a charge prosecutors pursued after a judge dismissed a murder charge against her in May.
After the jury returned its verdict, Judge Lawrence Kapiloff said the state owed Phinney an "abject apology" and that her ordeal "cries out for a civil action, and I hope you bring one."
"The pain was so deep I couldn't see," Phinney said of her feelings when she learned she was suspected of killing her son, Travis, whom she says she found unconscious in a bathtub five minutes after leaving him alone. At one point during her six-month ordeal, Phinney said she even tried to kill herself.
Now she is free, and she is suing the county for $1 million--in part because of what she contends was a careless autopsy on Travis that led the district attorney's office to prosecute her.
Phinney, her father, Donald Ozburn, and her attorney, David R. Thompson, said they hope her case will end the county coroner's practice of allowing doctors from Children's Hospital and Health Center of San Diego to perform autopsies on victims of suspected child abuse. Thompson says the hospital's doctors are overzealous in their pursuit of prosecutions.
"We think there's a need for the public to know the cost in human terms of something like this happening," Ozburn said. "The child abuse laws are being abused. It's like putting a gun in the hands of a kid."
"Child abuse is . . . obviously something that all of us should take seriously and want to remedy, (but) it still is no excuse for people not exercising their discretion in a more appropriate way," Kapiloff said. "I find it disgraceful that a woman has to be subjected to a case like this because of speculation on the part of too many people who are looking after their own jobs and their own economic interests."
Phinney's ordeal began last Labor Day, 10 days after she moved from Kansas City to an Oceanside condominium to "begin a new life" with Travis and her fiance, a moving-company truck driver.
That day, Phinney placed Travis in the bathtub after he had soiled his pants. She returned five minutes later to find her son face down and unconscious in three inches of water.
She called paramedics, who revived Travis and took him to Tri-City Hospital in Oceanside. Eventually, he was transferred to Children's Hospital, where he remained on a respirator in a medically induced coma until he died a month later from pneumonia, a complication of his treatment.
"Travis was my life," Phinney said in an interview after the verdict, her voice faint and cracking. "Not a day goes by that I don't think about him. He was bright. He sang. I taught him Spanish. He had rarely given me any problems. He was just one great big bundle of love."
Travis suffered from seizures the first three months of his life and took medication during that time. Doctors called as expert witnesses by the defense during the trial said the boy could have had a relapse in the bathtub.
Even before Travis died Oct. 9, pediatricians at Children's Hospital suspected that Phinney had struck or shaken him.
Although his body showed no bruises or other signs of mistreatment, the doctors said they wondered about the alcohol on Phinney's breath the day of the accident--which she says was from one glass of wine--and they said she told them she was irritated when Travis soiled his pants.
County social workers, nurses and doctors questioned the mother, but after she left for Missouri with her son's body on Oct. 12, she heard nothing more of the investigation.
Then, five months later, Phinney's former fiance--they had just separated--was stopped in Houston by police searching for her. A warrant had been issued for her arrest--on charges of murder and felony child abuse.
"She went overnight from a grieving mother to a fugitive from justice," said Ozburn, Phinney's father.
Phinney said she was seized by hysteria when she learned of the charges, and she hid with friends and relatives for two weeks. But after hiring an attorney she surrendered and returned to San Diego for trial.
Her parents mortgaged their house to raise money for legal fees, and Phinney, who returned to Kansas City after she was released on $10,000 bail, secluded herself in a bedroom--sulking, sobbing and wondering when, or if, she would ever be free.
"I kept myself away from people," Phinney said. "I wondered what people thought of me. I was very frightened."

If we adopt the view that the artist must "comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable," then Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darweesh ranks as perhaps the most inspired of contemporary Arab poets.
A refugee at age 6, he relocated from his birthplace at Al-Birwa to Haifa, then to Beirut after repeated jailings, and finally to Europe. "Sand," his 11th volume, is a poignant chronicle of passage by a poet some call the heart and mind of the Palestinian people.
In the same way that Israeli poet Yehuda Amichai sees his own poetry as being "political by the nature of its affection," Darweesh, afflicted with the universal pain of exile, synthesizes bloodline nationalism with the sonorities of lyrical verse. Passion informs eloquence. As Darweesh says repeatedly in "Al-Mutanabi's Voyage Into Egypt," "My country is my latest poem."
Unlike the metaphor of shiftiness that the book's title exalts, "Sand" is a tribute to permanence, as monumental a study of nomadic identity as Seamus Heaney's "Station Island" is of Ulster's native-born one. For readers, a collective journey through Middle East dissolution; for Darweesh, a personal pilgrimage of endurance. The blessings of hope are not lost on the dead but endure in the living, he says in his long poem "Beirut." "Are we finished?/ No./ We will survive like ancient ruins do/ Like skulls we will keep shape."
And again in "The River Is the Stranger," irony, searing like a cut tongue, is soothed by lyrical images:
Suffering self-incrimination, Darweesh offers the panegyric, "On Fifth Avenue he greeted me," for a poet, once victimized by political torture, now imprisoned by the sterile comforts of Manhattan:
He laments the inconstancy of the peacemaker, who lacking will, is freer "in the prison cells of Nazareth" than in the Fifth Avenue world of ambivalence where "dawn does not sting/ Nor any star burn in this crowding."
His wasted lands are Baalbek, Beirut, and Jaffa where the "details of war" desensitize not only the transgressors but the transgressed.
"We use art as a moral statement," South African Nadine Gordimer says, "not morals as an artistic statement." Darweesh uses poetry to lift morality out from under "the cloak of desolation." "We seek rhythm in a store/ But cannot find it." This at a time when so few poets seem to be searching at all.
R.E.M., Aerosmith Biggest Winners at MTV Awards : Music: Michael and Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson open the show hosted by Roseanne. The late Kurt Cobain is remembered by Nirvana band mates. - latimes
R.E.M., Aerosmith Biggest Winners at MTV Awards : Music: Michael and Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson open the show hosted by Roseanne. The late Kurt Cobain is remembered by Nirvana band mates.
NEW YORK — R.E.M. won four MTV Video Music Awards and Aerosmith took three, including video of the year, during Thursday night's program that opened with Michael and Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson making their first live TV appearance as husband and wife.
Nirvana won the art direction and alternative music prizes, and upon getting the second award, Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl referred to singer Kurt Cobain's suicide earlier this year:
Later in the show, bassist Krist Novocelic introduced a special video montage shown as a paean to Cobain's work.
Aerosmith also won the group award as well as the viewers' choice award for "Cryin'," while the dance and R&B awards went to "Whatta Man" by Salt-N-Pepa, featuring En Vogue. And Counting Crows were selected best new artist in a video for "Mr. Jones."
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were voted best male video for "Mary Jane's Last Dance" and Petty himself took home the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for his overall career.
As the 11th annual program went on the air, the announcer intoned: "Please welcome Mr. and Mrs. Michael Jackson."
"I'm very happy to be here. And just think, nobody thought this would last," said Jackson, who then planted a big kiss on his wife to the squealing delight of the crowd.
They kept it in the family for the night's first award. Jackson's sister Janet snagged the female video prize for "If." She resisted any temptation she may have had to comment on her brother and new sister-in-law's kickoff to the show, just offering the usual thanks instead.
The night ended with another unlikely couple--late-night talk show host David Letterman and Madonna. She had left Letterman nonplussed when she had to be bleeped at least a dozen times during a guest spot on his show earlier this year. He has taken jokey jabs at her antics many times since.
Their joint appearance made it look like things were patched up, though he left her to present the video of the year award by herself.
The presenters of the rap prize--which went to Snoop Doggy Dogg's "Doggy Dogg World"--injected some politics into the affair.
With Flavor Flav's gyrating help, Chuck D averred that rap was no fad--as some people suggested--and that it offers a political forum.
Chuck D said the United States had its own political prisoners and they should be freed. Among those he named: former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, who's serving time in an Indiana prison for rape.
In presenting a lifetime achievement award to the Rolling Stones, Rolling Stone magazine publisher Jann Wenner talked about how much the enduring rock band had meant to him throughout his life.
"They've inspired me in word and deeds. I took their name for my magazine. And they mean more to me now than ever. I'm a total stone-cold Stones fan, and proud of it," Wenner said.
He then offered heartfelt thanks, concluding: "We've been doing this now for 30 years. It's a good way of making a living. I think we'll just keep on doing it."
Performing between the acceptance speeches was a musical smorgasbord: the Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Petty, the Beastie Boys, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Stone Temple Pilots, Boyz II Men, Salt-N-Pepa, Green Day and Smashing Pumpkins.
