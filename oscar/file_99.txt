I have recently posted the following article "The Nature of the Sun's Influence on Climate Change" here
Summary - The sun is a major influence on climate change on Earth in that it provides solar irradiance that warms the planet and a far reaching magnetic field that shields Earth from the effects of galactic cosmic rays, which cools the planet. The magnetic field wrapped in the solar winds modulates the flux rate of cosmic rays which affects cloud formation and thereby the planet's global albedo. Past studies have shown a relationship between the flux rate of galactic cosmic rays and low-level ocean cloud formation. Recent experimental studies have confirmed the causal mechanism behind this process. This paper looks at the relationship between the solar magnetic field (as expressed in "AA Index") and ocean surface temperature over the period from 1880 A.D. to present and finds this relationship is best expressed by a natural logarithmic function.
Lord Christopher Monckton has the most trenchant short critique of the global warming fraud I've ever read. Monckton is a former Margaret Thatcher advisor, and is fighting the good fight as vigorously and honestly as anyone in the world. Lord Monckton writes that the whole global warming campaign is "a foofaraw of pseudo-science, exaggerations, and errors." A "foofaraw" indeed.
Here's the newest fraud: A Science magazine article claims that IF you believe the grossly alarmist assumptions of the UN "consensus" panel on human-caused global warming, all of the American Southwest has to come to a screeching halt! America is running dry! Stop all human development in New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. You're burning up the planet!
But of course the premise itself is dubious and completely politicized, a gross abuse of climate modeling driven by socialist ideology. From false premises you can arrive at any false conclusion you want.
It'll be interesting to see whether Senator McCain will now demand that we halt all new building and agriculture in Arizona. Phoenix has to freeze in place. Next door, Las Vegas has to shrink. No more folks must be allowed to come to Arizona from Mexico --- or New York. What about it, Senator? It's global warming!
But will Texas go along? Will Dallas become a ghost town? How about northern Mexico, right next door? No more building, no additional farming, let the people starve? Stop having children?
This is shameful. Pathological pseudo-science is now metastasizing. The editor of Science is himself a climate modeler, who seems to have no conscience about abusing climate models without a shred of real-world evidence. This cancerous abuse of science will continue to discredit the science establishment in the United States and around the world. And it should. It is utterly mendacious and abusive of real science.
The political motivations behind the global warming fraud have never been more obvious. Abolish Texas! This is very nasty anti-Americanism with a pseudo-scientific gloss. For shame.
Dr. E. L. Charmagny of the Indiana Institute for Science positively identified cooler temperatures as part of global warming. "The recent cold snap in America's midwest area proves that global warming is real," said Dr. Charmagny while enjoying a hamburger sandwich at a local McDonald's restaurant. He explained, "People don't understand that global warming takes many forms, including global cooling, an important part of global warming."
He cited as an example that when he was young winters were "a lot harsher", remarking, "It was very cold for days on end, and there was lots of snow. That's a scientific fact, I remember it! Now it's clearly warmer."
"Young punks nowadays take time off from school if there's two inches of snow on the ground. They need to have those iPods taken away from them, that'll teach them something."
Dr. Charmagny went on to explain that the cool weather in the Midwest is the Earth's 'sympathetic' reaction to global warming. "It gets so warm, that when it gets cold, it gets really cold. It's like when it's quiet after a lot of noise, it seems especially quiet. Again, that's a scientific phenomenon you can read about in any school kid's science book. If these little brats even read their schoolbooks. Brats."
There was some coverage of the chaos caused in central and southern China by their heaviest snowfalls for decades - but little attention was paid to the snow that last week carpeted Jerusalem, Damascus and Amman, none of them exactly used to Dickensian Christmas card weather. Similarly, Saudis last month expressed amazement at their heaviest snow for many years, in Afghanistan snow and freezing weather killed 120 people and large parts of the United States and Canada have been swept by unusually fierce blizzards.
Last autumn the BBC and others could scarcely contain their excitement in reporting that the Arctic ice was melting so fast there would soon be none left. Sea ice cover had shrunk to the lowest level ever recorded. But for some reason the warmists are less keen on the latest satellite findings, reported by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on the website Cryosphere Today by the University of Illinois.
This body is committed to warmist orthodoxy and contributes to the work of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Yet its graph of northern hemisphere sea ice area, which shows the ice shrinking from 13,000 million sq km to just 4 million from the start of 2007 to October, also shows it now almost back to 13 million sq km. A second graph, "Global Ice Area", shows a similar pattern repeated every year since satellite records began in 1979; while a third, "Southern Hemisphere Ice", shows that sea ice has actually expanded in recent years, well above its 30-year mean.
Still more inconvenient was the truth about an image that has been relentlessly exploited to promote this panic over the "vanishing" Arctic ice. It is the photograph of two polar bears standing forlornly on the fast-melting remains of an iceberg which has been reproduced thousands of times to show that there will soon be no bears left (ignoring evidence that their numbers have risen recently). Now, thanks to a Canadian journalist, Carole Williams (on NewsWithViews.com), we can read the story behind this picture, which was taken in 2004 just off Alaska by a marine biologist, Amanda Byrd. As Ms Byrd is happy to point out, the bears were in no danger so close to the coast (they can swim 100 miles). She wanted a photograph more of the "wind-sculpted ice" than of the bears.
The image was copied by another member of the crew and passed on to Environment Canada. Then it was eagerly adopted by the warmist propaganda machine - above all by Al Gore, who used it to powerful effect as an emotive backdrop to his highly lucrative lectures." Their habitat is melting," he likes to declaim, "beautiful animals, literally being forced off the planet."As the old joke has it, it seems those famous bears were not drowning after all, they were just waving. But the BBC is no more likely to tell us that than it was to lead the news with last week's snow in Jerusalem.
I think you may find the little graph I have just produced of interest. It illustrates an intriguing mini-phenomenon: since 1998, `global warming' appears to have - wait for it - stopped. The data is taken from the UK Met Office's `HadCRUT3' dataset, a globally-gridded product of near-surface temperatures, consisting of annual differences from 1961-90 normals. The full data set is available here, covering the period from 1850 to the present. The coloured ribbon shows the best estimate data from this set. But, what does it mean?
Of course, little can be gleaned from such a short data run of only 10-years ["`Global warmers' also please note, thank you"], but the temperature anomaly has clearly dipped, and then flat-lined below its 1998 anomaly peak - and for nine years now. In other words, since 1998 there has been no global warming [not even any `global warming']. Yet, atmospheric CO2 has continued to rise, from c. 368 ppmv in 1998 to c. 384 ppmv in November, 2007 [see: `CO2 Signals From The Past', February 1]. Moreover, politicians persist in claiming that temperature is rising faster than at any other time in the history of the whole Earth..... but then, we always believe our politicians, don't we?
So, does this mean to say that other factors may actually be driving climate and temperature? Oh me, Oh my! What a shock! Perhaps with all those shredders in our offices and homes, there are just too many tiny bits and bobs of credit cards floating up into the air and cooling the atmosphere? Or, weddings may have increased in number, and particulate confetti is having an unknown effect? Or, then again, the rise out of the `Little Ice Age', which ended c. 1880, might just be stuttering a tad? Who knows?
Time to get my skates on. But, whatever it is - for the moment, at least - Global Warming Has Stopped! Shout it from the rooftops, from your PCs, and from your Apple Macs.
The major objection that Greenies such as Dessler raised to the "400+ climate skeptics" report released by Inhofe was that some of the academic skeptics included were "not qualified" to comment on climate issues. So their outrage at DiCaprio's lack of climatological qualifications is to be expected -- or is it?
Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio has been invited to the Scottish Parliament to speak about climate change.The Oscar nominated actor - whose films include Titanic, Blood Diamond and The Departed - is also a passionate environmental campaigner. Green Party MSP Patrick Harvie has written to DiCaprio, inviting him to come to the Holyrood and speak to MSPs about the threat of global warming.
In his letter the Glasgow MSP told the actor that the Scottish Government had recently began discussions on a proposed Climate Change Bill. Mr Harvie explained that while these included "ambitious long-term targets" for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions the Greens wanted further action.And he said: "It would be a great help were you able to speak to other members of the Parliament about the urgency of the threat we face."
A Green Party spokesman said they were currently waiting on a response from DiCaprio.The actor produced, co-wrote and narrated the documentary film The 11th Hour, which looks at how human actions have affected the environment.
Today people worship actors, but former times saw them as lowlifes, as unstable people driven to pretense and false dealings. In other words, as hypocrites. It's heresy to say so but former times might have had a point.
Who's our congressman?" asked mama polar bear during a light lunch on an ice floe somewhere off Alaska. "Beats me," said papa polar bear. "Pass the walrus calf."
"I want to send a letter complaining about Joey being attacked again by those government wildlife scientists," said mama polar bear.
"Let it go," said papa polar bear. "Your brother still stinks of humans. But at least the sedation's taking longer to wear off this time, so he hasn't been his usual testy, cranky self."
"You'd be stressed too if you were chased by a helicopter, shot with a tranquilizer dart and had 'X19788' tattooed on the inside of your mouth when you were only 5 years old," said mama polar bear. "At least now he can no longer claim that first encounter was an alien abduction," said papa polar bear. "Cool it, kids," said grandpa polar bear. "Those scientists are just doing their job -- like the ones we saw on '60 Minutes' two weeks ago. "If it weren't for their longitudinal studies, we wouldn't know how many of us live up here or that anthropomorphic global warming is a threat to our iconic existence."
"Well, I'm sick of being harassed," said mama polar bear. "For my entire life they've been drugging us, weighing us, checking our fat content -- poking into our sex lives. Now they've got Scott Pelley of CBS flying around with them." "At least they're not putting radio collars on us or painting numbers on our backs," said papa polar bear. "Or shooting us anymore," reminded grandpa polar bear. "In my day, we had a lot more than mad scientists, biased TV reporters and melting pack ice to worry about. We were daily target practice for sports hunters or bored sailors.
"I bet there weren't 8,000 of us left in the whole Arctic in 1970. Now that we're protected, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service estimates we're up to 25,000 -- though 60 percent of us live in Canada, those hosers."
"I'd rather take my chances with hunters than put up with this darn population explosion," said papa polar bear. "You can't go 20 miles without bumping into a mother and her spoiled cubs. Go into town for a little Dumpster diving, and it's so crowded you gotta take a number."
"Quit griping, son," said grandpa polar bear. "Our species has finally hit the jackpot. Humans were our only enemy. Now we're the official mascots of the climate-change industrial complex. We're as charismatic as whales. We've got lobbyists all over Washington."
"It won't last," said papa polar bear. "Wait till everyone finds out the ice cap naturally gets thinner or thicker all the time. Wait till they all realize we can swim 30 miles before breakfast. Wait till they see two-thirds of us haven't died by 2050 because of a little global warming.
"But what if '60 Minutes' turns on us and catches us eating baby seals?" asked mama polar bear. "Don't be such alarmists," said grandpa polar bear. "Al Gore will never let it happen. "The mainstream media, politicians and school kids have been completely suckered. We're apex victims of modern mankind. Senators from New Jersey are working to put us on the Endangered Species list. Congress is talking about doing a study to make sure we won't be hurt before they allow those new oil and gas leases to be auctioned in the Chuckchi Sea. It's only a matter of time before we get Pell Grants for polar bears.
"So stop worrying, kids," said grandpa polar bear, slipping off the ice floe for a little five mile swim. "We've never had it so good."
Yesterday's green propaganda teach in demonstrated campuses are as much about indoctrination as discovering truth from the interplay of diverse viewpoints. Global warming issues took over lecture halls in colleges across the country Thursday, with more than 1,500 universities participating in what was billed as the nation's largest-ever "teach-in."
Organizers said the goal of the event, dubbed "Focus the Nation," was to move past preaching to the green choir, to reach a captive audience of students in many fields who might not otherwise tune in to climate change issues
The reporter got it right when she mentioned that students are a captive audience, forced to listen to and accept the perceived wisdom, similar to but without the harshest consequences of any Communist re education campaign. According to a student organizer
"It's about infusing sustainability into the curriculum of higher education, so students can graduate prepared to deal with the world they have been handed,"
By infusing the one thought propaganda within the curriculum captive students not only have no opportunity to learn other points of view they won't even realize there are other opinions. Perfect mind control.
Therefore, the 23 year old student organizer is totally wrong--once the students graduate and are out in the real world they will be very unprepared to deal with the world the university has handed them. For this they and their parents sacrificed?
AIM have done a very thorough job of demolishing the Warmists. The introduction to their big article is below:
In the past several months, a new "crisis" has heated up the controversy over man-made global warming. A few major-media writers and TV personalities are actually reporting statements by credible scientists who are challenging the assumption that carbon dioxide is the primary force causing global warming.
There's a real possibility that big-name journalists will break ranks and pursue their next Pulitzer Prize by exposing the lack of scientific consensus on CO2 as a planet-heating pollutant. That would create a crisis of confidence among the activists, researchers and global-governance apparatchiks who want a global carbon tax to build their political and financial power base.
As an agricultural journalist, I find this a fascinating new development in the climate controversy. I've studied weather and climate for more than 50 years. In the early 1970s, I wrote a short book, Tomorrow's Wild Weather, which warned what could happen if there was a long-term continuation of the cooling trends in the mid-latitudes since the 1930s.
As climatologist Reid Bryson advised me at the time, a cooler climate in temperate zones would have been serious for world agriculture: Westerly winds would intensify, making U.S. weather more extreme. Africa's Sahel desert would expand much farther southward, spreading famine across northern Africa. The data looked ominous: Average temperature in the 48 U.S. states had fallen by more than six-tenths of a degree Celsius since 1930.
This cooling attracted widespread press coverage and even some political pressure-to reduce "aerosols" or fine particles of pollutants which must be making our atmosphere more opaque. But the "New Ice Age" scare faded as more refined data emerged and the longer-term, slow recovery from the Little Ice Age resumed.
I've continued to follow the climate controversy, especially since the 1997 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Since that conference, billions of dollars in government funding have generated floods of research data, a myriad of computer models, political posturing and the Kyoto Protocol.
Most of that data is freely available to scientists and others on the Internet. Using it, hundreds of highly qualified climatologists and other scientists outside the fraternal network of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have challenged climate prediction models and other assumptions of the IPCC's reports. While there's consensus that climates change over time, climatologists are sharply divided over the interactions of the many potential causes. As research emerges, CO2 as a primary warming force becomes harder to defend with hard data.
These challenges are starting to fracture the UN's pretext for global governance over carbon emissions-including imposition of carbon taxes and "carbon credit" trading supervised by UN agencies. Giving the UN a legal right to impose a carbon tax- "cap and trade" in UNspeak-would provide an income stream to UN agencies which would greatly increase political power of UN bureaucracies. And their track record with large amounts of money, such as the Iraqi Oil for Food program, is not encouraging. However, if the scientific case for CO2 as a primary climate pollutant crumbles, so could a global carbon tax.
Individual climatologists have disputed conclusions of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change even before the first IPCC Assessment Report in 1990. The IPCC has issued a series of reports, each focusing on CO2 as the primary "greenhouse gas" causing the continuing warming recovery since the Little Ice Age.
One of the first organized scientific counterattacks sounded on April 6, 2006. Sixty accredited experts in climate and related scientific disciplines signed a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, urging that billions of Canadian tax dollars appropriated to implement the Kyoto Protocol on climate change "will be squandered without a proper assessment of recent developments in climate science." They wrote that if today's extensive climate knowledge and measuring capabilities had existed in the mid-1990s, the Kyoto treaty "would almost certainly not exist, because we would have concluded it was not necessary."
That scientific challenge received little prime-time media attention. The Canadian government's administration and legislature mostly ignored it.
Then, in March 2007, the UK's Channel 4 broadcast a biting documentary, The Great Global Warming Swindle. It debunked most of the major arguments of Al Gore's Oscar-winning video, An Inconvenient Truth. For example, the Antarctic ice core data dramatized in Gore's show actually reveal that increases in CO2 have generally followed increases in temperature. The lag is typically on the order of 800 years.
The Swindle documentary roused furor and scorn among carbon-as-cause believers, who attacked Channel 4 as offering a "great propaganda gift" to "climate-change deniers." But the credibility and rationale of scientific sources on the documentary endured the attacks. No factual challenges were forthcoming against the scientists' arguments.
The controversy over this TV show, the first journalistic challenge against CO2 as primary world thermostat, may have encouraged others in the scientific community to point out that despite roughly $50 billion for climate-change research over several decades, the case against carbon dioxide faces more uncertainty as the evidence grows, not less.
One such challenge comes from Dr. Bob Carter, Research Professor at James Cook University and paleoclimate analyst with more than 30 years' experience, including 95 research papers.
In an Accuracy in Media guest column in April 2007, Carter emphasized: "The evidence for dangerous global warming forced by human carbon dioxide emissions is extremely weak. That the satellite temperature record shows no substantial warming since 1978, and that even the ground-based thermometer statistic records no warming since 1998, indicates that a key line of circumstantial evidence for human-caused change-the parallel rise in the late 20th century of both atmospheric carbon dioxide and surface temperatures-is now negated."
This challenge and others from eminent scientists roused the carbon theorists to their ramparts. On the website www.realclimate.org, Gavin Scmidt and Stefan Rahmstorf presented a 1980-2006 chart of global temperature showing that the trend of deviation from "normal" in that 26-year period remains up. But they made no attempt to explain why shorter-term deviations vary more widely than the longer-term anomaly, which puts the globe at about 0.4 degrees Celsius above its long-term "normal" using the GISTEMP Land-Ocean Index computed by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
Throughout 2007, hundreds of highly qualified climate scientists individually challenged the presumption that global regulators can, and must, manage the world's thermostat by curbing 50% - and possible eventually 100%-of man-made carbon dioxide emissions.
The most lively media arena for the CO2 emissions controversy the past two years has been, by far, among Internet websites and blogs. The Science and Public Policy Institute (http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org) offers a wide-ranging forum on the science of climate change. Websites like the SPPI bypass major-media gatekeepers and the UN organizers, who carefully monitor any non-governmental organization wishing to attend an IPCC climate conference. Example: At the November 2000 Conference of the Parties (COP6) climate parley in the Hague, Netherlands, the only non-governmental organization to oppose the Kyoto Protocol was Sovereignty International (www.sovereignty.net).
The websites provide newspaper, radio and TV reporters a rich diversity of data and analysis on the issue. Usually, any posted article contains an opportunity for immediate rebuttal. These websites may embolden scientists to speak out more frequently in a forum unconstrained by peer review.
The volume of new climate data is accelerating, which means that media-amplified claims like the linkage between climate warming and hurricanes can be challenged more quickly. For instance, the SPPI site points out 35 factual errors in Al Gore's documentary, "An Inconvenient Truth."
On Dec. 20 2007, the biggest-yet assembly of scientists challenging the Kyoto pretext of CO2-as-villain was posted by Marc Morano on the minority page of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. This extensive digging by Sen. James Inhofe's staff summarized comments from over 400 prominent scientists who disputed some aspect of man-made global warming in 2007. These scientists' observations fill some 120 pages when printed out from the website. But they hardly made a ripple on prime-time TV news.
This Senate site says, in part: "Over 400 prominent scientists from more than two dozen countries recently voiced significant objections to major aspects of the so-called "consensus" on man-made global warming. These scientists, many of whom are current and former participants in the UN IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), criticized the climate claims made by the UN IPCC and former Vice President Al Gore."
Sen. Inhofe's staff observes, "Even some in the establishment media now appear to be taking notice of the growing number of skeptical scientists. In October, Washington Post Staff Writer Juliet Eilperin conceded the obvious, writing that climate skeptics "appear to be expanding rather than shrinking."
In all the political brouhaha over `global warming', and despite the 35 per cent rise in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide over pre-industrial conditions [from 1832 ice-core records of c. 284 ppmv to c. 384 ppmv in November, 2007), we too often forget that atmospheric CO2 levels remain at their lowest for 500 million years.
The above graph has been taken from `Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels for the last 500 million years' by Daniel H. Rothman (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 99 (7), April 2, 2002, pp. 4167-4171. The graph shows the fluctuations in the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2) over the last 500 My (million years), employing certain methodological improvements introduced by Rothman in his paper.
The grey bars at the top of the graph represent cooler periods in the Earth's history; the white spaces between are warmer periods. The time scale embraces minus 500 million years from the present, and includes the following geological periods: Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary.
"The last 500 million years of the strontium-isotope record are shown to correlate significantly with the concurrent record of isotopic fractionation between inorganic and organic carbon after the effects of recycled sediment are removed from the strontium signal. The correlation is shown to result from the common dependence of both signals on weathering and magmatic processes. Because the long-term evolution of carbon dioxide levels depends similarly on weathering and magmatism, the relative fluctuations of CO2 levels are inferred from the shared fluctuations of the isotopic records. The resulting CO2 signal exhibits no systematic correspondence with the geologic record of climatic variations at tectonic time scales."
"Using a variety of sedimentological criteria, Frakes et al. have concluded that Earth's climate has cycled several times between warm and cool modes for roughly the last 600 My. Recent work by Veizer et al., based on measurements of oxygen isotopes in calcite and aragonite shells, appears to confirm the existence of these long-period (~135 My) climatic fluctuations. Changes in CO2 levels are usually assumed to be among the dominant mechanisms driving such long-term climate change. It is therefore interesting to ask what, if any, correspondence exists between ancient climate and the estimate of pCO2 in Fig. 4 [the Figure shown above]. The gray [sic] bars at the top of Fig. 4 correspond to the periods when the global climate was cool; the intervening white space corresponds to the warm modes. The most recent cool period corresponds to relatively low CO2 levels, as is widely expected.
However, no correspondence between pCO2 and climate is evident in the remainder of the record, in part because the apparent 100 My cycle of the pCO2 record does not match the longer climatic cycle. The lack of correlation remains if one calculates the change in average global surface temperature resulting from changes in pCO2 and the solar constant using energy-balance arguments. Superficially, this observation would seem to imply that pCO2 does not exert dominant control on Earth's climate at time scales greater than about 10 My. A wealth of evidence, however, suggests that pCO2 exerts at least some control [see Crowley and Berner for a recent review]. Fig. 4 cannot by itself refute this assumption. Instead, it simply shows that the `null hypothesis' that pCO2 and climate are unrelated cannot be rejected on the basis of this evidence alone."
Of course, this study also rightly stresses its focus on long-term geological cycles. Nevertheless, it demonstrates well our current position with respect to geological time. Where carbon dioxide is concerned, we remain at a low ebb. Moreover, if for long geological periods the `null hypothesis' that pCO2 and climate are unrelated cannot be rejected on the basis of such evidence, how certain are we that comparable constraints might not apply at much shorter time scales too? I only ask?
You see, I just have a hunch that water vapour and the hydrological cycle are more significant drivers at all time scales, with temperature and carbon dioxide `piggy-backing' on these rather than presenting a merely simplistic, if beguiling, correlation.
Common sense should tell us that good policies produce more in benefits than they cost us. Unfortunately, common sense has left the building when it comes to climate policy. Asserting (somewhat absurdly) that America's economic and geopolitical competitors, such as China and India, are just waiting for "U.S. moral leadership," several voices are renewing their call for domestic cap-and-trade legislation to control greenhouse gases.
But cap-and-trade schemes are fundamentally flawed, and particularly ill-suited to greenhouse gas control. The current poster child for cap and trade is the Warner-Lieberman Climate Security Act of 2007 (S. 2191). If enacted, Warner-Lieberman will cause economic harm without producing any environmental or climate-protective benefits. This is the hallmark of irrational policy.
First, let's look at the likelihood that the legislation's goals can be met. Economist Margo Thorning observed in Congressional testimony, "In order to meet the emission reduction targets in S. 2191, U.S. per capita emissions would have to fall by a total of 13.8 percent over the 2000-2012 period, an additional 20.2 percent from 2012 to 2020 and a further 27.6 from 2020 to 2030. In other words, the required reductions in per capita emissions are about 25 to 35 times greater than what occurred from 1990 to 2000. The technologies simply do not exist to reduce total (and per capita emissions) over the next 17 years by the amounts mandated in S. 2191..." Thorning is not alone in this belief: in a 2004 Science article, a team of 18 prestigious scientists observed that meeting projected growth in energy demand while sharply curbing greenhouse gas emissions requires carbon-free technologies that "do not exist operationally or as pilot plants."
Now, let's look at the costs. Economist Anne Smith testified to Congress that her state-of-the-art economic modeling estimates that Warner-Lieberman would cause net reduction in 2015 GDP of 1.0% to 1.6% relative to the GDP that would otherwise occur. That loss rises to the range of 2% to 2.5% after 2015. Smith found that the annual loss in GDP would increase to the range of $800 billion to $1 trillion, which is serious money. By 2020, Smith estimates losses of 1.5 to 3.4 million jobs -- and that is net jobs, after adjusting for the new "green" jobs that might be created by the bill.
None of this is surprising as experience has shown cap-and-trade schemes are fundamentally flawed. Here are four reasons. First, capping carbon essentially puts a regulatory drag on economic growth. When the economy grows, energy demand rises, which means the demand for the limited number of carbon permits would rise, strangling growth in its cradle.
Second, everyone involved in a cap-and-trade system has incentives to cheat. Companies have incentives both to overstate historical emissions, and to exaggerate the benefits of new technologies to generate bogus emissions that become ready cash. Experience in both the US and Europe shows that firms usually get away with it: validating historic emissions is nearly impossible. And governments won't look very hard - wanting to appear green, they have strong incentives to turn their eyes away from carbon credit malfeasance.
Third, cap-and-trade creates a perpetual group of rent-seekers - those raking in profits in new carbon trading - who will call for ever-tighter caps, and who will staunchly oppose any other approach to dealing with greenhouse gas emissions. Once a company holds millions of dollars in carbon credits, they can be expected to spend large sums of money lobbying against anything that would devalue their new currency.
Finally, carbon cap-and-trade will raise the costs of energy, goods, and services. If that does not happen, there is no incentive for anyone to cut back on energy use, and the attendant emissions it produces. This could be offset, in theory, if the carbon permits were all auctioned off, and the revenues used to lower other taxes. But no emission trading system has ever auctioned off a majority of permits, and Warner-Lieberman is no exception: at first, it auctions only a trivial share of emission permits, and even when that ramps up decades hence, the revenues are used as a wealth-redistribution tool focused mainly on funding dubious energy research schemes rather than protecting the overall economy from the impact of higher energy prices.
The post-Bali refrain is that the US should "lead" by enacting carbon cap-and-trade. Apart from the silliness of assuming that our economic and political competitors are waiting on the US for "moral leadership," carbon cap-and-trade is simply bad policy: its costs are high, and benefits non-existent. Rational climate policy would consist of a short-term focus on adaptation, and a longer-term effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions via a modest revenue-neutral carbon tax.
Participants in President Bush's international climate conference this week in Hawaii should know that the "solution" to global warming -- expensive energy -- slows economic growth, at enormous human cost. In fact, evidence suggests that policies to fight global warming are worse for human welfare than rising temperatures.
By now it is common knowledge that climate change is caused by the combustion of fossil fuels, which releases heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But fossil fuels generate 85 percent of the world's energy because they are the cheapest sources of energy on earth. So a move towards green energy is a move away from cheap energy.
Not everyone admits the stark economic realities of fighting climate change. Representative from the European Union, for example, seem oblivious to the costs of the policies they propose. During negotiations last December in Bali, Indonesia, EU officials demanded that the world commit to steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, with the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.
According to the International Energy Agency, the costs of meeting the EU's proposal are staggering. The IEA says that it would require the construction of 30 new nuclear power plants, 17,000 wind turbines, 400 biomass plants, two hydroelectric dams the size of China's Three Gorges Dam, and 42 coal fired power plants equipped with still-experimental systems to sequester their carbon-dioxide emissions undergroundeach year from 2013 to 2030.
Of course, alternative energy sources cost more than conventional generation from fossil fuels -- that's why a green energy future is an expensive energy future. Expensive energy, however, is inimical to economic well-being. Consider America's economic malaise during the Carter administration, which was caused in large part by the precipitous increase in the price of oil resulting from the 1973 OPEC oil embargo
Don't be fooled by politicians like California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who claim that curbing global emissions will boost economic growth by creating a thriving "green sector." For each solar panel technician gained, a coal miner -- and much more--are lost, because higher energy prices means less of everything made from energy, which is...everything.
Economists agree that an abrupt transition to a clean energy future would cost the global economy scores, even hundreds, of trillions of dollars. Numbers, no matter how eye-popping, are only an abstraction of the human consequences of a low growth/expensive energy future. Greater wealth yields more medical care, less exposure to the elements and better nutrition-all of which save or prolong human life. By extension, slow growth kills, because it deprives the poorest of the means to ward off cold, sickness and disease.
So what's worse: the warming, or the policy? Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg applied a cost/benefit analysis to climate change mitigation measures like the Kyoto Protocol, and found they were a tragic waste of money. According to his research, we could spend a fraction of the cost of climate policies on immediate problems, like HIV or malaria, and save millions more lives than global warming would take.
In a 2007 study, Yale economist William Nordhaus demonstrated that the package of policies advocated by Al Gore would leave the world $44 trillion worse off at the end of the 21st century, or about double the cost of doing nothing about climate change. That's a killer deal, literally.
To be sure, global warming is real, and the climate will slowly change. But that doesn't mean that international officials in Hawaii should ignore the costs of controlling the planet's thermostat; otherwise, they risk prioritizing atmospheric chemistry over global poverty.
As I arose this morning to go work out, the temp was again -14. That's inside a major city, and it was much colder out in the boonies. I've seen worse and survived, but I really could get along quite nicely with less frigid temps. So, certainly, could my 18-year-old car. Where in hell is that dreaded, inevitable global warming the politically-correct sheep keep harping about?
Allow me to tell you where that global warming is. It's in the planet's nature, and we don't know squat about that. We do know that planet temps vary in cycles, but how and why is complex. It will be warmer sometime, and it will be generally colder sometime, but we puny humans can't predict it with any certainty. One thing I am sure of, though, is that we humans, short of balls-out nuclear war, cannot affect global temperatures to any significant degree. Everything we do together, worst-case, good or bad, is nothing compared to one volcanic eruption or a big forest fire, and those happen with or without our permission or intent.
Meanwhile, we're screwing up a lot by forcing nonsensical false-solutions on the world's population. By forcing, and subsidizing, ethanol on ourselves, we're driving up the cost of grains around the world, costing all of us even more money for food, and actually causing starvation. Ethanol is a solution to nothing, but we could kill ourselves trying to make it so. Cropland is being switched to corn, to feed the subsidized ethanol factories. That drives up the cost of corn, which drives up the cost of everything else produced from corn. Land that once was used for other crops is now planted in lucrative corn, creating shortages of other crops and driving their price up as well.
Can we not see when we are being bamboozled? Can we not even get suspicious when we see a TV ad of little kids mouthing global-warming fears for an organization lusting for your contributions? How gullible can we be? Global warming is being pushed by groups who get rich off your contributions, by scaring the crap out of you. They make you feel responsible for the weather, and some of them were doing it with global COOLING scares in the past.
I don't know what will replace gasoline as fuel in the future, but from what I do know, there is plenty of oil around the globe. I suspect someone will come up with a better, cheaper fuel in time, but ethanol sure as hell isn't it, and by forcing ethanol down our carburettor throats, we're reducing the incentive and ability to find good solutions. In short, we're in the process of killing ourselves.
There are all sorts of conferences with all sorts of purposes and the Heartland Institute is arranging a conference called "The 2008 International Conference on Climate Change" in New York. The purpose of the conference is to highlight the fact that there is a variety of views on climate change among scientists -- and to debate and discuss those views. And the Greenies seem to be afraid to participate -- knowing of course how many holes and frail assumptions there are in their arguments.
So The Greenie "Real Climate" site has slammed the conference by saying that it is not a routine general meeting for members of a scientific discipline but rather a more publicly available talking shop. It appears that according to them there is only one sort of conference! They also quite plainly imply that scientists who do not agree with them are not real scientists! A nice little circular argument implied there, I think. Below is the response (Comment 47) by James M. Taylor of the Heartland Institute to the Greenie article:
The anonymously authored Real Climate article above is a disappointing smear job - i.e., you have nothing to say substantively, so you attempt to smear your intellectual opponents. Many of the world's leading climate scientists from some of the world's most prestigious universities will be giving presentations. Rather than behaving like children and throwing mud at them, perhaps you might behave like adults and discuss the science. Of course, that will never happen because open and honest debate is what you fear most.
I never thought I would see the day when scientific debate and inquiry, conducted by some of the most credentialed scientists in the world, would be considered a bad thing. But that is what happens when people are afraid of the truth.
Al Gore in one day rakes in more honorarium money than all of our speakers combined. Nevertheless, we have offered to pay his usual honorarium to speak at our conference, but have not heard back from Mr. Gore. We have invited Real Climate's Michael Mann to come and speak at our conference, but Mr. Mann also has failed to respond to our invitation.
Unlike Real Climate, we do not attempt to stifle scientific inquiry. Instead, we encourage it. We are equal opportunity investigators of science. As the Real Climate article above notes, we have invited many members of Real Climate to come and give presentations. It is odd that Real Climate is invited to discuss the science in a professional, scholarly environment, yet throws stones from afar, where they do not have to subject their claims to scientific scrutiny.
Perhaps Real Climate will abandon their fear of public discourse, and will reconsider their decision to decline our invitation to speak at the conference. After all, isn't honest and open scientific discussion a good thing? Please send me an email at taylor@heartland.org and, as my prior emails indicate, I would be happy to add you to our conference lineup.
The level of chutzpah in your comment is breathtaking. Our 'substantive' additions to the scientific knowledge is well attested to by our publications in the peer reviewed literature and is subject to scientific scrutiny every day. I will even venture to make a prediction that the number of peer-reviewed papers on climate science we have collectively authored in the last 5 years will be substantially more than all of your speakers put together. Honest and open scientific discussion is greatly to be wished for, and in fact, happens all the time. I don't recall ever bumping into you at a real conference (AGU/AMS/EGU), but should you ever go, you'll see it how it works first hand. Your institute plays no role in that because your approach is the anti-thesis of scientific inquiry - your conclusions have been decided before you look at the evidence. When you decide to stop abusing the scientific process for political gain, then perhaps we can talk.
In saying: "Your conclusions have been decided before you look at the evidence" Schmidt is in fact of course describing the Greenie procedure. Good ol' Green/Left "projection" again. And getting papers published in journals where the editors and referees agree with you is both a doddle and no proof of anything. It is exposure to people who DISAGREE with you that is the real test and the Greenie scientists will not be in that. James Taylor further emailed Marc Morano as follows:
I would really prefer to keep the conversation with them constructive and professional, but the nasty, unprovoked, ad hominem attack they posted on their website against scientists who disagree with them was simply uncalled for.
By the way, I attempted to post a follow-up comment on their blog, but they have cut me off and refuse to post my comments. How typical of their tactics! If they are going to have a "closed" blog that does not allow dissent, they should at least be intellectually honest enough to identify it as such. Seeing as Gavin and company refuse to post comments from people who disagree with them, I will share my attempted post with you:
Gavin, I am disappointed, though not surprised, that you and your Real Climate fellow activists have refused our invitation to speak at the climate change conference (see 47, above). I can make a pretty good guess as to why. Less than a year ago, on March 14, 2007, Real Climate's Gavin Schmidt and two other global warming alarmists debated global warming against three skeptical scientists in front of the prestigious Intelligence Squared debating society in New York City. A poll of audience members prior to the debate found that the audience believed by a 2-to-1 margin (57 percent to 29 percent) that global warming is a crisis. After a lengthy debate in which all panelists had a chance to present their evidence and answer follow-up questions, the audience voted by a 46 to 42 percent margin that global warming is NOT a crisis.
Better for Real Climate activists to remain in your self-contained blogosphere and classlessly sling mud than to run the risk of another public embarrassment in a fair and honest scientific debate, right Gavin?
In my opinion, intelligence is a necessary part of a scientist's innate equipment, but intelligence alone is insufficient. Insight and character count too, for without them a scientist lacks judgment, the absence of which will eventuate in self-deception. Bad character leads to worse, until it undermines and defeats intelligence. I offer Gavin Schmidt as evidence for the validity of my opinion.
I might finally note that the Leftist "Think Progress" site has also weighed in with typical intellectual depth. They seem to feel that they have uttered a damning indictment by trotting out their usual boilerplate that the conference is funded by "Big oil". Getting the Green/Left to rise above ad hominem smears and actually debate the issues really is a Herculean task!
The Heartland Institute organizes a climate conference in March that is, unlike the conferences that you usually hear about in the media, open to climate skeptics and experts regardless of their political opinions or overall sentiments about the relationship between Nature and the human civilization. The organizers have sent invitations to many kinds of climate experts, including some of the well-known champions of the climate alarm. These invitations have provoked a hysterical reaction at RealClimate.ORG.
The profoundly concerned scientists describe all the scientists who will attend - before they actually know who they are - as being corrupt by the "evil" oil industry, not being scientists at all, as people being paid concrete amounts of money to fabricate papers and talks, and so on. Their talks are described as "tobacco science". RealClimate.ORG even recommends their readers conspiracy theories from two hardcore smear ecoNazi websites, ExxonSecrets.ORG and SourceWatch.ORG, that pre-emptively throw mud at very concrete people who might (or might not) attend.
What about the remaining 450 scientists at the updated Inhofe's list? Are the environmentalist whackos fast enough to create a similar Goebbelsian web page about every scientist who says the obvious, namely that the dangerous global warming orthodoxy is a hoax? Do they actually believe that they can eliminate the opposition as completely and effectively as NSDAP did without actually having police and other arms under its control?
The RealClimate "group" explains that the participants are not scientists at all - before they actually know who is attending - and they encourage the participants to skip the talks and enjoy a nice hotel in New York instead. They wouldn't hear any science at all, so it is important that the participants can't hear the talks...
Their smear job is so blatant, hateful, and inconsistent with any kind of a reasonable, balanced, open-minded, or scientific analysis of a question that I can't really believe that there exist people who are intelligent enough to learn how to read but moronic enough to be influenced by this incredibly cheap propagandistic porn.
The Heartland Institute conference is clearly not designed as a cutting edge conference that is expected to lead to some revolutionary scientific results. No truly groundbreaking discoveries have been made in climate science for many decades and it is unlikely that some of them will occur in a foreseeable future. Climate is just too messy and there are too many moderately important small insights about it. On the other hand, there are scientists - such as Richard Lindzen, Roy Spencer, Henrik Svensmark, and numerous others - who understand the climate much better than most people, including many active participants of the "climate debate", and who have a lot of things to teach others.
The real problem here is a political one - there exist powerful forces that don't want other people to learn what is actually known about the climate, not even some of the basic results and numbers. There exist organizations and their ad hoc unions that prefer constant lies to be promoted by the media and myths to thrive among ordinary people.
They have certain reasons to make people believe that the temperature of the second millenium looked like a hockey stick - even five years after the papers were shown to be bunk and their main author a crackpot in statistics. They want everyone to believe that the carbon dioxide was driving temperature during the ice ages and interglacials - many years after it became absolutely clear that the causal relation behind the correlation goes in the opposite direction.
They want everyone to believe that small changes of the temperature can exterminate polar bears and other species even though the actual scientific evidence shows that it can't, that the Solar activity doesn't have any impact on the terrestrial climate even though there is extensive evidence that it does, that small warming creates catastrophic hurricanes even though all links of this type have been shown erroneous. They want everyone to believe that there is a scientific consensus about this scientific discipline and this consensus can settle the debate and justify arbitrarily oversimplified conclusions - even though there is clearly no consensus and even if there existed one, it wouldn't mean anything and it would certainly not justify any oversimplification.
Indeed, the official goal of the organizers of the conference is a political one - to inform the world about the real state of affairs, namely that many qualified experts who have carefully thought about these questions simply disagree with the global warming orthodoxy. Individual participants may have purer (or, on the contrary, more material) reasons to attend. At all conferences, it is always like that, to one extent or another, and the "group" is simply not saying the truth if they pretend that pure scientific curiosity is behind all of their conferences. But I think that it is good that the Heartland organizers honestly state what is their goal because the goal of analogous alarmist conferences is also political (while many of their attendees have material reasons to attend) but this fact is being routinely obscured.
There is another difference that RealClimate.ORG points out: that the preferred speakers are recommended by the organizers or sponsors while it is usually a scientific committee that does it at "ordinary" conferences. Unlike RealClimate.ORG, I am not so sure which of these two arrangements is superior.
I have learnt a great deal about the work in committees - most of them were impotent, constantly stuck bodies composed of people driven by their extremely narrow-minded personal interests and desire to look politically correct and coincide with whatever opinion is felt to be dominant according to the wind that is just blowing right now. Whenever the question was whether an adjacent discipline would be allowed an extra funding or job, the dominant argument was always the pockets of the participants. 90% of the arguments offered at certain committees' meetings were driven either by material interests of participants or the creation of their fake "nice" image.
Yes, with these memories in mind, I would probably prefer a semi-informed CEO of ExxonMobil to make the choice but I am not sure whether he or she is actually the person who will do it. ;-) In fact, I doubt it.
At any rate, I recommend all big shots and medium shots ;-) regardless of their position within the environmentally political spectrum to attend, learn a lot, and teach others - climate realists and climate alarmists alike - a lot.
The Canadian Space Agency's radio telescope has been reporting Flux Density Values so low they will mean a mini ice age if they continue.
Like the number of sunspots, the Flux Density Values reflect the Sun's magnetic activity, which affects the rate at which the Sun radiates energy and warmth. CSA project director Ken Tapping calls the radio telescope that supplies NASA and the rest of the world with daily values of the Sun's magnetic activity a "stethoscope on the Sun". In this case, however, it is the "doctor" whose health is directly affected by the readings.
This is because when the magnetic activity is low, the Sun is dimmer, and puts out less radiant warmth. If the Sun goes into dim mode, as it has in the past, the Earth gets much colder.
Tapping, who was originally from Kent, says that "Typically as you go through the ten or eleven year solar activity cycle you see the numbers go up or down. The lowest number is 64 or 68. The numbers 71 or 72 are very low, but they usually start to go up. We are at the end of a cycle, but the numbers still haven't gone up. We have been joking around coffee that we may be seeing the Sun about to shut down." (To date Tapping has been far more concerned about global warming.)
According to NASA, "early, well-documented records indicate that the Sun went through a period of inactivity in the late 17th century" from about 1645 to 1715, during the Maunder Minimum.
"This period of solar inactivity also corresponds to a climatic period called the Little Ice Age when rivers that are normally ice-free froze and snow fields remained year-round at lower altitudes." It was called the Maunder Minimum, after Edward Maunder, a British accountant who saw a sunspot "like a tack in the Sun" while he was walking home, and subsequently made counting and analyzing sunspots, rather than money, his life's work. There have been other Minimums. The Dalton Minimum of 1800 to 1810 was that period when Napoleon had his unfortunate encounter with the Russian winter.
If the Sun's magnetic activity does not increase, and it goes dim for an extended period, it will get quite chilly. In the meantime the Canada Space Agency, the Royal Observatory Greenwich and the US Air Force Solar Optical Observing Network are all keeping an eye on the Sun.
Top Republicans have called for an investigation into the recent purchase of carbon offsets, which were part of the Democratic leadership's "Green the Capitol" initiative. In a letter sent Thursday, Reps. Joe Barton (R-Texas) and John Shimkus (R-Ill.) asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to look into "questionable purchases of carbon offsets" reported this week in The Washington Post.
Republicans are criticizing the venture, which paid farms in the Midwest $89,000 to take steps to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and was intended to compensate for the possible pollution that members of Congress contribute to the environment. Thursday's letter was the second request sent this month to GAO Comptroller General David Walker regarding the carbon offsets purchases from Barton, the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Shimkus, ranking member on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. "The investigation should look at relevant spending authorities, financial controls, and related due-diligence behind the purchases, and whether this taxpayer outlay will actually reduce greenhouse emissions," they said in the letter....
The congressmen's first letter this month, sent on Jan. 14, called the relatively new field of purchasing carbon offsets "good faith transactions," saying there are "no proven safeguard(s)" to make sure offset companies, like the Chicago Climate Exchange that the House used, fulfill their promises. "We don't want carbon offsets to become the 21st century version of snake oil and patent medicine," Barton and Shimkus wrote.
Pielke could have added to his comment below that if the 8 years of recent global temperature stability is too small a slice of time to justify reliable generalizations, the roughly two decades of warming in the late 20th century is also too short a time-period to tell us anything. Yet it is that period which the Greenies have repeatedly hung their hat on.
Last week scientists at the Real Climate blog gave their confirmation bias synapses a workout by explaining that eight years of climate data is meaningless, and people who pay any attention to recent climate trends are "misguided." I certainly agree that we should exhibit cautiousness in interpreting short-duration observations, nonetheless we should always be trying to explain (rather than simply discount) observational evidence to avoid the trap of confirmation bias.
So it was interesting to see IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri exhibit "misguided" behavior when he expressed some surprise about recent climate trends in The Guardian:
Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the U.N. Panel that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, said he would look into the apparent temperature plateau so far this century. "One would really have to see on the basis of some analysis what this really represents," he told Reuters, adding "are there natural factors compensating?" for increases in greenhouse gases from human activities.
He added that sceptics about a human role in climate change delighted in hints that temperatures might not be rising. "There are some people who would want to find every single excuse to say that this is all hogwash," he said.
Ironically, by suggesting that their might be some significance to recent climate trends, Dr. Pachauri has provided ammunition to those very same skeptics that he disparages. Perhaps Real Climate will explain how misguided he is, but somehow I doubt it.
For the record, I accept the conclusions of IPCC Working Group I. I don't know how to interpret climate observations of the early 21st century, but believe that there are currently multiple valid hypotheses. I also think that we can best avoid confirmation bias, and other cognitive traps, by making explicit predictions of the future and testing them against experience. The climate community, or at least its activist wing, studiously avoids forecast verification. It just goes to show, confirmation bias is more a more comfortable state than dissonance -- and that goes for people on all sides of the climate debate.
It is ironic that Europe, which likes to think of itself as the center of environmental correctness and the green revolution, should now be the scene of a sharp political struggle over its ambitious emissions targets. Indeed, few EU proposals have aroused quite such a chorus of complaint and derision. "This is a historic plan to make Europe the first economy on the post-carbon age," EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told the European Parliament.
The EU is to require its 27 member states to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by the year 2020, to ensure that 20 percent of its energy comes from renewable resources like wind and solar. The EU also aims to have biofuels power at least 10 percent of its transport. There will also be a bolstered Emissions Trading Scheme, in which the right to pollute will be auctioned. And if the world's big polluters like the United States and China do not join in, then the EU may either give these emissions trading rights free to European firms, or even apply special "green" tariffs to "dirty" imports.
The predictable results included a strike among Belgian steelworkers, protests from politicians in almost every EU country, storms in the media, angry threats from Washington and other countries, and -- less predictably -- anger from environmental groups.
Europe's Greens pointed out that biofuels may not be the blessing the EU thought it would be. Biofuels can raise food prices by taking up arable land and encourage deforestation. It also seems that when the carbon emissions of the fertilizers and tractors and soil-turning are all included, biofuels can be just as polluting as gasoline. "Most biofuels now appear to be worse for the climate than oil," said Friends of the Earth Europe's Sonja Meister. "The European Commission's failure to act on the many warnings is shockingly irresponsible," said Corporate Europe Observatory spokeswoman Nina Holland.
The Belgian steel workers were equally blunt. "You could call this the first carbon dioxide industrial action," said Fabrice Jacquemart, a spokesman for the FGTB union. "There is something utterly absurd about a policy that creates more unemployment in Europe."
The EU announcement came as Jeroen van der Veer, chief executive officer of Shell Oil, released the startling warning that "the world's current predicament limits our room to maneuver. We are experiencing a step-change in the growth rate of energy demand due to rising population and economic development. After 2015, easily accessible supplies of oil and gas probably will no longer keep up with demand."
These are the opening shots in what will be a long war, as the world fails or succeeds over the course of this century in surmounting the threat of global warming. Barroso claimed these measures would cost less than $100 billion a year, or about 0.5 percent of the EU's gross domestic product. As insurance, he claimed, this was cheap at the price, and the cost of inaction would be many times higher.
That is not the way the media saw it. In Britain, the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph, the Sun, the Daily Express and the Evening Standard all gave prominence to a report by the Open Europe think tank that the EU's drive for renewable energy would cost the average family about $1,500 a year. Others noted the warning from the Greens that the biofuels policy would make things even worse for the world's poorest people in the developing world.
Usually sympathetic to the EU and to environmental causes, the Guardian sniffed that "bits of the plan are disappointing. Why does the EU insist on wasteful biofuels being used for road transport? It is hard to see it as anything other than yet another sop to European farmers."
In Germany, the news magazine Der Spiegel put the headline "A Total Disaster" on its assessment of the EU's biofuels policy. It reported: "Paul J. Crutzen, who won the 1995 Nobel Prize for chemistry, estimates that biodiesel produced from rapeseed can result in up to 70 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels. Corn, the preferred biofuels crop in the U.S., results in 50 percent more emissions, Crutzen estimates."
The United States has already warned of the dangers inherent in a proposal to impose "green tariffs." At last month's meeting in Bali, Indonesia, that agreed a road map to negotiate the next phase of the Kyoto protocol against global warming, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab warned the Europeans that this cold "backfire." "Restricting imports easily leads to covert protectionism, undermining both environment and economic standards," she said. "Trade restrictions that seek to force actions can backfire and lead to tit-for-tat."
The Americans were not the only ones alarmed. Ujal Singh Bhatia, India's ambassador to the World Trade Organization, said: "If the countries imposing such measures invoke GATT provisions to justify them, the dispute settlement mechanism in (the) WTO would face serious challenges and create divisions along North-South lines."
While the EU's intentions were evidently high-minded, the result has been an object lesson in the difficulties the world will face in agreeing on mechanisms to reduce the threat of global warming.
The EU is not the only body that is mulling this kind of "green tariff" to force other countries to abide by tough targets to cut carbon emissions. The U.S. Senate is considering two bills with similar effect. The bills have strong backing from both the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and from the giant American Electric power group. The bills are likely to face similar objections from India and China in the WTO, just as U.S. farm subsidies for the production of ethanol from corn have aroused growing opposition from the Green lobbies.
The award of last year's Nobel Peace Prize to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the scientists of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change symbolized the degree to which there is now a broad consensus that climate change is a realty, that human activity is a major cause and that its implications are so dangerous that dramatic measures will be needed to alleviate its effects. But the reaction to the EU's proposals showed just how hard and contentious that will be.
JOSE Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Council and former prime minister of Portugal, dropped a policy bomb last week. He threatened climate trade war. Europe plans to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by a further 20 per cent by 2020. It would restrict imports from countries that did not do the same thing, specifically the US and China. He called the trade problem the nuclear bomb of the climate change debate.
Australia, no longer a Kyoto recalcitrant and the contributor of a mere 1.5per cent of global emissions, was not mentioned. Furthermore, the Rudd Government has looked approvingly on, but has not yet adopted, the EU target. That is under review. Expect trouble. There are two lessons for Australia from Barroso's bomb blast and bombast.
The first is that the 20 per cent target spells trouble, and the Europeans know it. Participants at an international conference in Sydney last November, hosted by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, heard why.
A German business leader teamed with a researcher from a leading economic institute to explain that the reductions in emissions (about 5 per cent) under the Kyoto Protocol had already led to increases in costs of between 2 per cent and 8 per cent in Germany's cement, steel and aluminium industries. They also reported that German business did not see how it could meet its Government's target to reduce emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 (Germany's contribution to the EU target) and be competitive in global markets.
The EU is anxious. At the UN summit in Bali, it tried to win support not only for the target of 20 per cent cuts in emissions by 2020 but also for the bigger ambition of 60 per cent cuts by 2050. The EU was opposed in all quarters and was not even allowed a passing reference to these targets in the mandate for the new convention to replace the Kyoto Protocol.
Sure, the negotiations have yet to start and the formal position is that everything is on the table. The reality is that the EU is on its own. And with only 25 per cent of the world's emissions (the US, China, India and Japan generate more than half of the world's emissions between them), the EU cannot act as an Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries-style climate change bully.
So, what is Barroso up to? He has brandished trade bans to signal to European industry that it would be protected under cuts in emissions of 20 per cent. It is a fig leaf. World Trade Organisation rules are already antagonistic to environmental trade barriers. The US, China and India would cream the EU in the WTO if it imposed such carbon trade barriers. The European Commission's external trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, understands this and ruled out carbon tariffs in December.
Others in Europe want them. This includes the environment directorate in the European Commission and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who threatened China with carbon tariffs after a visit late last year.
Does Europe have a plan B? Yes, according to the British Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, as reported by The Independent: "The issue of carbon requirement on importers only arises if we were not successful in securing a new (post-Kyoto) agreement." This means it hopes the new agreement will either establish a global system of caps and a trade in carbon permits, like Kyoto, or authorise members to override WTO rules and impose carbon tariffs.
Nobody is quite sure how a system of caps and trade in permits will operate alongside the WTO rules for an open trading system. There is probably a basic philosophical difference. A global cap on emissions is a centrally planned target. Such targets require regulatory controls to secure compliance. WTO rules are specifically designed to prevent the use of such regulation when it controls goods crossing national boundaries.
That's a fundamental point. There is a simpler practicality. Bali demonstrated there is no taste for a global agreement to set global caps. China and India know the caps are a poison pill to their strategies to use growth to eliminate poverty. And you can be certain they would block measures authorising overrides of WTO rules.
The Europeans hope a Hillary Clinton or John McCain administration will see it their way. That is unlikely. Congress will choke on proposals that reduce the competitiveness of US industry. Even if it did not, China, India and other developing countries will not accept global caps in the foreseeable future.
Herein lies the second lesson for Australia. Don't miscalculate along the EU lines. It designed a system to reduce emissions on the assumption the rest of the world would follow suit. Bali showed it won't.
LSU President John Lombardi has blocked plans by the outgoing chancellor of the Baton Rouge campus to join the college "Presidents Climate Commitment" - an agreement to take various steps to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.
Chancellor Sean O'Keefe, whose last day is Friday, had planned Wednesday to commit the campus to efforts to become a more eco-friendly campus before stepping down. He said he was disappointed Lombardi chose to block the efforts of the LSU Environmental Conservation Organization that put a lot of hard work into the effort.
Lombardi said he wanted to take a look at how the commitment affects the flagship campus and if it could involve LSU's other academic campuses. "The document commits the institution to take actions that, while desirable, have significant costs associated with them," Lombardi said in an e-mail response. "Until we can assess these costs and include them within the budget, it would not be appropriate to sign such a pledge. "Also, our commitment to energy efficiency is systemwide, and thus we want to approach these critical issues in a coordinated way," he said.
The climate commitment calls on schools to form task forces to find ways to become more eco-friendly, such as more energy-efficient appliances, less university air travel and greenhouse gas emissions, more public transportation, more recycling and less overall energy consumption. O'Keefe said he does not believe signing on now would have cost LSU any more because the university already is working on ways to be more energy efficient.
O'Keefe resigned recently, not giving specific reasons, but suggesting in his resignation letter that he no longer had the support of Lombardi or the university governing board. O'Keefe said Wednesday that the change in plans is another sign of the philosophical differences with Lombardi that led to his resignation on Jan. 16. He said he had worked with the ECO student members and the university's facilities planning office to see how the climate commitment could seamlessly fit into LSU's master plan.
Hundreds of schools have signed on including Southeastern Conference members such as the University of Tennessee, University of Florida, University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina. Lombardi's last school, the University of Massachusetts, and former LSU Chancellor Mark Emmert's current school, the University of Washington have also signed on.
Using data from eighteen 2000-year-long proxy temperature series from all around the world that were not developed from tree-ring data (which provide significant interpretive challenges), the author (1) smoothed the data in each series with a 30-year running mean, (2) converted the results thereby obtained to anomalies by subtracting the mean of each series from each member of that series, and then (3) derived the final mean temperature anomaly history defined by the eighteen data sets by a simple averaging of the individual anomaly series, a procedure that he rightfully emphasizes is "transparent and simple."
The results obtained by this procedure are depicted in the figure below, where it can be seen, in the words of its creator, that "the mean series shows the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) quite clearly, with the MWP being approximately 0.3øC warmer than 20th century values."
Loehle notes that "the 1995-year reconstruction shown here does not match the famous hockey stick shape," which clearly suggests that one of them is a poorer, and the other a better, representation of the truth. Because of its simplicity and transparency, as well as a host of other reasons described in detail by Loehle -- plus what we have learned since initiating our Medieval Warm Period Record-of-the Week feature -- it is our belief that Loehle's curve is by far the superior of the two in terms of the degree to which it likely approximates the truth.
Note: Minutes after posting this Climate Review, we received an email from Craig Loehle with an attached paper entitled:
Loehle, C. and McCulloch, J.H. 2008. Correction to: A 2000-year global temperature reconstruction based on non-tree ring proxies. Energy & Environment 19: 93-100.
The new paper describes corrections "for various errors and data issues" associated with the Loehle (2007) paper, which leads to the adjusted results depicted in the figure below.
In reference to the new results, Loehle and McCulloch report that the peak value of the MWP (which represents a 29-year-mean) is 0.526øC above the mean of the entire period, which places it 0.412øC above the last reported 29-year-mean value of 0.114øC at 1935 (which includes data through 1949). They then state that "while instrumental data are not strictly comparable, the rise in 29-year-smoothed global data from NASA GISS from 1935-1992 (with data from 1978 to 2006) is 0.34øC," and that "adding this rise to the 1935 reconstructed value, the MWP peak remains 0.07øC above the end of the 20th-century values, though the difference is not significant."
Anyone interested in the intersection of science and politics has to be watching with some amusement and more than a little dismay at the spectacle of professional immolation that the climate science community has engaged in following the release of Senator James Inhofe's list of 400+ climate skeptics. The amusement comes from the fact that everyone involved in this tempest in a teapot seems to be working as hard as possible in ways contrary to their political interests.
From the perspective of Senator Inhofe, by producing such a list he has raised the stakes associated with any scientist going public with any concerns about the scientific consensus on climate change. Not only would announcement of such concerns lead one to risk being associated with one of the most despised politicians in the climate science community, but several climate scientists have taken on as their personal responsibility the chore of personally attacking people who happen to find themselves on the Senator's list. What young scholar would want to face the climate science attack dogs? Of course, those sharing the Senator's political views may not mind being on such a list, but this does nothing more than further politicize climate science.
And this leads to the repugnant behavior of the attack dog climate scientists who otherwise would like to be taken seriously. By engaging in the character assassination of people who happen to find themselves on Senator Inhofe's list they reinforce the absurd notion that scientific claims can be adjudicated solely by head counts and a narrow view of professional qualifications. They can't. (See this enlightening and amusing discussion by Dan Sarewitz of leading experts arguing over who is qualified to comment on climate issues.) But by suggesting that knowledge claims can be judged by credentials the attack dog scientists reinforce an anti-democratic authoritarian streak found in the activist wing of the climate science community. Of course, from the perspective of the activist scientists such attacks may be effective if they dissuade other challenges to orthodoxy, but surely climate scientists deserving of the designation should be encouraging challenges to knowledge claims, rather than excoriating anyone who dares to challenge their beliefs.
I recently chatted with Steve Rayner and Gwyn Prins, authors of the brilliant and provocative essay The Wrong Trousers (PDF), who found themselves , somewhat bizarrely, on Senator Inhofe's list. Neither has expressed anything resembling views challenging claims of human-caused climate change, however they are (rightly) critical of the political approach to climate change embodied by Kyoto. I asked them what they thought about being on the Senator's list. Steve Rayner asked if there was some way to sue the Senator for defamation, tongue only partly in cheek. Gwyn Prins offered the following gem:
I think that pointing out that the mere fact of this funny headcounting is worthy of note: In the Anglo-Saxon witanagemot justice was achieved by oath-swearing so the number and the status of your oath-swearers mattered more than the facts of the matter; and this issue is being adjudicated on both sides - denialists and climate puritans - in just such a manner.
He is right of course, and this brings us to the dismay. The climate science community - or at least its most publicly visible activist wing - seems to be working as hard as possible to undercut the legitimacy and the precarious trust than society provides in support of activities of the broader scientific community. Senator Inhofe is a politician, and plays politics. If activist climate scientists wish to play the Senator's game, then don't be surprised to see common wisdom viewing these activists more as political players than trustworthy experts. If this is correct then maybe the Senator is a bit more astute than given credit for. Ultimately, the mainstream climate science community might share with their activist colleagues the same sort of advice Representative Jim Clyburn (D-SC) offered to former President Bill Clinton - "chill."
On January 31, a two-day barrage of panels dealing with global warming issues concludes at Colorado State University. The sessions are part of an "unprecedented teach-in" taking place around the country coordinated by the Green House Network under the rubric Focus the Nation. But of the fifty CSU profs involved in the discussion, one is conspicuous by his absence.
No, it's not philosophy professor Holmes Rolston, who's hosting a thumbsucker on "The Ethics of Climate Change." No, not Tom Dean, who teaches in something called the Global Social and Sustainable Enterprise Program, and weighs in today on "Economics and Climate Change," nor chem prof Anthony Rappe, who addresses alternative energies, nor writer Laura Pritchett, who tackles the subject of dumpster diving. They're all joining in, but as usual, professor emeritus Bill Gray finds himself, by choice or design, unincluded.
Gray, a forty-year veteran of CSU's atmospheric sciences department and a leading hurricane researcher, is an outspoken skeptic of the manmade global-warming claims advanced by leading climatologists around the world - some of whom happen to be his former students. Gray acknowledges that the climate is changing but suggests that natural processes, including shifts in ocean circulation, are responsible. To review how much heat he's taken over that position, see our 2006 feature "The Skeptic."
The teach-in presentations take manmade climate change, and particularly the insidious role of carbon dioxide in amplifying the greenhouse effect, as established science. Gray demurs, which is probably why you won't find him on the premises. It's too bad; he would have been an ideal panelist for a little give-and-take discussion scheduled for this afternoon, entitled "Doubting Thomases, Friends, Parents: Talking with the Unconvinced."
A rotor blade weighing several tonnes separated from a wind turbine. "This just shouldn't happen. People are walking their dogs in this area!" Those are the words of Hardy Pettersson in N„s [near the southern tip of Sweden's Baltic island of Gotland]. He lives less than one kilometre from the field where a rotor blade separated from a wind turbine last Friday morning. The rotor blade weighing several tonnes created a crater one meter deep on impact.
Last Friday a strong wind was blowing in Gotland. And just before eight o'clock in the morning several people in N„s heard a strange noise. But it took a while, before they realized what had caused it. "It's too fiendish". I could see from the distance that a wing was missing from the turbine. I thought at first it had been taken down. But then we arrived and saw what had really happened, says Hardy Pettersson, who lives less than one kilometer from the wreck site. "It's too fiendish that this can happen. There are after all 300 wings in the area, and people move about everywhere. And it is strange that it takes several days to come out in the news, says Hardy Pettersson.
The wind turbine belongs to a group of nine which was erected in 2002. They are of the type Vestas V52 and generate 850 kilowatt. Each rotor blade is 25 meters long and weighs several tonnes. The rotor blade that separated landed 40 meters from the tower and created a crater one meter deep, before it moved onwards another five meters. The tip of the rotor blade ended up 70 meters from the tower. [Danish manufacturer] Vestas who built the turbine despatched people to the site on Friday in order to check up on whether the remainder of the installation was safe and to gather pieces for their investigation.
"To us it is serious. But to the windmill industry in general it is very serious, says Hans Ljungstrom from Vestasvind Svenska AB. A group of technicians from Denmark are on their way in order to make a report. In the meantime it is hard for me to make comments on what has happened. But I can say that I have never heard of anything like it in Sweden, says Hans Ljungstrom.
In the United States, radical environmentalist and socialist academics have organized a massive, two-day-long (January 30 and 31, 2008), man-made global warming indoctrination effort called "Focus The Nation." See - http://www.focusthenation.org
This two-day event will take place on 1,500 U.S. campuses and indoctrinate hundreds of thousands of students with one-sided climate alarmist propaganda. This propaganda will include the demand to implement an 80% reduction in energy usage by 2050 which they call the annual "2% Solution" to minimize its devastating impact on human existence. There are several university announcements of the planned activities. See here and here and here
No scientists skeptical of the claims of the alarmists or of man-made global warming theory are being allowed to present their views or to debate the propagandists during this event. To illustrate the deceptive language being used for this event, here is a sentence from the Moravian College announcement in Bethlehem, PA,
"The Mayor of Bethlehem and regional experts will talk about what can be done locally to make a difference."
The "regional experts" have been already been identified as, "representatives of Clean Water Action and the Sierra Club." These are radical environmentalist groups.
The purpose of this massive Orwellian effort by the academic "Thought Police" is to produce a generation of indoctrinated "skulls full of mush" who will be willing fight for the abolition of the world's liberal democracies and constitutional republics to make way for authoritarian dictatorships run by climate experts. These dictatorships are viewed as necessary by Dr. David Shearman and Dr. Joseph Wayne Smith in order to save the planet from climate change. The despicable, anti-Enlightenment proposals of Shearman and Smith were discussed by Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. in his 1/23/08 essay "The Authoritarianism of Experts"
In 1940, American President John F. Kennedy wrote a book titled "Why England Slept" on the menace of rising totalitarianism. We need a new book today titled "Why America Slept" on the rising totalitarianism of the climate alarmists.
South Africa is experiencing an energy crisis that has all the dimensions of a national disaster. Last Friday all South Africa's gold, platinum, diamond and some coal mines closed. This was because of the dangers to miners during unexpected power failures. Energy-demanding ventilation and dewatering are critical requirements for our mines. Large energy-consuming aluminium and other smelters have closed down. Tens of thousands of workers are out on the streets. Gold and platinum account for about 25% of South Africa's exports. Losses are estimated to exceed R200 million per day from these sources alone.
Our only energy supplier is the semi-state body Eskom. The mining industry uses 12% of Eskom's capacity, accounts for 7% of the economy, 30% of exports and 25% of foreign exchange earnings.
This is only one of the consequences of the energy crisis. There are many examples of how the crisis is affecting all aspects of life in this country. Our national economy has already been adversely affected. On two occasions I visited local shopping centres. The lights were out, doors were closed, and the staff were waiting in the corridors for the power to come on again.
In order to overcome the problem, the authorities intend imposing severe reductions in electricity use. These will be in place for the next five years at least. The reductions include industries (10%), commercial use (15%), shopping centres and hotels (20%), large office complexes (15%), agriculture (5%) and household use (10%). The target is the reduction of national energy demand by 10% to 15%. No mention is made of the mining sector or of the natural growth in demand.
The relative use of electricity of the various sectors is as follows: households (35%), industry (35%), mining (12%), commercial use (9%), export to neighbouring states (4%), agriculture (3%) and transport (2%). The economies of our neighbouring states will also suffer.
I was directly involved in the imposition of water restrictions during the severe drought of the 1980s. These were very difficult to implement. The control of electricity use will be even more difficult. Voluntary reductions on the required scale will not be achieved. It will take at least a year to implement enforceable measures.
Other long-term measures are proposed. They include the compulsory use of energy-saving light bulbs and the installation of solar water heaters. It is not a coincidence that these restriction measures have long been proposed by climate change activists. They are also the basis for South Africa's support for internationally enforceable and economically damaging greenhouse gas control measures.
Now the South African public will directly experience the consequence of these measures long proposed by climate alarmists. There is little prospect of South Africa meeting its goals of halving unemployment and poverty by 2014. Economists are also predicting that we will not achieve the targeted 6% annual economic growth within the foreseeable future.
The South African authorities have acknowledged that the crisis is the result of not taking heed of warnings issued in 1998 that this would happen if our power generation network was not expanded to meet the growing demand. There is some suspicion that the delay was also the result of pressures from environmental activists.
This is a very good example of what will happen to the fragile economies of other developing countries with large disadvantaged populations. It also demonstrates the consequences when developing countries are forced to comply with compulsory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions imposed by developed counties such as the EU for example.
The UK sent Nicholas Stern and David King to South Africa in order to persuade the South African authorities to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to persuade other developing counties to follow suite. Now we see the result.
New information is leading to a controversial shift in thinking on the impact of global warming on ocean circulation, partly due to the work of a UA researcher. The scientific community has long believed that as global warming continues and large amounts of freshwater ice melt into the ocean, the ocean's circulation will slow. This would have a catastrophic impact on the environment as vividly, if somewhat overdramatically, portrayed in the film "The Day After Tomorrow." But a paper published last week in Nature magazine, the result of several studies of past and possible future weather, says that in fact the very opposite is true and ocean circulation will become stronger as the icecaps melt.
"We missed what was right in front of our eyes," said Joellen Russell, assistant professor of biogeochemical dynamics at the University of Arizona and co-author of the paper. She was at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University before coming to the UA two years ago, and spent several years studying and creating models for what weather will be like as global warming continues.
For this study, she and co-author J.R. Toggweiler "pulled all that research together" to conclude that wind pushes the ocean currents and that warming temperatures will increase the speed of these currents. The westerlies, also known as the trade winds, are the main wind in the middle latitudes of both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Observing that the winds have been migrating toward their respective poles for 40 years, Russell and Toggweiler realized this could be the explanation of how the last ice age ended 18,000 years ago. "The question of how atmospheric CO2 and the carbon cycle varied during the ice ages is the big mystery in the field," Toggweiler said.
As the westerlies move, the ocean's circulation increases, releasing more carbon dioxide from the deep ocean, leading to more warming and even stronger circulation in a feedback loop strong enough to push Earth out of an ice age. It also has a local effect. The westerlies "are how we get water in the winter," said Russell, and with their movement, the weather will go from "occasional winter storms to not very many at all. Our rain will end up in Oregon." This will become more noticeable during the next few decades. Previous models had placed the path of the westerlies in the wrong spot to begin with, making any predictions erroneous from the start. "The new model gets it just about right," Russell said.
Early weather models were based on the idea that ocean circulation was based on wind only for the surface and on buoyancy for deeper circulation. So adding freshwater to the ocean as the Earth warms would lead to less movement of ocean. Now, however, oceanographers mostly agree that it is only wind that has a major effect on ocean circulation.
Evidence from the most recent ice age, which reached its coldest 21,000 years ago, shows that the ocean had very little movement and exchange of deep water and surface water until the warming of the Earth about 18,000 years ago. "The evidence is piling up," that those models predicting a weakened ocean circulation in the coming decades are wrong, Russell said.
The increasing speed of the westerlies and their movement toward the poles "should stir the ocean's salty and fresh waters around and minimize the effect of the polar freshening," Toggweiler said.
Still, the idea that the ocean's circulation will increase as the Earth warms is not fully accepted by scientists. "It's controversial, but it explains what happened in the past and what is happening now," Toggweiler said. The mounting evidence has won the new theory a lot of converts, Toggweiler said. "We were lucky to publish first," Russell said. "This is what science is all about," Toggweiler said. "Looking for where the common wisdom is wrong."
Climate models predict that the ocean's circulation will weaken in response to global warming, but the warming at the end of the last ice age suggests a different outcome.
There is an old truism in climate circles that the cold climate at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which occurred 21,000 years ago, had stronger winds. This idea fits with the common observation that it is windier in the winter than in the summer because there is greater thermal contrast within the atmosphere in the winter hemisphere. Temperature reconstructions from the LGM show that Equator-to-pole gradients in sea surface temperature were indeed larger - that is, the polar oceans were colder than the tropical ocean at the LGM in comparison with the temperature differences today.
It is now becoming clear that the winds in the atmosphere drive most of the circulation in the ocean. If the LGM climate really did have stronger winds, it would thus be expected that the circulation in the ocean was more vigorous. The oceans seem to tell a different story, however. The deep water in the ocean's interior is continuously being replaced ('overturned') by surface waters from the poles. This overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean seems to have been weaker at the LGM1. The water in the deep ocean was also very 'old' in relation to the atmosphere - in terms of having a low radiocarbon content - indicating that the ocean's interior was poorly mixed and poorly ventilated2. The overturning circulation then seems to have strengthened as Earth began to warm about 18,000 years ago. The increased overturning vented the radiocarbon-depleted carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, as seen in a pair of big dips in the radiocarbon activity of the atmosphere and upper ocean3. This addition of CO2 to the atmosphere helped to warm the climate and bring the last ice age to an end.
These findings present a conundrum. If the winds were stronger in the cold glacial state and became weaker going into the warm interglacial state, then why was the ocean's circulation weaker during the cold glacial period? And how did it increase in strength during the transition to the warm interglacial period, causing the ocean's interior to become better mixed and better ventilated? Are researchers missing something about the factors that affect ocean circulation, or is it the old truism about the strength of the winds during the cold glacial period that is flawed?
During the 1990s, the first generation of coupled climate models predicted that the ocean's overturning circulation would weaken markedly over the next 100-200 years in response to global warming4. The predicted weakening is a response to the warming itself and to a stronger hydrological cycle, both of which make the ocean surface waters in the models less dense and less able to sink in relation to the water below. Thus, the models suggested that circulation would be less vigorous in a warming climate, somewhat like the weakening expected from diminished winds in a warmer climate outlined above. But again, the real ocean became better mixed and better ventilated when Earth began to warm about 18,000 years ago. So what will happen to the ocean's circulation in a warming climate? Are the models getting it wrong?
Until recently, the circulation of the ocean was thought to comprise two fairly independent parts. The wind-driven circulation drove the surface currents in the ocean gyres, whereas the overturning circulation ventilated the interior with cold and relatively saline water from the poles. The latter was called the 'thermohaline' circulation to emphasize that it was driven by buoyancy forces - warming, cooling, freshening and salinification - rather than the stress on the surface coming from the winds.
The inconsistencies mentioned earlier could be overlooked if this dichotomy holds, because the winds and the wind-driven circulation in the upper ocean could still have been stronger during the LGM while the thermohaline circulation was less vigorous. However, the dichotomy and the use of the term 'thermohaline' have almost disappeared from the oceanographic literature, because the circulation in the interior is now increasingly seen as being driven by turbulent mixing from the winds and tides5, 6 and directly by the winds themselves7.
The westerly winds over the Southern Ocean seem to be crucial in this regard7. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is a wind-driven current that goes around Antarctica through an east-west channel between South America, Australia and Antarctica that is not blocked by land. Because the winds over the channel and the flow of the ACC are aligned for the length of the channel, the ACC is easily the world's strongest current (by volume of water transported). According to Carl Wunsch8, about 70% of the wind energy going into ocean currents globally goes directly into the ACC.
The same dense water found in the interior north of the ACC is also found just below the surface around Antarctica, and the westerly winds driving the ACC draw this dense water directly up to the surface (Fig. 1). In this way, the winds driving the ACC continually remove dense water from the interior. Dense water must sink elsewhere to replace the water drawn up by the winds around Antarctica. [...]
Anthropogenic additions of CO2 to the atmosphere have resulted in a stronger hydrological cycle and a warming of the upper ocean that are currently threatening to weaken the ocean's overturning circulation. However, larger differences in temperature in the middle of the atmosphere have given rise to stronger winds that are acting to strengthen the circulation, as we argue they did at the end of the last ice age. What is uncertain is whether stronger winds and a stronger circulation will counter the freshening and distribute the extra heat through the interior over the next 200 years.
Current climate-system models say that the ocean's overturning circulation will weaken over the next century19, but these predictions might not rest on a solid foundation. The early climate models were deficient because they understated the effects of the winds in general and failed to anticipate the poleward shift and the intensification of the westerlies over the past 40 years. The latest models are much improved but might still not fully represent the wind effect.
A key test for the models is to reproduce the changes that took place at the end of the last ice age. Does the oceanic circulation in the models get weak enough in a cold LGM-like state to bottle up so much CO2? More importantly, can the weaker circulation make the CO2 in the deep ocean very old with respect to the radiocarbon activity in the atmosphere2? Can the circulation then get strong enough to let all the radiocarbon-depleted CO2 back out? From the observations, it is clear that large circulation changes took place, and it seems unlikely that circulation changes of this magnitude could have happened without substantial changes in the wind forcing. It seems that the information from the past is telling us to expect a stronger oceanic circulation in the warmer climate to come.
Paper companies have warned that the rising cost of raw materials and the introduction of an EU CO2 carbon emission trading scheme will raise prices and kill off profits.
The Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) said the trading scheme will take œ750m out of the European paper industry, effectively wiping out its annual profits.
It described it as the "first direct EU tax in history", as it even stipulates how the monies raised should be spent by member states.
"[The draft legislation] will generate up to œ55bn per year in 2020, as the impact assessment shows. This will see the largest amount of money being taken out of the EU economy ever, unprecedented in scale and impact," it said in a statement.
According to Finland's Pellervo Economic Research Institute, the European Commission's draft CO2 emission quota trading legislation will cause price hikes of between 6% and 12% when it comes into effect in 2013. It said the trading scheme would drive energy costs up by as much as 45%.
Britain's stupid Green/Left: "Only three "sustainable" homes built in UK so far. Gordon Brown's dream of "eco-towns" with tens of thousands of homes powered by wind and solar power has failed to grip the public's imagination. Officials have confirmed that only three low-carbon homes are being built in the UK. The Prime Minister made the plan for 100,000 sustainable homes a key element of his pitch for the Labour Party leadership last summer. But individuals have failed to match the Government's enthusiasm for cutting household emissions. Only three households have taken advantage of a tax-break for all new zero-carbon homes, the Treasury revealed last week. The Treasury minister, Jane Kennedy, said the Government expects the number of applications to increase "as more properties eligible to claim the relief go on the market".
After much reading in the relevant literature, the following conclusions seem warranted to me. You should find evidence for all of them appearing on this blog from time to time:
The Greenie message is entirely emotional and devoid of all logic. They say that polar ice will melt and cause a big sea-level rise. Yet 91% of the world's glacial ice is in Antarctica, where the average temperature is around minus 40 degrees Celsius. The melting point of ice is zero degrees. So for the ice to melt on any scale the Antarctic temperature would need to rise by around 40 degrees, which NOBODY is predicting. The median Greenie prediction is about 4 degrees. So where is the huge sea level rise going to come from? Mars? And the North polar area is mostly sea ice and melting sea ice does not raise the sea level at all. Yet Warmists constantly hail any sign of Arctic melting. That the melting of floating ice does not raise the water level is known as Archimedes' principle. Archimedes demonstrated it around 2,500 years ago. That Warmists have not yet caught up with that must be just about the most inspissated ignorance imaginable. The whole Warmist scare defies the most basic physics. Sadly, what the Vulgate says in John 1:5 is still only very partially true: "Lux in tenebris lucet". There is still much darkness in the minds of men.
The repeated refusal of Warmist "scientists" to make their raw data available to critics is such a breach of scientific protocol that it amounts to a confession in itself. Note, for instance Phil Jones' Feb 21, 2005 response to Warwick Hughes' request for his raw climate data: "We have 25 years or so invested in the work. Why should I make the data available to you, when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it?" Looking for things that might be wrong with a given conclusion is of course central to science. But Warmism cannot survive such scrutiny.
Most Greenie causes are at best distractions from real environmental concerns (such as land degradation) and are more motivated by a hatred of people than by any care for the environment
Global warming has taken the place of Communism as an absurdity that "liberals" will defend to the death regardless of the evidence showing its folly. Evidence never has mattered to real Leftists
‘Global warming’ has become the grand political narrative of the age, replacing Marxism as a dominant force for controlling liberty and human choices. -- Prof. P. Stott
The modern environmental movement arose out of the wreckage of the New Left. They call themselves Green because they're too yellow to admit they're really Reds. So Lenin's birthday was chosen to be the date of Earth Day. Even a moderate politician like Al Gore has been clear as to what is needed. In "Earth in the Balance", he wrote that saving the planet would require a "wrenching transformation of society".
For centuries there was a scientific consensus which said that fire was explained by the release of an invisible element called phlogiston. That theory is universally ridiculed today. Global warming is the new phlogiston.
Motives: Many people would like to be kind to others so Leftists exploit that with their nonsense about equality. Most people want a clean, green environment so Greenies exploit that by inventing all sorts of far-fetched threats to the environment. But for both, the real motive is generally to promote themselves as wiser and better than everyone else, truth regardless.
Policies: The only underlying theme that makes sense of all Greenie policies is hatred of people. Hatred of other people has been a Greenie theme from way back. In a report titled "The First Global Revolution" (1991, p. 104) published by the "Club of Rome", a Greenie panic outfit, we find the following statement: "In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill.... All these dangers are caused by human intervention... The real enemy, then, is humanity itself." See here for many more examples of prominent Greenies saying how much and how furiously they hate you.
The conventional wisdom of the day is often spectacularly wrong. The most popular and successful opera of all time is undoubtedly "Carmen" by Georges Bizet. Yet it was much criticized when first performed and the unfortunate Bizet died believing that it was a flop. Similarly, when the most iconic piece of 20th century music was first performed in 1913-- Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" -- half the audience walked out. Those of us who defy the conventional wisdom about climate are actually better off than that. Unlike Bizet and Stravinsky in 1913, we KNOW that we will eventually be vindicated -- because all that supports Warmism is a crumbling edifice of guesswork ("models").
Al Gore won a political prize for an alleged work of science. That rather speaks for itself, doesn't it?
I am not a global warming skeptic nor am I a global warming denier. I am a global warming atheist. I don't believe one bit of it. That the earth's climate changes is undeniable. Only ignoramuses believe that climate stability is normal. But I see NO evidence to say that mankind has had anything to do with any of the changes observed -- and much evidence against that claim.
Seeing that we are all made of carbon, the time will come when people will look back on the carbon phobia of the early 21st century as too incredible to be believed
The intellectual Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) must have foreseen Global Warmism. He said: "The object in life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane."
The Holy Grail for most scientists is not truth but research grants. And the global warming scare has produced a huge downpour of money for research. Any mystery why so many scientists claim some belief in global warming?
For many people, global warming seems to have taken the place of "The Jews" -- a convenient but false explanation for any disliked event. Prof. Brignell has some examples.
Global warming skeptics are real party-poopers. It's so wonderful to believe that you have a mission to save the world.
There is an "ascetic instinct" (or perhaps a "survivalist instinct") in many people that causes them to delight in going without material comforts. Monasteries and nunneries were once full of such people -- with the Byzantine stylites perhaps the most striking example. Many Greenies (other than Al Gore and his Hollywood pals) have that instinct too but in the absence of strong orthodox religious committments they have to convince themselves that the world NEEDS them to live in an ascetic way. So their personal emotional needs lead them to press on us all a delusional belief that the planet needs "saving".
"In science, refuting an accepted belief is celebrated as an advance in knowledge; in religion it is condemned as heresy". (Bob Parks, Physics, U of Maryland). No prizes for guessing how global warming skepticism is normally responded to.
"The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority, as such. For him, scepticism is the highest of duties; blind faith the one unpardonable sin." -- Thomas H. Huxley
Time was, people warning the world "Repent - the end is nigh!" were snickered at as fruitcakes. Now they own the media and run the schools.
"One of the sources of the Fascist movement is the desire to avoid a too-rational and too-comfortable world" -- George Orwell, 1943 in Can Socialists Be Happy?
Against the long history of huge temperature variation in the earth's climate (ice ages etc.), the .6 of one degree average rise reported by the U.N. "experts" for the entire 20th century (a rise so small that you would not be able to detect such a difference personally without instruments) shows, if anything, that the 20th century was a time of exceptional temperature stability.
Recent NASA figures tell us that there was NO warming trend in the USA during the 20th century. If global warming is occurring, how come it forgot the USA?
Warmists say that the revised NASA figures do not matter because they cover only the USA -- and the rest of the world is warming nicely. But it is not. There has NEVER been any evidence that the Southern hemisphere is warming. See here. So the warming pattern sure is looking moth-eaten.
There goes another beautiful theory about to be murdered by a brutal gang of facts. - Duc de La Rochefoucauld, French writer and moralist (1613-1680)
The latest scare is the possible effect of extra CO2 on the world’s oceans, because more CO2 lowers the pH of seawater. While it is claimed that this makes the water more acidic, this is misleading. Since seawater has a pH around 8.1, it will take an awful lot of CO2 it to even make the water neutral (pH=7), let alone acidic (pH less than 7).
In fact, ocean acidification is a scientific impossibility. Henry's Law mandates that warming oceans will outgas CO2 to the atmosphere (as the UN's own documents predict it will), making the oceans less acid. Also, more CO2 would increase calcification rates. No comprehensive, reliable measurement of worldwide oceanic acid/base balance has ever been carried out: therefore, there is no observational basis for the computer models' guess that acidification of 0.1 pH units has occurred in recent decades.
The chaos theory people have told us for years that the air movement from a single butterfly's wing in Brazil can cause an unforeseen change in our weather here. Now we are told that climate experts can "model" the input of zillions of such incalculable variables over periods of decades to accurately forecast global warming 50 years hence. Give us all a break!
If you doubt the arrogance [of the global warming crowd, you haven't seen that Newsweek cover story that declared the global warming debate over. Consider: If Newton's laws of motion could, after 200 years of unfailing experimental and experiential confirmation, be overthrown, it requires religious fervor to believe that global warming -- infinitely more untested, complex and speculative -- is a closed issue
A "geriatric" revolt: The scientists who reject Warmism tend to be OLD! Your present blogger is one of those. There are tremendous pressures to conformity in academe and the generally Leftist orientation of academe tends to pressure everyone within it to agree to ideas that suit the Left. And Warmism is certainly one of those ideas. So old guys are the only ones who can AFFORD to declare the Warmists to be unclothed. They either have their careers well-established (with tenure) or have reached financial independence (retirement) and so can afford to call it like they see it. In general, seniors in society today are not remotely as helpful to younger people as they once were. But their opposition to the Warmist hysteria will one day show that seniors are not completely irrelevant after all. Experience does count (we have seen many such hysterias in the past and we have a broader base of knowledge to call on) and our independence is certainly an enormous strength. Some of us are already dead. (Reid Bryson and John Daly are particularly mourned) and some of us are very senior indeed (e.g. Bill Gray and Vince Gray) but the revolt we have fostered is ever growing so we have not labored in vain.
Scientists have politics too -- sometimes extreme politics. Read this: "This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism... I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child." -- Albert Einstein
The "precautionary principle" is a favourite Greenie idea -- but isn't that what George Bush was doing when he invaded Iraq? Wasn't that a precaution against Saddam getting or having any WMDs? So Greenies all agree with the Iraq intervention? If not, why not?
The Lockwood & Froehlich paper was designed to rebut Durkin's "Great Global Warming Swindle" film. It is a rather confused paper -- acknowledging yet failing to account fully for the damping effect of the oceans, for instance -- but it is nonetheless valuable to climate atheists. The concession from a Greenie source that fluctuations in the output of the sun have driven climate change for all but the last 20 years (See the first sentence of the paper) really is invaluable. And the basic fact presented in the paper -- that solar output has in general been on the downturn in recent years -- is also amusing to see. Surely even a crazed Greenie mind must see that the sun's influence has not stopped and that reduced solar output will soon start COOLING the earth! Unprecedented July 2007 cold weather throughout the Southern hemisphere might even have been the first sign that the cooling is happening. And the fact that warming plateaued in 1998 is also a good sign that we are moving into a cooling phase. As is so often the case, the Greenies have got the danger exactly backwards. See my post of 7.14.07 and very detailed critiques here and here and here for more on the Lockwood paper and its weaknesses.
As the Greenies are now learning, even strong statistical correlations may disappear if a longer time series is used. A remarkable example from Sociology: "The modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by Arthur Raper titled The Tragedy of Lynching. Raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the South and on the price of an acre’s yield of cotton. He calculated the correla­tion coefficient between the two series at –0.532. In other words, when the economy was doing well, the number of lynchings was lower.... In 2001, Donald Green, Laurence McFalls, and Jennifer Smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi­tions and lynchings in Raper’s data. Raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal­ysis in 1929. After the Great Depression hit, the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi­tions deteriorated, yet lynchings continued to fall. The correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added." So we must be sure to base our conclusions on ALL the data. In the Greenie case, the correlation between CO2 rise and global temperature rise stopped in 1998 -- but that could have been foreseen if measurements taken in the first half of the 20th century had been considered.
Relying on the popular wisdom can even hurt you personally: "The scientific consensus of a quarter-century ago turned into the arthritic nightmare of today."

Maybe it's the after-effect of my just spending a week in the hospital but it seems to me that medical practitioners may be gradually starting to talk with their patients more. Two years ago, when I had an even longer stay in the same hospital, the doctors and nurses seemed to be far more interested in conversing only among themselves and when they spoke with patients, they used the well-known, in-group medical jargon that tends to isolate them from the rest of us non-medical types. But this time they actually spoke understandable prose to me most of the time, cheerfully explaining what was going on with my body. They also spent what seemed to me to be a great deal of time talking about lots of other things, small talk I guess. It would appear, based only on my admittedly small sample of participant observation, that the medical field may be discovering actual CONVERSATION.
Why was my hospitalization so different this time? Maybe it was because I had different attendants. Or maybe this time my floor had a bunch of easy cases for personnel to deal with. But I suspect that this new relaxed and informal experience had something to do with the fact that my hospital now has a new breed of physicians called "hospitalists."This is a new word in my vocabulary but when I checked google, I found 817,000 references to it, showing how slow I am to catch on I guess. Hospitalists are physicians who've decided that they want to lead a real life, just like other people, replacing their old grind of seeing patients all day in the office, being called at all hours, and visiting their patients in the hospital (definition here). My own internist quit his practice a year ago to become a hospitalist in a nearby city. My smallish hospital now has six of these, each working 12 hour shifts with the rest of the week free to lead their personal lives. They are never on call because other hospitalists take over when they're off-duty. They say that they now can lead a real life and, in my opinion, this makes them more fully human, capable even of engaging in CONVERSATIONS with patients.
The hospitalist who stopped by my room twice a day spent far more time with me than any other doctor ever has. She took time to explain my procedures in clear, non-technical English, discussed how she got into the medical field, showed me photos of my intestines that were taken during my procedure, took care of my medication needs, sympathized with my boring diet of jello and chicken broth, talking about hiking with her husband in the mountains, and joked about the irony of giving me new blood while at the same time drawing some of it out during my innumerable blood test monitorings. We even discussed a little politics. When the day of my release came, she saw to it that I didn't have to wait around all day to get release papers signed. I was out of there by 10 a.m.Two years ago it took until 3 p.m. to get this simple task accomplished.
What I noticed most, however, was the increased amount of CONVERSATION that took place during my stay. Nurses, phlebotomists, aides, all talked as much as I wanted them to. They seemed to have the time. And they were even interesting. The old tensions caused by waking up doctors in the middle of the night for changes in pain medication didn't seem to be present any more. The hospitalist took over. She seemed to be around all the time. The overall feeling of the place was far more relaxed, something that can be very encouraging to patients. At least it was for me.
Maybe one thing that medical practice has needed all along was a redistribution of authority. The "doctor as God" idea definitely needed to change. Sharing responsibility for patient care with another doctor may be one answer to the stressful life that caused my own excellent internist to quit his practice. All I know is that this hospital is not the impersonal, stressful, and frenzied place that it was two years ago. Personnel now seem to have the time and inclination actually to carry on extended CONVERSATIONS with their patients. And when this happens, there doesn't seem to be the need for using shorthand jargon with patients. Most of all though, it was just nice to be talked with once in a while.

Are your eyeglasses streaky and smudged no matter how often you clean them? Try these tips to help keep them clear and smudge-free.
If you're watching your favorite TV show, you may not want to make a trip to the bathroom or kitchen just because you noticed a smudge on your glasses. After all, why miss a key scene when the bottom of your shirt will get rid of that smudge or smear?
Cleaning your glasses without any water can end up worsening the smudge or may even damage the lenses. Your shirt may feel perfectly smooth to you, but might actually contain rough fibers that can scratch your lenses. Clothing also tends to trap dirt. When you rub the fabric across your glasses, you not only transfer the dirt to your lenses, but also grind it into them, potentially damaging the glass or coatings.
Your glasses aren't the first thing you need to clean. Dirt and natural body oils will be deposited on your lenses if you don't wash your hands first. After you wash your hands, rinse your lenses under lukewarm water to remove dirt and debris.
Place a drop of dishwashing liquid on each lens after you rinse your glasses. Gently rub the lenses to distribute the liquid on each side, then rinse them again. Stay away from dishwashing liquids that promise to keep your hands soft. These varieties contain moisturizer that will only worsen smudges and streaks on your glasses.
Glasses may look like little windows, but they're much more susceptible to damage than windows. Don't use window cleaner, ammonia or any other cleaning products you find under your kitchen sink to clean your glasses.
Do you focus solely on the lenses when you clean your glasses and forget about the other parts? Ear pieces and nose pads can retain body oils and may eventually smell a little unpleasant if you neglect to keep them clean too. The next time you clean your glasses, devote a few extra seconds to cleaning the frames, temples, arms and nose pads.
Hold your glasses under a stream of lukewarm water to rinse every trace of dishwashing liquid from them. If you just quickly pass them under the water, you may notice streaks due to residue from the dishwashing liquid. Use soft cotton or microfiber cloths to dry your glasses. Microfiber cloths are often provided when you pick up your new eyeglasses. If you don't see a cloth in your new eyeglass case, be sure to ask your eye care specialist for one.
Paper towels, bath towels and other items may scratch your lenses and shouldn't be used to dry them. Although tissues may feel soft, they often contain rough fibers, just like your clothing. Drying your glasses with a tissue can also increase smudging if the tissue contains lotion.
Cleaning cloths eventually get dirty. Wash your cloth regularly to ensure that it doesn't transfer dirt or dust on to your glasses.
Many of us place our glasses on our nightstands while we sleep. While this is certainly convenient, it exposes your glasses to floating dust particles. When your glasses aren't on your face, keep them in a hard case. The case will not only help you keep your glasses cleaner, but will also prevent damage if you happen to knock them off your nightstand during the night.
Proper cleaning techniques extend the life of your eyeglasses and help you enjoy excellent vision. If it's been a year since your last visit, or your vision has changed, give us a call. We'll examine your eyes, provide you with a new prescription and help you find the ideal frames to accentuate your face.

I am a huge fan of this little table. It coordinates with a more expensive piece. When I asked the maker to custom-build an occasional table, his price was more than 10x the price of this one. So, of course, I went with this one. It is very sturdy and attractive. The wood grain is nice, and it has a little rope detail around the lower edge of the table top. The color in the photo is about right.
Great construction and looks very nice, especially the color is a light caramel and goes great with burlwood furniture. Overall design and quality is nice and I have had for over two years and it still looks new because of the good sealant they put on the wood. I would definately recommend.
This is a nice tall table, with great finishes, and a fairly easy process to assemble. I say fairly easy because some alignments had to be tweaked a bit to make it all work, but it was pretty simple to figure out and I’m not a brilliant craftsman by any means. I use it in the corner of my living room as an accent table with a tall floral arrangement on top. It would also make an intimate high table with a couple of chairs for drinks or snacks. One thing is for sure…..it is sturdy and well finished.

These classes will challenge students to go beyond their grade level education and pursue higher level learning in the fields of Biology and Chemistry and Physics. Students as young as middle school are challenged to study high school level material and content through weekly lectures and reading assignments.The purpose of these classes is to teach Biology and Chemistry and Physics at the introductory high school level and thus prepare them for the respective SAT II subject tests.
The class will function similar to a college course with one lecture a week, weekly in-class assignments, exams, and reading homework. The lectures will last approximately 90 minutes and will include 30 minutes of activities and exercises to ensure that the student fully understands the topics.While this may seem rigorous,students will utilize online web simulations, virtual reality software and online labs so that they are fully engaged and attentive throughout the duration of the course. Lab experiments will typically be conducted in groups or pairs so students may need to work together to get certain assignments done.
Progress reports will be handed out throughout the course so that students and their parents will be able to follow along and track their progress and performance in the class. Conferences are available on request by parents if a child’s performance is not meeting the base standards.Progress reports will include not only the child’s performance but the class averages as well so the student may see where he stands. The grades will be based off of a normal distribution curve so students who score well above the average (even if the average is very low) will receive a good grade. There will be regrade requests available for both the assignments and exams if a student feels that there were mistakes in the grading. There will be a cumulative Final exam at the end of the course to ensure that the student has thoroughly grasped all the concepts taught throughout the class. Students will be handed a manual for each Unit that will contain all the readings that they will need to complete.
Students should bring a writing utensil, a binder and their manual to every class. Phones should beeither silenced or turned off during the lectures There will be work in and out ofclass as students are expected to put in the effort to do the readings aswell as the corresponding homework. While review will be conducted in class,it is important that students study for exams as will since each exam willoften cover a substantial amount of content.

Many years ago, before the advent of internet, mapping, satnav and all the other assistive technologies that we rely on, taking a long journey involved a long hard look at a road atlas and a lot of staring at signs. On one particular trip from the Stranraer ferry down to Cheshire I encountered a rather assertive traffic attendant. He certainly wasn’t part of the police force, but he seemed to think that directing traffic through the then not bypassed Dumfries gave him some sort of authority.
As I approached the junction which this attendant was managing I had a choice of two lanes, and a signpost to consider. Of course I chose one lane, and then, as I read the sign, very quickly switched to the correct lane. No sooner had I done this than the attendant put out his hand to stop me. He made a hand signal for me to wind down my window, and as I complied he lowered his head to my level and uttered these words.
I trust he was referring simply to my driving and not offering a metaphor for life, but in an ever changing IT landscape does it have a ring of truth?
I’ve recently been considering software/hardware stacks for a new project. In many ways the project is green field – all the options are open. But, there’s never a green field because developers, infrastructure managers, project managers and more all come with a wealth of experience. I know that if you can learn to code in one language you will be able to pick up another one, but the more aspects of a project you change, the more everyone is going to have to learn before even starting the project.
Software development has fashions and trends, just like every aspect of life, and everyone wants to jump on the shiny new stack of the moment. There are so many options out there that it’s difficult which few to use as an example, so I won’t. But I have been investigating, both reading up on what the benefits of each stack are, and how straightforward it will be to install, configure and develop against.
My conclusion? Look to the future, but don’t forget they legacy, and don’t discount the experience that your team has already gained. Do you have someone with SQL Server experience, but less understanding of the nuts and bolts of MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL – then use SQL Server, providing your infrastructure allows. If you’re using the Windows environment, then IIS is more likely to be a good fit than Apache, but both do the job well – don’t get hung up on it.
Server side and client side environments can be more flexible. You can run PHP, Node.js on Windows or Linux. Javascript of course runs client side and so is independent of your infrastructure choices. Again, if you’ve got a wealth of PHP talent, feel free to use it if it can do the job. But do consider the benefits of using a more modern language, and the cost in time and training against the improvements to development time, code usability, future proofing that moving on might bring.
For most development projects the crucial factor is doing the business analysis well before writing a line of code. The more time spent understanding the systems to be built, the faster it will be built, and the more likely it is to work first time. So, leverage existing experience and don’t get caught up in platform wars. Choose your lane and stick to it until a sign tells you otherwise. But work hard at understanding the system before you touch your code, or choose your environment, and then you’ll be halfway to building that system the best way you can.

ST. PAUL (AP) -- A third of Minnesota state parks could see their hours and services reduced under Republican-backed environmental bills approved by the Minnesota House and Senate.
DNR officials say up to 10 parks might have to be "mothballed" until state finances improve, if the bills become law.
Under the plan, the parks would remain open but campgrounds and buildings probably would be closed and unstaffed.
DFLers accused Republicans of breaking faith with Minnesotans who've favored environmental spending.
Senate Environment and Natural Resources chairman Bill Ingebrigtsen defends the cuts. The Alexandria Republican says making "difficult choices" today will ensure "a vibrant Minnesota outdoors tomorrow."

Several non-Muslims have responded (A13, subscription required) to Tahir Q's letter (lower half) about the article about Quranic criticism. I couldn't have said what they say any more articulately, so here are the best excerpts from each letter. Bold text is mine.
[Tahir's] peremptory tone...demonstrates precisely what is wrong with Islam and its "hands off" attitude toward scholarship. No religion is perfect, even as the primary texts of all major religions preach and teach the messages of virtue, love, compassion and peace. But some are more perfect than others. (oops, Animal Farm reference)
Many of the key texts of my religion -- Hinduism -- have been respectfully subjected to critical analysis by Western scholars -- without arousing...the wrath of its practitioners. The Bible is believed by many to be God's words, yet Western scholars (Jewish and Christian) have not shied away from delving critically into the Old Testament and the New. Why exactly is it so objectionable for Islam and the Quran to be studied the same way? Yes, why? If you have a good reason, comment on it. Understanding and respect for other religions can be advanced only through rational discourse, not blind faith in the literal truth of the text... There are a few slightly disturbing connotations in that last sentence, notably "literal." Which meaning does he mean? "The-author-said-what-s/he-meant-to-say," or "no-metaphors-allowed"?
Maybe that is exactly the problem: Muslims interpreting the Quran for themselves. Maybe it is time for "Westerner scholars" to get involved. Islamic terrorists have carried out thousands of deadly terror attacks since 9/11. And you wonder why Westerners have shown a level of hostility toward Muhammad and the Quran and Islam when compared with other faiths? You basically answered your own question. Take out at least one "maybe," and it'll be even better.
Is he joking? Over the past quarter-century, literally thousands of innocent men, women, and children of practically all faiths have been murdered in the name of Muhammad, the Quran, and Islam, while the majority of Muslims either openly celebrated such acts or quietly stood by without condemning them. If any religion needs a reformation to bring it in line with modernity, it is Islam...
...Really? In America, the law guarantees one the right to practice any religion one chooses. On the other hand, laws based on Shariah consign non-Muslim people to inferior status. Christians living in Muslim nations are continuously harassed, threatened and even jailed for "converting" Muslims. Name a teddy bear after the prophet, and you will also go to jail, no matter if you're on a selfless humanitarian mission... [emphasis in original]
Mr. Qureshi's response to study and interpretation of the Quran clearly characterizes the shortcomings of Islam -- lack of intellectual dynamism, curiosity, self criticism, inclusiveness and tolerance -- all demonstrated in his brief, articulate letter. And this one was even shorter!

ВЕНЕЦИАНСКИЙ КАРНАВАЛ — ежегодный костюмированный праздник. Его основные атрибуты — костюмы и маски, за которыми скрывались для совершения безрассудных, смелых, а порой и неблаговидных поступков. Традиционные венецианские маски имели как практическое, так и атрибутивно-символическое значение, их делали из кожи или папье-маше.
Just because your living room is verging on the small side, it doesn’t mean that you should hide away all your favourite belongings in storage. If you have objects that are worthy of showing off then display them along an open shelf, above the sofa. This idea is great for when floor space is at a premium.
While banishing clutter might help a smaller living room feel more open, if you’re a fan of the cosy, lived-in look such a pared back scheme will do little for you. But small doesn’t have to mean bare and characterless. Try the classic combination of dark leather armchair and traditional fireplace – there’s nothing like it for creating a warm, cosy environment. Add much-loved items and accessories – in an interesting, character-filled scheme, no one will be thinking about how small the room is.

This feature examines titles old and new. Our fall installment focuses on Connecticut places and personalities. Read on!
New England isn’t typically the region you think of when you consider sports rivalries. The recent World Series victories by the Boston Red Sox seem to have cooled their once heated rivalry with the New York Yankees. And it’s debatable whether the contest between these teams ever reached the levels of passion seen in some of the more spirited football feuds, such as Alabama vs. Auburn or Michigan vs. Ohio State.
So it can be a little surprising for newcomers and visitors to learn that southeastern Connecticut is home to the oldest high school football rivalry in the United States. Starting in 1875, the teams from Norwich and New London began a Thanksgiving Day match to see who would be able to take home bragging rights.
Brian Girasoli, a former sports editor and past president of the Connecticut Sports Writers’ Alliance, gives a thorough overview of this annual contest. He’s clearly done a great deal of research in order to trace the game from its early origins to more modern times.
I should probably disclose that I know Girasoli personally. In fact, we play bar trivia together all the time (he’s our sports ringer). And he spoke at my wedding.
OK, so maybe I’m not the most unbiased person to be reviewing his book. I can still offer a bit of criticism, in that the book makes heavy use of newspaper articles. This gives an intriguing look at how sports coverage has evolved over the years, but can also limit Girasoli’s own voice and result in a more repetitive style.
Nevertheless, the book presents a clear narrative, with numerous interesting and amusing vignettes from games past. The game in 1889, played in a snowstorm, ended abruptly after a punted ball could not be found again. A brawl among fans in 1951 put the game on ice for a couple of years. A controversial call in the 1960s would be discussed for years. Each school has built up lengthy winning streaks, only to see them shattered and have the advantage tilt to their rivals.
Every state has its claim to fame, often related to the famous sons and daughters who once lived there or continue to make it their home. Authors who write a book on such local icons face a few challenges, including whether they should simply rattle off a list of celebrated figures or try to unite them around a common theme.
Eric D. Lehman, whose previous works have ranged from natural history to a definitive account of Benedict Arnold’s attack on New London, recently released his own picks for some of our states most prominent figures. Connecticut Vanguards focuses on those “who were pioneers, groundbreakers, or trailblazers in their particular fields.” He adds the further stipulation that each subject either grew up in Connecticut or spent a significant portion of their life there.
As such, readers shouldn’t go into this volume with the expectation that Lehman will touch upon every famous Nutmegger. Many familiar names are featured, including Eugene O’Neill and Katharine Hepburn, are featured. Others are excluded; Mark Twain gets a quote in the introduction, but not an individual profile.
In each essay, Lehman makes the case for how the person became a powerful influencer. Some people have received plenty of analysis over the years, including Harriet Beecher Stowe’s galvanizing of the abolitionist movement with Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Others are fascinating, lesser-known examples such as Ebenezer Bassett, the nation’s first African-American ambassador.
Lehman profiles 24 people in all, and his selections provide a good balance of different personalities and professions. Artists, entertainers, industrialists, politicians, and more are covered. The concluding essays focus on more recent innovators, such as criminologist Henry C. Lee and sustainable sushi chef Bun Lai.
Connecticut Vanguards is a thoughtful look at some of the pioneering personalities of the Constitution State. It’s easy to take as a leisurely read, a chapter or two at a time, learning about some of the groundbreaking people from the area and perhaps getting a little inspiration along the way.
It’s always impressive to see how niche local history publications can be. Stop by this section of a bookstore and you’ll not only find countless volumes focusing on individual towns, but also a variety of slim but informative narratives on everything from a specific fire department to a vanished streetcar line.
Wick Griswold and Stephen Jones have added to that panoply with Connecticut River Ferries. As the name suggests, the book limits its focus to river crossings, including the long-serving Chester-Hadlyme and Rocky Hill-Glastonbury ferries. You’ll have to look elsewhere for a history of the seafaring steamboats or a look at the current Long Island Sound ferries.
While there are plenty of sections that follow a more historical style, such as a catalogue of mishaps on the ferries and a thorough recounting of the pressures to shut down the two remaining crossings, the book often follows a more folksy, whimsical style. There are plenty of anecdotes gathered from interviews with ferry captains, the legend of a stodgy old man who showed up a ferryman by walking around the Connecticut River instead of paying the fare, and much more.
This usually works to the book’s favor, but it can sometimes be a little grating. The third chapter, prefaced as an interlude authored by Jones, seemed to me an overlong and overwritten break that clashed noticeably with the rest of the book.
While there is plenty of discussion of the older ferry crossings that were set up out of necessity, I was a little dismayed to find that other river ferries were mostly or entirely omitted. There’s scant mention of the crossing that served Lyme and Old Saybrook before the construction of a bridge there, and nothing at all about the ferries that once plied the Thames River between Groton and New London.
Connecticut River Ferries is a bit of a muddled look at the history of this service. But it’s well-written and entertaining, and should appeal to those with an interest in the maritime heritage of the state.

For those of you who don't know, the Pac-Tour is sort of a spin off of the Vans Warped Tour, except on a much smaller scale. This was also the first national tour I've seen at the venue, and it was as good of a venue as I expected it to be.
The first opener was The I Drive, a local band that won Pittsburgh's heat of the Pac Tour battle of the bands. They we're pretty decent, but it was obvious the crowd could have cared less who they were. I thought it was funny that they advertised their show at a bar on the south side to a bunch of high school kids.
Eyealaska was up next and the most notable thing about them is that their lead singer came on stage wearing a wool sweater, scarf and backpack and was eating an apple. Their sound is a mix of Linkin Park sounding music with less screaming/rapping and, of all things, r&b. They weren't bad, but they weren't anything to write home about either.
P.O.S. came up next, the only act I had heard of other than IPS, thanks to late night MTVU sessions. The crowd was obviously flat, as a bunch of high schoolers wanting to see screamo could care less about rap. Also, while P.O.S.'s rapping skills were top notch, he had no showmanship. Eventually he resorted to rapping from the middle of the crowd to generate some sort of spark. Still, few people cared. He made a comment that the people who were just standing around and not getting in to him could have just listened to his cd at home. Well, P.O.S., you did nothing to make me think that I shouldn't.
Innerpartysystem came up next, with some new lighting effects but a shortened setlist, so they compensated by only playing their rockers. Transmission, Last Night in Brooklyn, Die Tonight Live Forever, This Town Your Grave, Heart of Fire, and of course Don't Stop. Some where in the middle of that was their new song Money Makes the World Go 'Round, which was awesome. Just like the last time I saw IPS the crowd was flat, or at least it was until they played Don't Stop. Why kids can jump around for that song but not This Town Your Grave makes no sense to me. In any event, Innerpartysystem keeps getting better as they continue these marathon touring sessions. Hopefully they'll pick up enough popularity from these package tours that they can get bigger and better booking.
Saosin took forever to get on stage, like half an hour or so. Also they filled up the entire bar with stage fog. I really had not heard any of their stuff prior to the show, and really wasn't impressed. Screaming and noise is best done when it's done just to be screaming and noise. I really couldn't understand why the crowd was so into this band, but then again I'm a good decade older than most of the people in the crowd. I left before they finished their set, after all, the Steelers were playing a tight game in Baltimore

Human beings probably danced even before there was a word for it. Rhythmic bodily movement is instinctive. It connects people, even if unconsciously, to the rhythms of nature. The grounded movement is notably different from ballet's upward lift - itself in relation to western melodic forms. Dance is a form of expression that supersedes verbal language; it is possible to convey far more meaning in a sweeping gesture than a simple phrase. Dance springs from a human desire for personal expression and social connection. and it feels good.

New Zealand's success in raising agricultural productivity has been accompanied by higher input use, leading to adverse effects on the environment. Until recently, analysis of farm performance has tended to ignore such negative externalities. The current emphasis on environmental issues has led dairy farmers to target improvements in both environmental performance and productivity. Therefore, measuring the environmental performance of farms and integrating this information into farm productivity calculations should assist in making informed policy decisions which promote sustainable development. However, this is a challenging process since conventional environmental efficiency measures are usually based on simple input and output flows but nitrogen discharge is a complex process affected by climate, pasture composition, cow physiology and geophysical variability. Furthermore, the outdoor pastoral nature of New Zealand farming means that it is difficult to control input and output flows, particularly of nitrogen. We present a novel approach to measure the environmental and economic efficiency of farms, using the Overseer nutrient budget model and spatially micro-simulated virtual population data. The empirical analysis is based on dairy farms in the Karapiro catchment, where nitrogen discharge from dairy farming is a major source of nonpoint pollution.
New Zealand's success in raising agricultural productivity has been accompanied by higher input use, leading to adverse effects on the environment. Until recently, analysis of dairy farm performance in New Zealand has often ignored undesirable effects on the environment [13], [14] and [17]. The eco efficiency study by Basset Mens et al. [3] provides a notable exception by indentifying farms which were both economically and environmentally efficient. This was achieved by including nitrogen discharges into the analysis of farm production and financial performance. This paper extends this approach and provides separate measures of economic, environmental and joint economic and environmental performance. The current emphasis on environmental issues has led dairy farmers to target improvements in both environmental performance and productivity. Therefore, measuring the environmental performance of farms and integrating this information into farm productivity calculations should allow farmers to benchmark their performance and assist policy makers to make informed decisions which promote sustainable development. The remainder of this section outlines our use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and recent approaches to the measurement of environmental performance. We then outline some of the challenges in measuring dairy farm environmental efficiency. In Section 2 we detail the specification of the DEA model and our definitions of four different measures of efficiency (technical, economic, environmental and joint environmental and economic efficiency). This is followed by details of the empirical analysis (Section 3), results, implications and conclusions.
DEA efficiency scores are summarized in Table 3 with the cumulative frequency distributions for each measure being illustrated in Fig. 1. It can be seen that there are substantial differences in both the level and the distribution of efficiencies among farms. The average level of technical efficiency (0.82) suggests that in principle farms could reduce their input use by 18% and still maintain the existing level of output, or could increase output without increasing input use. However, attitudes towards risk and farmer skill levels may affect their ability and desire to achieve this sort of efficiency. The level of technical efficiency found here is similar to that estimated by Jaforullah and Whiteman [14] in 1999 (0.83). From Fig. 1 it can be seen that farms perform best according to the technical efficiency measure with more than 60% of farms achieving at least 80% efficiency.

Hi! you have a great blog! please check out my blog and if you like, please follow me on Google Friend Connect & Bloglovin, I promise to do the same for you!
I am so tired. This is a quick post. On my birthday which was 3 day ago, on 25 th September, I was in Istanbul. Pictures bellow...
My photography hobby started in the late 70’s when I bought my first camera. This was a Chinon SLR with a 50mm lens. I joined the photography group at my high school where I mainly made B/W pictures. The school had a darkroom where I developed the films and printed the pictures. In my last year at the school I contributed many pictures to the yearbook for the graduates.
After using the Chinon for 3 years I bought myself an Olympus OM-10, again with a 50mm lens. With this camera I made a lot of pictures of family, vacations and weddings (by request) but never really went out to explore and develop my own interests and style. A pity, but the costs for films, developing them and printing the pictures were a too heavy strain on my student budget. After my graduation from university I started to work and my photography moved to the background. Only the occasional family and vacation pictures using my Olympus OM-10 and later my new Canon EOS 650.
In the end of 2009 I started thinking serious about photography again. I decided to buy the Canon EOS 500D with the basic kit lens EFS 18-55mm. With this camera I started exploring the world of photography again and I found out that I still enjoyed it. I started experimenting with the camera and all of its features. I also started to read books and magazines to improve my understanding of all the technical aspects of digital photography and also to learn from other photographers. In May 2010 I was at a conference in Las Vegas after which I took a short vacation to explore Las Vegas (the Strip mainly) and Death Valley. Of course I had my 500D with me.
I took hundreds of pictures experimenting with all sorts of techniques and compositions. This experience made me decide to take my photography up to a next level. I enrolled in the Base Course of the Fotovakschool in Amsterdam. A 7-day course spread over 3 months where the main purpose was to have the students learn to take a good picture not by luck but by skills and understanding. The course had several assignments that explored different photography techniques and skills.
In 2011 I made a photo trip of two weeks together with a good friend of mine. We visited the Grand Canyon, Antelope Canyon, Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon, Death Valley and Las Vegas. Again the 500D went with me but now with a new set of lenses, the main one being the Canon EF-S 17-85mm IS. I took the opportunity to experiment with filters for photographing sunrises and sunsets. I used ND filters and gradual ND filters from Cokin.
I think this last photo trip showed me that landscape photography is what I enjoy most. This is also where I would like to do much more with. But this doesn’t mean that I stay away from other areas of photography. To explore that more I decided to enroll in the 2 year Professional course at the Fotovakschool. This course focusses on making a living as a photographer. The modules and assignments focus on that. It is great fun to do.
In 2011 I also bought a new camera, the Canon EOS 5D Mark II. That is really a great camera. When in 2013 I did the series of the short track ice-skater I experienced one of the main drawbacks of the 5D Mark II which is the autofocus with fast moving objects. I needed to switch back to manual focus to get some real good shots of the ice-skater while going full speed through the corners. This made me decide to replace the Mark II with the 5D Mark III. That really makes a difference.
I now finished the professional course and interestingly I found that I feel very comfortable with event photography. My graduation project was about the trikers.
Turn your kitchen to one of the most beautiful places in your home by installing new hardware on your cabinets such as kitchen cabinet knobs and pulls. The best thing is you can install cabinet knobs and pulls cheaply and if you have just a little handyman in you can even install them yourself.
Instead of spending thousands of dollars to get brand new cabinets for your kitchen consider painting them. It is the most affordable option. You can choose from a wide variety of colors and effects to add new life to the room. Painted kitchen cabinets are a quick and amazing makeover for the kitchen but it does not stop there. Painted cabinets would update your other rooms also.
Professional kitchen builders specialize in kitchen designs and styles. Kitchen designers are almost everywhere nowadays. They cater to everything and have established agencies which are easily accessed by nearby residences who want to seek professional advice in the construction renovation or redesigning of their kitchens.

First, some bad news. As might come across as obvious due to the fact that this post is not just a simple link to On The Box, OTB has told me to stop my column, “The Beginner’s Guide to Anime” because it is too niche for them. However, that doesn’t mean I have to stop the column entirely. Thus “The Beginner’s Guide to Anime” will continue here, on my own personal blog.
Appropriately enough, this anime I’ve picked to restart things looks at the anime fandom itself. Otaku no Video is a two-part Original Video Anime (OVA) which was released in 1991 by Gainax. This spoof is semi-autobiographical, partly drawing on the experiences of the team behind the series. It is also the first anime covered in this column to feature extensive use of live-action footage.
The story begins in 1982 and follows Kubo Takeshi, a successful guy with a girlfriend, whose skilful at tennis, and who after taking a year off is about to go to university. While out on the town one night he gets stuck in a lift with a group of otakus – a group of geeky obsessives with a deep passion for anime among other things. One of the people in the group is Kubo’s old high school friend Tanaka Naeo, and later Kubo finds him at his new college: in cosplay, dressed up as Char Aznable from Mobile Suit Gundam (No. 2). After some pressure Kubo begins to take an interest in anime and manga, and Tanaka introduces again to the guys he met in the lift, who are Tanaka’s closest friends.
Over the coming months, Kubo develops a passion for otaku culture. He drops out of the college, gives up on tennis, ends up having no job, and is eventually dumped by his girlfriend. However, he doesn’t give up wishing to know more about the otaku way of life. What frustrates him is people’s prejudices about otakus. This leads him to decide to start his own business with Tanaka to overturn these views, with his ultimate ambition to become the greatest otaku of all, the “otaking”. These events are covered in the second episode which starts in 1985, with Kubo creating and losing successful multi-million yen business, leading to his plan to create an otaku-themed amusement park, before strangely ending in a flooded, ruined Tokyo in 2035, with Kubo, Tanaka and friends planning to take otaku culture into space.
However, this is only half the story. While this jolly, anime story is played along, throughout both episodes there are cut-in life-action scenes from a mockumentary called Portrait of an Otaku. It “features” current and former otakus with pixelated faces and distorted voices talking about their love of otaku culture. They include an office worker who is embarrassed to talk about his love of cosplay, a criminal who steals animation cels and sells them on, a man who travelled to America to assemble the greatest video collection, and a porn obsessive who claims to have invented glasses to remove the pixels from censored porn and is seen masturbating in his interview. All of these people are actually Gainax staff acting.
Otaku no Video thus contains a mixture of different styles and emotions. The animated sequences tell the story of an otaku who becomes successful and makes the culture accepted, while the Portrait of an Otaku segments mock all the negative aspects of the fandom. Not everyone saw the funny side of it however, with many otaku at the time complaining that it misrepresented them, although it was a parody.
One of the best things about Otaku no Video is enjoying the way so many anime series get referenced and spoofed. Not only is the Gundam cosplay, but there are similar moments involving Space Pirate Captain Harlock (No. 107) and Lupin III (No. 90). The period storytelling feature segments feature scenes such as Kubo and his friends spending the night outside a cinema waiting to see the 1984 premier of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (No. 38). There are also references to other Gainax works: there is mention of Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise (No. 105); when Kubo and Tanaka design their character for their own OVA, the character’s mascots look like King, the pet lion cub of the title character in Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (No. 112); and in one of the Portrait of an Otaku sequences there is a man playing an adult video game featuring one of the characters from Gunbuster (No. 24).
However, I think that not only does Otaku no Video reference anime of the past, but there are other anime that are partly influenced by it. In the final scene, when Kubo and his friends go to space, their rocket is shaped like a huge conical drill. Years later, Gainax’s over-the-top mecha series Gurren Lagann (No. 50) feature mecha armed with such drills. Some people even claim that part of Gurren Lagann’s main character, Simon, are influenced by Kubo, partly because both stories take a gap of several years in which the characters develop.
Otaku no Video is a short collection, with each of the two episodes lasting 50 minutes, but it is a wonderful anime to watch because it mixes so many things. It is not that surprising that it is so popular, to the extent that when a region-free Blu-Ray release of the series was proposed on Kickstarter it more than doubled its target.

Ralls County Sheriff’s deputies say two females are safe after being trapped against a fence by pit bulls Wednesday morning.
Deputies say the women were working with their horses in a pasture when the unrestrained dogs began to attack them. As deputies arrived and tried to rescue the women, sheriff’s reports say one of the animals attempted to attack the deputies.
The aggressive animal was euthanized on the scene. One dog fled and the other was returned to its enclosure by the sheriff’s department.
Research on a set of words known as 'discourse markers' (DMs), like the English expressions you know, I mean, like, so, well has flourished during that last two decades, with many studies of English discourse markers having been undertaken. However, studies of discourse markers in other languages have been relatively few in comparison, and research into discourse markers of second language learners has received even less attention. Kurdi's research investigates the use of English discourse markers utilised by Syrian Arabic-speaking university students.
There are instances where these second language learners show ability to use English discourse markers in a native like way (example 1), while in some other cases they used some English markers in different ways to that of native speakers (examples 2 and 3). Example 4 is an instance of intense language contact where speaker failed to separate the two systems.
In example (1) so is used by the learner as it would be used by a native speaker of English. M is the interviewer and R is the interviewee.
R 6 coz they've been there for now fourteen fifteen years in England so their English is better than their Arabic.
In this example speaker R uses so in line 6 to mark a causal relationship between two parts of the sentence; the fact that the nieces of speaker R have been living in England for a long time (around fifteen years) is the reason why their English is better than their Arabic despite the fact that they are born to Arabic parents. This usage of so is well recognized in English when it marks a fact-based result.
M 1 h-how do you manage to find the time you work do you have a fulltime job I mean how do you manage to find the time to study with your fulltime job?
3 "ok you are you aren't allowed to attend the course of Diploma, you aren't allowed to go for Japanese language"
5 so my Japanese course start at three o'clock I need about half hour half an hour to reach here the centre.
In the example above the usage of so in line 5 does not match with any of the functions of so in the English language. So may mark a result, an inference, a summary, a main idea unit, among other functions. 'my Japanese course start at three o'clock' is not an inference, a result, or a summary of 'our work time from eight o'clock to three thirty' .The speaker here is simply using so as a connector regardless of whether it is suitable in this context or not.
A 1 the British council they told us don't take anything except your umbrella, you can buy anything from there but if you are out of the airport, and the rain.
2 so I bring it from Syria but you know I was there in summer when I try to bring it it was summer so I had a lot of trouble to find an umbrella coz until now I think we don't have winter or we don't have rain.
3 it is November started so I bought it in June, you can imagine that nobody has it, so why he wants it?
This is another example of so being used none natively. Prior to this piece of discourse the interviewer had seen the interviewee carrying an umbrella with him. She told him that she was glad to see that he did not forget his umbrella.
In segments (2) both instances of so indicate a cause-result relationship between the utterance before and after it. Because they told him that an umbrella is the first thing he is going to need in England (cause), he bought one from Syria (effect). In the same manner, the fact that it was summer at the time he had to buy an umbrella (cause) caused him a lot of trouble (effect). The problem arises in segment (3). In (3) he wanted to go back to the main argument (that buying an umbrella in June was difficult given the fact that at the time of speaking it was November and there was no rain in Syria). But that does not work in English. English does not allow choosing one function and ignoring the other. His imperfect English competence in this example, gives him the license to pick and choose one function of so (back-referencing) and to ignore another (what follows is related to what preceded). The sentence 'it is November started so I bought it in June' is odd to native speakers of English.
J 18 er let me then tell you something if you want to er to improve your conversation you must speak with strangers er I think ya'ni er I mean er for er English people native speakers er it's the way to improve your conversation and if you want to learn English er you can learn it by er read read a lot of books er read more and more and to see er some TV programmes and er films but the only way to improve your er conversation is to speak with native speakers.
This example is an interesting instance of language contact in the area of discourse markers. The speaker in line 18 failed to separate the two systems, Arabic and English. She uses the Arabic discourse marker ya'ni instead of the English I mean. She, however, is aware of her deviating from the code of the interview which is English and this is obvious from her immediate correction.

The Nebelung cat is the longhaired variety of the Russian Blue cat. The name Nebelung is German and means “creature of the mist,” which is a reference to the cat’s silvery-blue coat that seems to float over his body.
This cat breed was developed by Cora Cobb of the Nebelheim Cattery. Cobb was inspired by a kitten named Siegfried, the only longhaired blue kitten in a litter fathered by a longhaired black cat and born to a black domestic shorthair named Elsa. A next litter produced a female longhaired blue kitten whom Cobb named Brunhilde.
Siegfried and Brunhilde became the start of a new breeding program and produced their first litter in 1986. Russian Blues that carried the gene for long hair were imported from eastern Europe in the late 1980s and contributed to the development of the breed. The International Cat Association gave the cats New Breed status in 1987 and full recognition in 1997. Nebelungs can be outcrossed to Russian Blues. The Nebelung is also recognized by the Cat Fanciers Federation and the Traditional Cat Association.
The Nebelung has a good reputation as a gentle, quiet cat, somewhat shy, but don’t get the wrong idea. This cat may have a reserved nature, but he loves to play (being especially fond of retrieving) and enjoys jumping or climbing to high places where he can study people and situations at his leisure before making up his mind about whether he wants to get involved. Guests will not receive his immediate attention and may never see him unless he decides they are worthy of his notice, but toward family members, especially his favored person, he is ever loyal, following them through the house and even riding on a shoulder. The Nebelung is a sensitive cat who doesn’t like to be ignored and will be hurt if he doesn’t receive the same amount of affection he gives. Lack of attention can cause him to become anxious or fearful.

John and (mainly) George, interviewed in George's Manhattan hotel room (apparently) on 20th December 1974 (again apparently); broadcast the following day on NYC station KHJ AM.
I think the tape is a little slower than it should be - or else something has made George sound particularly lugubrious (not that there's anything wrong with that).
Relations were a little spiky by that point, as can be heard, though there is an amusing moment when John asks (referring to Ringo) "Who was the other one?" and George replies "Bert". I need not explain, I trust.
Man, it leaves me with a bittersweet feeling listening to those two guys talking. Wish they had managed to keep their friendship going through the 70s.

It was a lovely relaxed Christmas at home. It was a smaller group this year as we have family overseas and out of state.
The boys laid out their Santa sacks and left some treats out for Santa and his reindeers. I love that there is still belief in the Christmas magic in the house.
Hydrangeas always say Summer and Christmas to me so I kept things simple with several bunches of them in the middle of the table, a faux garland weaved around them and a few gold baubles.
Our Christmas cocktail this year was a combination of gin, elderflower cordial, lemon juice and soda water. I had a few requests for the recipe and the quantities we used for our mason jars.
All the trimmings for lunch. Pork, crackling, turkey, roast veggies, corn, potato gratin, stuffing balls and fresh bread rolls. Gravy, apple sauce + cranberry sauce on the side.
Noah especially loved the Christmas crackers this year and was very keen to hear all of the jokes inside! The jokes were as still as corny as ever!

RAWALPINDI: Pakistan has the highest number of drug addicts in the world, said Director Anti-Narcotic Force Anwar Hafeez.
He was addressing a seminar on “Role of public representatives and civil society against drug abuse” here Tuesday at a local hotel. The seminar was held as part of an anti-drug campaign launched by Rawalpindi Arts Council.
Anwar said according to a survey conducted in 2001, the total number of drug addicts in Pakistan was around four million, out of which half a million were chronic heroine addicts. He added that injecting drugs was a major cause of spread of HIV/AIDS among the younger generation and if not checked, could lead to an epidemic.
Highlighting the functions of the Anti-Narcotics Force, he said the force also played a role in reducing “demand reduction” of drugs in the country.
Anwar expressed concern regarding the rehabilitation facilities provided to drug abusers. He believes that the existing facilities should be upgraded with better staff, including a psychologist.
“This problem cannot be solved by one organisation alone, citizens should also cooperate and help promote the anti-drug campaign,” he said. Potohar Town Nazim Hamid Nawaz Raja reinforcing what Anwar Hafeez said announced that he would look into the matter of improving the rehabilitation facilities.
Special Advisor to Punjab Chief Minister Raja Mohammad Nasir, who was the chief guest, also addressed the gathering. He pointed out that the prevalence of drug abuse was higher in rural and remote areas where people lacked information. He said there was a need to create awareness in these areas.
Raja Nasir announced that the government would soon launch an anti-drug campaign which would be carried out at all levels. Seminars would be held starting from the first week of July at the district level to educate people in rural areas about the harmful affects of drug abuse. He also said the government was ready to grant funds for promotion of the anti-drug campaign started by Rawalpindi Arts Council.
The CDA has assigned the task of the project’s designing to Engineering Associates who also prepared the design of the under construction underpass at Kulsoom Plaza Chowk — also in Blue Area.
CDA sources said the design of the flyover-cum-underpass would be finalised within the next two months and contract for construction work would be awarded to the contractor to be selected from the already short-listed firms.
The sources said as per concept of the plan, the traffic would ply on three levels. An official said the part of flyover of the project would be required for smooth flow of traffic on Jinnah Avenue. A CDA official said the project — starting sometime in September — would be completed in six months while its actual cost would be known once the design is finalised.
It has been learnt that the Authority would have to shift the service lines passing through the intersection to start the project. The CDA is already spending Rs100 million on shifting service lines from Kulsoom Chowk and almost the same amount will be required to re-located service lines from Faisal Avenue.
The Authority has reserved Rs490 million for the project of the Kulsoom Plaza underpass while funds have also been allocated for the project of flyover-cum-underpass at Faisal Avenue Chowk. Sources said the CDA would also start work on construction of underpass at China Chowk in the financial year 2006-07.
Through the haze of a dim-lit, smoke-filled room, 50 or so men, apparently in their 20s and wearing ‘just-out-of-bed’ T-shirts and jeans, are visible reclining casually against cushions on the floor. A few of them, sporting long hair falling limply over their shoulders and goatees of different styles, are moving their heads in rhythm to the sound of an acoustic guitar. Another, who looks around 18 and has experimented liberally with gel on his short spiky hair, sits with his back against the wall, a single bullet hanging on a black thread around his neck and a thick, studded, leather band on his wrist. All are intensely focused on three people sitting on a sofa in the middle of the room, playing music on a bongo, an acoustic guitar and a bass guitar.
“Let’s see how many of you have heard this one,” says a young, confident voice from the middle of the sofa, making the small audience raise some fresh hoots and applause as the guitar abruptly picks pace towards a familiar number. Soon, the crowd is on its feet, repeating the high-pitched chorus, some jumping and banging their heads aggressively against the air. The aura is explosive; the youngsters gathered are hardcore fans. It’s an underground rock jam session in a small room on the upper floor of a café in Islamabad.
Having shed its ‘quiet’ image, a new, Metallica-styled face of Islamabad is slinging on a guitar and a pair of torn jeans after school and work, and keeping the music savvy youth of the city rocking away into the night.
It comes as no surprise that the city that proudly gave us ‘Vital Signs’ two decades ago — a band titled as the ‘pioneer of pop music in Pakistan’ — is brimming with the talent of young, eager musicians. Irtaash, Lahu, Corduroy, Nafs, Saturn and Needlework, to name a few underground rock bands in Islamabad, have quite a number of concerts to their credit, each struggling with nothing more than the strings on their guitars and self-trained vocals to attain ‘rockstardom.’
Underground bands, typically known in the West for their contempt for commercial success, a music style that appeals to a non-mainstream, cult-like audience, and at times, linkages with political movements, call for total redefinition in this part of the world. Here, bands remain underground only because financial constraints, lack of contacts, sponsorships and media attention, and discouragement from parents cause them to remain smothered down there. Most Western UG bands prefer remaining proudly unheard of by the larger audience; here, UG bands long for popularity and success. Because of this fundamental difference, UG rock music in Pakistan, unlike Western UG rock, which is more ‘free’ and at times bizarre due to its rejection of specific genre labelling, sounds more or less the same as mainstream rock.
“It’s the dream of every underground band in Pakistan to record an album. If you don’t want to go commercial, you might as well sit in your room and play your guitar to yourself,” says Junaid Waheed, 29, lead vocalist of the band Lahu and a business graduate, currently working as a regional sales manager at a telecom company.
Others, like Aashir Irfan, 19, bassist of the band Saturn and a student of ACCA, feel that the notion of ‘selling out by going commercial’ that applies to UG bands in the West is relevant here as well, but only if you compromise what you do best just to develop a popular following.
“If an underground rock band starts making pop music just to get on TV, that’s selling out. The band Corduroy released an English rock album two years back and sales did not sky-rocket, but at least they stuck to what they do best,” says Aashir.
These young musicians might lack finances and acknowledgment from the mainstream crowd, but the one thing they claim they do not lack is passion.
Junaid, with his ‘zero-cut’ hairstyle (an almost shaved head), a French beard and spectacles, explains with ease of manners how his love for music landed him a gig at Bahria University in 1999, which gave his fellow musicians and him the idea of forming a band. The newly formed band circulated pamphlets around the university, asking students to suggest a suitable name. The result was ‘Lahu’.
“‘Lahu’ is the essence of life,” he explained, with a hint of pride in his voice. Yasir Jaswal, 23, lead vocalist of Irtaash and a student of BBA, practised his vocals from an early age by singing along old Indian songs of Kishore Kumar. His clean, pressed shirt, neatly trimmed hair, and boyish looks contrast with his aspirations of becoming a rock star.
“I make music for myself … to let go of my emotions. If people can connect with it, my job is done,” he said with a voice full of passion. “The term ‘Irtaash’ means ‘vibrations produced by waves’,” he continued. “Our first performance was at a function at FAST University, which we did for free because the organisers couldn’t get any other band and we wanted the exposure.”
The band performed their song ‘Kali Raatain’ (Dark Nights) at the function, which was an instant hit among those present. Now, 5 years later, they have finally released a video of the same song on ‘Indus Music’ and ‘The Musik’– a feat that was no picnic for a struggling UG band from Islamabad.
“UG bands have not been able to get the exposure they deserve. Whatever they are doing, they are doing it on their own. If a band finally manages to get a video on IM, it wont be run very often unless you actually go to Karachi to make sure it is”, said Junaid.
“There are very good rock bands in Islamabad … the problem is that to get some attention, most have to shift to Karachi and now Lahore. Vital Signs was an Islamabad-based band but had to move to Karachi … as did Junoon, which was from Lahore,” he continued.
Money is unanimously cited as the biggest hurdle on the way to commercial success. Recording studios are out of reach of the pocket of a typical UG band, since recording a single song costs much more than what they make from one concert. Consequently, whatever they make is usually spent on upgrading their equipment.
But perhaps all these issues would not be so painful to swallow if it weren’t for the lack of one of the most sought after elements in the world of show business: Respect.
“Not getting money for our performance doesn’t feel as bad as not getting respect. Organisers often cancel commitments at the last minute if they find a band that will perform for a lesser amount or for free. Once, an organiser bluntly asked us to leave after we had finished playing at an event,” said Yasir, with a trace of bitterness.
A band that performs the opening act at a concert is immediately categorised as ‘mediocre’, the crowd is also unsympathetic towards newcomers in the music scene, not willing to applaud or appreciate no matter how impressive the performance is, and the ultimate letdown is when a rock band is requested by a coarse crowd to play ‘Bhangra’.
“The mainstream crowd is mostly attracted to ‘Bhangra’ and pop music and doesn’t appreciate the talent of rock musicians,” said Jonathan Jones, 21, lead guitarist of the band Nafs and a student of Bachelors.
Gradually, however, the crowd’s taste is becoming more refined, says Aashir. Thanks to Call and EP — prior UG bands from Lahore but now household names among young music lovers — an appetite for rock music is steadily developing.
Luckily, UG rock bands from Islamabad are more successful in developing a small, intensely loyal fan-following as compared to those from Lahore and Karachi, where large numbers of mega-famous bands make the crowd less patient towards unfamiliar performers.
“Islamabad has really good underground rock bands. My favourite is Corduroy and Lahu,” said Bilal Abbas, an 18-year-old ‘A’ levels student from Islamabad who claims to avidly follow local UG rock music.
The performances of these UG bands, attended mostly by fellow musicians and word-of-mouth crowd wanting to party and ‘head-bang’ (a popular practice among heavy metal fans involving aggressive shaking of the head, preferably if one has long hair, along with the music), take place at different venues around the city, including Islamabad Club and Lok Virsa, where NGOs and other private organisations arrange ‘Rock Fests’ (performances by four or five bands), Planet X, where they perform on self-financed basis, schools, universities and local events, where they sometimes play free-of-charge just for the exposure, and the only venue in the city that asks for no money or contacts for practising in front of a live audience: Civil Junction.
The small café in F-7, with its casual, simple interior, perfect for lounging about on lazy days and a pretty patch of trees outside beneath which one enjoy the tit-bits offered by the famous, quirky menu card, has become such a crucial element of support for these young musicians that most of them refer to it almost reverently. Arshad Bhatti, owner of Civil Junction, says that he offered this platform because he believes that Islamabad is capable of producing brilliant rock stars.
Known among the locals as “tree girl” for uncanny resemblance of its branches and leaves to a maiden’s hair, this marvel of nature stands prominent among the remains of the ancient Buddhist city of “Bhir Mound” (600-200BC), situated a few metres from Taxila Museum.

Comments: BBQ sauce and amber ale is a perfect match for any type of meat. The sweetness in the sauce and the sweetness in the beer and roasted flavours will make the both the flavours in the food and in the beer distinct. Indian Pale Ale will match the aggressive spices on the tongue and at the same time allow a person to taste the stronger beers in stages, highlighting the floral notes and bitter finish in the beer.

This recipe is a base recipe and you can add whatever unique touches you want to it such as basil, oregano, rosemary, ginger, chili-powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cayenne, different paprika’s and so on.

When it comes to the West Bank, what do we know for sure? Or to put it another way, when it comes to the media, how do we know they’re telling the truth?

Today's recipe is yet another simple yet super delicious combo. Prawns,drumsticks and mangoes goes so well together. It is an absolute comfort food. My mother used to make this every time we get prawns and mangoes.Drumsticks/muringikka adds a lot of flavor to the dish and mangoes imparts sourness which makes this curry irresistible. You can also make this with dry prawns and is equally delicious.
Cut mangoes into cubes. In a pot add the cut mangoes, cleaned prawns, drumsticks,sliced shallots,salt,slit green chilly and turmeric powder . Cook till the prawns is done and the mangoes and drumsticks and soft.
Muffins are perfect breakfast and this combination of avocado and honey is really delicious,especially when it is nice and warm and fresh from the oven.Avocados and honey keeps the muffin soft and moist. It is oil free and tastes really good and is healthy too. I have used avocados in chocolate cup cakes in place of butter and it came out really soft with no after taste. I added a little of butter scotch chips, you can add chocolate chips of nuts according to your preference.
Cut avocado an scoop out the flesh. Using a fork mash it really soft or make a puree of it using a mixer. Mix in honey and keep aside.
Uzhunnu vada or medu vada is a very common snack in south India and is a perfect accompaniment with a cup of hot piping tea.I like it as a snack but again cannot resist when it is served with idli,sambar and chutney as breakfast. Where does all the aroma come from? The plain deep fried lentils is by itself flavorful because I make them often for vada curry. But in uzhunnu vada the addition of pearl onions,ginger and curry leaves imparts a wonderful aroma that is irresistable.This is something I really missed when I came here to the US until I started making my home made version. Try this you will surely love it.
For this months baking challenge Swathi put forward the suggestion to makes PIES. I love pies and tarts and was so excited with the theme.There were four recipes to select from~ two sweet pies and two savory tarts. I wanted to try savory tarts for some time.

So will try that some other time. This recipe suggested by Samantha was quick and easy. I reduced the recipe into half and made only with one pastry sheet.It has layers of flavors which blend well with the cheese. The cheesy center with caramelized onions and sun-dried tomatoes together with a crispy and buttery crust tastes wonderful.Thanks Samantha for suggesting this recipe.

Pizza is my kids favorite and I often make pizza at home. Some times,when I do not have pizza dough,I tweak the recipe a bit and use naan or bagel as the crust. In this recipe I have used naan instead of the regular pizza dough and is light and crispy. This is a fusion variety but still tastes exotic.It has with paneer and touch of tikka masala. In addition to this it has the regular pizza tomato based sauce and a cheese blend of Mozzarella,Asiago Romano and Parmesan. This is a vegetarian version but you can also use meat or pepperoni as topping.

Need more business skills than developers skills in top management. Since the death of Wavecrest and Visa/Mastercard's severance of the crypto industry, it's impossible to get a debit card deal anywhere except maybe Unionpay in China. But Visa owns the most of the ATMs in Europe and have a lockdown on the industry. Too many debit card projects out there already floundering who have done ICOs anyway. Nothing that original here.
Very competitve space. Many established players in Asia and Europe who are building fast. Not sure they will get a financial partner to be able to use ATM. Not having a native app until down the line will have impact on UX as will be slow as non native. When rasing such funds as a ICO I dont see why a native app is not done immediately . May work in Australia but can see problems scaling as long lead time in a fast changing space.

We launched the first Dedicated Semester in Fall 2007 with the topic of Judaism and its Cultures. Ten years later, the tradition of the Fontbonne Dedicated Semester is still going strong.
Catholic Social Teaching suggests the family is the most important social institution, the basic building block of humanity. This Dedicated Semester takes a broad, interdisciplinary perspective on practical, theoretical, and political topics related to families. It will offer opportunities to examine the history of the family and its role in education, religious formation, socialization, economic structures, and emotional development. We’ll explore traditional, changing, and families of choice and the challenges they face now and in the future.
The tradition of the Dedicated Semester began in the fall of 2007 with a campus-wide exploration of Judaism. Each fall, the Fontbonne University sponsors a different subject for the semester. With cooperation from schools, divisions, departments, and programs across the university, our campus community explores a new theme. Academic departments contribute courses that are the core curriculum of the Dedicated Semester, which is also supported by a variety of co-curricular activities and events.
Images surround and influence us on a daily basis, and yet we are seldom taught ways to read visual culture. In this semester, we will explore the visual image in a variety of contexts: from art to advertising, technology to aesthetics, from religious vision to the selfie. How does what we see shape what we know? How does it guide and misguide us? How do images persuade? What makes them so powerful? How do we define what is beautiful or ugly, and when or why should we? What does it mean when we say a leader is a 'visionary' in his or her field? How can we use images to serve the common good rather than to reduce it? What can the science of sight illuminate about human perceptions and limitations? How does visual perception, or impairments in visual perception, shape development in psychology, education, and beyond? How is the visual privileged or marginalized? What do we mean when we speak of 'our image'?

G,Rexroad Steve Miller was sensational, the Dead were even better......Jimi could have stayed home as good as he was....the Dead sold me that day
I was ending my Freshman year in high school. I was 14 years old. The night before this concert I tie-dyed a brand new white t-shirt in three colors, just for this show. My Dad drove me and a buddy to the show.The show was great! It was in Temple Stadium, an outside venue. The stadium is no longer there, but all my memories are. I saw Pigpen.
In Rock Scully's book LIVING WITH THE DEAD there is a misidentified photograph (one of many!) of a beardless Jerry with a cigarette in his mouth and strumming his guitar. Bobby is next to him. In the background is the stands of Temple Stadium.

Could this be the greatest car on the planet? If not, then it has to be close. Of course, the product film is very well done as well. I'm not much of a Mercedes fan, but this car and the film caught my attention. Very well done!
I'm still getting caught up and just had a chance to watch the YouTube video - it was very well done.
Overall I like the styling of the new S-Class and I agree that it sets the standard for luxury and technology. Some of the new accident avoidance technology is simply amazing. There's no question in my mind that we're not too far away from having "self-driving" cars become available in the marketplace.
The one feature I didn't see in the S-Class video was the availability of "self-parking" technology - I wonder if it's even available? Clearly Mercedes has the technology to offer self-parking - I just wonder if the Germans are opposed to the idea in the same way they hated installing cup holders in their cars?
Wow that's amazing with iconic design and groundbreaking design Mercedez Benz S class.I agree it lacks in self parking technology but the Brake Assist System detect crossing traffic and pedestrians, which is amazing
I agree it lacks in self parking technology but the Brake Assist System detect crossing traffic and pedestrians, which is amazing
My bet is Mercedes could easily incorporate the self-parking feature in the new S-Class but they refuse to do it because they don't want to be seen as pandering to people who don't know how to drive.
It's like BMW and cup holders - I remember reading that the Germans hated the idea of adding cup holders to their vehicles because they felt cup holders detracted from the driving experience. Ultimately BMW caved in when it was clear the U.S. customers were demanding interiors with cup holders.

The S Class will not only parallel park itself, but it will back-in as well. Steering Assist, is the coolest--it will literally follow the car in front of it, making small corrections to the wheel as you drive (or even bigger ones). It knows if you take your hands off the wheel, however, and will only let you do so for 15 seconds at a time.
I was under the mistaken impression that Mercedes didn't offer parking assist on their cars. While I'm still betting there are some hard-core German Engineers who are opposed to the concept there's no question that the parking assist features are something that many consumers want.

Learn to be great at sex and learn to love sex — it helps. May 1, at I have heard lately that she slept with him, even tho he is with her best friend friend, there friendship doesn't seem good anymore.
If not, read this next: And of course the familiar wig from last time was on the ground, I put that on without asking. I was half awake when I felt something.
First the girls did my makeup and hair. We had, and many of us still have, a lot more cortisol the stress chemical running through our bodies as children than all other kids. I sat down next to her friends, who reached in my pants feeling up my diaper, giving me a boner. We will often need to go through an emotional process in order to cope with the event, before finally coming to the conclusion that we can recover and move on.
His commitment, which is only demonstrated in proportion to its duration. I HAVE to tell him about this really funny thing that happened!
She wanted me to pinky promise her something and drew a smiley face on my pinky We Appreciate Patience We wish you would be really, really patient with us. Recently she has ignored me when talking online but at school she acts like we still talk a lot.
But again, what was I supposed to do! Play to their determination, make it funny. I got my teacher to change my place in class to sit next to him. She flipped over and took her bra off.
Do you know what to do to get things back on track? Many of a woman's triggers for romantic love are less immediate: Dating for Months, but Not Serious? She got a new boyfriend who looked alot like me.
I've seen her walk out side a few minutes after I do for something tiny. It was sooo nice to get that thing out of me. I went up to my room, and just crashed. Thanks Luke Dean 5 months ago Hey Jay so there is this girl at work I've met and I think we have a good vibe like she always comes to talk to me and she just makes eye contact with but now she doesn't respond to my texts I'm confused Al 6 months ago Ok so what if she asks u buncha questions then backs off?
I saw Kassy smirking, Kayla and her friends told me to wave to the camera that captured it all. Patrick 21 months ago She would playfully touch me when chatting. I was so excited that I wanted to share this with my husband, but he was not so excited to hear about it.
Why did she asked after sex,she could asked before having sex,can any1 tell me what is she thinking????
So of course this leads back to me. Don't wait around for his feelings to "grow" the way yours sometimes do. The awkwardness was crazy. Her friends kept giggling.
But lately she has started ignoring me and barely says a word to me and still sits either across from me or right next to me she has a choice to sit somewhere else because she is the second person to enter the lunchroom at our table. For Thebes first week of highschool I saw her walk back and forth through the halls in between a few of my classes and at lunch I sat across the lunch room from her.10 Things You Must Know About Dating Korean Girls.
Note: The article ’10 Things You Must Know About Dating Korean Girls’ was meant to be for fun. I am speaking from just my own personal experience as a white male and, of course, these points do not refer to all Korean women.
She will be obsessed with evading awkward questions about relationship status from others and avoid situations in which they might come up. Interactions are sometimes carefully managed to imply her boyfriend is her husband without telling a direct lie.

I met my boyfriend through mutual friends. I wasn't very attracted to him at first.

My paintings are about the beauty of fully saturated colors, their reaction to each other and the profound effect viewing them has on us all. I strive to create colors that vibrate against each other while making subtle changes in hue that seem to cause flat space to bend.
I work to give each painting a sort of “proud-chested” feeling. This is accomplished by not allowing the subject to completely fit on the canvas and by altering the viewpoint and perspective, creating a feeling of iconic architecture.
It’s the architecture of buildings redefined by the use of vivid color that define my collection of Pop Constructivist-style paintings called Architectural Portraits.

So recently iv been trying out sleeks face form contouring kit, I never really used to contour my face, well tell you the truth I used to only wear concealer, eyeliner and mascara until recently (I did study make-up at college though).
As you can see the packaging is the classic sleek, matte black with shiny gloss writing. Which I love! Inside there's a lovely full sized mirror which is perfect for using on the go and the fact that this palette is so slim makes it perfect for travelling!
This palette comes in four different shades, Fair, Light, Medium and Dark, I decided to go for the Light shade as I think it suited my needs better, also I preferred the Blush colour in that shade.
and finally a stunning shimmery rose gold coloured blush, but its not too shimmery I'm not a huge fan of shimmery blush but this has just the right amount of shimmer to it :)
Although these colours are very pigmented they come out a little sheer on your skin which means they are very buildable so you can use as much or as little product as you prefer. I love how the contour shade doesn't leave you looking dirty, as long as you remember blend blend blend!! and these are easy to blend :) and they have a silky feel to them which I also love!
What else can I say I am so glad I picked up this palette and I use this pretty much everyday when I do my make-up I love it!! and for £9.99 you really cant go wrong!
Hope you enjoyed this post. Let me know if you have tried this product and what you thought of it :)

Managerial efficiency for broiler producers in Saudi Arabia is generally difficult to achieve. High investment costs coupledwith relatively high average production costs and the consequent incompetent market prices, have resulted in projects eitherworking at less than full capacity or being shut down completely. The aim here is to determine the most efficient productionalternatives (actions) available to managers under business risk considerations. The ordinary stochastic dominance approachwas used to solicit the most efficient production alternatives for broiler producing projects of all sizes in the Central Region ofSaudi Arabia. For small- and medium-sized projects, the efficient production alternatives concentrated on marketing risk. Forlarge projects, the efficient actions concentrated on both marketing and production risks. For the three sizes of projects, thetwo production alternatives that proved to be the most efficient, were the one that contains creating more marketing strategiesand the one that adopts good veterinary care systems. On the other hand, the production alternative that deals with selectinggood breeds of chicks appeared to be most efficient for small and large projects only. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

I am feeling wholly unmotivated to work today. I brought about 8-10 hours' worth of stuff home with me yesterday so that I could "work from home" today; so far, aside from responding to emails I've done zero. It's not the end of the world, but it *does* mean I will have to catch up on this crap over the weekend. NOT good!
We are basically moved into our house. Furniture and appliances were delivered yesterday, so now it feels like we actually live here.
Projects still to be completed: ceiling fans (to be installed next week); garage door opener (to be installed Monday); partially in-ground spa (breaking ground early next week and will take 2-3 weeks to complete); and landscaping (cannot be started until spa is complete). I have a few little items to buy for the house, but nothing major.
Because of lack of time (& my stress level), I left quite a bit of stuff behind at my old apartment to sort through "later." The pain in the ass thing about that is that I am now going to have to set aside a half day on 3-4 weekends to go and deal with all that crap. I guess at the time I figured it would be better to spread out the suffering and not deal with it all at once as we were scrambling to get ready for our move. But now that we are in the new house, I'm over it and don't want to deal with it! Oh well. No one else is going to take care of this for me, so I've just got to suck it up and do it.
I've got to get back on track with the Core plan. I've skipped Weight Watchers the past two weeks, and I've been eating out a lot the past few days, mainly because we didn't have a refrigerator until yesterday afternoon. Must stop the regain that is happening before it gets out of control. . .
Yesterday I felt strangely tense and disconnected all day. I am chalking it up to the move and all the stress related to that. I'm sure it's not relationship related because spending the evening with MM actually made me feel less tense and disconnected.
A completely random aside: I ordered the Furminator from drugstore.com just before the move and used it on Sebastian just before he went to stay with my future in-laws. It's appropos of nothing, but I couldn't resist including a photo of all the hair I got off!
About the house photos: our carpet color looks off in the photo of the great room where Sebastian is seen on the left side. . . but I included it anyway because he's in it. The colors in the other photos are much more true-to-life.
LOVE your tile! It looks great. We have a furminator too and I use it on my cat and EVERY TIME end up with a pile of hair as big as he is!
I need to buy a furminator for Katie. She doesn't have a super thick coat like my parents lab, or your dog, but it still gets a lot more out than regular brushes.
I'm a 39-year-old woman who lives in the American Southwest and is continually working on self-improvement. I share my life with my husband MM and our wonderful Golden Retrievers, Sebastian and Hunter. I started this blog long before I met MM, primarily to write about my struggles with my weight and trying to get organized. I still continue to struggle in both areas, so I write on those topics more often than anything else, but I also write about my daily life and occasionally post a rant or hop on the bandwagon with the themes of other bloggers' posts. . . wherever the mood takes me.

ASOS has been applauded on social media for featuring a plus-size model wearing a bikini on the retail site.
The term “bikini body” has been used in past marketing campaigns to imply that women should try and achieve a certain body ideal in order to proudly don a bikini when the summer comes around.
However, the inclusion of a plus-size model wearing a bright yellow bikini on the ASOS website is winning serious praise for showing that women of all shapes and sizes should feel no qualms about baring all on the beach.
A few days ago, an individual on Twitter drew her followers’ attention to a selection of photos of Eyo-Ephraim that had been featured on ASOS advertising a halterneck-style yellow bikini.
Her tweet currently has more than 8,000 retweets and more than 31,000 likes, with many people expressing how much they admire ASOS for promoting inclusivity and diversity
Man of the Matchh @asos X @bridgemodels 👊🏾💛 Thank you ALLLL so much for the messages, the likes, the comments, the retweets, everything!!! I’m truly appreciative, shocked, excited & cannot wait to represent more women & make everyone even more proud❤ #CELEBRATEMYSIZE
You are here: Home / Weird Stories / Incredible! This Woman Has a Husband, Fiance and 2 Boyfriends. See Her Explanation On How It Works
There are stories upon hearing them, send your whole thinking faculty into some serious work. This story will probably do the same to you.
With a husband, fiancé and two boyfriends to boot, Mary Crumpton certainly isn’tof the traditional, nuclear family, reports LADBIBLE
It was gathered that the 44-year-old says that she couldn’t imagine things any other way and that despite having been called names, her polyamorous relationship works perfectly for her and the men in her life.
The Chorlton resident hopes that her own, individual story, broadens people’s understanding of polyamory and makes people more accepting towards those who choose to adopt the way of life.
Mary, who works as a teacher and a therapist, has a husband, Tim, 43, a fiance, John, 53, and two boyfriends – Michael, 63, and James, 73.
Having more than one spouse is illegal in the UK but Mary and her partners get around that by having unofficial ceremonies at Unitarian churches.
She said: “I was brought up in quite a traditional home. I had boyfriends and was monogamous. Having more than one partner never crossed my mind. In my twenties I got married and settled down in Chorlton fully intending to be with my husband for life.
“The idea that loving more than one person might not make me a terrible human being only dawned on me when, at a pub, I bumped into a person who had more than one partner. I had never come across it before, or the term ‘polyamory’ which means ‘more-than-one love’. I was quite shocked, and curious about how it all worked for them.
“My partner was with me when I met the polyamorous person, and he was curious about it, too. At the time neither of us considered it for ourselves, but I think the seed had been planted.
“A couple of years later, in 2003, I suggested to him that perhaps we might try an open relationship. I was interested to explore the possibility of allowing myself to love more than one person. I think for him it was more about the thought of more than one sexual partner. We were both curious to see how it could work for us.
“For me, it is all about love. Of course, some of my relationships have been sexual, but sex is not the driving force for me.
“I am no longer with the partner that I first explored polyamory with, though he and I remain close friends, and he has continued to be polyamorous.
“I married one of the people I first dated polyamorously. My husband, Tim, who is 43, and I got together in 2004 and were married in 2013 at Manchester Museum under the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
“I have a partner, John, who I have been with since 2011, and who I am planning to ‘marry’ this year. We can’t legally marry, but we are having a full wedding-style commitment ceremony at Chorlton Unitarian church in May.”

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.

Lately my web browser (IE) behaves very different. I think it happened since I downloaded those 'free' screensavers.
You might have caught some so called browser helper objects (BHO). These BHOs are not easy to spot. They can work completely invisible behind the scenes, e.g. report all your web browsing activity to a data miner. Or keep track of how you fill out forms and collect your passwords. They practically never come with an uninstall program and you probably don't know how many you have installed.
Windows XP service pack 2 will introduce a screen that shows you a list of all BHOs that your machine has. It does not provide an uninstall either!

In the end, Every leader fees about 20 cents or significantly less and can take about 10 minutes to produce. I commonly use thread but have discovered which the sewing monofilament in the craft keep (e.g. Interest Lobby) works incredibly nicely for stiffer leaders and may be very potent when completed. I take advantage of tippet rings at the conclusion of mine to ensure I am able to tie tippet ideal to the chief, stress free.

Therefore if I use a Seaguar knot for my leader to tippet link I will be totally free from working with flourocarbon knot much less leaders and just use flouro tippet? You simply saved me a shipload of cash!
In case your line has no loops, there are many selections to connect the leader. The commonest method is often a nail knot, but A neater alternative I’ve been keen on a short while ago is the sheet bend, often known as the weaver’s knot, LAP knot, or flag knot.

Remember when we talked about lead scoring? Well, it isn’t exactly doable without your sales team’s input. How will you know what qualifies a lead for sales without knowing if your defined SQLs are successfully sold? Your marketing and sales teams need to be aligned on the definitions and the process of moving a lead from MQL to SQL to opportunity before you even begin to capture leads.
No matter how effective the subject line you’ll always have subscribers who don’t open it for a variety of reasons. Send your email again specifically targeting a list segment of those who didn’t open the first time around. Not only is this a second chance in case they just missed the first email, it’s another opportunity to further split test subject lines as well as send times.
Beyond that, avoid using all caps, too many exclamation marks, and hyperbolic phrases ("ACT NOW BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT!!!!"). Poorly formatted HTML in your emails can also hurt how they’re handled. Every spam filter is different, so an email might pass through one filter but get flagged by another. For more comprehensive info on how spam filters work and how to avoid them, check out this guide by MailChimp.
Take the email below from Paperless Post, for example. I love the header of this email: It provides a clear CTA that includes a sense of urgency. Then, the subheader asks a question that forces recipients to think to themselves, "Wait, when is Mother's Day again? Did I buy Mom a card?" Below this copy, the simple grid design is both easy to scan and quite visually appealing. Each card picture is a CTA in and of itself -- click on any one of them, and you'll be taken to a purchase page.
We also love how consistent the design of Uber's emails is with its brand. Like its app, website, social media photos, and other parts of the visual branding, the emails are represented by bright colors and geometric patterns. All of its communications and marketing assets tell the brand's story -- and brand consistency is one tactic Uber's nailed in order to gain brand loyalty.
ToFu: Leads at the top of the funnel need awareness. They know nothing about what you offer and what domain you operate in, so you’ll need to create a conversation around both these focus points—without selling your product up front. If you sell CRMs, you attract ToFu leads by talking about how SDRs (sales development representatives) can do their job better using CRM software. Blogs, ebooks and guides are content types that work well at this stage.
Form-Scraping Tool: A form scraping tool that collects submissions on your website's existing forms helps you automatically consolidate all your leads into your contact database, regardless of which form visitors submitted on your website. HubSpot customers can create and embed forms using HubSpot, which automatically populate into your CMS. Non-HubSpot customers can use a form creation tool like Contact Form 7, JetPack, or Google Forms, and then use HubSpot's free collected forms feature to automatically capture form submissions and input them to a contact database.
Lead generation is not a new form of acquiring a business, but business trends and time necessities have found a better way to get new clients. Rather than sitting at a trade show table for hours on end, or setting up a display in hopes that targeted consumers will complete a form, you can have leads generated and sent to you using available technology, all while you can direct your time elsewhere. https://www.nncinfotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Email-marketing-trends.jpg
If you’ve been following along from the beginning, you have now learned how to grow your email list to epic proportions, you’ve segmented your list so that your emails are highly relevant to each individual subscriber, and you’ve learned how to send amazingly effective emails that have a high open-rate. Now you are ready to automate the process and turn your campaigns into money-making machines!
Focus on the reader first. You should always write your emails to address the needs of your subscribers, not yours. Offer ways to solve their problems, don’t simply talk about your products and how great they are. (This is a part that so many companies get wrong.) Ask yourself, what are the biggest pain points/struggles for my subscribers? How can I solve their current problem in this email?
"Why aren't millennials moving?" The subject line of this email campaign reads before citing interesting data about relocation trends in the U.S. Trulia doesn't benefit from people who choose not to move, but the company does benefit from having its fingers on the pulse of the industry -- and showing it cares which way the real estate winds are blowing. https://upcity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/25908941702_23b26766dc_b.jpg
Engage your email readers with content that is short and to the point. Wordiness and fluff have no place in email marketing campaigns. Reveal your purpose up front and talk about how your purpose relates to the customer to get a connection started. Choose large fonts in an easy-to-read style. Your readers may be people who constantly read while they’re on the go or they may have poor eyesight. You’ll want them to be able to read and scan the email quickly.
Companies that pay attention to each of these steps, especially in the early planning stages, and devote the right resources and budget, tend to perform better than the competition. The process isn't simple, and ignoring any of these steps can lead to poor outcomes. Building a killer process, on the other hand, leads to sustained growth and profitability.
Another way to generate leads from social media is to run a contest. Contests are fun and engaging for your followers, and they can also teach you a ton about your audience. It's a win-win. Read our step-by-step guide for growing your email list using social media contests, which covers everything from choosing a platform, to picking a winner, all the way to analyzing your results.
One of the first lessons that I learned about email marketing campaigns is to give sincere thought to how a customer perceives every component of the email, starting with the subject line. Media headlines grab your attention and get you to listen longer or read further. A meaningful subject line for an email offers the same punch. Subject lines should be relevant, interesting and genuine.
When a subscriber is sorted into a segment, it can trigger an automation to send to them. Each person’s interactions with your email campaigns or your website can trigger a sequence of follow-up emails based on their interests, allowing you to hone your message to your targeted audience. For example, if someone visits your pricing page, you know they’re probably further down your sales funnel and will want to follow-up appropriately. Or if they went to a specific product page or clicked on a link for that product, you can send additional information about the product, testimonials and more.
This is the number of visits to your website from unique URLs, not including your own employees. A higher number of website visits means more people are landing on your site. This traffic is acknowledged by Google (and other search engines) as an indication of your website’s authority. As a result, your website starts ranking higher for keywords you’re targeting. One way of getting more visitors to your website is by promoting it extensively on social media.
Promotional emails are one of the most economical ways for any business to connect with customers. Research shows a message is five times more likely to be seen through email than on social media like Facebook or Twitter. That’s why musicians use email marketing software to share their performance schedule with their fans, non-profits use it to get donations and photographers use it to promote their portrait services. It just works. https://www.emailtooltester.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/email-marketing-services.jpg
Essentially, you can tell Office Autopilot what to do if certain things occur. For example, if a customer places an order, you can send an order to your fulfillment house to fulfill that order. Or if a customer leaves, you can send them a last minute special offer. Just select the trigger for the action, then select what list it applies to then select what to do when that action is trigger.
Over the years, businesses have used many tools for lead management, like the rolodex, contact management software and spreadsheets. But these tools function like a system of record. Sales reps just view their leads using these tools; they don’t get context. And that’s where CRM software (customer relationship management software) fills the void. In a CRM, every lead gets their own profile. This profile contains demographic details, a chronological list of every conversation the lead has had with your business, along with all the data/documents you’ve ever shared with them. And all this is just one part of what CRM software can do.
Leads may come from various sources or activities, for example, digitally via the Internet, through personal referrals, through telephone calls either by the company or telemarketers, through advertisements, and events. A 2015 study found that 89% of respondents cited email as the most-used channel for generating leads, followed by content marketing, search engine, and finally events.[2] A study from 2014 found that direct traffic, search engines, and web referrals were the three most popular online channels for lead generation, accounting for 93% of leads.[3] https://www.bkacontent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Email-Marketing-1024x646.jpg
How do you minimize unsubscribe requests and spam complaints for your auto-responder program? The best way to minimize the risk of unsubscribe requests, spam complaints and non-opened emails with your auto responder program is the same way to minimize those risks with all email marketing. Provide useful, engaging content and good offers that your subscribers will care about. You can also use the best practices for managing unsubscribe requests, opt outs and spam complaints that we'll discuss later in this book and which include: prominent and easy-to-find placement of the unsubscribe link, proper opt-out and opt-in messages and asking users to "white list" you in your initial email.
Facebook has been a method for lead generation since its inception. Originally, companies could use outbound links in their posts and information in their bios to attract strangers to their websites. However, when Facebook Ads was launched in 2007, and its algorithm began to favor accounts that used paid advertising, there was a major shift in how businesses used the platform to capture leads. Facebook created Lead Ads for this purpose. Facebook also has a feature that lets you put a simple call-to-action button at the top of your Facebook Page, helping you send Facebook followers directly to your website.
Content: While the download of a coupon shows an individual has a direct interest in your product or service, content (like an educational ebook or webinar) does not. Therefore, to truly understand the nature of the person's interest in your business, you'll probably need to collect more information to determine whether the person is interested in your product or service and whether they're a good fit.

Hi all. I present to Mr. Rabbit. Accompanying this picture I leave my first video with themaking of the session. It is a gift to all who are following me on my blog. I hope that in this way will be easier to keep lighting schemes.
The important thing is to use photo black background and the flash from behind the fund. To give shape to the figures of crystal white I used two screens on the sides.Trying is very simple
The other day I was walking near my house. Passing by a shop I saw this fantastic gallery and I thought I could put in the middle of my great friend Miguel HernandezBorland bluesman. So I immediately got in touch with him and explained my idea. As you know he agreed to pose delighted once again with my camera.
The issue of lighting had it more or less clear. As you see in the picture I used my main flash canon 430 with snoot to highlight more the face and chest but not too builtMichael not to create a very high contrast. To the right of the put a fill flash with atranslucent white umbrella.
In the rear of a two flashes used to highlight the silhouette and the other to illuminate the background and create a sort of flame at the back.
Today on my way home I decided to make this picture. In which a man looking throughhis house Ventada concerned about what was happening outside.
I parent very fair I have time to devote to prepare all these assemblies. Although I think that is complicated is not. As I always say that if you have it in your head everything goes very fast. This simple exercise took me to do about 12 minutes.
Good afternoon. On this day 10 exposure Shadows otherwise see the light. In the presentation I decided to do a portrait of all attendees. This is one of them. Thanks for your time.
As you can see is a simple lighting scheme with a single point of light. Because of the location and the available material and improvisation is what I could get better. The source of lux is right in front of the model shifted slightly to the left of the axis of thecamera. The beauty is homemade disc. I fabricate a tale of dog food. As you can seeeverything is very simple you just have to be taking pictures.
You could have improved the photo by placing a fill flash on the back right of the model to separate some of the background or adding a flash shot to the back wall with a red jelly. That is a matter of imagination.

She is immediately suspended in the middle of the room, dangling helplessly and exposed to the sadistic intentions of her male handler. As her toned and athletic ass is spanked, her mouth is suspended by a huge rubber ball gag tied to end of a rope. As soon as her jaw tires for gripping the ball gag, a massive cock is thrust into her throat coercing her to gag and choke with delight. She is then restrained in a vicious back bend that draws her arms and feet into maximum extension. Her smooth skin is pulled taut and is ruthlessly abused by leather crop. Tired from the sound of her screams and her pleas for mercy, the dom shoves his cock down her throat and jams a hitachi onto her clit. Caseyâ€™s entire body spasms as many unwilling orgasms are ripped from her pussy while nipple clamps yank on her tits. Now that she is warmed up, Casey is flipped onto knees and tied down in a doggystyle position. Before she knows what is happening, the dom takes his giant cock and shoves it into her tight, creamy pussy. Her whole ass shakes while it gets spanked ruthlessly with a leather paddle. She whimpers with delights and begs to cum. But she hasn’t earned the right to orgasm yet and her dom relishes the pain of her orgasm denial. To end the day, Casey is flipped onto her back and is fucked mercilessly in her teeny pink pussy. As sweat pools all over her body she begs to cum with breathless whispers. And when she can’t handle another moment of the hot fucking, the cruel sadist blows a huge load of jizz all over her swollen and engorged pussy.
The world’s most celebrated football tournament is set to start in 18 days, and the authorised distributors of international TV brands are offering attractive schemes targeting soccer enthusiasts in Nepal. Skyworth, Hisense and LG have launched new TV models and different schemes with an eye on the World Cup. FIFA World Cup 2018 is scheduled to be held in Russia from June 14 to July 15.
Smart Appliance Company, a subsidiary of the KL Dugar Group, recently launched Wallpaper TV, a slim television set from Skyworth. In a bid to entice soccer fans to buy new television sets to watch the World Cup matches, Smart Appliances has offered a 25 percent discount on Skyworth TV sets. The company has also launched Google Android TV and multi-functional tea table from the brand.
Prasant Acharya, regional manager (sales and marketing) of Hisense, which is also one of the official sponsors of the FIFA World Cup, said that the company was conducting sales campaigns in different places targeting the World Cup.
The company offers cash back of up to 30 percent on LED televisions. The company also has scratch card and lucky draw schemes where winning customers can take home microwaves, LED TVs, refrigerators and washing machines.
TV sales have doubled this World Cup season compared to the 2014 World Cup, Acharya said. “Affordable prices, upgraded technology and digital channels have led to a boost in TV sales this year,” he added. The company expects to sell 2,500 to 3,000 televisions during this World Cup season.
According to Acharya, 50 percent of the customers prefer 32-inch LED TV, 20 to 25 percent prefer 39 to 43-inch TV, 10 to 16 percent prefer 49 to 60-inch TV and the remaining 10 percent prefer wall TV. Meanwhile, Sanjay Rajbhandary, marketing communications and brand management head at CG Electronics, is hopeful that the LG brand TVs will sell well
“We have aimed to sell 30 percent more TVs this season. Our major focus will be on the 43, 49 and 55-inch segment for the LG brand.” Also, the company will be focusing on TV brands like LG, CG, TCL and Sensei under CG Electronics.
The company is seeing very good demand for TCL Curved TVs in the 49 and 55-inch segment. According to Rajbhandary, people’s preferences are shifting to 32-inch and larger sets.
There is a whole bunch of customers upgrading to the 49-inch and larger segments. “Upgrading to smart TV is growing unbelievably fast,” he said. “All smart TV heavyweights are set to engage in a battle royale during the FIFA World Cup 2018.”

Union minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore Tuesday condemned the Naxal attack in Chhattisgarh in which three people, including a DD News cameraman, were killed.
Sub Inspector Rudra Pratap, Assistant Constable Mangala, and Doordarshan (DD) News cameraman Achyutanand Sahu were killed in a Naxal ambush in poll-bound Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district on Tuesday.
“Prasar Bharati Parivar condoles the death of Cameraman Achyutananda Sahu earlier today near Dantewada in Chhattisgarh. Our prayers with his family during this difficult moment,” the national broadcaster said on its official Twitter handle.
Responding to the tragic news of the attack, Information and Broadcasting Minister Rathore tweeted: “Strongly condemn the Naxal attack on the @DDNewsLive crew in Dantewada. Deeply saddened by the demise of our cameraman Achyuta Nanda Sahu and two jawans of @crpfindia (sic).”
“We will take care of his (cameraman’s) family. We salute all those media persons who go for coverage in such dangerous situations, remember their bravery,” the minister told reporters.
Chairman Prasar Bharati A Surya Prakash expressed heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased.
“Shocked to hear of the attack on DD News and the death of cameraman and security officials. Heartfelt condolences to the families and our prayers,” he said on Twitter.
CEO Prasar Bharati said he was shocked and saddened by the death of “brave cameraman Achyutananda Sahu in the line of duty in Chhattisgarh for the cause of democracy”.
“We stand in solidarity with the brave @DDNewsLive team deployed to cover the upcoming assembly elections in Chhattisgarh,” he said.
Director general Doordarshan Supriya Sahu also expressed sadness at the death of the CRPF jawans and the DD cameraman
“Our hearts go out to the families of our brave cameraperson Shri Achyutananda Sahu and CRPF Jawans who laid down their lives in the line of duty. Salute and respect from Doordarshan family,” she tweeted.
Two policemen were also injured in the incident, which took place at Nilawaya village under the Aranpur police station.

Some atrocities can't be avoided. Like Justin Bieber. But yeah. I've tried to be open-minded about Hunters and Sandworms but at the end I've just decided to send both of them to the desert for Shai-Hulud. But unfortunately both was the digital versions and I had to just send them to a recycle bin
Use of the term "Golden" was probably as propaganda, to divert character's attention from the havoc it would cause.
I just realized this for the first time...the association between "Golden" and the Biblical Golden Calf (which almost even rhymes with Golden Path). After all, the Golden Path was about setting up a living God to be worshipped, an idol to oppress the universe until it exploded. Now that I think of it I can't help but thing this was intentional and was exactly what Frank had in mind. That would make "Golden Path" literally be the blueprint for the actual plan of action, and in some ironic sense make an idol of gold just as the ancient Hebrews did, turning value on its head and showing that the thing which people worship is why they verge toward decadence. In the Bible what they worshipped was gold, but in Frank's world what they worship is leaders and heroes, so what better way to give a lesson their bones would remember than to give them exactly what they do desperately wanted - their version of the Golden Calf - the KH as a God.

I never thought that before. I thought he was just invoking the idea of things like the shining path.

to achieve that end, Leto II consolidated the known universe under his rule and enforced millennia of political/cultural/economic stability and tranquility. the whole point of this was to build up wanderlust, innovation, and rebellion against charismatic authority
by concentrating power in his hands, that meant that his death would be the bursting of a societal dam that had stood for millennia, releasing a torrent of energy and expansion which became The Scattering. by spreading the human race far and wide in the universe, by breeding prescience-cloaking genes, by encouraging innovation (no-globes, ixian navigators, etc.), and by weaning the human race off of their dependence on spice from Arrakis, he ensured human survival.
he didn't do this for power, narcissism, or long life. in fact, Leto II took on a huge burden and sacrifice (which was too much for Paul-Muad'dib) to prevent human extinction.
This is somewhat off-topic, but it just occurred to me: Leto's Peace is structured like Plato's Republic. Leto II as philosopher-king, Fish Speakers as the guardian class, and everyone else as workers/producers.

Assuming the comparison is apt (I'll be reading the Republic again in a few months, most likely, so I can check up on it) do you take this to mean that Plato himself was satirizing the notion of a good republic in his dialogue just as Leto II was deliberately satirizing bad government?
inhuien wrote: Hmm, never thought of Leto's 3500 year reign as a polictal pun. Or have I missed your point?
Pun? He created the most oppressive government possible in order to guarantee that no one like him could control all of humanity ever again. The point of his reign was to teach the universe a lesson their bones would remember about how awful things were under him. It was certainly not an attempt to demonstrate how good government should operate. It was an example of how not to govern, which makes it a satire of itself. My question was whether, likewise, Plato was deliberately describing the worst possible government in order to make a point.
it's debatable. was the Republic an earnest attempt at conceiving of an ideal society? or was it meant as a warning against idealism? personally I don't think it was satire, even if it tread onto unrealistic and dangerous ground. the overall argument is complex and rational, and it has excellent ideas that have shaped philosophy ever since (allegory of the cave, etc).
while I'm fascinated with the ideas of the Republic, I'm also wary of utopias. In history, most utopian efforts have resulted in dystopia (and that to a nightmarish extent). even if all goes well, the problem I have is with stasis. I believe societies should be continuously growing and changing. Remaining stable in a certain form, even a very good one, creates risks. what if the status quo is broken, and the efficient utopia can't adapt to a new situation? the result is breakdown and chaos (like the Famine Times and Scattering).
the comparison is correct, in fact it's an unexpected parallel. Plato's Republic aims to build a utopia, while Leto II builds a "utopia" (or very unusual dystopia) in order to ensure that massive change happens afterward and humanity's survival is secured. What they have in common, aside from basic structure, is stability. both are designed to maintain their status quo for the greater good.
Wasn't sure in which thread to post this picture, but I thought it was neat. Never heard this quote from Honest Abe before, and after doing a bit of checking it seems to be a false attribution to him than began recently. But I've decided to pretend he said it anyhow.
“Our republican system was meant for a homogeneous people. As long as blacks continue to live with the whites they constitute a threat to the national life. Family life may also collapse and the increase of mixed breed bastards may some day challenge the supremacy of the white man.”

Wow, never heard that one. I did some checking, though, and apparently the internet is getting to be a tough place to parse whether quotes are really accurate. It seems the one you cited was actually contained in a letter from the Reverend James Mitchell of Indiana, written to Lincoln. Crazy world.
Realy? I tried to check it out before I posted it but... oh well. I had heard a similar quote that day on the radio but I couldn't find it and that one came up.
I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, [applause]—that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. ~ Abraham Lincoln

James Shoemaker of Patten, Wornom, Hatten & Diamonstein is a leading lawyer on the Peninsula who regularly sues employers on behalf of his employee clients. So, when he addresses attendees of the final showing of the 34th Annual Employment Law Update at the Hampton Roads Convention Center, his perspective on how he chooses employers to sue should be helpful to employers who want to keep from being sued.

Mr. Shoemaker will not be the only highlight of the July 19th final showing of the 34th Annual Employment Law Update. A number of representatives from relevant state and federal employment law agencies like the EEOC will also be on hand to help the K&C Employment Team present a number of topics, including Handling Unemployment Claims; How to Effectively Document Employment Actions; How to Deal with the Toxic Employee; Problem Absenteeism and a Workplace Harassment Update. Also, the ever-popular K&C Answer Booth will help provide answers to all employment related questions attendees may have.
The 34th Annual Employment Law Update is intended to provide employers and HR professionals with the latest legal updates along with practical ways to avoid legal claims. Entertaining videos will be presented in keeping with an Office Party theme to help employers see what they should avoid doing in the workplace to reduce liability.

“If you want a winning role, act like a scientist. Talk like a scientist. Imagine that everything you say is backed by a study published in a peer-reviewed journal.” (The Underground, Jon Rappoport)
Objectivity. What more could you want? What could be more objective than science? What could be less open to dispute? Who could be more authoritative than a scientist? What could influence public opinion more thoroughly than a whole group of scientists, an establishment of scientists, backed by the government?
Notice that when a news anchor takes an unimpeachable statement from a scientist, they both sound like scientists. The double whammy.
“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.” —Marcia Angell, MD (“Drug Companies and Doctors: A story of Corruption.” NY Review of Books, Jan. 15, 2009.)
Essentially, Angell is saying that fraud dressed up to look like science is pervasive in official medical media.
Take the breaking story of NBC’s Brian Williams, “the most trusted name in news.” He lied about being in a helicopter taking fire in Iraq in 2003. He admitted the lie yesterday, and in his confession he apparently lied again, giving the false impression that the helicopter right in front of his took the fire, when at least one soldier on the scene states that Williams’ helicopter wasn’t even in the same formation, but landed some time later.
The impact of Williams lying is magnified by his persona of objectivity, which is on display every night on NBC. The objective man was lying. He was making it up. He was faking it.
Consider the 2004 Pediatrics study which exonerated the MMR vaccine and claimed it was in no way connected to autism. Objective science. But last August, one of the authors of the study, William Thompson, a long-time researcher at the CDC, released a statement through his attorney, Rick Morgan, confessing that he and his co-authors had lied, omitted vital data, rigged the study, in order to give the vaccine a free pass.
Centuries ago, when a ruling priest addressed an audience and shouted and pointed at the sky and warned of great danger and destruction, and told of curses, and laid out a path for appeasing the gods, he was considered an “objective authority.” He wasn’t accused of ranting.
Today, the appearance of scientific objectivity is the key. Whoever holds that key is considered an authority. Therefore, many, many people affect that pose. Especially in the news business.
In days gone by, priestly shouting was accepted as a truth-indicator and thus induced a trance. Today, the pose of science induces the trance.
This is the reality egg: the pose and appearance of scientific objectivity. This is how the egg is built.
But here is the truth. The egg, the enclosed dome are being built for us by messengers who appear to be objective. They’re the narrators. They’re the news princes and the “scientists.” They’re the key actors.
They can mix image and word and algorithm and computer model to prove anything, and in doing so they can act as if they’re reporting facts—rather than building the egg.
The egg is there for one reason: to convince us that each one of us can’t invent his own open realities, to convince us that we can’t find ways to cooperate, as free and independent and powerful individuals, and crack the egg.

Is he one of those symbols that have become a hardened energy…once the cracks appear, it won’t take long and he will be shuffled of to pasture with a field full heifers. And they will bring on a new ‘Max headroom’.
“A guy walks into the doctor’s office. A banana stuck in one of his ears, a head of lettuce in the other ear, and a carrot stuck in one nostril. The man says, “Doc, this is terrible. What’s wrong with me?” The doctor says, “Well, first of all, you need to eat more sensibly.”
There isn’t much pure science being done anymore. Too much big business behind it all now. It does tend to squew the results.
Why? I can’t imagine “Stars and Stripes” would run story like that without approval, so why would the regime want to discredit a loyal salesman like Brian Williams?
I read the S&S article and the comments section. This is largely a Step To The Right audience poised for an anti-liberal “event”. The Powers That Be are getting ready for the pendulum to swing back to the right politically in our living soap opera. This will fit nicely with the narrative. A swinging pendulum keeps us all in a trance.
Must be something like that. They throw one of the fortunate ones to the wolves every once in a while. Lance, Tiger, Cosby….Maybe to keep the other baboons in line?
The sad news of this posting, so many lives are being sacrificed fueled by all the corrupt entities, not held accountable and protected legally against public recourse.
This is very true. In the past, you could not question a priest. Now, you can’t question a scientist. The stupidity of the human race never goes away. The forms of the stupidity merely change with the times. You used to be able to lie to people in the language of faith. Now, you must lie to them in the language of Science (Scientism). EVERYTHING I said in this comment has been verified by peer-reviewed studies in major medical journals. So, you can feel proud of believing it.
His job is lying. He is doing a good job overall, so he gets to keep his job. Unless people stop believing him. Then he will be fired.
This is a deadly serious issue that calls into question the conviction in which we hold our own core beliefs to be relevant in a healthy and functioning society. In our desire to advance Humanity to its highest state of being, we must vow to hold our institutions and ourselves to the highest…
OH SCREW THAT! I haven’t stopped laughing since this morning when I heard that Big-Time-TeeVee-News-Boy got his nuts in a wringer for lying through his teeth!!
Very true. I once worked in television news. Most all of it was rubbish and not really important at all. The real news is never reported. I hope your readers appreciate your “cracking” of the egg here. Now go get your vaccinations my good sheeple. The gubmint says its good for you!
*“If you want a winning role, act like a scientist. Talk like a scientist. Imagine that everything you say is backed by a study published in a peer-reviewed journal.”*
In addition to Brian Williams, another one who is a true master in this way of presenting himself is none other than (“a child can handle 10,000 vaccines!” (http://vactruth.com/2012/04/16/10000-crazy-vaccines/) and “inventor of rotavirus vaccine” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Offit)) **Dr Paul Offit.**
then do a find on Offit and read what he had to say in response to soft and semi-hard questions,… (he was the third and final guest — so scroll down)
On a related note, cnnmoney is promoting an anti-anti-establishment kill piece on “the vaccine skeptics”, following the money trail as though this group was any different than the AMA etc. funding its own research. They have a new young voice of authority / cheerleader. Ugh. http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2015/02/05/the-money-behind-the-vaccine-medical-myth.cnnmoney/index.html?iid=HP_LN
Wow. That is like one long comedy of logical errors and unsupported assumptions. People used to think the smallpox vaccine caused their child to get diabetes, but then we isolated insulin and that “nonsense” went away. Really? “Yes, Mrs. Smith, we’ve determined your child’s diabetes couldn’t have been caused by the vaccine because it was actually caused by a sudden and inexplicable inability to produce insulin.”
Offit didn’t want to debate the opposition because the science is all on his side, and it wouldn’t be fair. I guess it just wouldn’t help the viewers to watch him slay the opposition with superior science. The viewers will be much better served if he just announces afterward that everything the opposition said was nonsense.
They lay the egg to us very carefully, with a lot of dexterity, otherwise, they might drop it and the egg would crack open.
How badly they flail about when their shortcomings and deceit are exposed for all to see. “Pay no attention to that man over there!” And so was all who beheld the spectacle of their majesty, enthralled with their trances. It is they, who say what the reality is, and it is the masses, who are expect to consume the toxic atmosphere of subdued self-judgment – in the face of “the gods of truth”.
Be he cursed, he who of self-propelled determination and keen insight, that he shall endanger the molded minds of the many. Let his words nary be heard, but barely above the whisper of the breeze. Let his heart be shorn from him, that he may feel not, the pangs of righteous indignation when put to him, those things that injure his individuality. Let the masses rejoice in their omnipotent ignorance, and in their reverence for the “sooth-sayers” of the day. For the majority be made up of sincere fools!
Wow! His apology is even worse. Brian didn’t lie, he misremembered… Or didn’t chose to make this mistake.
Ok, but he lied about that for the first time in 2003, the same year it happened. He’s able to conflate an event in which he participated with an event he made up… or heard about 30-60 minutes later? This guy is able to conflate a normal ride with being on a different helicopter that was hit by an RPG. Isn’t grotesque enough?
It seems that all others NBC employees with him that day in the same helicopter have never tried to correct him. They have allowed the false story to be aired again and again.
Few people say Brian Williams should be fired because he’s a liar. Come on! Lying is what Brian does for living. The first day he stops, the system will collapse.
We’re so steeped in willful institutional deception it’s a wonder consensus reality is holding together at all. Do people like Williams really understand how low they’ve sunk? Have we, as a society, wandered so far off track that we no longer care about basing our lives here on any semblance of integrity? A shockingly sad state of affairs when you really think about it. I hope you’re right, that “their strategy and pose is failing”. Seems that’s only true if people, on a massive scale, are seeing the deception; is that happening yet?

Someone or something that has changed dramatically to become decreased in vivacity in some way, often following negative circumstances or some traumatic event. Ever since Tim was in that accident, he's been a shadow of his former self. She's so quiet now, like a shadow of her former self. Does anyone know what happened to the bubbly girl we once knew? Many of the town's residents moved away, leaving it a shadow of its former self.
To be weaker or inferior in comparison to how someone or something was previously, often due to negative circumstances. After suffering from a prolonged illness, Sharon was a shadow of her former self. This town is a shadow of its former self after so many of its residents have moved away.

Someone or something that has changed dramatically to become decreased in vivacity in some way, often following negative circumstances or some traumatic event. Tom's been nothing but a shadow of his old self since that accident, his bubbly, outgoing persona replaced by gloom and seriousness. The mass emigration of workers from the country during the recession has left it a mere shadow of its old self.
Selves leave no fossils, so we cannot know for certain how the first colonial (multicellular) organisms came to sense their selves.
However, as Michael Schoenfeldt's Bodies and Selves in Early Modern England makes clear, it is still quite possible to say important and original things about both bodies and selves, and about the ways in which early modern writers imagined each in terms of the other.
Guernsey uses this observation to argue against Stephen Greenblatt and others who can f ind only socially constructed selves in the Renaissance, only what amount to Winnicottian "false selves.
The Pulse of Praise: Form as Second Self in the Poetry of George Herbert & Writing the Flesh: The Herbert Family Dialogue
People have a need to view them selves as good and meaningful citizens of their cultures," Heine remarks.

Mandy Izzo is a Senior Science Writer for the Institute for Disease Modeling, where she develops scientific content for the global health community. She earned a BA in Integrative Biology from the University of California, Berkeley; an MS in Biology from California State University, Northridge; and a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Michigan. Her training was furthered during post-doctoral positions at the University of California, Davis, first in the Department of Entomology and Nematology, and then in the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology. She has over 11 years of field and lab experience in the biological sciences that include the design, oversight, execution, and analysis of projects. Trained as an Evolutionary Ecologist with specialization in the Behavioral Ecology of insects, Mandy’s work on insects has spanned topics such as the evolution of cricket song in the presence of an acoustically-orienting parasitic fly; the evolution of signals mediating inter- and intra-sexual selection in paper wasps; how multi-modal signals interact to mediate social interactions among dominance hierarchies in social insects; and how social interactions maintain honesty in communication. In addition to her work on insects, she has forayed into other taxa as well, examining the functionality of zebra stripes and studying the social, hormonal, and genetic basis of aggressive behavior of female tree swallows. Mandy is passionate about science communication, and aims to help make science more accessible between fields as well as to the general public. Her enjoyment of engaging others in science is manifest in her numerous publications and award-winning presentations. She holds a long-standing interest in public health and epidemiology, and is extremely excited for the opportunity to participate in the scientific process with a group that strives towards increasing transparency in science.

This paper examines how different unionisation structures affect firms' innovation incentives and industry employment. We distinguish three modes of unionisation with increasing degree of centralisation: (1) "Decentralisation" where wages are determined independently at the firm-level, (2) "coordination" where one industry union sets individual wages for all firms, and (3) "centralisation" where an industry union sets a uniform wage rate for all firms. While firms' investment incentives are largest under "centralisation", investment incentives are non-monotone in the degree of centralisation: "Decentralisation" carries higher investment incentives than "coordination". Labour market policy can spur innovation by decentralising unionisation structures or through non-discrimination rules.

Nottingham emotive pop punks HIGH TIDES have debuted a new music video for their song “Bridges”, coming from their sophomore mini-album “I’m Not Giving Up, I’m Just Starting Over”, slated for a March 17th release via Scylla Records! The track ignites the fire within you due to catchy lines and powerful performance, whose optimism is counterbalanced with some nostalgic feel. Just like the very core of the pop punk genre, these guys seem to be built on a multiplicity of identities that allows us to love them, but not necessarily appreciate the generic parts of their offering and whether or not you’d like to argue about these guys, theirnew track is worth a check!
Nottingham quintet HIGH TIDES, describe themselves as ‘putting emo into pop punk since 2015’. The forthcoming release is self-described as covering themes including “heartbreak, learning from mistakes and realising that things do get better; sometimes you just have to make a fresh start for that to happen.”
HIGH TIDES have for the most part, been in eachother’s lives for years and some even from school age:
“We’ve all been in bands previously both together and separately, but this final line up just clicked instantly both musically and socially”.
Within the busy sphere pop punk, HIGH TIDES say that what sets them apart from their contempories is both their music and their live show:
“We feel our sound brings some fresh elements to the UK Pop punk sound, being a bit deeper and more mature than other bands on the scene, tending to stray from the typical ‘In sound’ currently being shared. Live it’s always crazy energetic and we put absolutely everything into it, we don’t feel we’ve done a good enough job unless we come off stage looking like we’ve had a bath in sweat.”

From the pigs we processed this winter, we cured and smoked the hams, bacon, and most of the shoulders. They came out amazingly well. We gathered information from books and other farmers to devise a system that fit within our resource constraints.
Here is the smoker. A fire is built in the stove, and the smoke is vented out to where the meat is hanging.
This bacon has been curing in the curing mixture. It was hung here so we can spray the salt off, so that it doesn't get overly salty.
The final product, hanging in the house. We cut the bacon into usable sizes, and froze it. This bacon was hands down the best bacon that most people surveyed had ever eaten.
Many a late night was devoted to grinding sausage. Here we have some smoked kielbasa- another amazing blessing from the pig.

Fans had found out that a sequel was in the works thanks to a major leak from Walmart Canada last week. After that, the official Twitter profile of RAGE has been reactivated and actually stayed active for the following days. The game seems to have several warring factions mowing each other down in pure mayhem.
Unlike the first game, Rage 2 boasts a full open world wasteland for players to traverse. Now, we finally have something concrete.
It won't be the studio's first female-led film - Brie Larson is already set to enter the franchise as Captain Marvel in 2019. Adding further to it Marvel revealed, "We have plans for that once we've introduced Captain Marvel to the world".
Pre-Order for RAGE 2 is available right now priced at $59.99 implementing several pre-order bonuses. This entire incident resulted in a teaser for Rage 2 which barely showed us anything about the game. Publisher Bethesda has teamed up with id Software and Avalanche Studios to create an open world shooter that looks like Resdient Evil meets Destiny.
Bethesda is promising a "carnival of carnage where you can go anywhere, shoot anything, and explode everything". In an interview with German-language publication GameStar (via Google Translate), creative director Tim Willits was quick to address this, saying that he "can say for sure" that the game will not have any loot boxes. However, this blood has also made them a target for the Authority, and after years of fighting, Walker is the only Ranger still standing. Take a look at the new footage for yourself above. The earth is now a wasteland where ruthless gangs are fighting over territorial power.
There are also a host of party primaries, other races and measures on the Central Oregon ballots. Those who have not voted yet can still return their ballot by 8 p.m.to a ballot drop site.
One aspect of Rage 2 that (amazingly) hasn't leaked is the release date. As expected, RAGE 2 will have some sort of storyline apart from the following, however, no further information has been revealed. However, the official description of Rage 2 provides some clues. It does a brilliant job of showing off the game's open-world, it's traversal options from monster trucks to gyrocopters, and the weaponry, which includes guns, mechs and more.
Looking at the brief gameplay trailer, you can already see the game forming. Though, it did manage to capture that Mad Max vibe, as it featured characters with outlandishly punk costumes taunting on screen.
A Ranger's arsenal isn't limited to the abundance of upgradeable weapons and toys at their disposal. It is argued that with proper use neotricula abilities, Walker is able to emerge victorious from even a hopeless fight.

11LHDVD4-8 - Frank Butler - GOD LOVES WINNERS - DONATION $6.00 - Eight times in Revelation, we read "to him who overcome". In Acts 16:16, the girl said the right thing but with the wrong spirit. The devil will use scripture to trip you up and attack Jesus. Whose authority are we under? Sin shortens our life. Know that when someone attacks you unjustly, there's something wrong in their life. Paul and Silas were able to sing and pray even while incarcerated wrongly. That's freedom in the spirit - vs 27, 33. "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in the time of trouble," Ps.46:1. When your ways please the Lord, even our enemies are at peace with us. Joy comes from serving Jesus.
17LHDVD12-7 [DVD - $6.00] - Geri McGhee - BITTERNESS - The Word of God says it’s the truth that sets us free. Yes, sometimes we need some help from ministers or teachers but the Word of God is the truth that brings freedom into our lives. However, we are required to obey what His Word tells us in order to receive the benefits. We must deal with fear, anger, hurt, and depression, all of which leads to bitterness in our lives - if we want to be free and if we want to see God. We must repent if we want to get free of the demons attached. God is merciful and will show us the things that we need to repent for. The Word of God tells us that a curse without a cause cannot light. So if there’s a curse, there’s a cause. How we respond to our trials decides whether we will be bitter or better so we must learn the correct way to respond. Deliverance is all about repentance. When we repent, the demons leave because they have no grounds to stay. One example Geri uses is about what happens if we are not producing acceptable fruit. Bitterness in our lives will cause us to produce bad fruit. John 15 tells us that if we bear no fruit, we are cut off as a branch, and destroyed by burning which may pertain to terminal diagnosis from your physician. Ephesians 4:17-32 gives instruction on how we are to walk if we want to be fruitful- how we are to treat others as well as instruction to not grieve the Holy Spirit of God. The things we go thru in this life are to conform us to the image of Christ according to Romans 8:28, 29. In Romans 8:10-13 we read of the danger of wounding someone’s conscience. What happens is, whatever is done to them begins to manifest in the wounded one. Example: If someone is molested, they may begin to masturbate or molest someone else. They have received the spirit of the one that wounded them. Until they forgive, they are bonded to the molester. Romans 2:1 says we become like the one we judge. Regardless of the situation, we must forgive, so that no root of bitterness can grow. Prayers and ministry for deliverance conclude this message.

ah I really can't wait to start, I hope to be feeling the same way very soon. :D[CSVLB]Sunday 10/19/08
I have a decent amount of fat on my chest and very small bumps under my nipples. They never itch or anything like that just when I where tight shirts they pop out. I am about to do my very first cycle of Super One for 4 weeks. Would you guys recommend I use an anti-e while on the cycle?[CSVLB]Have one handy, at least. Just in case it makes what you have worse, then use. But don't just start using it, as estrogen can be our friend, too.
Ok so I decided it would be a good idea to weigh myself this weekend. Friday night before I go to bed (I know at night is a lot less accurate I weighed myself and it came up 253.5! That's 11lbs in a week? So I woke and weighed myself and it still said 252.5! That's 10lbs in a week.so then i weighed myself on a different scale this morning and it came up 247.5 which is still 6lbs. Since they're different scales I don't really know what to think. I'm assuming it's just water weight though. My GF (who saw me 2 weeks ago said I looked bigger and so did my parents (haven't seen in a month and my lifting buddy (sees me just about everyday said I looked bigger as well. I guess that all means I'm getting bigger whether that has anything to do with the JW is still to be determined. It's been a week so hopefully I'll start to notice things here and there to let me know it's working within the next week.[CSVLB]Back and Bis:
BENZ- You do seem to know your stuff-Keep up the good work![CSVLB]Mag-10 is a great supplement. I have also had good results with too.

so far so good, Somadrol keeps my life in check in many ways, recovery is the biggest part of growing, i feel without a natural sleep aid i wouldnt be able to grow.

total: around 5000-5150 cals[CSVLB]updates have been delayed due to no internet home but all is still going well
and i went to cooldown and place some basketball. As soon as i got down to the court, i was still eager to lift some more. I went and did some extra sets :D
Tommorrow: Chest/Abs. I plan on maxing out on the bench. I haven't done this in forever, and I'm curious how much strength I've gained in the past few months:)[CSVLB]Good luck with maxing out. Warm up and kill the weight.[CSVLB]Chest/Abs:
I'm glad you enjoyed the review, and I hope I can do a few more for you guys in the future. It takes time, and it takes honesty, and it takes genuine effort and thought, but clearly there are some endeavors that are more than worth it, and I thought MAN was certainly one. Thanks for your generosity. :)
is my lab Hogg. He had a sister named Harley but she died and it's just him now. He is super sweet, unless you're a stranger and we aren't outside when you pull up, lol.
Thanks man, I appreciate the advice. What I was thinking of doing is splitting back/shoulders into two workouts, as I have done in the past. The reason this one took so long is we were essentially doing 2 workouts in one. Great for adding size because of how frequently you are able to hit each muscle group, but maybe not ideal for a precontest diet. I will see what I can do about speeding up the workouts.
I have been intermittent fasting for a few months now and know exactly what you are talkign about. You get so bloated after those 8 hours of eating because i just down food but afterwards you are nice and lean. I have seen myself loose weight while gain strength for about 3 months straight now. Slow but steady. Awesome style and very convienient.
meal 4: piece of the homemade protein bar found of keto recipes thread, and four slices provolone cheese
they are just on another level compared to other bars[CSVLB]Thanks for the support! Enjoyed meeting you at the Arnold last year, and bummed that I did not make it this year.
Well only 40 lbs to go until my squats back up. My legs have always lagged, I hope to change that this year by transforming them by treetrunk porportions.[CSVLB]good leg workout, your squats will progress quickly, don't worry[CSVLB]good leg workout, your squats will progress quickly, don't worry

I’m pleased to now offer to live directed sessions with Source Connect for voice over. Robert Marshall, Co-Founder of the Source Connect company, Source Elements, went above and beyond with a call to go through the set up, use, and features of this powerful ISDN replacement tool. While I use REAPER as my DAW, it is fully supported by Source Connect. We successfully tested the remote control video sync playback for dubbing.
Speaking of dubbing, that’s part of the reason why I’m going with Source Connect for voice over and no longer subscribe to ipDTL. I love ipDTL, and it’s a fantastic tool for podcasting and broadcasting. But, it doesn’t have video playback for dubbing/ADR. I paid for the full package for ipDTL, including the dedicated Los Angeles ISDN number, and none of my clients wanted to use it.
In fact, my European clients who had both ipDTL and the similar SessionLink Pro were using the latter exclusively over ipDTL. They found their SessionLink Pro connections to be better and of higher quality with fewer artifacts, and we could do video playback with it.
This brought me back to a core value: providing the right tools for my clients. If a client wants to do an ipDTL session and they own a subscription, I can still log into their session. But choice isn’t mine as the voice over talent. Over the years, I managed to encourage a few corporate clients to try ipDTL; but in general they are not interested. Lately, they prefer to use Go To Meeting or Skype for Business because most of these projects require conference calls hosted in an office, not in a production studio.
ipDTL confused too many of my corporate clients. Podcasters and broadcasters understand it, but not business people. It took me an hour once to show a video game producer in the UK how to set up her laptop for ipDTL. And on top of that, the Opus Codec on which ipDTL runs is highly unreliable on Windows 10 for a substantial number of users. Note that on September 18, 2018 they launched a big update of Opus Codec which hopefully fixes many issues. Check my previous post on alternatives to Chrome for Opus Codec streaming.
I realized that my Corporate, E-Learning, and Explainer Video clients don’t need ipDTL at all. My studio is covered for them with phone patch or Skype, Go To Meeting, and so on. But for commercial, animation, and dubbing, I need the right tools. Those tools are ISDN and Source Connect. Major American production studios have adopted Source Connect; and accept them going through their firewalls, which is not the case with Opus Codec solutions. As for ISDN, I have access to many nearby Atlanta recording studios for ISDN sessions. From my own studio, I’m happy to offer Source Connect for voice over. An added bonus I can offer for live sessions is with my Yamaha MG10XU USB mixer, I can playback takes on demand whether using Source Connect, ipDTL, or SessionLink Pro. It’s all about having the best tools for my clients.
Voice Over recording and editing with REAPER just like one would do in Edit Mode of Adobe Audition is not only possible, it’s easy and more powerful. Admittedly, I looked at Reaper several times in the past and it seemed too complicated, and I couldn’t figure out how to make quick time selection edits which are crucial for VO editing. But then I found a hack by that makes it just like editing in Edit mode in Adobe Audition. The video on how to do it is here at The Booth Junkies YouTube Channel. You just set up a Action command key to do four steps at once. It takes one minute to set it up. Okay, maybe two or three with a good cup of tea or coffee.
4.) Set a key shortcut and name for these Custom Actions (I chose “Delete”). I also then set “0” for deleting sections of track Items so I could do that as well.
Yes, there is a learning curve with REAPER, but I got it up to speed in three days and I’m doing e-learning editing, etc. with it. In principle, I’m not paying Adobe a likely $3k over the next decade in their quest to replace human voices with digital ones. You know that Audition is not going to be $19.99 a month ten years from now, right? But you get so much more with using REAPER over Adobe Audition, and for only a $225 one-time payment, which also covers upgrades through version 6.99. That should leave you set for about a decade. There is a 60-day free trial period, and if you are making less than $20,000 with REAPER, the non-commercial license is $60. Another nice bonus over Audition is according to the terms, “If you own multiple computers, you may install the same license key on all of them, as long as you only use REAPER on one computer at a time.”
Once you’ve worked out how to do voice over recording and editing with REAPER, you will soon see that it’s incredibly powerful, similar to DAWs like Cubase. There is fully customizable punch and roll capabilities. In Audition, there is only a nice but limited free Add-On to do so. REAPER also has spectral editing, but what I love is the Spectral Peaks capability, so you can really see what the words are in the wavelengths. Here’s an example below. Different peak frequencies appear in different colors. Perfect for unicorn-lovers and chasing away the drab interface of Audition.
Note two other things in the screenshot above. You can drop in markers as you record (the red lines), and the grey/gray separation lines are for the ‘items’ that are automatically created when you make an edit. No more confusion as in Audition as to what you actually just cut, especially since REAPER is ‘non-destructive’ editing. I added in the little track icon for the shotgun mic, one of the nice features for labeling tracks.
You can apply effects, such as noise reduction, to the whole track or selections. Honestly find the built in dynamic processing in REAPER to be superior in quality and speed to that of Audition. As for VST plug-in use, I noticed that running Izotope RX6 Elements Noise Reduction had better latency and quicker rendering with REAPER.
Another nice feature is that you don’t “Save” keeper takes/files. You “Render” them. So, when I’m done with a voice over I select the time parameters with the cursor and Render the time selection to a computer Directory. On Adobe, it just shows you the time it will take to Save. In REAPER it pops up a window with a live-generated waveform and metering levels of the audio. So you can see ahead of time if the exported levels are correct, and if there’s any clipping. Sweet!
One of my biggest beefs with Adobe Audition is their gimmicky pre-sets without the power to do substantial things. For example, you can play-back at 2x speed with Audition. That’s helpful for editing long narration, but with even the latest Audition CC 2018 any hard consonants come across as popped plosives. And 2x is a bit too fast for intelligible playback. Even basic Sound Forge lets one play back at custom speeds and the playback is flawless. With REAPER, the playback at higher slider-selected speed it excellent. Just remember to set it back to 1.0 when you Render your files, otherwise it will save it at the fast speed! When I first made this mistake I realized something: REAPER’s time-stretching/compressing power. You can shorten or lengthen audio and it sounds perfect. Just press ALT and move the cursor to the edge of an Item. You can pull it out or in. It will re-set to the new speed to fill in the space. You can make a :30 a :20 and it doesn’t sound artificial like it does in Audition. Whenever I tried to make time changes of more than 8% there would be all kinds of staggered sounds. Not so with REAPER! Here’s a :12 clip followed by it again sped waaaay up to :09. And this edit was done using an mp3, not even a loss-less file!
And yes, when you make these changes when working with a video file, it will change the video timing too! You can make simple video edits within REAPER. If you copy, delete, or paste a section of the audio, it will do the same to the video. Pretty cool stuff. If you are working on Windows, in order to work with video in REAPER you will need to download the free VLC Media Player available here.
So far so good – after using Audition for much of my voice over career I’ve switched to REAPER and I’m doing more with it than I ever did with Audition. I’ll post more as I learn new tricks and tips. For now, there’s a great amount of YouTube videos on voice over recording and editing with REAPER that are extremely helpful. I encourage you to go check them out as I will be doing when I have the time!
There are many resources now for streaming audio over an internet browser, such as ipDTL, SessionLinkPro, and Bodalgocall. While conventional wisdom says to use such streaming services on a Chrome browser, that’s not necessarily your only, or best, choice. There are now also many alternatives to Chrome for audio streaming voice over studio connections. Chrome uses the Opus Codec for streaming audio, but what is Chrome? It’s an Open Source Chromium browser. The difference between a Chrome and Chromium browser is well explained in this How-To Geek article. There are many of those other than Chrome, and they’re not made by Alphabet / Google. So, in fact, you can use these services in most cases with any Open Source Chromium browser such as Opera or Yandex. I was the first voice over talent to test ipDTL on either of those browsers and I regularly run my sessions with the Opera browser. But why would you need alternatives to Chrome for Audio Streaming? Consider the following four points:
Google is always stripping out or killing off programs and capabilities, as well as releasing incompatible upgrades. Can you trust Chrome will always work?
Redundancy and backup services. Always good policy to have backups in the toolbox for audio streaming voice over in case Chrome lets you down.
Outside of Opera and Yandex, there is another Chrome solution other than the latest Chrome browser. The support staff at ipDTL recommends using the M57 and not the latest version of Chrome. ipDTL has also released stable Chromium versions which are free to download at the Facebook ipDTL Users Group. Join up, and then search for Chromium Browsers. I highly recommend the group for all your technical questions related to ipDTL, and they’re very quick and helpful with their responses.
As for the Edge browser, they’re getting closer to supporting Opus Codec for streaming but dragging their heels. Recall that a few years back Microsoft promised a Skype TX high-quality audio streaming voice over service but that was all hype and no action. Not even an alpha version was developed. So, don’t hold your breath for that.
However, Firefox has upped their game in so many ways with the new Firefox Quantum browser. It’s fast, stable, and works with almost any application or site. Most of all, while Firefox has supported Opus Codec since 2012, it now supports audio streaming solutions. I’ve successfully used it on many sessions on Windows 10 with ipDTL and SessionLink Pro. Still, there is not complete support/compatibility with Firefox Quantum, but it’s very close. I asked Kevin Leach of In:Quality, the company behind ipDTL and he replied:
“Frustratingly, Firefox has always been slightly behind the Blink based browsers such as Chrome in terms of what we need to get the best out of ipDTL. That said, it’s come on some way recently and you can now run ipDTL in Firefox with just a couple of limitations, and this is a neat solution for those who have had audio problems between Chrome and Windows 10.
We’ve actually been throwing some of our own development effort into Firefox recently – as its open source structure allows us to do so – which should hopefully see things like output device selection being possible in the near future. This means that we’ll soon be able to announce full support for Firefox in ipDTL, allowing for greater flexibility in browser choice. Our contribution here will also benefit users of ipDTL ‘lookalike’ apps.”
So there you have it. If you need alternatives to Chrome for audio streaming voice over studio connections you have several choices: M57 Chrome, Custom Chromium, Opera, Yandex, and Firefox Quantum.
When hiring a voice over talent and fixing your budget for your project, there are many variables to consider. Yet all of which can be addressed with current and accurate Voice Over Rate Guides. Especially relevant are these questions:
Which media? Web Usage is not inexpensive anymore, and is now more in line with conventional broadcast.
First, let’s look at the current rates for Union Voice Over Talent with the SAG/AFTRA rate calculator. This is an excellent interactive guide to show producers exactly how much a union voice over costs and what the money goes to. Even as a non-union voice talent in a ‘Right to Work’ state, I use these standards as an important reference. An eight-week option for an internet-only commercial is $1833.30. The days of a couple hundred bucks for internet use as a side item is long past.
If you have selected a non-union voice over talent, The Global Voice Over Academy (GVAA) has an excellent rate guide for Non-Union voice over work. As well as detailing non-union and union rates for radio, television, corporate, and E-Learning voice overs, it features a breakdown for rates by US markets. Most noteworthy is the newest addition to the rates: the overview of Web Usage. This is imperative as ‘internet only’ isn’t an excuse anymore for low budgets. Furthermore, the internet is now just as important as television or radio and in many cases has greater reach and impact. The GVAA guide Web Usage covers:
Gravy for the Brain put out another comprehensive rate guide for all types of media for the UK market. While I’ve seen rates slip a bit for the UK lately, especially for explainer videos, I hope this and other voice over rate guides will help reverse that trend.
In addition, French voix-off talent Thomas Dormoy discusses various rates in France in his blog here. I find that his rates are the same as my experiences with working for French clients. For a list of other recommended international voice talents, please see my post here.
One of the better European markets for requiring American English voice overs is Poland. As a result I’ve had the pleasure of working for many producers and talent rosters there, and the rate guide at Mikrofonika is thorough and well-presented. Hence, it gives a good benchmark also for comparing to other European markets outside of the UK, France, and Germany. And they have great creative projects too, like the one here where I play Leon the Cat!
Remember, just as no voice over talent is one-size-fits-all, rates will vary depending on the market, usage, and experience level of the talent. However, it is great that for both producers and talents alike that SAG/AFTRA and the GVAA have put together such comprehensive and easy-to-follow voice over rate guides. Most importantly, they both have addressed the prevalence of Web Usage and that it should be paid for accordingly.
Finally, if any of you have access to rate guides in various international markets, please write to me. I’ll add them to this post and be sure to credit you. Thank you!
Adobe has greatly improved Audition CC 2018 with its new release making it a more flexible and powerful DAW for voice over post-production.
Impressive Generate Speech function. I was able to turn a 30 minute script into a high-quality male or female computer voice in 90 seconds. The functionality of this is basic for Windows but comprehensive and very powerful on Mac versions.
To make the most out of Adobe Audition CC 2018, you must change a setting they reversed for monitoring inputs. All one needs to do is uncheck the “Enable Smart Monitoring” preference. Otherwise, your monitoring will loopback while recording. Choose “Preferences>Multitrack>When Arming Tracks For Record>Enable Smart Monitoring”. Then to monitor while recording, click the “I” button on the channel strip. Nice of Adobe not to warn anybody about this ahead of time, but now you know!
Audio Engineer Mike Russell has a helpful YouTube playlist of all his video tutorials about using the new features in practice.
I’ve really enjoyed using AA CC 2017 this year as an upgrade to my previous Adobe Audition 3 recording software. My only two complaints have been the obvious ones shared by other users. First, the subscription price is steep compared to other DAWs. Second, automatic upgrades have been deleting user Keyboard Shortcuts.
Note that when you upgrade from Audition CC 2017 to the 2018 version check to see if you will have to re-enter those Keyboard Shortcuts. Mine saved perfectly, thankfully. Also, you will need to re-load your VST and VST3 plugins, and then assign shortcuts for those. Perhaps most importantly, make sure that you go to Edit > Preferences > Audio Hardware to make sure it is seeing your settings for your audio interface properly. It will default to MME in most Windows computers, so be sure to select ASIO under “Device Class” drop-down menu in the Audio Hardware page.
The Essential Sound Panel will be very helpful for audio editors when mixing sound and narration. My favorite preset in name at least is “That Public Radio Sound” which indeed does not disappoint, just like the rest of this new Audition upgrade. My hope is that most of these presets are not-very subtle, especially the impact of compression, and that most people will adhere to the rule “if you notice the effect of an Effect, dial it back.” But it’s nice to have these tools in the kit with Adobe Audition CC 2018 for Voice Over Production. I’m finding that the Vocal Enhancer setting which has male and female settings are pretty much a set it and forget it solution for full sounding voice over auditions, and could be a great tool for editors on a tight schedule.

Hello. This is my first contribution to this board. However, I have been visiting from time to time over the past year. I only wish that I had been visiting before that.
For those who are interested, here is my story. I had my vision destroyed January 6th, 2007, by Dr. Jerome Swale and his accomplices at the Lasik Vision Institute (LVI) in downtown Chicago. Prior to the ?surgery,? I thought that my vision was poor. Unfortunately, like many here, I now know what poor vision really is like. I have largely remained in denial and mental seclusion for the past year, refusing to post here or elsewhere, afraid to learn more about what really happened to me, and wanting it all just to go away.
Let me make an attempt to describe my pre-LASIK condition. Please feel free to correct me if I misspeak or use the incorrect verbiage. I am now interested in educating myself as much as possible, so that the deception can stop. Best that I can tell, I was an OD -5.50+2.50X113, OS -7.00+1.75X090 before the slice and burn. I don?t exactly know what all of that means, but I do know that I was referred to at one point as a ?high myopia, moderately high astigmatism? patient. I have just over 6 mm pupils. My higher order aberrations were measured as under 5% by the VISX CustomVue machine. At the time, my mom and my sister both had vision correction surgery and had been happy with their results. In addition, I never got along well with contact lenses. Originally, I was fitted with rigid gas permeable lenses for my astigmatism. Later on, when toric lenses were developed, I got those. In the end, the results were always the same. I never was able to get comfortable with the lenses. Mostly, my eyes felt dry and itchy. I was sold on the lie that LASIK was some kind of ticket to a new life freedom. I would be able to gain quality of life, have more fun, be a better golfer, go inside on a cold day and not have a pair of lenses fog up, etc. What I wouldn?t give to just go back.
Anyway, I decided to go through with it. I am a natural pessimist, so I struggled mightily with the decision. I knew that there were risks. Of course, I was lied to and told that new technology has ?virtually eliminated? the risks. I was sold the biggest bottle of snake oil of all time, and drank it all, because I wanted to believe. I chose LVI based on price and convenience, of all things. ?Dr.? Swale was supposed to be this great surgeon with impeccable credentials, blah, blah. You can look at his bio here if you care to: http://www.lasikvisioninstitute.com/loc ... d=30&dist= I was told that I needed the ?custom? procedure due to my prescription.
I could continue to write a book about all of my pre- and during surgery details. In retrospect, there were so many warning signs that day, I had every opportunity to bail out, and I didn?t. Let me cut to the chase. I am now suffering from an all too common list of ?complications;? ghost images from both eyes in all lighting conditions, starbursts, halos, dry eyes, and floaters. If I were forced to chose which was the most troublesome, I would say the floaters. I have a desk job, and looking at the computer screen all day is just torture. My higher order aberrations are now over 50% in both eyes, with Coma and Spherrical aberration almost off the chart.
I am here for several reasons; first and foremost, to say ?Thank you? to those who have put this forum together, and who contribute to it so faithfully. The resource was there for me to avoid my current situation, and I chose not to use it. Secondly, I want to continue to educate myself on my current condition, and get input from you folks on what my options are, if any. Thirdly, I would like to stay abreast of any technological advancement that might be in the works to help folks like us. Lastly, I want to contribute in any way that I can.
As I mentioned before, there are a lot of details surrounding my visits before surgery, the day of surgery itself, and what has taken place afterwards. Hopefully, with time, we can discuss these details. Right now, however, I need your help with one issue in particular. I have visited three independent Ophthalmologists since my eyes were destroyed. Each of them has agreed on one very important aspect of my post-surgical condition. They all agree that I DID NOT receive a Custom laser treatment. Again, I was told that I needed to have Custom in order to ?achieve my best personal visual result.? I paid for Custom. My understanding, however limited, is that the non-Custom version of LASIK only has an effective treatment zone of 5-6 mm, and that Custom was designed specifically to deal with higher prescription patients with larger pupils. Does an ?oversight? like this constitute Medical Malpractice? At the very least, is it Consumer Fraud?
Thank you for entertaining my long post. I very much look forward to any and all feedback that you can provide both regarding my condition and the potential for litigation.
Boy, do I know that feeling! When I first started posting on patient bulletin boards it was for the purpose of finding a fix for this mess and then to get on with my life. I was shocked at the horror stories and refused to believe my problems were permanent.
Let me make an attempt to describe my pre-LASIK condition. Please feel free to correct me if I misspeak or use the incorrect verbiage. I am now interested in educating myself as much as possible, so that the deception can stop. Best that I can tell, I was an OD -5.50+2.50X113, OS -7.00+1.75X090 before the slice and burn. I don?t exactly know what all of that means, but I do know that I was referred to at one point as a ?high myopia, moderately high astigmatism? patient. I have just over 6 mm pupils. My higher order aberrations were measured as under 5% by the VISX CustomVue machine.
That means that higher order aberrations only represented 5% of the total defocus at the scan diameter on the report.
At the time, my mom and my sister both had vision correction surgery and had been happy with their results.
My sister had it before me. She said she was happy. Several years later she was put on Restasis for chronic dry eyes.
In addition, I never got along well with contact lenses. Originally, I was fitted with rigid gas permeable lenses for my astigmatism. Later on, when toric lenses were developed, I got those. In the end, the results were always the same. I never was able to get comfortable with the lenses. Mostly, my eyes felt dry and itchy.

I would be able to gain quality of life, have more fun, be a better golfer, go inside on a cold day and not have a pair of lenses fog up, etc. What I wouldn?t give to just go back.
Which laser, exactly, were you treated with? Who said you needed custom -- a technician, OD or surgeon?
I could continue to write a book about all of my pre- and during surgery details. In retrospect, there were so many warning signs that day, I had every opportunity to bail out, and I didn?t. Let me cut to the chase. I am now suffering from an all too common list of ?complications;? ghost images from both eyes in all lighting conditions, starbursts, halos, dry eyes, and floaters.
If I were forced to chose which was the most troublesome, I would say the floaters. I have a desk job, and looking at the computer screen all day is just torture.
My sister had a co-worker who had floaters so badly after LASIK that while he was working he subconsciously fanned his eyes, as if he were batting at gnats. I developed a huge, curtain-like floater after LASIK. There are many, many reports of floaters after LASIK. We believe this is due to the effects of the suction ring...
My higher order aberrations are now over 50% in both eyes, with Coma and Spherrical aberration almost off the chart.
This means that after LASIK your lower order aberrations were reduced by LASIK (as they should be) and apparently your higher order aberrations were increased. Just a decrease in the lower order will cause a higher percentage for higher order, but most likely your higher order increased a lot. The numbers to look for are the numerical values for the spherical aberration and coma before and after surgery. And it's important to know the scan diameter.
I am here for several reasons; first and foremost, to say ?Thank you? to those who have put this forum together, and who contribute to it so faithfully.
The resource was there for me to avoid my current situation, and I chose not to use it. Secondly, I want to continue to educate myself on my current condition, and get input from you folks on what my options are, if any. Thirdly, I would like to stay abreast of any technological advancement that might be in the works to help folks like us.
That's what this site is for -- to educate. Unfortunately your best option is probably going to be hard contact lenses. I wear SynergEyes PS. My vision is much improved with them. My extremely dry eyes are another matter and it makes it hard to wear the lenses. It's the LASIK catch-22.
If you are interested in surgical alternatives... well, don't get your hopes up too high. First things first. You need to know precisely what your residual stromal bed thickness is before ever considering more surgery. Unless your surgeon performed intraoperative pachymetry (not likely), you may not know unless you have a special test performed. Instruments that can measure your residual stromal bed after LASIK are not common in most eye doctors' offices. We can do a guesstimate, but I would never ever plan a surgery with a guesstimate. I'd need your records to do the guesstimate. Also the records will answer several other questions that I have about your surgery.
Stick around. Ask questions. Learn. Be part of our community. Tell everyone you know about this site and others like www.lasikcomplications.com
As I mentioned before, there are a lot of details surrounding my visits before surgery, the day of surgery itself, and what has taken place afterwards. Hopefully, with time, we can discuss these details. Right now, however, I need your help with one issue in particular. I have visited three independent Ophthalmologists since my eyes were destroyed.

My understanding, however limited, is that the non-Custom version of LASIK only has an effective treatment zone of 5-6 mm, and that Custom was designed specifically to deal with higher prescription patients with larger pupils.
Firstly, based on what you said above, you do not have large pupils. You said your pupils are 6+mm. It's possible they were measured inaccurately as mine were. "Large" is typically 7mm or larger. Conventional (non-custom) LASIK generally has up to a 6.5mm optical zone. With some lasers the optical zone is reduced when treating astigmatism. If you can scan and email me your operative report I can tell you exactly what your optical zone size is.
"Optical zone" and "effective optical zone" are different. The optical zone is the area that is intended to receive the full correction. The effective optical zone is the actual diameter of the cornea after LASIK that was fully corrected. Contrary to what patients are told by LASIK surgeons, the laser does not precisely sculpt the cornea like it does a flat piece of plastic or a dead human hair. One surgeon stated that it's like trying to precisely sculpt jell-o. The cornea contains water and there are biomechanics and healing responses that come into play, as well as the "cosine effect".
Does an ?oversight? like this constitute Medical Malpractice? At the very least, is it Consumer Fraud?
Fraud for sure. On all of us. Be sure to file a MedWatch report with the FDA. That's another way you can help. Before you do you'll need to know the exact laser used.
I know an attorney in Chicago that's helping another LASIK patient and would be happy to give you his name.
Thank you for your response. For what it is worth, I am a praying man. I have, as a result of this trajedy, questioned my faith at times. I have read others as they have openly discussed their faith on this board; especially as it relates to their own situation. I appreciate their candor. To an extent, their perseverence in faith through their own issues has reinforced my faith through mine.
Anyway, with all do respect, I don't need to send an email to Mary or Jesus. He made sure that we all had a direct line.
Also please consider John 12:24 which is an asterisimo I think...asterisimos I believe are super super important (the amen amen according to catholic confraternity text)
Amen amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it brings forth much fruit. HE WHO LOVES HIS LIFE, LOSES IT;AND HE WHO HATES HIS LIFE IN THIS WORLD, KEEPS IT UNTO LIFE EVERLASTING.
In John 12:24, Jesus is preparing His disciples for His subsequent sacrifice. He was setting the stage and letting us know that our life here isn't the ultimate prize. Good example.
I cannot seem to corroborate the term "asterisimos," especially as it relates to Catholocism. Can you provide a link or more detail?
Anyway, thanks for the support. It is more important now than ever to keep my (our) physical struggles in context.
Thanks for your detailed response. I always appreciate the time and effort that you seem to put into your postings. It reflects the fact that you really do care.
I am embarrased to say that I don't know the exact laser that was used in my treatment. Can I get that from the laser report? On the report, there are several lines of information. One of them is "Calibration Table:." Past that point, there are some numbers and then "Star S4 US Lasik PRK, PRKH Astig." I thought that I had read something on this board or another about the Star S4 laser. I am guessing that is what was used.
I was told by everyone I met throughout the process that I needed the custom treatment. The technicians and ODs I visited pre-operatively were all consistent in referring to the custom treatment. You know, now that I think about it, I don't ever remember the surgeon talking about custom. But, in my case, I got to see the surgeon for about 5 minutes total. Not a whole lot of time to talk about anything.
My current refraction is OD -1.00+0.50X115, OS -0.75+0.25X150. I have visited three well respected ODs post. This prescription is from a corneal specialist at the University of Iowa Hospital.
I visited a Retinal specialist once I developed the floaters and began to realize what they were. I was afraid that I may have some Retinal damage or internal bleeding. Thankfully, there doesn't seem to be any damage to the Retina or bleeding. However, there is certainly damage to the vitreous. I asked one of ths assistant Retinal specialists I visited with about the connections between LASIK and floaters. He was adament that several studies had been done that showed NO CONNECTION between LASIK and floaters. I knew better from my time on this board, but I also knew that arguing with this guy wasn't going to help me. I just couldn't believe that these kinds of lies were still being perveyed. I mean, this is a guy who has been through several years of school and is paid handsomely to know everything there is to know about the Retina and vitreous, and he is telling patients that LASIK doesn't lead to floaters. Wow. How do we compete with that?
So, how can I use my wavefront scan information? What is the most useful information on the page? How can I understand the information better in order to communicate more effectively and prevent any future doctors from lying again? I am looking at some of my scans right now, and see that most of them, even taken one after another, weren't done at the same diameter. Does that reduce their value? If I were to get more wavefront scans taken, should I request a certain diameter or at least that they be consistent in diameter? Is the scan diameter something that the machine "auto" determines?
So, you went to see Dr. Boshnick in Miami? Do the lenses reduce your HOAs? When you say that your vision is much improved, are you just talking in an overall sense or are there one or two things that are spectacularly better?
I also have dry eyes. I mentioned in my first post that I struggled with contacts before surgery because of my eye dryness. I can't imagine I am going to be any better off now. Are there some type of drops that you use to make things more manageable?
I am not in any state right now to consider further surgical options. I have talked to Dr. Wang in Nashville by email. Of course, his message is hopeful, but I know the truth thanks to this board. I have also talked to others that have found new hope with Dr. Stojanovic in Norway. I spoke with Dr. Stojanovic by email as well. It sounds like he is so busy with his work and helping people like us that he wouldn't take the time to review my records unless I was willing to pay him $500/hour. I hope that technology can further advance and we can all have new hope for a surgery that actually works.
As far as my residual corneal thickness, I have two post op measurements, but none of them, of course, are broken down into flap vs. bed. My pre-operative thickness was between 600 and 650 microns. The laser reports say that they burned 56 microns out of one eye and 40 out of the other. I have been told post op that I have "plenty" of cornea to have further treatments if I so desire. Thanks to this board, I know that having enough total thickness doesn't tell the whole story. Eventually, I will visit Dr. Wang or someone closer to me that has an Artemis, and get a better picture of what is really going on between the flap and bed.
Yes, there is certainly a possibility that my pupils were measured inaccurately. If I remember right, I was told they were 6.14mm. I suppose that is one of my two eyes, as they can't be perfecly the same. I have all of files scanned. What would you be most interested in seeing? I would send you everything, but the total file size is 26 MB zipped.
This is very interesting information. I believe I have read the report that you refer to where the doctor equates cornea shapping to jell-o. Again, a report I should have read before hand.
I would be grateful to find an attorney that would evaluate my case. Please feel free to PM me if you feel that is most appropriate. I would also ask anyone else out there with legal advice or suggestions for legal council to please speak up. I can't possibly imagine that having the wrong surgery doesn't constitute negligence to the point of malpractice, or at least, fraud.
only found one book which really explained asterisimos and also polyptoton(he who has ears to hear let him hear) and do not know where it it now..so just using my memory . But both terms are so very very important as used in the bible.
I'm not sure you're looking at the "operative report". Recently I was assisting a patient who had asked for all of his records but the operative report was not with the other records, and he had to request records a 2nd time to get his operative report. Somewhere on the report it should have the optical zone diameter and number of laser pulses -- does it? The VISX Star S4 may or may not have been "custom". I can't tell without seeing the report.
Next important question... are you current wearing lenses to correct for this? Free tip: Go with the experienced ODs refraction, not with the "corneal specialists' ".
This is a common experience for post-LASIK patients. It's what we've come to expect from eye doctors, sadly. Sometimes I'm not sure if they are just stupid, or if they know they're lying, or if they are in denial.
Here's the deal... the scan needs to be taken at the diameter of your pupils when dark-adapted. If your pupils measure 6mm in the dark, then the scan needs to be taken at 6mm. If the scan diameter is smaller, then it doesn't tell you anything about your vision at night. If your problems are worse at night, this is probably important to you. Somewhere on the wavefront report it should have the values for higher order aberrations expressed in microns. That's the important number -- that, and the scan diameter. Yes, the scan size is extremely important. You can't compare a pre-op scan taken at 6mm to a post-op scan taken at 4.5 or 5 (that's one of their dirty little tricks). Yes, if you have more scans taken, insist that they be taken at the same diameter of your pupils in the dark. Good luck with that! An eye doctor will NOT want to comply with such a request because it proves how badly your vision was impaired by LASIK. The tech doing the scan has control over the scan diameter up to a point, meaning that the machine may have an upper limit, and that's a big problem for patients with large pupils. The other limiting factor is your pupil size when the scan is taken -- if they have you sitting in a brightly lit room, your pupils will be small. In order to get a large scan they can dilate your eyes or do the scan in a dark room controlling for any stray light sources. Just remember, what you want to know is the values of the HOA at the diameter of your pupils in the dark.
No, actually my local OD fits SynergEyes PS. They are now commerically available. Yes, my lenses reduce my HOAs. They correct both, my myopia and astigmatism and my HOA to a large extent. Glasses improve my refractive error but they do nothing for my visual quality (HOAs). If I try to drive at night with glasses I am ovewhelmed by starbursts and halos and everything is still blurry. With my lenses I feel safe to drive -- the starbusts and halos are almost gone. But I do see shooting arcs when my pupils dilate larger than the optical zone of the lenses -- this is only a problem for patients like me with enormous pupils (8mm).
Yeah, I struggled with contacts before LASIK, too, which is one reason I thought LASIK was a good idea. Little did I know that contact lens intolerance is a sign of dry eyes. Not that it would have mattered because I was not tested for, or warned about dry eyes. My regimen includes eye washes twice a day with cold Unisol4, preservative-free Theratears PRN, and frequent rewetting drops when wearing my lenses. I never go anywhere wearing my lenses without rewetting drops. I left the house a few days ago and forgot my rewetting drops -- what a nightmare. I was miserable. I always make a mad dash for the bathroom to remove my lenses as soon as I return home. I'm used to stumbling around in blurryland at home.
I am not in any state right now to consider further surgical options. I have talked to Dr. Wang in Nashville by email. Of course, his message is hopeful,
but I know the truth thanks to this board. I have also talked to others that have found new hope with Dr. Stojanovic in Norway. I spoke with Dr. Stojanovic by email as well. It sounds like he is so busy with his work and helping people like us that he wouldn't take the time to review my records unless I was willing to pay him $500/hour. I hope that technology can further advance and we can all have new hope for a surgery that actually works.
I personally believe that having a surface treatment on top of a LASIK flap is a really bad idea!!! And I do NOT believe that any new technology will ever change the fact that the cornea is NOT a piece of plastic. Retreatments are very risky. I know several people that have had them and most of them did not turn out well. Dr. S in Norway will likely use a toxic substance called MMC on your cornea. I have read some scary things about MMC -- possible long-term damage to the eye. Do some research here on lasik-flap about MMC or mitomycin C. Any doctor who is doing surface treatments on top of a LASIK flap uses MMC to prevent haze. That stuff is never coming near my eyes if I can help it.
As far as my residual corneal thickness, I have two post op measurements, but none of them, of course, are broken down into flap vs. bed. My pre-operative thickness was between 600 and 650 microns.
Send me the operative report if you have it, the post-op wavefront scans, and the post-op color topography.
The important thing (legally) here may not be whether or not you had the "wrong" surgery (custom v conventional). The reason I'm interested in knowing the exact laser model that was used is so I can check to see if the FDA approved it to treat your level of refractive error and astigmatism. The FDA's definition of "mixed astigmatism" is on page one of the following letter:
Yes, this report (these reports, actually, one for each eye) has the pulse count. OD - 184 pulses and OS - 255 pulses. The optical zone diameter information looks to be OD 6.0mm X 4.6mm and OS 6.0mm X 5.2mm. Does that make sense? I will send the reports.
No, I am not currently wearing lenses to correct for any of my issues. I have a "standard" pair of -1.00 glasses that I am wearing to help reduce some of my issues at night. They just help to "take the edge off" in a way.
Interesting, your comments about the OD vs. specialist. I don't have as recent a refraction from an OD. One conducted last March, only a couple of months after surgery, was "OD -1.00+0.50X071 and OS -0.50 sphere."
Okay, so, I need to have my pupils dialated and then accurately measured. What is the most accurate way to measure pupils? Then, while dialated, I need to have the wavefront scans taken at the same diameter as my pupil measurement. Got it. I have scans taken post-op with dialated pupils, but the scan diameters are different (7.25mm vs. 6.00mm.) I will send you the scans.
These lenses sound like something that I need to look into more closely. Would you be willing to comment on their cost?
Boy, I hear ya on that one. Contacts won't work, so just go for the home run. Well, something got hit out of the park, that is for sure. Thank you for sharing your dry eye care regimen. I will see if some of your steps will help me.
I am only starting the process of compiling my list of options. It has been suggested that PRK on top of my LASIK treatment might be the best option. Of course, I am extremely gun shy of ever letting anyone touch my eyes again, no matter what they are promising. I will have to do some research on this MMC.
One more complicating detail of my situation of which you should be aware is the free cap I have on my right eye. My right eye was the first one chopped. They chopped off the flap completely. Luckily, they didn't lose it. They did throw it in a dirty petri dish, and now I have several pieces of debris trapped between the flap and bed. Anyway, the ODs I have seen since have differed in opinion on the proper way to burn up my corneas again. One had no problem re-lifting the flap, another was very hesitant about lifting the flap and was suggesting PRK, and the last was undecided and said that further evaluation would be required before he would make a decision.
I had thick corneas, and little did I know it, but I had very nice corneas. I thought they were somehow "imperfect" because they were a little of of shape. Ha. Now I know what imperfect is. In the process, I managed to get my vitreous ruined as well.
I will try to trim the files to the most meaningful, re-zip them, and send them. Thanks for your willingness to take a look. Would you prefer that I remove my name from the reports?
Thanks for the information. One thing that I did just notice is that my pre-operative refractive error and the "desired correction" in the laser reports don't seem to match. That can't be right, can it?
That has to be it. Now, how does the non-custom treatment differ from the one described? I have just perused the material. I plan to read it in more detail.
That's what I was looking for. So there you have it -- your optical zone is too small for your pupils. Man, that pisses me off! You should have been warned about that.
You should be wearing prescription glasses based on your refraction. Some issues will be improved just by wearing the correct script.
I would suggest you get refracted by a good OD and get some glasses. I'd never get by without corrective lenses. I'd be running into walls. That reminds me of another thing that really ticks me off about LASIK surgeons -- they never tell patiens that they need to be wearing glasses, even if they really do. They don't want anyone seeing their LASIK patients in glasses -- they'd rather they be running around in blurryland so they can say your surgery was a success!
No, no, no. Two things -- first you should probably have your pupils measured again in the dark with a pupillometer just to be sure the original measurement was correct. This has to be done with no dilating drops! You need to know your natural dark-adapted pupil size. Secondly, knowing your true natural dark-adapted pupil size, you need to have a wavefront scan taken at that diameter. It's ok if you are dilated for this exam (some will argue that point), but it's much better if you can get the tech to do the exam in a dark room and control any stray light and take the scan at your natural dark-adapted pupil diameter -- but this can be tricky and getting them to do it might be impossible. The point is to get the scan diameter as large as your natural dark pupil size. Keep in mind some aberrometers are not capable of taking a very large scan. But if your pupils really are not much larger than 6mm, that won't be a problem for you.
What is the most accurate way to measure pupils? Then, while dialated, I need to have the wavefront scans taken at the same diameter as my pupil measurement. Got it. I have scans taken post-op with dialated pupils, but the scan diameters are different (7.25mm vs. 6.00mm.) I will send you the scans.
Infrared pupillometer in a dark room is the most common and should be reasonably accurate -- unless there's a moron on the other side of the device. There's a little more to it. You might find this helpful:
Remember, no dilating drops for the pupillometer! Dilating drops are ok (some will argue) for the wavefront scan. The scan diameter needs to be set by the tech for your natural dark pupil size. If the scan is larger, the device should still be able to provide a report at any smaller size.
I had a complete exam (except dilated fundus) including lens fitting which was over $800. I believe the cost of the lenses themselves was $660.00. That's two pair. Each pair lasts six months. I highly recommend these lenses. I would be very surprised if they did not dramatically improve your vision.
One more complicating detail of my situation of which you should be aware is the free cap I have on my right eye. My right eye was the first one chopped. They chopped off the flap completely. Luckily, they didn't lose it. They did throw it in a dirty petri dish, and now I have several pieces of debris trapped between the flap and bed.
Holy cow! You didn't mention a free cap! Geez, I'm sorry to hear about that. Did you lose lines of best corrected vision, meaning, can you be refracted to read the 20/20 line with that eye?
Anyway, the ODs I have seen since have differed in opinion on the proper way to burn up my corneas again. One had no problem re-lifting the flap, another was very hesitant about lifting the flap and was suggesting PRK, and the last was undecided and said that further evaluation would be required before he would make a decision.
No problem relifting a free cap?! Are you kidding? I never, ever heard of anyone relifting a free cap -- not that I know everything, I don't, but I will tell you this -- I'd never even consider a relift if it were me... then of course I'd never consider any additional surgery, period.
Not unless you feel better removing your name. It actually helps me keep them straight. Many patients have sent me their reports and I usually hang onto them in case they have more questions. Your records are safe with me. But if you decide to remove your name, that's ok with me.
Actually that's common. Don't read too much into that. Let me explain... let's say your surgeon had lasered 5 people who were -4.00 and all of them were overcorrected... he'd naturally back off a bit on the laser treatment to adjust for that the next time he treated a -4.00. Several factors come into play with a surgeon's nomograms. Now, if it were a misprogrammed treatment, that's another story. That's probably not the case, but you should be able to tell by the other information on your reports.
Here's all the information for the last version of the VISX Star prior to custom wavefront -- there's a lot of material here:
The "Patient Labeling" is the same thing as the "Patient Information Booklet" which they are required to give you PRIOR to LASIK.
This webpage has more information about the patient information booklet requirement, about halfway down the page:
Why don't you just ask them, point blank, "which version/model (exactly) of the VISX Star S4 was I treated with?" There are several...
FDA approved lasers and links to approval orders, Summary of Safety and Effectiveness, and labeling (Patient Information Booklets and Profession Use Manuals):
If anyone needs the transcript of the September, 1999 panel meeting to draft the guidance for microkeratomes, please post your request here and I'll email it to you. For some reason I can't locate the link, but I have the file.
You can type in LZS for lasers, HNO for microkeratomes. For Intralase, type in Intralase. You should read some of these in your spare time!

The King returned to Cobra Golf last year with the King LTD driver and the King F6 range that included drivers, fairways, hybrids and irons.
The short game has now been covered with the release of the Cobra King wedges, which come in 3 sole grind options to suit all swings and course conditions.
Wedges are all about getting the correct fit for your game, picking the best combination of loft, bounce and grind to help you attack more pins, get up and down more often and make more sand saves.
We’ve been working on these new wedges for nearly two years to create the best-performing speciality wedges for golfers. Our Cobra engineers collaborated with our tour players, including Rickie Fowler, Jonas Blixt and Lexi Thompson, and conducted extensive research and testing on the King wedges. Through that we've greatly improved wedge feel and versatility, giving golfers the confidence to hit a variety of shots around the green.
The Versatile grind has toe, heel and trailing edge relief and is suited suited to players with a slider or neutral attack angle on courses whose turf is medium to firm.
The Classic grind has a progressive sole width from heel to toe to allow players with all swing types to benefit in all turf conditions.
Finally, the WideLow grind has a wide sole with reduced bounce for players who tend to come into the ball from steeper angles and to allow more consistency on courses where the ground is generally softer.
The grind options are backed up with other key technologies that Cobra believes are key to excelling with shots into and around the green.
The faces of the King wedge have a new progressive milled groove design that features wider grooves and gapping on the weaker lofted wedges, and narrower, tighter spaced grooves in the stronger lofted clubs to give optimum spin and trajectory.
The new grooves are combined with Variable Face Roughness a milling technology Cobra uses to maximise average roughness and max peak to peak depth to the USGA limit.
The notch design, a long standing feature of Cobra wedges, has been improved to enable the sole and trailing edge to sit lower to the ground. This means the blade height is closer to the turf on shots where the wedge is square or open, allowing for greater consistency of shot.
Spin is maximised with the use of a variable face roughness that optimises grip across the face to give the control required for shot making from both grass and sand around the green.
The Cobra King wedges come in 12 combinations of loft, bounce and grind and are plated with a Satin Nickel Chrome that reduces glare and provides a durable finish.
I spend ages thinking up elaborate ideas for amazing costumes, but on the day end up coming up with last minute ideas. Non the less it always comes out looking good - perhaps my talented mother has a lot to do with that? Haha
I'm lucky enough to be able to dress up twice, for trick or treating and then a halloween party the next day!
The second night was a much bigger success. My scary clown costume was a big hit and scared my clown-phobic friend to pieces!

Depression and menopause are just two medical conditions that can rob you of sleep. Discover other culprits that can cause insomnia.
Having problems going to sleep or staying asleep? A health condition could be to blame. Research suggests that sleep disturbances such as insomnia are rooted in certain medical conditions.
“We’re finding that both the quantity and quality of sleep a person gets can be linked to a number of health issues and diseases,” says James Wellman, MD, medical director of the Sleep Disorders Center of Georgia in Augusta. Sleep problems may be caused by physical, emotional, or hormonal conditions — everything from asthma to depression to menopause. Here are the most common culprits.
Depression: Sleep problems and depression are common bedfellows. Some research shows that 90 percent of people with depression experience troubled sleep. “In low-grade depression, insomnia is often the most prominent symptom,” says Dr. Wellman. Waking up too early in the morning is a hallmark of serious depression. Other depression-related sleep problems include difficulty falling asleep and sleeping excessively. Anxiety (persistent worrying and uneasiness) can also leave you wide awake due to the inability to relax. Appropriate medications can help ease depression and anxiety, as well as the resulting sleep problems.
Menopause: As a woman’s periods start to end, insomnia may begin. According to the National Sleep Foundation, 61 percent of menopausal women have sleep problems. One possible reason: Progesterone levels drop off during menopause. “Progesterone is a sleep-promoting hormone,” says Wellman. Changing levels of estrogen during menopause can also cause sleep disruptions by bringing on hot flashes, sudden waves of intense body heat, and sweating.
Diabetes: Diabetics often find restful sleep elusive due to blood sugar fluctuations, night sweats, and the need to urinate frequently during the night. Insomnia can also increase the risk of developing diabetes. In a recent study involving 1,741 adults, people who slept less than six hours were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who got more sleep.
Musculoskeletal disorders: The intense pain of arthritis can make drifting off to dreamland difficult. Plus, arthritis patients who must shift positions during the night often find it hard to fall asleep again. A pain reliever before bed can help ease sleep-stealing arthritis pain. Fibromyalgia, a condition characterized by painful ligaments and tendons, has also been linked with sleep disturbances, as well as next-day fatigue.
Cardiovascular disease: Two common cardiovascular conditions, coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, have been linked to sleep problems. In coronary artery disease, fluctuations in circadian rhythms can cause chest pain, an irregular heartbeat, or even a heart attack while sleeping. Congestive heart failure prevents the heart from pumping enough blood to reach all parts of the body. As a result, extra fluid accumulates around the lungs while you are lying down, causing you to wake up during the night. Using pillows to elevate the upper body can help.
Asthma: People with asthma often have sleep disturbances because of breathing difficulties, wheezing, and coughing, says Wellman. Asthma symptoms are usually worse at night due to night time changes in functioning that constrict the airway, increasing the risk of asthma attacks during the night. Some of the medications used to treat asthma can also cause insomnia and fragmented sleep.
Heartburn or GERD: In heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), acidic juices in the stomach flow back into the esophagus, causing irritation and painful burning sensations. This can make it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. Lying down often worsens the condition. Avoiding big meals, coffee, and alcohol in the evening may help relieve heartburn and bring on a restful night’s sleep.
Eating disorders: “Anorexia has been found to interrupt normal sleep patterns, possibly due to malnutrition and excessive weight loss,” says Wellman. Research suggests that anorexics get more non-REM sleep and less REM sleep than people of normal weight, resulting in next-day tiredness. Bulimia is often characterized by eating binges and purges during the night, interfering with a good night’s sleep.
Kidney disease: Kidney disease prevents the kidneys from filtering wastes from the blood, which can lead to insomnia or restless legs syndrome. Dialysis or even a kidney transplant doesn’t always result in normal sleep, says Wellman. Researchers aren’t sure why.
Thyroid disease: An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can cause sleep-busting night sweats, while an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) brings on excessive daytime sleepiness. Both of these thyroid conditions can be diagnosed with a simple blood test and easily treated with medications.
When sleep problems are due to a medical problem or physical condition, treating the condition will often resolve the insomnia and ease sleep disturbances, says Wellman. See your doctor for an evaluation, and you may find that your insomnia does a disappearing act. If not, the next step is to make an appointment with a sleep specialist.

I drilled from the mark. That way I could ensure that the hole was where it was supposed to be, on the side where the position was critical. I have two 3/8" bits -- a brad point bit that came with my doweling set, and a perfectly ordinary 3/8" twist bit. Brad-point bits are far more precise than twist bits -- they're more likely to start where you want them to, and they're more likely to stay straight. My problem is that my brad-point bit wasn't long enough to go through 3-1/2" of wood. So I started each hole with the brad-point bit, then finished it off with the twist bit. I clamped a piece of ply on the back, to reduce tear-out.
The Practical Woodworking course at the JD Lohr School of Woodworking is a complete and comprehensive woodworking course held in our shop on the 13-acre farm in southeastern PA. This is total immersion woodworking for ambitious, interested adults. With class size limited to 11 students and 3-4 instructors in each class, all needs of every student are met regardless of experience level. If you are self taught with no formal training as a woodworker, this course will quite literally change the way you work.
Thread the rods through one of the legs, then set the leg flat on the table. Insert dowels into the dowel holes. Place the matching stretchers into place. Put dowels into the dowel holes at the top end of the stretchers. Place the other leg onto the threaded rod and settle it down onto the dowels. You'll probably have another opportunity to whack away with your rubber mallet.
The first time you try your hand at the ancient craft of woodworking, you want to do it right. Learn woodworking basics with hand tools to a professional standard on a weekend woodworking course at Rowden Atelier. Ed Wild runs weekend furniture building courses for everyone from beginners who want to have some fun experimenting behind the bench, to those who are looking to develop specific skills as a furniture maker. Classes include tool handling, box making, and basic veneering, but to a certain degree, you can tell us what you want to learn - these short woodworking courses are partly bespoke.
Those bums even have a stipulation that you can't connect any utilities to a shed. My plan is to adhere to the letter of the law if not the spirit. I plan to run a buried 20 amp power line out to the shed (this will be done professionally and properly according to whatever is required by the law), but it will require a manual connection to a junction box on the outside of my house to complete the circuit. That way, I can argue that the electrical connection is only temporary and is little more than a safe and buried version of an extension cord.
It doesn't get much better than a day at the woodshop! I've taken several classes from cutting boards to turning vases. It is always fun and informative! All of the machines are top notch and the instructors are great! I've toyed with the idea of a membership but I think I'll take a couple more classes before doing so! I can't wait to see the new location! :)
Drill a pair of 3/8" holes in each end of the short stretchers, just over half of the depth of the dowels, using a brad-pointed bit. These stretchers already have a groove running their length, centered on the bottom edge. Precise placement isn't necessary, but keeping track of which part is which is. We need a hole in each end of each stretcher. Take care to keep these holes square, you don't want them running at angles.
Then I flipped the top and the base, lied up the base in the proper location relative to the top, I then positioned the front vise and the support MDF for the end vise, and marked the locations of the bolt holes. Then I flipped the base right side up, drilled small pilot holes from the bottom side where I had marked the locations, and then drilled shallow countersink holes from each side, then a through hole that matched the bolts. Finally I tried out the bolts and washers, and deepened the countersinks until the heads of the bolts were just below flush.
The course successfully meets the needs of multiple experience levels in a safe, well equipped, spacious, congenial, and educational environment. All instruction and lab experience is under the personal direction of master woodworkers as well as one or two additional experienced woodworkers/teacher assistants who are on hand during all lab hours providing roughly a three-to-one student-to-instructor ratio. Intermediate to more advanced students should not be put off by the fact that beginners are also included in this course.  Check out some of the work done by our alumni in the Alumni Furniture Gallery to get an idea of what our students are capable of.
The hacksaw will often damage the last thread when it cuts. Running a nut off the end will fix this. You'll have to run the nut all the way down from the other end. This doesn't take long, if you chuck up the rod in your drill and let it do the work. Hold the rod vertically, with the drill pointing down, and just hold on to the nut enough to keep it from spinning.
This place is great! They offer safety classes before you sign up for a membership, and the workspace is big and well maintained. I needed some basic lessons with table and band saws, which went great. I didn't ultimately get a membership because my sawing needs are very specific, and ended up getting a small bandsaw for myself at home. But if you're someone who needs the whole range of tools, this is the place to be!
Although many hand tool operations are thoroughly covered, this is a machine based woodworking experience. You will find the school finely equipped with four table saws, four jointers, three drill presses, three thickness planers, a wood lathe, full dust collection, bandsaws, jig saws and scroll saws, 5 routers and dozens of router jigs and accessories. There is a heavy focus on the safe and efficient use of the table saw starting with it's basic operation and going into advanced production procedures. We consider the table saw to be an essential machine for efficient, accurate, and safe woodworking.
The edges of MDF are fragile, easily crushed or torn. MDF is also notorious for absorbing water through these edges, causing the panels to swell. In Sam Allen's original design, he edged the MDF with 1/4" hardboard. This edging is one of the complexities that Asa Christiana left out in his simplified design. I think this was a mistake. MDF really needs some sort of protection, especially on the edges.
Learn the basics of woodworking with simple hands-on projects to build your confidence and skills. Each lesson in this class explores an area of woodworking that will form the building blocks of all future woodworking projects you undertake. Keeping the average DIY'er in mind, this entire class is conducted using basic handheld power tools, with no fancy fixed tools like table saws, lathes, planers, or drill presses.
For a fun and comprehensive learning experience, take an online woodworking class in the WWGOA Academy. You’ll learn in-depth woodworking how-to, get bonus material, and enjoy custom benefits for class participants. You’ll never lose access to your Class; no strings attached! Check back often – as we’re adding new online woodworking classes regularly.
The book is well written and easy to read. The illustrations, I'm sure were excellent in 1914 and, are still adequite now. Most of the designs seemed repetitive, though. I wish more attention had been given to lashing materials. If you are looking for that you will find almost none here. The book was fun to read and provided enough inspiration to make my brother and me attempt a large hut.
During an intensive six-month course, not only will you learn all of the basics such as the different tools you will be using but also get a chance to try some of our more advanced projects. These will include how to draw up a big project such as a workbench, and French Polish your own jewellery box. You will also learn how to draw and can take part in our design courses, an invaluable part of the making process.

What I did, when I came back, was to clamp down the strip where it had torn away, and then to start routing from the other end. I still moved the router from right to left, but I did it in six-inch sections, taking light passes, and sort of whittled the strip flush. As the sections I was working were farther to the right, the strip was thinner. Eventually I came to where I was trimming the strip away entirely, at which point I took off the clamps and the remainder fell away.
A woodworker's Workbench is a special type of bench designed to hold your work when you are working on a wood project. The main purpose of this table is to keep the woodwork steady and to prevent it from moving. Follow the tutorial below to build yourself a nice workbench suitable for your specific woodworking projects. Make sure to modify the table to fit your specific requirements.
Can't say enough about the team at Post Woodworking, Inc., from Karen in the office to the team that... put up this beauty starting at 7AM and were done before lunch, Kyle, Aaron and Billy. After what sounded like a late night at the shop the night prior, they were still on site bright and early as promised and still energized and ready to show their pride in their work. Couldn't be more happy with our 14' x 20' Cohasset. See More
1. In this post, you kindly remind us not to make it too deep or worry too much about the height. I presume you still believe a bench cannot be too long or too heavy? I’m with you — just asking if that’s actually still your opinion, since the bench above appears to be yet another six footer. (If longer is better, why don’t you build an 8 or 10′ for your home shop?) TYIA – remember, I’ve bought all my lumber to start my new bench, but I haven’t milled anything yet, so you’re really helping in an immediate way here!
With the shelf secure, get a couple of friends to come help, and stand the bench on its feet. I said earlier moving the top by yourself is dangerous. Trying to lift the entire bench is foolhardy. Of course, I already said I'm stubborn, so I did it myself by rigging a simple block-and-tackle using lightweight pulleys I got at the hardware store. (Not the lightest-weight pulleys, those are meant for flag poles and have a design load of something like 40 pounds. These had a design load of 420 pounds.)
Great advice. May I add #11?…if you’re left handed (like me), build a left handed bench. It sounds obvious, but when I made my bench, I had looked at all the pictures in my books, laid out plans for a nice, traditional bench, built it, then realized my front vise should have been on the other end (I have no tail vise). I plane from left to right, and the front vise is always in the way.
I clamped the top to the side of the base, as I had done before, so that the edge with the knot would be easy to work with. I mixed up some ordinary five-minute epoxy and added just a touch of black epoxy pigment. I applied this freely. After about twenty minutes I checked on it and found that in the deepest spot the void wasn't entirely filled, so I mixed up another batch and added more. After that had cured for a bit I eased the top to the floor and applied a coat of oil to the bottom side. I planned on attaching the base to the top the next day, and I wanted the bottom side oiled to keep it from absorbing moisture.
Students will make two pens at the lathe, one of solid wood and one of your own design built up from several pieces of wood. Since turning pens is a quick process, we will have time to teach you how to choose woods, how to prepare and mount wood on the lathe, and several of the more popular finishes. We will cover safe operation of a lathe, demonstrate how to use common woodworking tools, practice tool sharpening techniques, and discuss options for what kind of lathe you might want in the future, from a small pen lathe to more robust machines that can handle much bigger projects. Bring clothes that can get dirty.
You're not the first person to say this! I'm half inclined to use the Lowes shed as a starting point for my own design. But I do think I'd feel better if I could work as an "aprentice" next to an "old master". Someone at work is going to put me in touch with a guy who builds sheds for a living, and apparently he's competitive with the prices @ Lowes and HD. The Lowes shed comes with a "Handman Package" that I don't want but would end up paying for, anyway. The "workbenches" were laughably flimsy.

Trying to capture the imagination of unpredictable, tantrum-prone critics like children must be a tough task. That’s probably why absolutely outlandish characters like a demented talking blanket managed to slip on to daytime television.
Despite efforts to improve the quality and content of TV shows aimed at the younger market, they haven’t stopped a few particularly imaginative animators from coming up with some truly awful and frightening ways to‘entertain’ minors.
Here are the weirdest and most unsettling characters to have somehow made it into children’s television shows through the years:
The stuff of nightmares made manifest, Ratafak Plachte spooked audiences in the 1980 show ‘Slniecko’. Apparently the character was meant to be a talking blanket. Instead it has been compared to Satan’s spirit animal by former viewers subjected to the demented creation.
‘The Moomins’ incredibly cheery opening segment masked the fact that the characters were pretty messed up. If domesticated hippos weren’t enough to melt your developing brain, then the appearance of the dark and icy Groke would surely scare you senseless.
Hot water bottles are not scary. But there was something very unsettling about the grimace on Alfred’s face in the 1990 ABC creation ‘Johnson and Friends’. The giggling bed warmer bore a worried expression which suggested he’d seen things no hot water bottle should witness. Post-traumatic stress disorder, anyone?
These shape-shifting experimental artists appeared on ‘The Muppet Show’ in 1976. Mime duo Mummenschanz manipulated their clay faces into bizarre and increasingly-alarming features with disturbing ease.
The less said about Fukurokuju, the better. According to Japanese gaming guide Kotaku, the character aired on national television in 2012 and was meant to represent one of the Seven Lucky Gods. Instead, his oddly-shaped extendable head resembled… well… you know...
Dreamed up by executives at Brazil’s Rede Globo station, Fofao looked like the strange father of murderous movie doll Chucky. Sure, he had some serious issues with his cheeks, but that didn’t stop the character from becoming hugely popular with ’80s kids.
Australia’s ‘Lift Off’ aired for only three years. However, it is still remembered for its nightmarish character EC - a ragdoll that was meant to represent ‘every child’. Today, children are more likely to run away from the faceless toy than identify with it.
‘Wizbit’ centered on an alien wizard of the same name in the shape of a cone hat. Starring British magician Paul Daniels, the show followed the adventures of a talking wizard’s hat, which would spout nonsense spells like ‘Ostagazuzulum’.
Wizbit also lived with a giant rabbit, which spoke at the pace of someone who had consumed quite a bit of grass.

Being a masochist - I often bring work home with me and spend my evenings cleaning up little jobs and catching up so I have time to read all of your blogs the following day. Last night I decided that I was going to head to a coffee shop to work so that Mario Kart couldn't give me "come hither" eyes and distract me from the task at hand. Damn you sexy Wii. That sounded bad.
So to the coffee shop I went. I should explain that this coffee shop isn't your normal Starbucks-y place. It is attached to my apartment complex and has a coffee shop, restaurant, bar, convenience store, dry cleaner and Assault course from American Gladiators (ok that last one was a dream I had where I was a gladiator and my name was "Teflon"). This coffee shop on steroids also has theme nights.
The stage is in the bar / restaurant area of the room while I was perched over in the coffee house area silently working away. I heard the microphones being set up and the specrapular smooth jazz playing before anyone took stage. I tuned most of the distraction out as the Drive-By Truckers were playing a live acoustic set on my favorite XM Radio station - X Country and I was also listening to the Tribe game (yay for multi-tasking!). The first half hour was made up mostly of jazz singers and was actually quite enjoyable. Then "that guy" hit.
To which I stood up and screamed "IF YOU SAY LIFE ONE MORE TIME I WILL COME OVER THERE AND END YOURS!" That never happened - I would never think up something that witty on the spot - but when I was laying in bed last night thinking about it I totally said that in my head. I showed him!
Who writes that crap? I know we can't all be lyrical geniuses but the drivel coming out of that guys mouth made me want to slam my man parts in a car door (I need to quit using that analogy).
So I crank up the tunes/game and get on with life. Before long the first free-style rapper makes his way to the stage and, with the game and the DBT show over, I am left to listen. He gets going and I didn't want to murder myself so he is already an improvement. I would say he was talented but me criticizing a rapper is like Keanu Reeves voting on the Oscars.
The rapper was going on about how people in the black community don't stand up for themselves and hide behind racism for not improving their life. Then he dropped this line:
Anyone that can work Church's Chicken into a rap is cool in my book - and sitting there, 12 hours deep into my work day with my eyes half shut - I let out a moderately loud chuckle. Not as loud as a "Caddyshack" chuckle but more than a "Son In Law" chuckle.
I wasn't laughing at what he was saying - just the way he chose to say it. This point was apparently lost on the crowd because every person in the place turned to look at me. I then noticed I was the only white guy in the whole place. Great. Now I look racist. Damn my selective hearing and penchant for laughing at culinary comedy. I look around at the collective death stare and notice "We Are Life" guy shaking his head. It wasn't hard to tell what he was thinking:
I thought the title of this post was, "What is Love" so I read this whole post bobbing my head to the left.
Every year I shock myself by mailing out our Christmas cards. I NEVER remember until the last-minute and once I do remember then I have to actually figure out a design, print them, cut them, and address the envelopes. Oh, the envelopes. Luckily I made a deal with my hubby this year that if I made the cards he had to write out the envelopes. It’s a win for me, the family receiving them and a win for the mail man too cause my handwriting is nearly unlegible.
I was actually on track to get them finished early this year and had what I thought was a pretty cute concept. I showed Justin only to get an “eh, it’s okay, why aren’t we in it though?”. I had thought I was done. It was a cute watercolor of a VW van carrying presents and adorning a wreath. But, I did kind of see his point and after spending ALL day Saturday designing and redesigning I am actually super happy with how they came out. In the end he was right regardless of my willingness to totally admit it to him.
It’s amazing how good it feels once they get mailed out, especially when you weren’t sure about doing it in the first place. It is like a huge weight off your shoulders and it feels even better to know that we got to say happy holidays to all of our family and friends, even the ones we may not see this year. Which could end up being a lot. We decided this year that we would spend the holidays in and not spend them running from house to house. So we won’t see everyone in the family like we normally do, but we will get to spend even more time with each other and really relish in the holiday. I am excited to wake up Christmas morning, open presents, and play all day. Watch movies and take naps. Sip on hot chocolate! I am even pre-making ALL of our food (and some cocktails/mocktails) for us and any visitors that may come to join in. This way whenever we get hungry we can just pop something in the oven and wait for the ding. I couldn’t plan anymore for an even lazier, wonderful day. My only job? To make sure my son has the perfect holiday.

There are many (many) days when I wonder if dinosaurs are an actual sustainable life source. Based solely on the earth shattering screams that Jax can let out when he’s searched for 13 seconds and can’t find a particular pachycephalosaurus and the STRONG desire to go to Target as often as possible and buy more, I’m leaning more and more on the yes side everyday.
It’s his thing. And if I’m being honest, I get it. Experiencing dinosaurs through him has shown me that they are actually insanely cool. What other group of creatures in the world are so unique and mystical? While also being completely unattainable. They leave a lot to the imagination, and Jax has a LOT of imagination, which makes them a perfect fit. Him and Lu can sit around the living room for hours and just play pretend with their dinosaurs. Which is why it was zero surprise when I asked him what he wanted to be this year for Halloween and he said “a dinosaur!”.
Of course he did. SO the search began. Let me tell you, there are a LOT of dinosaur costumes out there right now. All different kinds of fits and styles. But none are like the one we found from Chasing Fireflies. I’m officially declaring it the ultimate dinosaur costume.
From head to toe Jax was totally immersed in the costume. The feet attach to his shoes, the hands to his hands, and his head came right out the dino’s mouth. The fit is perfect because it is shaped to take on the shape of an actual T-rex. It is fitted tight around the arms which fall against the body that widens around the hips making him look like he has huge hind legs and teeny tiny little arms! What?! It is so cool.
Top that off with a super cute head-piece that wraps around the neck and open its mouth to reveal your head. It gives you the appearance of being much bigger than you are, kinda like a dinosaur! The spikes trail down the head and along the tail that drags behind without touching the ground and creating a mess. You can tell right away it is made to last, I sized up because I knew this would not be a Halloween exclusive costume, BUT I would advice sizing down or true to size for a little room. At least with my kids they ended up being a little bigger than I anticipated. I am also thinking about stuffing the inside I bit to fill it out for the big day!
Severe numbness or tingling in the hands may be treated by non-surgical tests or by doing some physical tests to further diagnose the cause of the problem. However, while the numbness is still mild or manageable, we could do some basic physical activities to relieve the pain momentarily. By doing so, may also prevent the occurrence of the numb condition. Here are the three basic movements that you could apply.
Circulation is the key to remove formigamento nas mãos and bending is the basic thing to do. Although the numbness is felt in your hands, other compressed nerves in your body may be treated to eliminate the pain. You may stretch your feet or arm and slowly bend them inwards. Neck bending may also alleviate tired nerves. Though it may be far from your fingers, nerves are in network with each other which means they are connected. Neck exercise would be useful and effective to counteract numbness. As for your fingers, you may do “close-open” bending exercise while applying some squeezing force.
Compressed nerves because of improper posture are prevalent. In order to relieve pressure, stretching and shoulder rotations could be done with a regular interval. Stretching each finger would allow comfort and relaxation, relieving the tired bones. Following the stretch is shoulder rotation which would allow further circulation. Start by keeping your arms at your side and bending your elbow at a 90-degree angle.
Exercise is a sure way to encourage blood flow in your system. However, some exercise would tire you out without even enjoying the process. One physical activity that you would appreciate is swimming. While taking the pleasure of water splashes, you won’t even notice that tingling in hands has been relieved. Aside from this, you get additional benefits from swimming like improvement on blood circulation, muscle development and most importantly - enjoyment.
Welcome to the Keedy Family Blog. This is our way to keep family and friends updated with pictures of our growing boys. We hope you enjoy it!
This year Will wanted to dress like his favorite baseball player, Albert Pujols. Jake overheard us talking about it and said he wanted to be Albert, too. Jake really looks up to Will and wants to do EVERYTHING he does. It is so cute!
This is Jake before his Halloween party at Under the Rainbow earlier in the week. Again, excuse the pics being out of order. I can't seem to fix this problem.
I wanted Will to squat down so he would be closer to Jake, but, of course, Jake had to do what Will was doing.
These pics are in reverse order AGAIN! I can't figure out why I can't click and drag them like I used to. If anyone can help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it. Anyway, life lately has been very busy. I am almost finished with my masters degree and will feel like I have my life back when it's completed...only 8 weeks to go!! Maybe I'll be a better blogger in the new year. For now, I'll have to do a quick recap of the past couple of months...
Jake will finally pose for the camera instead of running from it. Maybe Christmas card pictures won't be so horrible this year. But, I seriously doubt it. That would make my life too easy! =)
Another milestone was reached at the beginning of this month. For the first time in six years, I no longer have a baby bed in my house. Jake is sleeping a "big boy" bed, which is actually a toddler bed. It suits him perfectly for now, but I'm sure he will outgrow it soon. This boy is growing like a weed! I want to get bunk beds for his room eventually, but I am afraid he is still a little to small for climbing up to the top bunk.
We've spent lots of time at football games. This family is full of die hard Newport Greyhound and stAte Red Wolf fans.
I had my 15 year high school reunion this month, also. Man, I'm getting old! I had a great time catching up with some old and dear friends.
Nana treated us to a Disney Live show in Jonesboro. The boys loved it! Jake is already asking when we can see Mickey Mouse again. I guess we will be going to Disney World before too long!
Will had his 6th birthday party at Pump It Up in Jonesboro...easiest party he's ever had! I didn't have to do anything except bring the cake. He had a great time and I think all of the other kiddos did, too. Jake loved it just as much as the big guys. You can see him in the background of the first picture heading up the monstrous slide.
While opening gifts at Pump It Up, the birthday boy or girl gets to sit on this huge throne shown above. When Will kept insisting that we have his party at this place, I told him I could rent a bounce house and we could have the party in Newport where it would be more convenient for his friends. Then, he informed me that he wouldn't get to sit on the throne. So what's a mom to do??? By all means, let's sit on the throne!!
I didn't get this post on here on his actual birthday since it took 10 minutes to load each of my catch up posts, but I was determined to get this on here before I went to bed. I will be paying for that in the morning!! We celebrated his birthday earlier tonight with Ginker and Coach. Will got to pick where we went to eat (of course, he picked US Pizza...he is his mother's son) and then we came back home to have cake and open presents. His actual party will be this weekend at Pump It Up in Jonesboro. Hopefully, I'll keep up with the blog and have more pics to share this weekend from the party.
Jake kept saying that is was his birthday everytime someone mentioned Will's birthday. I'm glad he had some presents to open, too, or he would have really been disappointed on his "birthday"!
This is a pitiful cake, I know, but it's what he wanted for his "at home" birthday cake. He put the candles on it himself and didn't want me to try to decorate it in anyway which is probably a good thing!!
-He still loves his momma! He loves to cuddle and loves to just sit by me and watch TV or read books.
-Even though he's a cuddler at home, in public it's a different story. He recently quit letting me hold his hand when we cross the parking lot at stores. Everytime he pulls his hand out of mine, I feel like my baby is slipping away and becoming too independent. But, I guess that's what parenting is really about...raising our children to become independent. So, I will try my best to let him grow...and not smother him to death with my overprotectiveness. Is that even a word??
-He loves sports! He's definitely a Keedy! He knows more players on the Cardinals team than his dad and calls his dad with play by play updates if he is not home to watch the games.
-He will sleep in his own bed and lay down by himself, but he doesn't like it. He was doing good until Michael Jackson died and seeing pictures of him on the news back in June still haunts him.
He thinks he was a monster, and it's not because of Thriller. He's thinking about how he looked after all the plastic surgery.
-He is a wonderful big brother most of the time. He is so patient with Jake and will not hit Jake even if Jake hits him. In fact, when Jake tries to bite him, we've told him to try to bite Jake back but he will not do it. I'm glad he was the first born because I'm quite certain that Jake wouldn't have been as good of a big brother.
-He is a very well-behaved child in public (and most of the time at home, except for the mess thing) and always has been-- except for the first four months of his life. He is very much a "pleaser" and comes by that honestly. He also always thinks he's right and is a little bossy at times...he comes by that honestly, too! =)
-He has an awesome memory. It's spooky sometimes. He'll say remember that time when I was 2 and we went to blah, blah, blah... and we really will have done what he is talking about and it's not something that he's seen in pictures.
-He admires his daddy more than anyone and wants to be just like him. It's so sweet!! I love hearing him tell things about "my daddy" to other kids.
-He adores his grandparents (both sets) and would probably choose to live with them if given the chance. LOL!!
Will started kindergarten this year! Many people think he has already been to kindergarten since he is turning 6 this month, but since his birthday is so early, we decided to wait until this year to start him. He was certainly ready to go last year, but I was afraid the age difference might show up in junior high or high school when kids really need to have a level head. I've got to brag just a little....Will can already do math that some of my 5th graders can't do. He can add and subtract (all in his head, not with pencil and paper) and multiply by 2's, 5's, and 10's. I think he gets it from me!! ;)
Nana, the boys, and I went to see The Wiggles in Little Rock a few weeks ago. When Will was little, The Wiggles were all the rage and had a show on Disney. Now they aren't as popular, but Jake still likes to watch all of Will's old Wiggle DVDs. Will was probably a little too old to go with us, but I couldn't stand to not take him. He acted like he was so bored during the show and too big for it, but I know he really enjoyed it. Jake had a look of awe of his face the entire time!
These pictures are in reverse order of how I wanted them, but it wouldn't let me rearrange them for some reason. Ginker and Coach took Will to St. Louis for a few days to see 2 Cardinal games and go to the St. Louis zoo. Recently, Will has become obsessed with the Cardinals and begs to stay up late to see the end of games. He already knows the starting line up and all their jersey numbers. I think he's a Cardinal fan for life!
I have been married to my high school sweetheart for 10 years, and we have two adorable boys, Will and Jake. I am a fifth grade math and science teacher at the elementary school I attended as a child, and my life couldn't be better!

This past week I have been in France, working and composing... my mind is in London and my body is in France in the sunshine walking....
This Saturday I'm working with Dan night in Lewisham Art-house with his Sound Sculptures. I'll be performing and I'm I'm a judge in a composition competition and I'm really looking forward to hearing and working with the entries .
Next week I am to travel to Diamond Light Source in Oxford to work with a on a new commission called Crystal and on the 21st of July I am performing at the ICA a new work called Untitled Lines. This work has a Limited Edition tape cassette release available from entr'acte which will be for sale on the night and available a few days before in the book shop at the ICA.
== Just come back from my first soundcheck for Untitled Lines in the new ICA theatre space . It was good to hear the work in the space , I'm working with quite extreme streams of sound, some are very delicate and some are very robust.
Most of the sound is created from my own voice and I have focused on the concept of recording with domestic objects ie my iphone. Through domestication, lines of song and rythym emerge in alternating harmonic and melodic platforms.
I'm working at Diamond Light Source in Oxford at the moment collecting audio and looking at spectrums for my new work 'Crystal'. Diamond is an amazing place of cutting edge technology scientists and synchrotron technology.
But for now it is the last push for the 21st at the ICA . I will be working with a great sound system and performing a new work called Untitled Lines in response to the Pablo Bronstein exhibition.I love this feeling just before performances , I have excited nerves...
Thank you to everyone that was involved in the event tonight, it was very special and a privilege to perform my site Specific work Untitled Lines at the ICA. Thank you to Allon Kay from Entr'acte who published 20 Limited Edition Cassette Tapes of the core music that was manipulated live . These are two works called Drift and Swan.
The lines are untitled as they are moments of liveness between my self the performer and the audience .. moments of expression which can only be captured by physical presence and by being in that space at that time.
All the material was generated from recordings by my iphone a domestic recording device. The recordings are of my voice and two environmental recordings of wind and the sea. This work is a site specific work in response to Pablo Bronstein's Sketches for Regency Living. It was performed in the Regency Box theatre space of the ICA.
Thank you for the work done by Marta and Lilli , Jamie , Allon ,the sound crew , Yev , Andi and Will and my audience, It was a real pleasure.
Big big week ahead and looking forward to an exciting weekend of music performance and very very good sound. The entracte tape cassette of Untitled Lines was released last week for the performance.
Getting ready to work with my Diamond Light Source sounds in Bangor Electro Acoustic Studio's next week and again will write some more about that later...
I am playing with the group Asteroid ... Its going to be a great sound with a smashing line up of players ... a free improvisation collective that rotates with every performance.
This publication is a set of chapters associated jointly by means of a logical framework geared toward exploring the fashionable position of the dimension technological know-how in either the technically so much complex functions and in daily life
The sphere of electric dimension maintains to develop, with new strategies built every year. From the elemental thermocouple to state of the art digital instrumentation, it's also turning into an more and more "digital" undertaking. Books that try to catch the cutting-edge in electric size are speedy outmoded.
Excessive intake of alcohol, certain drugs and local radiation therapy can also decrease and/or delay hepatic regenerative activity. Implicated medications include actinomycin, cyclo-heximide, tamoxifen, colchicine and indomethacin. Thus, the correction of the above factors might potentially enhance hepatic regeneration, were that the therapeutic objective. The third option, limiting hepatic functional activities and, thereby, increasing the amount of ATP available for proliferative activity, represents a high risk proposition that must be carefully studied in animal models before being attempted in humans. Nevertheless, the use of an antimetabolite medication, such as propylthiouracil, might be beneficial.
On the other hand, it is also possible that attenuated hepatic regeneration following extensive resections and/or advanced liver disease is potentially harmful and should be corrected to improve survival. This might be particularly true if the critical mass of viable hepatocytes required for survival no longer exists. Were this the case, the therapeutic options to be considered include: augmenting growth promoters; negating the effects of growth inhibitors; and suppressing hepatic functional demands. To date, the value of growth factor and cytokine administration has not been clearly established in the setting of liver failure. This is not surprising because high concentrations of growth factors have already been documented in experimental animals and humans with advanced liver disease. Moreover, the biological half-lives of these agents tend to […]
Thus, attenuated or submaximal hepatic regenerative activity may represent an inherent attempt to limit the amount of ATP being applied to proliferative activity to maintain an essential amount of hepatic function. Were that the case, what therapeutic options should be considered beyond supportive measures and, for those who are candidates, liver transplantation? The intervention that makes most theoretical sense is to increase energy delivery and/or availability to the liver, thereby allowing both proliferative activity and metabolic function to proceed as required. That might be achieved by: optimizing oxygen delivery to the liver (maintaining high partial pressures of oxygen, adequate hemoglobin levels, and hepatic blood flow); providing adenosine, S-adenosyl-methionine or other precursors required for ATP synthesis; direct infusions of ATP into the systemic circulation; and in […]
More clinically relevant are cases of extensive hepatic resections in healthy patients, more limited resections in patients with cirrhosis, and fulminant hepatic failure. In these cases, more than 70% (and often 90%) of the liver has been resected or destroyed. Here, the key question is whether the attenuated hepatic regenerative activity that exists in these settings is protective or harmful. To properly address this question, it must be noted that hepatocytes require energy for the maintenance of hepatic and systemic homeostasis. Some of the more energy consuming activities in the liver include: carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism; clearance and metabolism of hormones, neurotransmitters and toxins; and excretion of endogenous and exogenous products and metabolites. For the most part, these energy requirements are met by using […]
Hepatic regeneration following surgical resections or injury involving less than 70% of total liver mass proceeds uneventfully until restitution of the original liver mass is complete, often within three to six months in an otherwise healthy human liver. Rates of regenerative activity are proportional to the regenerative stimulus until 70% of the liver has been resected or destroyed. Thereafter, there is a precipitous decline (but not to baseline levels) in regenerative activity despite increased stimulation.
If loss of an inhibitory cytokine is responsible for priming hepa-tocytes to enter the cell cycle, the cytokine most likely to be involved is TGF-P1. TGF-P1 is a member of the multifunctional TGF’P superfamily that is synthesized by hepatic stellate cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, platelets and bile duct epithelial cells. It produces changes in transcriptional activity by activating the Smad intracellular signaling cascade and TFs, SP1, and p53. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the addition of TGF-P1 to primary hepatocyte cultures results in cessation of hepatocyte proliferation. In vivo, TGF-P1 expression is attenuated first in the periportal region of the lobule and then in a wave-like pattern towards the pericentral region (preceding hepatocyte mitosis). TGF-P1 receptors are also downregulated during the early regenerative period, rendering […]

The growth-promoting cytokines that have attracted the most interest in explaining hepatocyte entry into the cell cycle are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and IL-6. TNF-a is released by non-parenchymal cells in response to inflammatory activity and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). That TNF-a might play an important role in initiating the regenerative process is suggested by data indicating that TNF- antibodies inhibit DNA synthesis following partial hepatectomy and abrogate early TF activation. Moreover, mice with TNF-a receptor deficiencies do not regenerate their livers following partial hepatectomy. Increased TNF-a activity also induces nonparenchymal cells to release the other important regenerative cytokine, IL-6. IL-6 is a downstream mediator of TNF-a, as injections of IL-6 in TNF-a receptor-deficient mice restore hepatic regenerative activity to normal.
Continue reading " Hepatic regeneration: PRIMING FACTORS (Increase in growth-promoting cytokines/factors) "
Increases in hepatic flow cause an increase in endothelial cell shear stress, which in turn results in increased nitric oxide synthesis. High nitric oxide levels activate specific cytokines and transcription factors known to play an early role in the regenerative process. While there are many proponents of this theory, the principle arguments against it stem from early studies wherein it was demonstrated that: proliferative activity can occur without increases in and, indeed, in the absence of portal venous blood flow; the extent of proliferative activity in the liver is significantly less than would be predicted following arterialization of the portal venous system; non-parenchymal cells tend not to proliferate following experiments designed to enhance hepatic blood flow; and in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury, regeneration occurs but […]
What remains the Holy Grail of hepatic regeneration is the identity of the factor(s) responsible for priming quiescent hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle. Leading candidates include: changes in the electrical charges or potential differences across hepatocyte membranes; increases in remnant liver blood flow; destruction of the liver matrix; release (or increased expression) of growth promoting cytokines/factors; and loss (or decreased expression) of growth-inhibiting cytokines/factors.
The growth inhibitors most often cited as influencing priming and/or G1/S transition are TGF-P, Rb, p27, p16, GADD45, p53, p21 and activin. If cellular or DNA abnormalities are detected, these regulatory factors, and p53 in particular, exert sufficient inhibitory effects to prevent cell progression through the restriction point. If, on the other hand, no such abnormalities exist, growth promoters predominate and progression ensues. The actual progression of cells through the cell cycle occurs as a result of activation of cycle dependent kinases (CDKs). CDKs are enzymes consisting of a labile, structural protein and a more stable kinase. A series of CDKs (CDK4/6, CDK2, and CDC2) are activated as the cell progresses through different stages of the cell cycle and each binds to a succession of […]

The restaurant is divided into three zones, the first being the elegant Thai House 'Baan Thai’ which represents the traditional Thai houses of the Chakri period which still adorn Bangkok today. The area has wooden wall panelling embellished with intricately embroidered pictures of traditional Thai dancers. The Thai Pavilion is a sunken seating area; guests can sit on comfortable handmade cushions and dine in the style of the North. The Garden Zone was inspired by the North East of Thailand and is decorated with bamboo trees to recreate the many bamboo forests of the region with sculptures influenced by Khmer art in the Thawaravadi period. The waiting area is fashioned like a beach from the South, where guests can relax while waiting to be seated. More information at www.siampalacethairestaurant.co.uk

Settlement of International Disputes on the environment: Defect of the Existing Mechanisms and Solutions
My decision to start writing came late in life. I was 50, a half-century in age, when I decided to throw all caution to the wind and start writing with purpose. Recognizing my age and eventual mortality, time wasn’t on … Continue reading →

Each book is made up of episodes that connect to a larger story. The final book in the Stool 17 series was released May 2017. If you ask him if it’s best to read them in order, he would say, “Yeah! I have a yacht payment due.” But more importantly, each volume builds upon the others.
From two projects on humanization of work, the article presents points on power and subjectivity. Each in their own way, the projects deal with transformation of monotonous work in industry. The first one has a mostly negative angle showing obstacles and barriers to change. Although wishes for change are expressed in interviews and group discussions with workers, the potentials are held back and obscured by resistance and defence mechanisms. The second project, on the other hand, giving the workers more autonomy, mainly has a positive angle showing human resources and experiences of progress. Although the progressive side is the predominant one, it does not conceal the difficulties and conflicts. Therefore, both projects point towards dialectics between potentials for change and barriers against change on the shop floor. They show contradictions and conflicts, when processes of change interfere with the established cultures and structures of power. The article argues that orientations and experiences of work are compound and even contradictory. What is exposed by the workers in projects or investigations of change, depends on the methods, the ways of cooperation and the perspective of change. Comparing the two cases, only the democratic one showed potentials for radical innovations.
Women, the law and the workplace. Vol. 3. Locating the role of labor politics within feminism in the late twentieth century af (red.)Sybil Lilpschultz
Bringing together legal rulings and commentary, this three-volume collection documents the development of legal protections for women in the workplace. The comprehensive coverage encompasses the major legal and constitutional issues, including debates over minimum wage legislation, issues of gender equality versus gender difference, maternity leave, health hazards in the workplace for pregnant women, and other vital topics. This set will become an essential guide for students and scholars, as well as lay readers.

Pumpkin season is officially dead to us until next year, which means it's peppermint and hot chocolate time! Target knows what's up, as they are carrying Hot Cocoa M&Ms starting in November. And not only are they carrying them— no other store is.
Target dropped the chocolate-y news at their 2018 holiday preview last week, alongside the revelations that are Ghirardelli Toffee Cookie Crunch, Lindt Snickerdoodle, Reese’s Santa’s Helpers, and Dove Hot Cocoa (all things that will also exclusively be carried at Target this year).
Back to the matter at hand, though: the M&Ms. Turns out M&Ms that are hot cocoa-flavored are milk chocolate, as usual, but they also have a white chocolate marshmallow-flavored center. The bag you see above contains both brown and white M&Ms, both of which are marshmallow-white when you bite into them.
Not that you bite M&Ms into halves before eating them, right? That would be weird. Like, far be it from me to judge your M&M-eating ways, but that would be entirely weird. But whatever.

Located at sought-after Yonge and Eglinton, the Plaza Midtown represents the best of both worlds – efficient and well connected with access anywhere in the city, yet completely self-contained, an enclave unto itself. It’s a neighbourhood rapidly evolving into the future. Two buildings on one site leveraging existing structures, the Plaza Midtown declares ownership of midtown Toronto, a reflection of Eglinton’s uniquely piecemeal history, evolving organically to suit the influx of area inhabitants. This is the new midtown. This is Plaza Midtown.
Nature lovers, rejoice. The Yonge and Eglinton neighbourhood has something for every outdoor enthusiast and fitness fanatic. When it comes to shopping, there is a fine line between "want" and "need". This area provides a retail experience unlike any other, with virtually everything you want/need, all within walking distance. Furthermore, some of the city's top-ranked public and private schools are in this neighbourhood.
Plaza Midtown Condos is a condo and townhouse development by Plaza in preconstruction at 33 Holly Street, Toronto. With a Walk Score of 98, Yonge and Eglinton's impressive daily foot traffic tops an estimate 80,000 pedestrians daily - rivalled only by Toronto's Yonge and Dundas Square. It is already a walker's paradise, but soon, with the imminent Crosstown LRT, the intersection will be even more accessible than ever before. By foot, by train, by car - you decide.

Mehta's current research projects center around four themes. The first is understanding India's Great Transformation, the profound social, political and economic changes of the last two decades, and the trajectory they are likely to take in the future. This will result in a book. The second project looks at the role of law in Indian society. It will specifically focus on the justiciability of social and economic rights, and whether judicial intervention is a good means of achieving those objectives. This project will result in a series of papers. The third project - a collaborative project-related to the first two is on Globalization and the Indian State, that looks at the legitimacy challenges facing the Indian State in an era of globalization. The fourth project continues Mehta's long standing interest in philosophical ethics and explores what it means to lead an examined life. In addition Mehta will continue to perform the role of loyal opposition and engage the public and government through columns on topical issues.

The Centre for the Study of Law and Governance [Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi] initiated the establishment of the "Law and Social Sciences Research Network" in order to bring together scholars, lawyers and doctoral researchers engaged in research and teaching of issues of law in different social sciences in contemporary South Asian contexts. We believed that the critical work that has emerged from different institutional locations and theoretical frameworks, has yet to find a common forum which can act as a medium for exchange of ideas, work, materials, pedagogies and aspirations for the way law, regulation and society as objects of research as well as sites of praxis have been envisaged variously. The attempt of this network is to create a forum for academics, researchers, and lawyers to interact with each other to find productive conversations with each other as well as enhance these conversations into future directions that law and social sciences scholarship in India might mature into.
LASSnet, anchored at CSLG, seeks to organise a network conference every 2-3 years, collaborate on specific themes with institutions in South Asia, especially, take the idea of publishing a series of volumes on these themes seriously as well as initiating reading groups/work in progress meetings.
So far we have organised 3 network conferences in Delhi and Pune in India and one conference in Sri Lanka. We run a LASSnet Delhi Chapter which meets once in two months allowing researchers to present their ongoing work. We have also started a reading group, LASS Readings.
We would be delighted if you were to send us names and emails of those you think might want to join this network. We hope that people will also share their work, and ideas.
CSLG also has a library that has put together important texts on law and social science scholarship. This network could use the archives at CSLG meaningfully as well as enhance it. If you would like to be part of LASSnet, please send your contact details and short bio to lassnet@gmail.com
We began by noting that law is conventionally taught and practiced, in South Asia (though not only there) by treating it as an autonomous and self-sufficient phenomenon. The doctrinal researchers regard law as autonomous and believe it is capable of giving an account of itself. The law also tends to be narrowly conceived as what judges, legislators, or the police ‘do’ – ignoring the diffuse structures of power and governance, and practices of regulation, normalisation, and biopolitics that penetrate bodies and condition behaviour.
The notion that law is autonomous (legal formalism or legal positivism) has been subjected to sustained challenge over many decades by scholars who draw on social science methodologies, as well as by the law and literature movement, and by activists who constantly challenge the positivist image of law. Broadly conceived, these scholars seek to explain law as a social, anthropological, historical, and economic artefact which should be understood and studied as such. This implies also that we trace the genealogies of categories which inform law, and the images and imaginings of law in contemporary social science theory. All this suggests that the law is not confined to state law or the appellate judiciary. Not only it remains a fact that state law remains inherently plural; it interacts with plural regimes of customariness. We wish to understand how forms of state and non-state law mutually constitute each other and how they relate to different structures of power and techniques of violence.
Methods and techniques drawn from the social sciences are central to understanding the market, legal structures, regulation and statecraft in the era of globalisation. In mapping the field of law and social sciences, we interrogate the place of law and economics in the larger context of the scripting of the transformation of legal and regulatory regimes. We recognise that while regulation has emerged as a field in conversation with the discipline of economics, there is very little work which details the intersection of regulation with law. Moreover, the conversations between regulators and lawyers do not seem to be informed by social science frameworks and methodologies. The Law and Social Sciences Network (LASS) reflects the interests of those scholars who wish to engage with interdisciplinary research on the transformation of legal and regulatory regimes from varying empirical and theoretical viewpoints.
LASS recognises that much scholarship informed by the social sciences in South Asia has been engaged with social movements and forms of activism which have challenged law’s power to deny, censor, hurt, humiliate and kill. The engagement with this politics of hurt has led to many passionate debates about the place of law in our work and in our politics. Yet in South Asia, the research, teaching and practice of law that draws on the social sciences has been relegated to the margins, and radical activist engagement with law devalued by official discourses of judicial reform. LASS invites reflexive engagements from scholars and activists about the relationship between law and social movements.
The Law and Social Sciences Network (LASS) was constituted to map the field of Law and Social Sciences in South Asia. Its objective is to bring together academics, lawyers and researchers engaged in innovative legal research in South Asia which employs social science methodologies. Building on existing conversations, LASS hopes to stimulate the development of further research into the links between knowledge production, techniques of government, and the ever transforming interdependencies of power, law, and resistance. LASS promotes an examination of how law and/or regulation is constituted as an object of study, and an interrogation of the conditions of its truth claims.
LASS may or may not necessarily inhabit the intellectual and political zones of comfort or of distress created by the habitus of postmodern jurisprudence. We invite critical engagement with the global travels of mainstream networks of Law and Economics, Law and Society or Critical Legal Studies, by providing a sustained critique of the fascination of progressive Eurocentric scholarship for South Asian law, economy and society studies.
LASS may equally turn its attention to the precious and precocious critiques of the “dark side of [European] modernity” which rarely attend to the histories of colonization and the Cold War as these have affected South Asia
We remain sensitive to the fact that the very expression ‘South Asia’ embodies forms of epistemic geopolitical imperialism. LASS remains particularly anxious concerning this essentialization of identity and by the same token resists its translation into an “area studies”. Further, it needs saying that some new geopolitics is now in the making. LASS thus calls for an appreciation of the histories of diversity and plurality, within which inescapably new traditions of law/society/humanities tradition of discourse may be further re-imagined. What purchase this may constitute for the tradition of the distinctive European post-Enlightenment critical legal studies tradition is an important thematic inviting further dialogical/discursive fellowships of juristic learning.
These methodological challenges are suggested with a view to inviting their further elaboration. Contributors should be mindful of these methodological concerns as they address issues in the following more specific settings. In particular, papers, panels, and presentations were invited on:
· Constitutionalism, rights and regulation. Has the discourse on constitutionalism met new challenges in relation to changing statecraft, international law, or human rights in South Asia? How does regulation intersect with rights discourses? How do pictures of the written and unwritten scripts of constitutional law circulate in different sites of law and life?
· Languages of Power and of Resistance. What literary and visual representations of the law and resistance to law exist in the South Asian region? In what ways, the 'poetics' tend to subvert politics? Herein we signal the problematic of the multiplicity of the official languages and the politics of translation. How does the politics of resistance constitute the fields of law, creativity and collective action? What are the trajectories that turn the public domain inside out and force new sensibilities and new paradigms that foreground a different understanding of “justice”?
· The politics of law and judicial reform. What is the politics of law and judicial reform? How are histories of such reform to be archived and evaluated? How do different forms of representations [such as the media or those emanating from social movements] engage with projects of law reform? Do contemporary engagements with reform and resistance benefit with tracing the genealogy of categories, and discursive shifts which create new forms of subjection and subjectivities?
· Colonial and Postcolonial Imaginations of the Law: The challenges by legal historians and postcolonial theorists in thinking through law and social forms have led to a rich body of literature on law and society in South Asian contexts. We invite contributions interrogating colonial as well as neo-imperial formations of law, governance, and regulation. This panel retains an interest in the contestations on law’s past as these relate to the constitution of the nation-state, and reflections on the impact of history in the reconstitution of law as an object of study.
· The practices of governance in relation to environment, health and sexuality. What are the processes of govermentality which sanitise, medicalise or pathologise some forms of life? What form of regulatory power inhabits the constitution of waste and how does it participate in the formation of public aesthetics? How is the body encountered in public or administrative law? Is gender/sexual orientation/disability a site of recognition that allows us to critique the manifold elisions in the body of the law?
· Technology, Life and the Law. The relationship between science, technology, the body and resources are mediated by the state-corporation alliances in a globalised era. What are the ways in which we may interrogate the deployment of technology to control bodies and life forms, and the regulation of both life and technology through law?
· Technosciences, Environment, Risk and Regulation: How have human rights and social movement discourses pursued this relationship? What images of a ‘risk society’ remain constitutionally legitimate? Are these ideas revisited in the context of the environmental contemporary discourses, such as the global discourse on climate change?
· Property in different domains of law and life. What are the new challenges faced today in thinking through property rights and discourses? What are some new forms of property emerging through new phases of economic reform? What futures one may envisage for agrarian reforms? What kinds if new property stand invested, particularly in relation to the changing regimes of intellectual property rights in South Asia?
· Labour rights, livelihoods and mass displacement of peoples in contemporary contexts of globalisation. What is the relationship between law and regimes of impoverishment in South Asia? In particular, how may globalization affect constitutionally mandated visions of development as most benefiting the worst-off peoples? As concerns worker’s rights, what legacies may we derive from the histories and narratives of working class movements in South Asia? How may we ‘read’ these alongside with the globalization–induced programs aimed at creation of ‘flexible labour markets’?
· Social suffering and political violence. This has multiple dimensions not fully exhausted by the figure of the detainee, torture and disappearance; forms of collective violence and atrocities in everyday and collective contexts; and the modalities of capital punishment and custodial violence have elicited critical research. How is the everyday conceptualised in these contexts? Beyond, and related to this, remains the question of the reproduction of foundational violence of the law. This emerges of course in the context of India-Pakistan partition; yet it also emerges equally fiercely, for example, in Afghanistan, the erstwhile Tibet, and Burma. This conference invites full attention to the postcolonial ‘nacropolitics’ (to deploy here the phrase-regime of Mbembe).
· Terror, Law and Biopolitics: What is the relation between terror, law and bio-politics? Or what would constitute the jurisprudence of emergency or exception in South Asia today? Put another way, we need to explore fully the law-society relationship between the pre and post 9/11 forms of wars of, and wars against ‘terror.’ How may have the South Asian studies tradition, at all, addressed ‘terror?’
· Movements of autonomy and secession: The South Asian experience remains marked by constitutional and ‘extra’-constitutional insurgencies. How has the construction of the political been conceptualized and narrated in law and society studies tradition in the ‘region?’ How does militarization of protest and of governance proceed to reproduce new forms of ‘bare life?’

I have the chance to drive this car because my mother wants me to take care of this car at Kampar since at home no one is free to take care of it i.e. wash it every night, vacuum it etc. So, other than Bachelor Degree of Science (HONS) Biotechnology, I am also pursuing Bachelor Degree of Mechanical (HONS) Car Maintainence.
My parents count every single meter for me. Which means, they know how many meters I run during the time me at Kampar. I believe my sister also encounter this problem. For example if I come out from house to UTAR go-return too often then I die. There is once I went Cameron just to buy my FYP flowers and I got &#$(*&#$&%#$&#@@(*&#$* When I drive VIVA, no such thing will happen.
I cannot have a single scar on this car. When I drive this car, I have to be extremely very careful and thus, I cannot show my real ability or skill of driving a car like what I did to Viva last time. T___________T I am so not me. I am a diva of Viva but I am a bird of Vios.
So, I think I am returning back the car to my mother and tell her sorry I cannot take the HEAVY responsibility of taking care of her car. T_________________T

The British Virgin Islands are some of the finest sailing grounds in the world. They are a score of islands just a few miles from one another, with good anchorages and reliable, year-round Tradewinds of ten to twenty knots. And they are exceptionally beautiful too, even by Caribbean standards..
The sailing escape in the Caribbean is famous all over the world. The trade winds provide a fairly reliable source for very enjoyable sailing trips. The relative short distance between islands make the entire region ideal for island hopping during a dreamlike sailing holiday. An escape in the Caribbean today offers far more than the world's best beaches. As the islands have grown into international travel destinations, their individual features and strengths have emerged. Many traditional cultures have been preserved, and the astonishing ecological treasures of the islands are now among their most celebrated features.
The richness of the Corsican landscape makes every attempt to describe very difficult, because there are so many various splendours which come close together or become intermingled between marine blue sky and heavenly horizon ; such as the lofty peaks, valleys worthy of a legend, wild or harmonious gulfs, sheltered inlets, placid or wild beaches, cliffs sculpted by men and spindrift, hillsides cut out for vines and the olive tree.
The numerous islands and cays that make up the Grenadines, are the ideal destination for a sailing escape in the Caribbean, the perfect place for yachting, swimming, diving in the deep blue waters and enjoying the beaches. The islands lie between the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean and are located north of Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago and south of St. Vincent. All the islands are low-lying, ringed by coral reefs, and famed for some of the best beaches and sailing conditions on the planet. You can glide from island to island in an hour or so in trade winds of 10-25 knots, swimming ashore to a beach bar, watching giant sea turtles and bumping into visitors from all over the world for a drink at sunset.

Last night I finally saw the Voyager episode with Q that made everyone stop watching Voyager. I guess I can see how they misunderstood it. I liked but I didn't because I stated thinking about a O.S. Card short story and then I compared that with a Heinlein story and a Dr. Who story, and then... well, I thought to myself all the way walking to school and still haven't figured it out yet.
The subject of immortality is a subject science fiction approaches on many occasions. Is it death that makes people do what they do? Do people try to become great because they know they will die? And is immortality really as evil or as dull as people make it out to be?
Lois, a woman I spoke to about death, life and afterlife, firmly believes that once you are alive your spirit will never die. She says that there is no such thing as true death, total non-existence. She believes that one a person is a living, sentient spirit, that they will exist forever-after in one form of another.
The Voyager episode, "Death Wish" says that living forever is not what people should strive for. "There is nothing new in heaven or on earth". If one lived forever, time would pass and pass, and pass. After eons of time, boredom and apathy will emerge. No matter how creative you are, or how much you have done, one day you will become bored. There is only so much to see, only so much to do and think in the universe. According to "Death Wish", an immortal will have seen it all, done it all and eventually wish to be annihilated.
On the other hand, according to Heinlein, to live, simply to exist forever is the dream of all mankind. It is what people are made for, this is the basic desire of all. To him, eternity will be exciting and great, but only as long as you have someone to love, a purpose to carry on, and a creative mind. Most people posses all these things. You can do what you enjoy the most, be with the one you love the most forever, without worrying about death, sickness or running out of time.
O.S. Card says that death is in a way, beautiful. To him it is death that makes man wish live forever. People in a sense life forever through being someone great, or doing something incredible that will exist long after they are gone, and in a sense, make them immortal. O.S. Card also says that beginnings must have endings, and without them people would not be the way they are. Without death people would have no need to create. Creation is for one who knows he will die but wishes to live forever. Books, paintings, any form of long-lasting anything in bulk would not exist. Why read it in a book if you've experienced it yourself and you know that everyone else will experience the same thing eventually? Why paint a picture when you have it in your mind, to remember whenever you want? Why write other than to know what it feels like to write? No one would need to read it, because they already have seen, done, felt what is written.
The Doctor who book says that he who wants to live forever usually has bad reasons for it. The idea is, we have all been given the time we need. Time was a gift, and trying to get more is not acceptable. It's like a lost man who stays a night at a kind strangers house, but in the morning the lost man decides that he likes his bed and the house so much that he refuses to leave, and forces the kind stranger to let him stay.
People may live on forever, people may cease to exist. If one lived in eternity alone, it would be lonely, it would be terrible, one would get bored, just as one living alone on Earth. But, different people believe different things, everyone sees the world differently. The universe is infinite, people's imaginations are infinitely different. We all have an infinite capacity to learn. There is so much to think, to do, to see, to feel. Every minute something new is made, every second, something new is happening. How could one become bored in eternity? One can never see, do, feel, create it all.

4. Relation ????S is applied to the selected standard manifestation and the associated symbol is provided as the measured value. The above process can be formally described by the following set of relations. q ↓ ???? → ????s x ↑ {qsn } → {xsn } There are different possible ways to define a measurement scale, and their properties may limit the analysis that can be performed on the measurement results. Five different kinds of scales are generally employed, ordered according to an increasing level of richness in the information they convey.
This step allows us also to verify that the whole measurement context has been correctly identified. If the identification is correct, the measurement goals are achieved, otherwise also the identification process has to be refined. 3 Final Remarks The different processes that take part in any measurement activity have been briefly reported and discussed in this section. The obtained model shows the steps required 20 MEASUREMENT MODELS AND UNCERTAINTY to implement a measurement activity that is correct from a methodological point of view, and not only from an experimental (or instrumental) perspective.
Interval scales This kind of scale is an ordinal scale that conveys additional information about the size of the interval between adjacent classes. Examples of interval scales are the Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales, and the Richter seismic magnitude scale. Sums and subtractions are the only allowed mathematical operations. Affine mappings between scales that preserve the order and interval proportions5 are also allowed. 8 ⋅ ????C + 32. Mean and standard deviation are allowed statistical inferences for these scales.
Spain's unemployment rate hit a record high in the third quarter, with one in four out of work and more expected to lose their jobs in 2013 as the next phase of government cutbacks kicks in.
At exactly 25 percent, Friday's official number was the highest since the Franco dictatorship ended in the mid-1970s, and gives fresh impetus to calls by labor unions for a general strike next month.
That action is part of an increasingly vocal protest campaign against successive waves of spending cuts and tax hikes that, critics argue, has only served to put more people out of work rather than getting to grips with Spain's economic crisis.
"Weaker growth than expected, coupled with austerity, could easily see unemployment hit 26 percent next year," said Silvio Peruzzo, economist at Nomura in London.
The rate was 24.6 percent in the second quarter, and analysts had expected Friday's National Statistics Institute data to show a rise to 25.1 percent.
Of European Union countries only Greece, mired in an even more brutal recession than Spain and battling to stave off bankruptcy, has a higher jobless rate.
Friday's data puts further pressure on the government as it debates whether to seek international aid while it battles to bring down the public deficit in line with European Union demands in a recession that shows no sign of letting up.
Government forecasts show the economy contracting next year by 0.5 percent, but economists in a Reuters poll this week said they expect it to shrink three times faster.
"There is a debate over the optimistic growth outlook for next year by the government, which is given little credibility," Nomura's Peruzzo said.
Spain's financing needs are largely covered for this year, and its cost of borrowing from debt markets has eased significantly since August thanks to the European Central Bank's promise to buy the country's bonds should it call for financial help.
But austerity measures worth over 60 billion euros ($78 billion) by 2014, are likely to crimp growth further, and cast more workers out of work.
Meanwhile, labor reforms pushed through this year aimed at making it easier for companies to hire and fire have encouraged many to make mass layoffs as demand remains fragile.
The government expects the economy to shrink 1.5 percent this year, while the official outlook is for the unemployment rate not to fall below 24 percent until 2014.
Peruzzo said the outlook would only improve if Spain is granted more time to cut its public deficit, a move that is backed by the International Monetary Fund to help struggling euro zone countries.
"I've been out of a job for six months and am looking for work wherever I can get it," said German Herrero, 42. He said he lost his job at Vodafone after 12 years of service and had left his family behind in the eastern city of Albacete to search for work in the capital.
The economy slipped back into recession at the end of last year. The government says 2013 will be the final year of recession for Spain, a view shared by the euro zone's largest bank Santander.
On Friday Madrid's transport system slowed to a skeleton service as workers protested against salary cuts. Protests have mounted over the past weeks, particularly against cuts to the country's healthcare system and education.
Some people in work have cause to complain too, going without paychecks as companies struggle to meet payments, while others have welcomed early retirement packages in fear of worsening times ahead.
"I'm happy as I was given early retirement at 55, but the situation is grim and Germany has the country by the neck," said Jose Albalt in a wet Madrid on Friday morning. He said he was offered a retirement package last year when the bank he worked for was merged with another and 1,200 jobs were lost.
Spain's banking system is undergoing a major restructuring process after property investments they made during a decade-long boom soured when the economy began to crash.

Adjustment of forces in large-span structures in the design of a rational constructive form of a Dolphinarium in Volgograd
In some cases, architectural, technological or other special requirements dictate the development of buildings and structures with large spans of shells. The choice of the scheme of bearing structures depends on the size of the span, architectural and planning solutions, the shape of the building in plan, the height of the structure, the presence and type of suspended transport, the requirements for the rigidity of the shell, the nature of lighting and aeration, type of roof, size and distribution of loads, the need to accommodate large masses of people and other factors. Differences in the purpose of large-span buildings and structures, features of technological processes, architectural and aesthetic requirements determine the use of a variety of solutions of such coatings. The article presents design measures for the implementation of architectural and artistic solutions of the building of the Dolphinarium in Volgograd. Analytical description of complex architectural and structural forms is performed. The analysis of existing structural forms of large-span structures is given. In the design, the concept of a combined archcable system was implemented, in which the cable system acts as an unloading and supporting system. The study of the work under load of various schemes of the cable system. It was also investigated the influence of pre-tensioning braces on strain supported their designs, and from what was determined optimal value of the efforts of the cables tension.

Golden Artist Colors has enjoyed the privilege of collaborating with artists to make highest quality professional art materials. That same collaborative process has produced a new, thoroughly modern watercolour called QoR.
QoR [pron. ‘core’] retains the best qualities of traditional watercolours while expanding the range and versatility of each colour. QoR’s exclusive binder provides more pigment in every brushstroke, offering a strength, range and versatility unmatched in the history of watercolours.
The unique QoR formulation accentuates the luminosity and brilliance of pigments even after drying. It provides the subtlety, transparency and flow of a great watercolour, with colorus that have as much vibrancy and fire as the best acrylic or oil paint.
QoR has been formulated to embody the essence of watercolours while offering these unique qualities:

Berkeley,CA - Hailed as the world's most powerful transmission electron microscope,TEAM 0.5 is living up to expectations. UsingTEAM 0.5 (TEAM stands for Transmission Electron Aberration-corrected Microscope), researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have produced stunning images of individual carbon atoms in graphene, the two-dimensional crystalline form of carbon that is highly prized by the electronics industry.
These first time ever images were recorded at Berkeley Lab'sNationalCenterfor Electron Microscopy (NCEM), a DOE national user facility that is a premier center for electron microscopy and microcharacterization.TEAM0.5, its newest instrument, is capable of producing images with half-angstrom resolution, which is less than the diameter of a single hydrogen atom.
"Simply put,TEAM0.5 is the best transmission electron microscope in the world, representing a quantum leap forward in instrumentation," said physicist Alex Zettl who led this research. "Having the ability to see, basically in real time, each and every individual atom in a sample is unbelievably useful and the images we can now see have been jaw-dropping for even the most seasoned electron microscopists.TEAM0.5 is pushing transmission electron microscopy to a new level."
Zettl holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division (MSD) and the Physics Department at theUniversityofCalifornia'sBerkeleycampus, where he is the director of theCenterofIntegrated Nanomechanical Systems. Collaborating with him on this graphene imaging project were Jannik Meyer, also withBerkeleyLab's Materials Sciences Division, and Christian Kisielowski, Rolf Erni and Marta Rossell of NCEM.
Their results were published in the journal Nanoletters, in a paper entitled: "Direct imaging of lattice atoms and topological defects in graphene membranes."
The properties of solid materials stem from the arrangement of their constituent atoms in the solid's crystal structure. While technologies such as electron and x-ray crystallography can reveal the atomic geometry of a crystal, they do not identify the precise location and position of each individual atom. When the dimensions of a material shrink to the nanoscale, the location and position of each individual atom becomes critically important, as Zettl explains.
"Think of the steel re-bars on a three-dimensional structure, like a jungle gym," he said. "If a small piece of re-bar is rusted out somewhere in the center of the gym, it won't likely have much affect on the overall properties of the structure. In a two-dimensional structure, however, a rusted out segment becomes a much bigger problem, and in a one-dimensional structure, i.e., a single re-bar, a rusted out segment can be catastrophic, causing the entire structure to fail. On a nanoscale crystal, one missing atom or some other defect in the arrangement can result in catastrophic failure."
Graphene is especially sensitive to defects in its atomic structure. Consisting of a single-layered sheet of carbon atoms arranged in hexagons, like a sheet of chicken wire with an atom at each nexus, graphene features extraordinary electrical, mechanical and thermal properties that could enable it to serve in a broad array of carbon-based electronic devices. For the enormous promises of graphene to be fulfilled, however, scientists need a much better understanding of how specific types of defects in the crystal structure, including those that change location over time, affect its properties.
"Theorists are currently making all kinds of predictions about the properties of graphene for different local atomic configurations, but untilTEAM0.5, we did not have the ability to actually see and study these configurations in real time," Zettl said.
TEAM0.5 features state-of-the-art technical advances including an extremely bright electron source, ultra-stable electronics to reduce drift and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to provide optical corrections for spherical aberration (blurring). By making points of light look like disks, spherical aberrations have been the prime limiting factors in the resolution of transmission electron microscopy.
Says NCEM principal investigator and collaborator on this study Kisielowski, "TEAM0.5 allows for the detection of every single atom from the Periodic Table provided that the sample under investigation can stand the radiation damage (TEAM0.5's record-setting half-angstrom resolution was achieved with an electron beam that was 300 kilovolts (kV) in energy.)
Correcting spherical aberration makes it possible to use theTEAM0.5 not only for broad-beam "wide-angle" images but also for scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), in which the tightly focused electron beam is moved across a sample as a probe. In this mode,TEAM0.5 is capable of performing spectroscopy on one atom at a time — an ideal way to precisely locate impurities in an otherwise homogeneous sample, such as individual dopant atoms in a semiconductor. Aberration correction also enablesTEAM0.5 to produce high resolution images at relatively low electron beam energies. Because of their longer wavelengths, lower energy electrons are more difficult to focus than higher energy electrons. Aberration correction overcomes this problem.
UsingTEAM0.5, Zettl, Kisielowski and their collaborators were able to obtain images of graphene membranes - crystalline foils one atom thick – at a resolution of one angstrom using electron beams of a mere 80 kilovolts (kV) in energy.
"The low voltage was crucial for the stability and study of these graphene membranes which are much too fragile to be imaged at the higher energies required for conventional transmission electron microscopy," said Zettl. "That we were able to detect and resolve every individual carbon atom in these foils at 80kV is relevant for future studies of organic materials where low-z atoms dominate and higher energies are damaging to samples.TEAM0.5 provides fantastic resolution at low electron energies, which is the best of both worlds for organics."
Added Kisielowski, "This is not even the end of the story. We have since made improvements to further boost signal-to-noise ratios and already have new and even better images. There is much more to come."
TEAM0.5 was designed and constructed through a collaboration led by Berkeley Lab and including DOE's Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, the Frederick Seitz Materials Laboratory of the University of Illinois, and two private companies specializing in electron microscopy, theFEICompany headquartered in Portland, Oregon, and CEOS of Heidelberg, Germany.
This past weekend I went down to Sydney to see Joss Whedon speak at the Sydney Opera House and spend some wonderful time with by Browncoats. And, of course, for eating!
Saturday night was Brendan's birthday party, and he was showing off his new Thermomix by whipping up several vegan-friendly dishes (and one not so vegan friendly meaty chili). Combined with two delicious tarts that Leigh brought along, everyone there, vegan or otherwise, was very well fed!
Here is my dinner plate, loaded up with goodness. What you can see here is a slice of Leigh's two quiches - a sun dried tomato and smoke Sheese quiche and a hummus and vegetable quiche, with lemon and pea risotto, brown rice salad and beetroot salad (those last three all from the Thermomix). It was good, and I went back for some seconds as well! For dessert I tucked into a delicious little treat that Leigh had brought me from the vegan bake sale - but more on those in a later post!
Sunday morning came along and this was Joss day! I started my day with an almond croissant and cherry pie, then had a mini cheezecake snack about an hour later. Again, more on these in the bake sale post! We then headed into Newtown for a late brunch at Naked Espresso.
After my super sweet start to the day, I decided to try something different from new usual, and I had the scrambled tofu feast - scrambled tofu, mushrooms, spinach, pumpkin, hashbrowns, toast and homemade baked beans.
Diana had my usual, which is different from her usual (the BLAT). My usual is the buckwheat pancakes with a side of Redwood bacon and hashbrowns. There must always be potatoes at brunch!
After brunch, Brendan and I headed down for a stroll through Newtown (Diana had to go help set up for the Joss Whedon cocktail party her work was involved in), and we ended up at Buppa's Bakehouse - one of Brendan's favourite places in the world. Buppa's is an American style cake and pie shop. They also have New York style bagels, which are vegan! Even though I had just eaten brunch, I could hardly say no.
Mmmmm.... warm bagel with Nuttelex and sour cherry jam. Buppa's has an excellent grasp on what is required to be vegan. Unfortunately they don't offer a vegan option in their regular daily selection, but they can bake a range of vegan cakes and cupcakes to order.
After the bagel, I was just incredibly full. And a power walk from the bus stop the Sydney Opera House was not helping. But no matter, because it was Joss time! Wow, what an incredible 90 minutes! He is an incredible speaker - funny, articulate and honest. I laughed, I cried, I love it. For a great write up of the event, click here. And if you are going 'Joss who?', well then - get thee to a DVD store and stock up on Buffy, Angel, Firefly, Serenity, Dollhouse and friends stat!
Afterwards, some people went to the after party, and those of us that didn't went to a nearby pub to wait for them. I was still quite full, which was good because the pub had a very uninspired selection on the menu and certainly nothing vegan! But once we were all joined up again, a large group of us headed out for dinner at Wagamamas. Leigh, my fellow Browncoat vegan, was also there. So what do two hungry vegan ladies eat at Wagamama?
Some sort of stir-fry. I don't remember the exact names. We subbed out the soba noodles (which contained egg) for rice noodles.
And, of course, pickles! You cannot have Japanese without pickled vegetables. Nom! All washed down with Japanese tea and water. A tasty feast indeed!
I headed back to Brisbane yesterday, thankful for a wonderful weekend with some of my favourite people, my favourite write/director/producer/etc and some delicious food!
This photo isn't from Sydney. Last night, after I got back, I went to Loving Hut with The Jens. I just wanted to share their new starter - French Onion Pouches. Inside these little crispy packets is hot, melty french onion cream cheeze... which sounds wrong, but is oh-so-right! I could become addicted. ;)
This handsome man is Caleb, one of Brendan and Diana's kitties. Here he is being just utterly adorable - his back legs are still sitting on the top platform of his scratching post, but he has his front legs standing on the lower one. He sat like this for ages, looking rather happy and zoned out. He's a gorgeous big cutie. :)
It's so hard when your babies grow up. Saturday the 28th of August is my little Sahara's birthday, and this year she turned NINE! And she's my youngest! I can't believe how quickly time goes by. It seems like just yesterday that an 18 month old Sahara came into my life, and my brain always considers her to be that age, forever. Unfortunately I had a plane to catch the morning of her birthday (more on that later) so I only had a few hours with her, but my parents made the rest of her birthday super special and took lots of photos for me.
We started her birthday with some Greenie's in bed! I keep a packet in my bedside draw, and every time I think about opening it she materialises like magic! So on this particular morning I risked spoiling her appetite for breakfast with a pre-breakfast crunch and snorgle.
If there is one thing that makes her very excited, it is steamed broccoli! Here is a picture of her nomming into a special birthday bowl!
It's a flipped around post today, so here is a single food photo to end it on! My friend had her birthday a few weeks ago, and when I asked her what sort of cake she would like she said strawberry shortcake. I made this recipe, from Now Vegan by Lynda Stoner. I had to bake the cake about ten or fifteen minutes longer than she said in the book. Once you bake the shortcake, you cut it in half. The recipe then calls for strawberry jam and fresh strawberries to be layered in the middle. I also added a thick layer of Macadamia Creme from Vegan With A Vengeance, because I always thought strawberry shortcake was meant to have a creamy layer. Anyway, it was an awesome addition. The cake was very cute, and really nice. I wisely chose to take to work in bits and assemble it there, because after sitting for too long it goes a bit smooshy.
At the end of May this year, my little brother Greg moved to London to be with his beautiful girlfriend Jordy. Jordy has moved over the previous year to study acting, so they had been missing each other a lot during that time! Jordy flew home for a few weeks first to catch up with her family and friends, and then they flew back together.
While Jordy was here, our two families got together for lunch at our house. While there was some sort of fishy stew (eww), I made the following vegan options for the table.
Lemony Rice-Stuffed Grape Leaves from 1000 Vegan Recipes. This was the first time I had ever made dolmades, and I was quite happy with them. The tangy lemon flavour here is delicious! Plus, super cute.
Roasted Ratatouille Gratin and Chopped Salad, both from 1000 Vegan Recipes, also served with some olive and thyme sourdough bread from Sol Breads. The ratatouille was yummy, and the capsicum taste was not strong at all. However the capsicum content was enough to give me heartburn for the evening. Susan and capsicum are unmixy things. The salad, on the other hand, was awesome! It is a huge salad involving different lettuce varieties, chickpeas, tomatoes, cucumber, celery, carrot, olives, radishes and avocado. But you can more or less sub ingredients in and out at will.
The night before Greg set off, he selected the menu for our last ever family night dinner for some time. He did an excellent job of choosing some five star dishes!
The first course was French Onion Pastry Puffs from 1000 Vegan Recipes. These were delicious! The instructions say to cut either a 2- or 3-inch circle out of the puff pastry, and I used a 2-inch cookie cutter. Next time I think I would use a 3-inch cutter, as when they puffed up in the oven the yummy caramelised onion, olive and caper topping fell off a couple.
Rustic Cottage Pie from 1000 Vegan Recipes was the main course. This is a yummy combination of seitan, vegetables and mushroom sauce topped off with mashed potatoes.
To go on the side, he chose Roasted Baby Potatoes with Spinach, Olives, and Grape Tomatoes. Another excellent choice!
For dessert he picked Bread Pudding from The Joy of Vegan Baking. Just the thing to finish up the meal on a chilly night. Especially good with some soy ice cream as well.
And here are our jet-setting couple about to leave us. Aren't they a gorgeous pair? I should probably mention that the third person going in this flight with them was my brother's double bass, which was packed into a double bass case that stood at over eight feet tall! That was fun to get around. My brother is a fantastic jazz musician. I went to his farewell gig at the Brisbane Jazz Club a couple of weeks earlier, and it was amazing. The first time I had ever really seen him play in all those years. I am a slack sister.
Greg is having a lovely time in England, by the sounds of it, doing lots of gigs and experiencing all that London and its proximity of Europe has to offer!
In honour of my brother, I thought today I would spoil you with three photos! Here you can see how much my girls loved spending time with their uncle.
Sahara takes no prisoners! Actually, Greg and Sahara once jammed on the piano together. It was so super cute.
Speaking of napping, Gizmo snuggles up double warm. Actually, I have a lot of photos of Greg and Gizmo napping together. This cat does not waste the chance for a warm place to snooze!
Today I am home feeling sickly, I have the head cold thing that seems to be going around. As I work my way through an entire plantation's worth of tissues infused with an entire something's worth of aloe vera, I thought a blog post was in order. Earlier this year, I had my wisdom tooth out. I say tooth because I only have one wisdom tooth, the other three had never actually formed, and it chose this year to make itself known. There are a lot of photos in this post, by the way. Let's not forget the backlog I need to get through!
My mother had her wisdom tooth out a few weeks earlier. She had it done under local in the chair, and was pretty much fine straight away. I made her some soft food for the first couple of days, but then it was business as usual.
Green and Yellow Split Pea Soup from 1000 Vegan Recipes. Definitely use the option sliced vegan kielbasa! Seeing as we don't have vegan kielbasa ere in Australia, I just used a packet of Sanitarium sausages. They make a nice addition.
Autumn Medley Stew from 1000 Vegan Recipes, which is delicious - seitan, chickpeas and awesome vegetables with some pasta. It is also fantastic for breakfast the next day on toast!
So, when it came time for my wisdom tooth extraction, I was feeling calm and zen. I elected to have mine done under a general anaesthetic because I have a severe gag reflex, the tooth was impacted so would require sectioning, I do dental extractions on cats at work and know it is a brutal business at times, and I am a great big wimp. I had it done on a Thursday and had the next three days off. All would be right, right?
On the plus side, the anaesthetic was delightful! Propofol induction and sevoflurane maintenance, I did not feel groggy or gross at all afterwards. Hurrah! Also, I had a nasty cat bite on my hand from work the day before that was red and swollen and infected, and the IV antibiotics I had really knocked that on the head and it was heaps better even by the time I woke up! They also had vegan jelly for me when I woke up. The downside was the local anaesthetic they gave me that was meant to least for 12 hours wore off about an hour after waking up, which led to one of the most horribly painful half hours of my life until my trusty Nurofen Plus kicked in.
Chilled Carrot Soup from 1000 Vegan Recipes. Which is nice, but to be honest after an anaesthetic and having to fast from 5am that morning, it so wasn't hitting the spot I needed it to. So I had some leftovers.
Roasted Cauliflower and Shallots with Millet from 1000 Vegan Recipes. OK, so this photo is not from that night, it is from the night I actually made it. I had served it with marinated tofu and salad. It is really delicious, who doesn't love roasted cauliflower? Also great for a breakfast snack. However, on post-op night I just had a little bit of the millet stuff, warmed just to take the chill edge off, and then smooshed with my fork to break it up a bit more.
The next day the swelling had kicked in big time, and I was loving my good friends Paracetamol and Nurofen Plus. Not to mention the awesome ice pack head wrap the hospital had given me to keep ice on my swollen face. Here are the dinners I made in those first few days.
Orzo, White Beans, and Tomatoes with Lemony Spinach Pesto from 1000 Vegan Recipes. This was delicious, and also small and easy to eat for someone who couldn't use one side of their mouth and couldn't open their mouth open further than about 1cm.
Millet, Chard, and White Bean Casserole from 1000 Vegan Recipes. This is all kinds of awesome. If you have this book, go and make it. Again, it fits the easy to eat post tooth removal criteria.
Rice and Pea Soup from 1000 Vegan Recipes. This is lovely and creamy and has a really subtle flavour. You can either just enjoy the flavour as is, or sprinkle with some nooch, or alternate. My mother was particularly in love with this dish!
Barley and Winter Vegetable Stew from 1000 Vegan Recipes. This was made on the day I was meant to go back to work. I say meant to, because I did not. My face still looked like I had been punched and I couldn't really talk and I was still relying on trusty codeine, which makes me happy but sleepy. As luck would have it, I had the following two days off as well because my brother was moving overseas (more on that in the next post), which gave me some extra time to heal.
Yellow Dal with Spinach served with Chapati, both from 1000 Vegan Recipes. This is lovely, though I found the dal only really made about three servings.
This was almost a week after my operation, and I was finding that while to tooth pain was fading (even though my sutures had pulled through a few days after the op - gross), I was developing a burning pain in my throat. To the point I was dreaming that I was being strangled. A quick exam into the back of my throat explained why - I had ulcers all around my soft palate and on the end of my uvula! Thus started the longest and possibly most painful two weeks of my life.
Things I tried to dull the pain: Savacol mouth-rinse, alcohol free Savacol mouth-rinse, Difflam mouth-rinse, Difflam sore throat spray, lignocaine, xylocaine viscous. The latter is normally super expensive, but thankfully we have some at work so I was able to get a little from there. It is revolting, but was the most effective thing at numbing... though only for about ten minutes. Gah!
And what does a girl eat during this time? Not much, to be honest. Pain is great killer of hunger. Ice cold soymilk, lukewarm peppermint tea into which I dunked vanilla biscuits until they were smoosh and I could suck them, icy smoothies (rockmelon, soymilk and a little soy icecream) and soup... lots of soup. At slightly warm temperature. Soup that did not have anything spicy or acidic in it. Mostly made by my wonderful mother!
All these recipes were good, but I don't have too much to say as I was in pain, my throat was temporarily numb, and I was just happy to be getting something with actual nutrients into me! Originally I had seen a doctor near work who said there was nothing to be done but ride it out, but eventually I made an appointment with my normal doctor, who is awesome. She got me to make a mouthwash using dexamethasone, and that stuff started to do the trick and healing finally began. Sweet relief!
Tempeh and Sweet Potato Shepherd's Pie with Roasted Zucchini and Tomatoes, both from 1000 Vegan Recipes. A delicious return to solid foods!
Pear Gratin with Cranberries and Pecans from 1000 Vegan Recipes. Because dessert is awesome and nothing says 'farewell nasty ulcers' like some nice crunchy nuts.
For making it all the way through that post (or maybe you just flicked through the look at the photos), I give to you Prince in his papoose! Prince is a gorgeous old man, he was a Singapore street cat who was brought over to Australia by his mum. She's had to go back to Singapore for work, so Prince lives with one of our nurses and comes in to the clinic to say hi when she comes to work. He travels in his little papoose. How cute is that? None of my girls would ever sit in that. He just really enjoys being carried around, and I think being super close and snuggly to Pip, who does the carrying. Despite his many health issues, Prince is still going strong and is a much loved little kitty by many.
Last weekend, my wonderful friend Jen married her partner Ryan. No to be confused with the other Jen who married Freddy last year. It was a glorious day, and a beautiful bride.
The wedding was lovely, and was held at Victoria Park in their Garden Marquee, which ad a beautiful view overlooking the golf course and the city.
After the wedding, it was a chilly wait for an hour and a half at an outdoor bistro waiting for the reception. I was obviously looking forward to some vegan noms, and was curious to know what they might serve me. Apparently the venue has some vegan options naturally, and she kindly informed them that I was a hungry vegan so they could plan accordingly.
While other kids were eating crab cakes or mushroom gnocchi, I was given this bowl of yummy pumpkin and coconut soup. It was really thick and delicious. Fairly small, though a big bowl might have been a bit rich. There was the standard bread roll at the place setting, but with no guarantee of its veganess I skipped it. It left me slightly hungry though. But taste wise the soup was a winner.
Who needs steak or fish when you can have a gorgeous vegetable risotto? I have to say that this function centre certainly knows how to get some great flavour from some simple vegan dishes. Though I would have liked a slightly bigger serving size! Given that I was not comsuming a huge chunk of animal on my plate (eww and ick), surely they could have spared a little more?
The wedding cake was for dessert, and the happy couple had chosen a cupcake cake - very cute. But very not vegan. However - and this is when you know that you have wonderful friends - in the business of the day before the wedding Ryan found time to head over to Loving Hut to pick me up a little something for dessert. How awesome are my friends??
So I enjoyed a Raspberry Cheezecake that was carefully transported in. The venue provided a little scoop of mango sorbet, instead of ice cream, that was fantastic (I knew there had to be more than one scoop out the back and I really wanted to sneak into the kitchen and devour it all!) and also some berry compote that everyone got. The raspberry cheezecake was very rich, which made up for my slightly grumbly tummy with the previous two courses.
Two posts in two days! What is this crazy talk?? Hee. So I have a lot of various events to blog about as well from the last ever. I have decided to start at the most recent and work backwards, it seems like the thing to do.
Possum the family cat has become more intrigued with my shoes after I get home from a long day at work. They must smell very interesting to him!
Thank you and your guides so very much for the wonderful and great weekend. It was so much opening and deepening our meditation and spiritual growth. Every evening we now both channel our guides of different kind. The Sunday in the evening we channeled for one complete hour without interruption. It is amazing and I did a step, I thought could never achieve. Many puzzle pieces have come together. I am reading very interestingly the book from you, it is so interesting and amazing and helps to understand and believe in some other books I have read in the past. Hope to find again possibility to learn from you. My mother is so fascinated from our reports and is thinking if it would be possible to try to organize a seminar for you in Germany again with longer preparation. Again many thanks, blessings and wishes!
Refresh your memory with this compilation of quotations by polititians, officials, millitary personal, Iraqi's etc. from the months leading up to the war until recently. And then start paying close attention to the chatter comming out of the administration about Iran lately and consider.... Ready for round two anyone? Does anyone have the courage to stand up and say no?
Reading, writing, watching story of all kinds is my primary passion. Fiber arts runs a close second and actually plays a role in the other as the stories and reviews I write are often born as my needles or hooks are in motion. The common denominators of them all are imagination and creativity.
解説: This dirty schoolgirl has one of the hairiest pussies you have ever seen. I fingered he deeply, to make her nice and wet. Soon she was ready for my hard cock. I pounded this schoolgirl so hard, that she was moaning with pleasure.

DTG (ang. Direct To Garment) this technology printing on garments using specialized inkjet printers, which must meet two conditions: the transport mechanism of clothing and textile inks that are directly affixed to the clothing. Direct printing technology allows you to print using a full palette of colors, without the background, and the printing durability is comparable to that of screen printing.
Why DTG? Implementation from 1st art, photographic print fidelity, durability, printing, full-color printing!
FLEX this technology used at low cost, because it requires additional costs related example. the preparation of the matrix. Prints flex rely on the excision of a special foil pattern to the contour (which is on the shirt is like a razor!) And then wgrzaniu her the material. The use of foil in this case ensures that the printing does not fade, even after many washes, because we are not dealing with paint or ink.
Screen printing embodiment consists in forcing the ink through a die consisting of a fine sieve, through which the paint is applied. Where appropriate, screens let in the paint, creating a blueprint, while in others it stop. With the help of templates created a very accurate and durable prints.
Why Screen printing? Use on various surfaces, ideal for larger orders, printing durability, high color saturation!

Joel Rosario, who rode two winners on Friday’s Breeders’ Cup card that included of five Championship races, leads in the race for the Bill Shoemaker Award, given to the most outstanding jockey of the Breeders’ Cup World Championships at Churchill Downs.
The Shoemaker Award is based on a 10-4-2-1 scoring system on first- through fourth-place finishes in each of the 14 Breeders’ Cup World Championship races.
Rosario’s two victories came in both $2-million races, the Sentient Jet Breeders’ Cup Juvenile (G1) on Game Winner and the Tito’s Handmade Vodka Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies (G1) on Jaywalk.
His 20 points put him six in front of Irad Ortiz Jr., who won the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf (G1) on Newspaperofrecord and finished second in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf (G1) on Uncle Benny.
Other riders picking up 10 points for victories were 2017 Shoemaker Award winner Javier Castellano in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint on Bulletin and William Buick on Line of Duty in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf (G1).
The Shoemaker Award is named in honor of one of the greatest jockeys in the history of Thoroughbred racing. Shoemaker, who captured the Kentucky Derby four times, won more than 8,800 races in a career that spanned more than 40 years. In 1987, at age 56, Shoemaker won the Breeders’ Cup Classic aboard Ferdinand at Hollywood Park.

IISD launched its Webinar Series on Investment Law and Policy with its first webinar April 17 at 9:00 a.m. ET in preparation for the meeting of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in New York.
Working Group III of UNCITRAL met in New York from April 23 to 27, 2018, to further its mandate on possible reform of investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS). At the meeting, the working group continued to identify concerns regarding ISDS, consider whether reform is desirable and, if so, develop recommendations.
The goal of our webinar was to support governments and other stakeholders in building on the UNCITRAL process to work toward an ISDS reform agenda that works for sustainable development.
Expert presenters provided an overview of the previous meeting of the working group on this topic—held in Vienna from November 27 to December 1, 2017—and analyzed some of the submissions made and positions taken. It also provided an opportunity for participants to discuss various options for multilateral reform of ISDS and the way forward at UNCITRAL.

The Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA) held an Oct. 17 public meeting to update residents on the status of the already approved General Heath Square (GHS) Apartments affordable housing development project, which should be available for residency in September 2019.
The then Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) approved the project in December 2015. The project, developed by Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation (JPNDC) in partnership with Back of the Hill CDC, has been securing funding and will provide only affordable housing. This past August, the project received its state funding award.
GHS will be a 56,000-square-foot building built on currently vacant land on the Jamaica Plain/Mission Hill border near Jackson Square. The proposed four-story building will include 47 new affordable housing units. Of the 47 units, 12 will be one-bedroom, 21 will be two-bedrooms, and 14 will be three-bedrooms. There will also be an additional 824-square-foot commercial space and a 1,042-square-foot community room. The proposed use for the commercial space is not yet known.
The building will also provide 20 parking spaces, a low ratio of .43 spaces per unit because the location is .25 miles from Jackson Square and the development is “transit-oriented,” according to Matt Henzy with the JPNDC.
The apartments will provide resident services for special needs populations as appropriate, meaning that “folks that meet those definitions will be able to succeed,” said Henzy.
At the Oct. 17 meeting, about 20 residents attended with some expressing concerns about density and increased traffic.
Henzy said that the project will contribute very little to the traffic, referencing a traffic study that the team had done several years ago.
“Traffic is consistent city-wide,” said Aisling Kerr, project assistant at the BPDA. “We’re looking at that and trying to improve it every single day. The City is very much in favor of transit-oriented development, which is why we support this project.”
In response to questions about why the project will be so dense, Henzy said “it’s our mission to provide affordable housing for people who need it.”
Maggie Cohn of JPNDC added that originally JPNDC proposed a less dense building of 40 units, but the City wanted more housing, so they compromised at 47 units.
The total expected development cost will be $18,028,805, or $378,256 per unit. The developers expect to acquire the exact amount of funds that they need through tax credit equity, city subsidy, state subsidy, Mass Dev Brownfields, and a permanent loan.
“Thank you for your tax dollars, because we do use some of that money to build this development,” Henzy said.
In terms of affordability, the project will include 16 units for households with incomes under 30 percent area median income (AMI) through Project Based Section 8 or Mass Rental Voucher Program. Of those 16, five units will be permanently reserved for formerly homeless individuals or families.
Two units will be permanently reserved for clients of the HUD 811 Project Based Rental Assistance Program, which is targeted to serve non-elderly disabled households with income under 30 percent AMI.
Two units will be permanently reserved for clients of the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services for households with income under 30 percent AMI.
Twenty units will be for households with income under 60 percent AMI, and seven units will be for moderate income households with income under 70 percent AMI.
The architects for the project are Prellwitz Chilinski Associates and the property will be managed by Peabody Properties.
The project has received BPDA Article 80 approval and zoning approval, and has also secured a City funding award and a state funding award as of August. The next steps are finance closing and acquisition, with an anticipated construction start in March 2018. The construction will be completed in July 2019, and full occupancy will be in September 2019.
Another public meeting will be scheduled a month prior to construction to notify residents about the plan for work hours and who to contact with complains during that time.

Lilias came from a long line of writers and artists. Her great-grandfather, Sir Robert Strange, distinguished as an engraver “of the very first rank,” is remembered for designing the currency for the foiled dynasty of Bonnie Prince Charles! Both her mother and father published books, he on finances and she memoir-letters from the “new world.”
There is no doubt that Lilias was encouraged in her drawing from an early age. It is noteworthy that before her parents’ four-month trip to the United States (inspiring the letters to her daughter that were later published) five-year old Lilias was given her first sketchbook, inscribed “Lily Sept. to Dec. 1858” to record her impressions during their absence. Though without formal training in art, she was provided views and experiences to stimulate her aesthetic sensibilities and the materials to express them, a series of pocket-sketchbooks from her youth, documenting the same.
Indeed, it was her ability to capture rapidly on paper a faithful and convincing representation of the sights and scenes from their many family travels, throughout the UK and the Continent, that caught the eye of the imminent artistic arbiter of the Victorian Age, John Ruskin. Taking leaves from her Norwegian sketchbook for his students at the Oxford School of Drawing to copy, Ruskin observed, “What skill is more precious to a traveller than that of minute, instantaneous, and unerring record of the things that are precisely best” – words immortalized in his Slade lecture, “The Art of England.”
Her writing is considered by many to be on a par with her art. Like her parents, Lilias did not hesitate to publish her writing when it furthered a purpose dear to her heart. Her History Lessons for Junior Classes, published by the Church of England Sunday School Institute, reveal both her mastery of the material and pedagogical methods, combining text with graphics to clarify concepts – skills for which she would later distinguish herself. And it is not surprising that an article, “Making A Venture,” would be published in the YWCA monthly newsletter just one month before her “call” to Algeria!
All was in place to employ “pen and brush” upon her arrival in North Africa, in 1888. Thirty-five year old Lilias was dazzled by her first views of this exotic new land – skies, bay, hills, groves, houses, plants, flowers – capturing these images in a pocket sketchbook in a glowing range of hues that would have delighted her color-loving mentor, John Ruskin! The very skills that many lamented being denied her full expression or recognition in the world of art and letters were to be lavished upon Kingdom work for the remaining years of her life.
From her earliest days in Algiers, Lilias explored means to develop written material that would resonate with the Arab nationals – a unique challenge as women and children rarely were readers while, at the same time, printed materials were among the most effective means of communicating the Gospel, allowing individuals the privacy to read without the need to defend or argue. With their earliest scraps of Arabic, Lilias and her comrades hand-printed Scripture texts to distribute on the quay and in public squares, even venturing Saturday evenings into cafes in town where the men often delighted in assisting them in reading the texts aloud! The most effective way to reach the women, they discovered, was by putting Scripture texts into rhyme and rhythm, chanting in a cadence they grasped and remembered. Soon, the need for a yet more colloquial translation of Scripture became apparent and with that, the recognition of the importance of presentation: lithographed in their own, beautiful writing and printed on rough, creamy paper with marginal lines and flap covers – all as Arab as possible – the Gospel of Luke being the first venture of their “revision committee.”
Methods and materials would evolve, over the years, with greater understanding and availability of resources. Early on, Lilias observed the Eastern love of storytelling, and realized if their small band of workers were to hold the interest of the people they needed more attractive leaflets, printed and autographed in their Arabic script and peopled with their own local characters. This eventually evolved into booklets for boys – story parables – an endeavor given a great boost by collaboration with the Niles Mission Press, at the invitation of Dr. Samuel Zwemer, to further expand this concept in literature for women and children of Arab-speaking lands. Three months “residency” in Egypt, assisted by Blanche Haworth, triggered a flow of writing employing skills of the mission band which they laughingly called “tractitis!”
Through the years, Lilias continued to develop evermore effective means of printing, driven by the need of color-printing for this color-loving people, at a price for broadcast distribution. The ingenious solution to the problem was a process called two-color printing: the application of a single color to details in the simple picture insets and decorative borders designs. The four-page leaflets written in the classical Arabic interfaced with a French translation for the benefit of the French-speaking population along the coast had enormous appeal to their eastern sensibility. An additional set of “blanks” was prepared – illustrations without the text – to allow for translations to be autotyped in countries where Arabic was not understood. Alongside this ongoing venture was the development of a series of themed text cards, ornamented with decorative borders – boys’ painting classes filling in the color – the script done by native scribes who, alone, could fully capture the subtlety of lines and curves. Fifty-seven different leaflets, parable stories, and folders had been printed out in Algiers but over one-hundred-fifteen have been documented, most of which were published and distributed by the Niles Mission Press – some still in print to this day.
It must be noted that concurrent with her developing literature for Arabic and French-speaking Muslims of Algeria and Tunisia, was a wealth of English writing, some devotional in nature, other informative of the work. Her devotional classics, Parables of the Cross and Parables of the Christ-life were lessons drawn from nature and illustrated respectively with plant life of England and seed-bearing vessels of North Africa. Tiny leaflets with covers of pen and ink or watercolors, were taken from spiritual insights, first recorded in the diaries and journals which documented her forty years in North Africa. Her final years, while confined to bed, she expanded her original foldout on the seven “I AM’” texts in John’s Gospel into her consummate work for the Sufi Mystics: The Sevenfold Secret.
Her final major work, Between the Desert & the Sea, was in essence her love affair with the land and the people, moving chapter by chapter from one region to another. Paintings culled from her forty years of journals and diaries lavishly illuminate the oversize pages. The text reveals her intimate knowledge and love of the people and the land; the watercolors bringing the same to life with unforgettable images, exquisite and exotic. The foreword begins with an invitation to “come and look.” She continues to state the purpose of the book that at once reflects the influence of her mentor John Ruskin, and captures the very nature of her calling to “pen and brush:” “The colour pages and the letterpress are with one and the same intent – to make you see. Many things begin with seeing in this world of ours.”
Lilias’s unique giftedness with pen and brush was given over completely to capturing her unique way of seeing – both inward and outward – translating lessons from the natural world into spiritual verities of eternal significance for herself – then conveying the same to others. In the process she was nourished in her spirit and has left a lasting legacy of beauty and truth.

As a business advisor, I help people to develop business strategies and improve processes. I also lead projects.
As a professional photographer, I get to practice what I teach as a business strategist. And, I get to take photographs, which I love.
All my work is based on my values. My goal is that the people I work with and I learn as much as we can from each other. The best way I know to grow and develop, is to help others grow and develop.
I am a compulsive writer. My first management book, Tempo!, was published in 2010. LESS!, a collection of essays by twelve management thought leaders, was published in 2012. I initiated the project, coordinated it, and wrote a chapter about strategy.
All my work, as a photographer and as a business advisor is based on the same underlying principles and skills.
For example, I teach customers how to use the OODA loop in strategy and skills development. I also use the OODA loop to develop my skills as a photographer.
I coach executives in basic strategic principles like the Interaction/Isolation principle and Cheng/Ch'i. You will also see the same principles at work in my photos.
The ability to translate basic principles of strategy from one strategic game, like business development, to another strategic game, like photography, is vital. It is what enables me to understand how to be useful to my customers.

The process of onboarding is crucial and measures to retain employees are being given increased focus. A measure taken to retain employees is to provide a good and substantial onboarding experience. Retention of employees begins at day one, it is also your ��first impression�� of the organisation… Don��t you want to give new employees a good first impression?
The employee has an idea of what the organisation is about, who they need to report to and who are the employees at management level
In KALES, successful candidates who have accepted an offer will be inducted into the organization via the process of Onboarding. Tasks that are carried out during this stage are grouped under Perform Applicant Onboarding activity. These tasks include any details relating to medical tests, reference data and joining formalities.
Why is KALES better than other systems? KALES self-service aspect of onboarding is paperless and ensures integration and structure in induction. Candidates are able to see what forms need to be submitted, what documents are mandatory/non-mandatory and what percentage of tasks are pending. During the export to HRMS process (Process of candidate to employee), all the information that a candidate has entered under the ��Personal Information�� section is copied to HRMS and available for further editing and viewing by the employee.
This is where the employee will upload relevant qualification/education documents and download templates for forms that need to be submitted for their job.
Under this section, the employee can download the agreements/policies and provide their acceptance by clicking the ��I Agree�� button.
This section is only applicable for an employee that needs to complete specific training for the job as part of their onboarding process. The status of the training would be displayed next to the training course eg. Not Completed or Completed or In Progress
The onboarding portal also helps employees understand where their work location is, who their supervisor is and who is part of their team. This way they can identify key employees before commencing on their first day.

It's pretty disheartening considering the tremendous amount of time and community involved, and the loss of what is really an archive of memories. I would prefer if the same did not befall this forum as well, at least not without advance notice.
Yeah well that's what happens when you're in charge of people. You have to learn to be less of a cunt. Control your tism
You are? Then you've transferred it onto me you dick. I had to have two different meetings on the subject of "improving my interpersonal skills". Thanks asshole.

It, with the help of SWOT[1] model, identifies weakens, strengths, opportunities, and threats existed in metropolis Mashhad for strategic management of this city. It suggests suitable management for stable management in this city. Priority is one of topics is followed. The method of this paper is descriptive and analytical so that the required information (weakens, strengths, opportunities, and threats) is gathered by urban experts (21 experts) and citizens (384 citizens). In the process of analysis of strategic management of Mashhad metropolis, we used internal factor evaluation matrix (IFE)[2], External factor evaluation matrix (EFE)[3], Internal-External matrix (IE)[4] and Quantitative strategic planning matrix (QSPM)[5].

They are as follows:

In case it isn’t obvious from my blog theme, I love the color combination of purple and green. I have two skeins of Opal Prisma, one in each color – 1192 (green) and 1195 (purple). I’ve come up with several ways to use the two colors in socks. There’s a poll at the end [...]
The Antigua & Barbuda Employers’ Federation was established December 1950, and duly registered January 1951 under the Trade Union Act.
The Organization was formed to create the much needed voice for industry in the face of a strong workers’ movement the Antigua Trades and Labour Union.
The stated objectives were, to inform members of prevailing Labour laws and practices, to advise members as to the interpretation and applicability of said laws, to organize Employers into a respectable Association, to advise and represent Employers’ in their various challenges in dealing with workers and their representative trade unions, to promote Collective Bargaining, to oppose legislations which are disadvantageous to Employers, among others.
Founded in 1964 by the late Nobel Laureate Abdus Salam, ICTP seeks to accomplish its mandate by providing scientists from developing countries with the continuing education and skills that they need to enjoy long and productive careers. ICTP has been a major force in stemming the scientific brain drain from the developing world.
ICTP alumni serve as professors at major universities, chairpersons of academic departments, directors of research centres and ministers of science and technology in nations throughout the developing world. Many of them have been recognized in their own countries and internationally for their contributions to science and science policy. The impact of ICTP extends well beyond the Centre's facilities to virtually every corner of the Earth.
The collected thoughts and musings of writer Judy Leigh. Food, film, football. Politics, plays and putting pen to paper.
When it came out on DVD, I bought a copy of The Brothers Grimsby because the two main actors are both highly skilled. Mark Strong is a ubiquitous performer who has excelled in so many films, from Our Friends in the North to Sherlock Holmes, from Kingsmen to Anna Karenina and RocknRolla. He has been in Prime Suspect and also in Twelfth Night. Strong is a versatile and consummate performer and in this film he stars alongside Sacha Baron Cohen.
Baron Cohen studied History at Cambridge before being tutored by a French drama teacher called Philippe Gaulier,whose style of physical theatre, mime and clowning owes much to Jacques Lecoq, the guru of movement-based theatre. Other students of Gaulier include Emma Thompson, Simon McBurney of Theatre de Complicite and Helena Bonham Carter, who have all acquired strong skills under Gaulier’s tuition. Baron Cohen’s training has been evident in all of his clown roles and Grimsby is no different.
I could take or leave Ali G: I didn’t like Bruno and I refused to be offended by Borat. I did quite enjoy The Dictator and I believe that there is a place in comedy for iconoclasm and pushing barriers. This said, I laughed out loud at The Brothers Grimsby from start to finish. It is a genuinely funny film.
The story is straight from the Blood Brothers genre: separated as orphans, Sebastian becomes a secret agent with MI6 and his elder brother, Nobby, is a heavy drinking football- mad father of eleven who lives in an English fishing town. The brothers have been separated for 28 years but Nobby is ever-hopeful that they will be reunited one day. They finally meet at a benefit where Sebastian is attempting to foil an assassination attempt. Of course, it all goes horribly wrong and there are scandalous occurrences involving Daniel Radcliffe before the brothers embark on a picaresque adventure to save the world. Their exploits culminate in a climax of action in Chile at an England vs. Germany football final.
There are some hilarious scenes. Without giving away too many spoilers, the spy on the run and his hapless brother hide from assassins inside an elephant’s vagina. Nobby imitates James Bond in South Africa and seduces the wrong woman. Nobby’s kids save the day more than once and there is a beautiful speech, Braveheart-style, at the end of the film where Nobby incites the football fans of Grimsby to rise up and fight against oppression. The end of the film is predictable but hilarious as fireworks explode in strange places and even Donald Trump has a minor role, albeit an ignominious one.
The Brothers Grimsby is a film which didn’t receive good ratings. This is probably because the same old jokes about penises and oral sex and bottoms are reinvented in a new context. I found it funny, quite harmless, charming, satirical and, in its own way, a bit of political lehrstucke in the Brechtian style as family loyalty is supremely important for Nobby. It’s not the type of film I watch often, but it is pure escapism and it’s lively and iconoclastic and well performed. It’s best watched as a mates’ film, with a few beers and some tacos after a hard day when belly laughs are needed most.
It is also quite uncanny how Baron Cohen and Strong evoke a parody of Liam Gallagher and Vin Diesel as two bungling spies. It’s conceptually both clever and ridiculous, as most of Baron Cohen’s stuff is. I enjoyed it!
I’m still on my quest to read books by authors I wouldn’t usually choose, looking at genres which are new to me, discovering what I can learn as a writer from them. I recently heard a keynote speech by Meg Rosoff at a writers’ conference and I decided she clearly knows and can explain fluently how her creative mind works as an author, so I bought her novel ‘How I live now’ and I read it last week.
I then read ‘Apology for the Woman Writing’ by Jenny Diski. She is my sort of writer. I’ve read half a dozen of her books before. Diski, the unofficially adopted daughter of Doris Lessing, died this April and I’ve always admired the way she writes and her conviction to delve into any subject, taboo or otherwise, so I read ‘Apology’.
Meg Rosoff is a really ‘neat’ writer. I use the word about her work, not only in deference to her American birth and the implied meaning of both ‘terrific’ and ‘undiluted’, but also to suggest the more universal meaning of her writing being ‘well ordered,’ ‘smart’ and ‘adroit.’
Diski writes beautifully: her phrases are muscular and intelligent and she paints pictures with words which not only evoke a character or a setting but do so with conviction and flair.
I read ‘How I live now’ in two days. I discussed Rosoff’s work with a friend who has boundless insight into YA novels and she shrewdly recommended that I read this one first. Rosoff’s story is about an American girl, Daisy, who comes to stay with cousins in the UK: the country is ravaged by civil war. Daisy has her own teenage issues which she brings to the story and she falls in love with her cousin Edmond and they live a blissful and natural existence until the war rips the children’s home apart.
Rosoff is strong on issues: Daisy has a problem with eating and it is an integral part of who she is, and it is a direct result of her past. Rosoff does not provide fairytale stories or easy answers but when Daisy is on the run for her life with her young cousin Piper, her needs change and new resolutions begin to occur in her life as other problems arise.
This is a book I wish I’d read as a teenager. The characters are natural and imperfect and I believed in their lives and shared their problems. Through Daisy’s eyes, we understand her background, her passions and the horrors of the war which she must learn to deal with and surmount. The tragedies, killings and heartaches which stem from the war are never diluted and the result is that the story has impact and there is tension throughout.
Jenny Diski’s ‘Apology for the Woman Writing’ is a third person account of the life of Marie De Gournay in the 17th century. It deals with a young woman who shirks the three choices she has available to a person of her class and gender: to become a wife, a housekeeper for her ageing mother or a nun. De Gournay discovers as a child the secret pleasures of her father’s library: she reads the classics and she teaches herself about translation, then she encounters the work of essayist and philosopher Michel de Montaigne. On meeting him, she stabs herself with a hairpin as a gesture of her devotion. This is the beginning of her obsession and her ambition to become a writer
Of course, the journey is difficult for Marie who is awkward, spontaneous and determined, and Diski shows us the hazards which lie in wait for her in a world where intellectual discussion and writing exist only in male-dominated society.
Diski writes with clarity and accuracy and we quickly understand the pressures which lie in wait for Marie. The story begins with her as an older woman, wheezing on her death bed, attended by an ancient cat and an impoverished servant. Marie’s story is never going to be easy reading.
Nor is Michel de Montaigne a perfect mentor for Marie. He is conceited and inflexible, entrenched in his gender and cultural expectations, so he views her as an oddity, impressed by her mind but but not able to fully accommodate her intense desire to learn.
Both books make fascinating reading. Rosoff’s novel is a quick read with a younger audience in mind, and Diski’s story is a study of a slice of history from the perspective of a gifted but eccentric woman. It is a novel which, of course, makes us consider gender politics today with regard to women’s intellectual contributions to society.
Diski and Rosoff are important writers and I enjoyed both books. Rosoff writes a romping good read for young adults but her work goes beyond that, as she is a driving force for youngsters to accept who they are and to deal actively and positively with the hand life offers them. Diski shows us a woman with potential and how a male-dominated society fails to take her seriously.
Both women write brilliantly in their own genre and there is much to learn from their style, from their incisive minds and the content of their books.
Several years ago I saw Ralph Fiennes as Prospero in The Tempest. It was directed by Trevor Nunn, at the Theatre Royal, in 2011. Ralph, as in Salph and Sound, had only been on stage for twenty seconds. He hadn’t spoken a word. He simply raised a digit slowly into the air and -pow! Thunder crashed and lightning split the stage. That is the sort of performer he is: autocratic and accurate and absolute in his instinct.
The Tempest isn’t one of my favourite Shakespeares but Fiennes as Prospero was commanding and powerful, yet vulnerable and utterly convincing. We were in Salph hands.
So, Fiennes as the villainous Richard the Third in Rupert Goold’s Almeida production, screened live to cinemas on 21st July, could only promise to be thrilling theatre.
The play begins with Richard’s skeleton being discovered in a grave in a Leicester car park. The grave is the centre point of the stage and sets the context for the play as the archaeologist pulls out the twisted length of a spine and lifts it high. The lights change and we are in the fifteenth century and Richard sways forward, dragging the audience into his seething monologue:
Fiennes delivers to us a callous misogynistic Richard who is ambitious, cunning and intent on achieving power at any cost. He dissembles and lies to other characters but with the audience he is honest, brutal, sometimes exposed in his weakness, but always scheming and self-obsessed.
There are times when he is funny. The scene where he pretends not to want the crown, but holds out the Bible and feigns piety, is hilarious: Fiennes becomes a master of stand-up comic timing. But then there are the murders and the deliberate schemes to strike his enemies and we know everything he does is done to further his own position.
The scene in which he persuades Anne to marry him while she is mourning over her dead husband’s corpse is outstanding. A difficult scene to achieve for actors- one minute Anne curses him, spits at him, then he asks her to kill him: she almost does it, then agrees to marry him. However, the rapport sizzles: we understand the motivation for Anne’s acquiescence in the face of Richard’s power, his craftiness and his sexual assault of a vulnerable woman. Anne becomes prey and victim and we the audience believe every moment. She is merely a step towards Richard’s achieving the crown: I’ll have her; but I will not keep her long.
Richard’s interaction with women is a key theme of the play. Fiennes’ King holds no respect for women. He has no natural affection for his mother and he repels Margaret’s bitter curse with a single swipe. He is indifferent to the fact that he has brutally murdered Elizabeth’s sons: he tells her that he will marry her daughter as recompense:
Goold then directs the scene shrewdly and with breathtaking impact: Richard rapes Elizabeth. He is violent in his abuse and she quickly leaves the stage: she has not acquiesced, but she is shaken and violated, and when she has gone he shows no remorse, but calls her a : Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
Fiennes is outstanding as Richard but this isn’t a one-man show. Vanessa Redgrave is magnetic as the cursing Margaret, carrying a doll which represents dead babies, feeding it alcohol from a glass. There is a powerful and tender scene where the three mothers, Margaret, Elizabeth and the Duchess of York, combine their sorrow and lament the death of their children. Margaret advises Elizabeth to experience as much bitterness and pain as she has known in her own life and the three women combine in a curse as powerful as anything in Macbeth:
The performances of Aislin McGuckin, Joanna Vanderham and Susan Engel as Elizabeth, Anne and The Duchess of York are powerful: although they are each in turn the object of Richard’s maltreatment, they are still vocally compelling and each creates a taut and credible victim while demanding to be heard in their own right. They are no pushover, demonstrating the extremity of Richard’s heinous behaviour towards them. James Garnon as Hastings is perfect: the scene in which he realises Richard has duped him and he is to be killed is a triumph of characterisation. Finbar Lynch makes a superb Buckingham, perfectly balanced as a liar and cheat and as a victim of Richard’s fickle allegiances. Daniel Cerquiera’s Catesby is exactly right: the noble thug who does all Richard’s dirty work with impressive efficiency.
Each moment is a gem – there are no sagging scenes in the play. The final action where Richard is visited by the ghosts of his victims, and the Earl of Richmond has a contrastingly peaceful night’s sleep, is intense and thrilling as both men sit at the same table and the ghosts speak first to Richard then to Richmond, and we sense the outcome of the next day’s battle.
The final battle scene is everything it should be- loud, crashing and quick, with Richard repeating his famous lines A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! until we can only hear the gasped word horse! and he is killed and falls into the grave where, as the lights fade, we see the archeological excavation and exhumation in February 2013 in Leicester.
Richard the Third ends with a satisfying reminder of where it started: the back story has been filled in and Goold has shown us history on stage. Fiennes has created the character of Richard with physical and vocal perfection: there is the dragging leg and the hunchback, but he does not wheedle or whine. Rather, he plots and simpers and cajoles and threatens; he is mentally incisive and always dangerous. He licks blood from the block where Hastings has been beheaded. He searches the audience for assassins to help him. He is commanding and sinister and lethal and in control.
I would have loved to have been at the Almeida and seen Richard the Third live. It was a close second, though, to be in a cinema auditorium with another twelve or so people, having the opportunity to watch this fantastic production as it is performed in the capital.
It’s an interesting plot factor that Richard seizes the chance to rule a divided country in difficult times. He sees the opportunity open before him and through his crazed ambition, his ability to deceive and his unswerving determination, he takes his country from stability to division and chaos. Fiennes said of the play that it resonated with what is happening in our own current political climate: “Not through our doing but just because of events happening around us. Suddenly it became full of a pertinence that perhaps it hadn’t had before.”
Of course he’s right. This is exactly the time to be watching Richard the Third and to be considering our own political parallels. Perhaps we’re not so Salph!
There are some things which are improved by time.We don’t have to sideline everything old in favour of something new. When they are left to develop, whether it is an idea, a favourite jumper or a bottle of brandy, some things just keep on improving. The same can be said of a book. Holding a pristine book, unread, unexplored, is a thrilling feeling: no blemish of a fingerprint, the endless possibilities of a good read jumping from each page. But think of the deep fulfilment of finding an old book, knowing its crumpled cover has been turned over by many hands, its pages bruised and thumbed and avidly read.
Second hand book shops smell of dust and warmth and love: the books hold the scent of every person who has touched a page and there is promise of so much magic. As you move around the shelves and sift out a book, sliding the title towards you with interest, there is a secret shared between the binding.
I picked up some ancient books on a market stall this week. A coverless copy of Victor Hugo, with stained pages, the past leaping out, letters black against the grey. The book lay in my palm like a prayer, and then the bookseller held out another book by Alphonse de Lamartine: maroon cover wrinkled, dry as an old fig, the gold letters of Poésie almost worn away.
I continued to search, touching each book lightly with my fingers and found Tout Compte Fait and Réflexions sur la question juive, by Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus, side by side as they probably are now at the Cimetière du Montparnasse.
The books cost me five euros altogether. That’s currently just over four pounds; a pound each and a few pennies for each piece of genius.
Last week someone recommended to me that I read a novel called The Butcher’s Hook. It was brand new and cost me £6.99 and I will give it away to anyone who wants it for free. I read the first hundred pages.
Alphonse de Lamartine and Victor Hugo, Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus may be old, battered books, creased and coverless, but they hold a special place in my heart. And now they are on my bookshelves.
I’m on a quest to read popular novels that aren’t the type of thing I’d usually read. Novels which might make one of my most respected literary friends wrinkle her nose and push it aside if I offered to lend it to her. The sort of writing I’m not steeped in. I’m doing this because, as a writer, I want to know what readers of commercial fiction read and what’s popular and then I’ll try to analyse why.
I’m steeped in Amis and Achebe, Brontë and Bashevis Singer, Camus and Carter, De Beauvoir and Dostoevsky and I love modern writers like Matt Haig and Paul Kingsnorth, Sunjeev Sahota and Emma Donoghue and Sarah Winman and Roddy Doyle. So it’s probably fair to say that I’m going to struggle with Hilary Boyd’s ‘Thursdays in the Park.’ I picked it out because it’s about an older protagonist, and I’m interested in how writers create the older protagonist, as I have one in in my first novel.
Boyd’s central character defies the stereotype of young heroines:she offers readers a role model or a lifestyle they can look forward to when they’re older, or she simply champions the older reader. So I read Hilary Boyd’s novel about 60-year old Londoner Jeanie who falls in love with Ray the Aikido teacher and is fed up with her sexless marriage to dull, rich, controlling George.
It’s a romance and that’s pretty much what the book is about. I never felt particularly close to Jeanie who was, to me, a middle-class heroine, attractive, popular, just like all the other stereotypical romance heroines, but older. That, in itself, was disappointing. Jeanie and I never bonded, although I did feel a bit of sympathy when I found out poor George had been abused as a child. Well done Hilary Boyd for not being scared of that one.
The signposting was a bit of a problem for me: I knew what would happen next on every turn. And then I struggled with the holier-than-thou perfect daughter Chanty and the silly spoilt son-in-law, and Jeanie’s unbridled passion for the man she chats to in the park who mistakes her for the two year old’s mum, rather than her Granny. (Oh yeah, right?)
I’m not really the target audience for this book. I noticed that Hilary Boyd had the usual difficulties making the romantic or sexy scenes different or unique – a problem we all share, where the protagonists look at each other with heaving hearts and sigh a lot and shrug a lot and shake their heads with disbelief. I did learn something from Boyd though; she’s empathically behind her character all the way and she creates feasible human dilemmas. I suppose Jeanie wasn’t enough of a feminist protagonist for me; she didn’t rebel enough, and her acceptance of the views of others, especially George, didn’t convince me to care about her sufficiently.
I wouldn’t want to be Jeanie and I couldn’t make the leap of sympathy but I’m sure ‘Thursdays in the Park’ is popular with the reader who likes her novels easy to read and happy at the end. On my masters’ course we were often asked: what does the central protagonist want and what stands in the way? This one was simple. Jeanie wants Ray and George is blocking her path to ultimate happiness with a man.
I read ‘Shock of the Fall’ by Nathan Filer and the blurb told me that Filer’s novel follows in the footsteps of Mark Haddon. Filer is a mental health nurse so it’s clear he knows his background. The book is written from the point of view of Matt, whose unhappy situation stems from his brother’s death earlier in the story and we follow Matt’s progress as we are quickly hooked into the idiosyncrasies and dilemmas of the character.
Nathan Filer does two things I like a lot. First of all, the voice which tells the story is really engaging. Matt’s character is unique, surprising and speaks to the reader as someone we come to understand and know and like, unlike Jeanie whom we know everything there is to know about from page one.Secondly, the novel is well shaped, not linear and although it leads the reader to where you know you’ll ultimately end up, the journey has a few surprises on the way and this deepens the reader’s compassion for Matt and his family and we care about the impact of what has happened to brother Simon.
This is definitely a ‘safe hands’ book: Filer’s story is so well organised and his character speaks with such clarity and credibility and authority that the novel is captivating. Add to that the bittersweet humour and the contrast between the harrowing scenes and the touching moments, and it makes for a memorable read. Cleanly written, cleverly contrived, ‘The Shock of the Fall’ works well on the levels of both a story well told and a learning journey for the reader.
I’m glad I read both books, although I enjoyed one much more than the other. But my journey isn’t just for my own reading pleasure: I’m building an understanding of what is popular, of what readers want and what works for them. And then it all goes into the writer’s bag of learning to be sifted and synthesised, so that I know what to aspects to reject and what techniques will work for me as I continue to develop my unique voice.
So the world is imploding. All sorts of worms are crawling out of the opened can.The negative feelings of the disenfranchised are manifesting themselves as widespread disagreement and arguments and dissatisfaction and we’re seeing Facebook memes of Pooh Bear and Piglet healing rifts between polarised friends. Everyone has a strong opinion – thank goodness for Free Speech, but now we live in a world where the Emperor’s new clothes are off and no-one will acknowledge the nakedness. Lies are legitimate political currency now, and so are double crossing and hatred, all coming fresh from the mouths of the political right this week. Before the vote, the unhappiness and untruths were an undercurrent, now we have a tsunami: Gove spitting vituperative statements of Johnson’s ineptitude, the Tory leadership oven hotting up to explosion point and Jeremy Corbyn, though many still love him, lugging a Labour party which might snuff itself out in the next General Election. And Farage, the most ineffectual and dangerous of stand-up comedians, humiliating himself with his pathetic hubris at the European Parliament.
This week was all too much. It’s time to rise above the stench of the detritus. Thank goodness for the solidarity of a writing group.
Most writers agree that a good writing group is what makes a difference between basic writing and honing our skills. A regular writers’ group is essential, using the balance between astute critiquing and positive praise if we are to improve and develop style. I’m fortunate to still be in touch with many talented writers from my MA group and I have a number of trusted readers, who are writers and poets, who will always give me a straight opinion.
Then there is our local writers’ group, a group of some ten or twelve people who write short stories and poems and memoirs. I joined the group in September last year so that I could keep myself on my toes, finish my first novel, start a second and dabble in creating different characters and perspectives and genres.
Our tutor is a real enabler, a poet and always full of ideas, offering great stimuli and weekly feedback on our work. Then there is the group itself with so many clever writers. One talented woman may well now embark on completing an exciting children’s book. A woman whose memoirs of life in London in the fifties and sixties thrill her listeners each week. An ex-policeman’s writing is invariably warm and measured and dry and witty. An artist/ musician’s stories of local life are genuinely moving, funny, clever and hugely entertaining. An actress/ performance poet, professional and iconoclastic is always uniquely surprising whether she writes comic or poignant pieces. Each week, local writers deliver smooth stories, witty and lively responses and ideas which leap off the page. Even better, it’s great to see creative people flourish and become even more confident and articulate.
Last night we celebrated with a writers’ party, a local reading in a cafe where several of us came together to stand in front of a microphone in turn and humbly offer our poems and stories to an audience. It was a great way to end our summer course, and an opportunity to revel in how far everyone had progressed. There were stories about a gifted magical girl, drunken bets on racehorses, childhood mischief in Paris, sex and washing machines, a nasty uncle who raced greyhounds.Every tale was a gem and truly entertaining.
Politically, it’s a changing world and a pivotal time for us all now. We’re expected to accept lies as truths whether they are promises on buses or vows not to stand for PM. The Bullingdon boys and the Etonians and Gove now have it their way and they have become reckless, their mayhem is all around us and many of the disenfranchised people have voted with their emotions and their misplaced trust. We will live with the consequences as best as we can.
Thank goodness for friendship; thank goodness there is talent, that we can share creativity and meet with thinking people. This is, of course, not to ignore or stop the fight against xenophobia and dishonesty and corruption and political duplicity and ongoing perfidious betrayal of the ordinary person. But it is important to remember that there is much in our world to love, to enjoy and to celebrate. There are so many people to say thanks to, for friendship and support, whatever their views, however they voted. This blog is for them all, to remember that the way forward is to be joyous and mindful and that we are bigger than any divisions; we will change what we can when we can and, meanwhile, we’ll celebrate the present. After all, it is just that, the present, and the present is a gift, isn’t it?

The garden got away from me! Well, the growth of some of its inhabitants did. One day I had baby turnips & zucchini. The next day, it seemed, they were enormous! I really didn’t need to plant turnips as early as I did, but I was so excited to get things growing that I overdid the planting a bit. I tend to think of turnips as a fall crop, but planted some early this year because…um. Why? I don’t know, just because! They matured just as everything else did, and I wound up with way more produce than we could eat at once. So it was that I came to have these two monsters. I only used half of the giant turnip and zucchini you see in the photos since there were just the two of us for dinner. In spite of their size, they were both quite delicious! There’s a trick to getting the best flavor out of a large, mature turnip — see Step 2 below. If you’ve ever had bitter, nasty turnips, there’s a good chance they weren’t peeled properly. While you might not necessarily think of these two veggies in the same dish, they really complement each other well. Roasting the vegetables brings out their deepest flavor; fresh herbs and a sprinkle of parmesan bring everything together. A little bit of late summer heaven!
2.) Young turnips don’t always need to be peeled, or they only need a thin layer removed. Older turnips, though, have a bitter outer layer. It goes beneath the thin skin to the dark line (the tip of the knife is pointing to it.)

With a very mature turnip, you can pull it off by hand once you get it started. Once peeled, chop the turnip into ½” (1 cm) pieces. Cut the zucchini into ½” (1 cm) slices.
Thanks! It was my first year for growing both. I used to think I didn’t like either, but I’m so happy I was wrong!
“I am and always will be the optimist. The hoper of far-flung hopes and the dreamer of improbable dreams” - The Doctor
Film reviews, news, trailers, and articles written by our diverse team of writers from across the 🌍
Any film from beloved stop-motion animation studio, Aardman, will be met with great anticipation. Their films feel so intrinsically part of British culture, and after previous feature-length efforts such as ‘Chicken Run’, ‘The Curse of the Were-Rabbit’, and ‘Shaun the Sheep Movie’ delighted audiences almost as much as their fabled ‘Wallace & Gromit’ shorts did, the hope was that their latest offering, ‘Early Man’, would do the same.
Boasting an impressive British voice cast, including Tom Hiddleston, Eddie Redmayne, Maisie Williams, and Timothy Spall, to name but a few, the thumbprints of Aardman are all over this film…in more ways than one! It is impossible not to be charmed by this film, even when the story is perhaps a little sub-par compared to some of their previous offerings. Hapless hero Dug (Redmayne) and his quest to save his valley from the tyrannous Lord Nooth (Hiddleston) by defeating his all-star team in a football match, is a classic underdog story and one which is in the safest of hands with Aardman and director Nick Park.
It follows many of the same beats as other sporting underdog stories, but coupling this tried-and-tested movie blueprint with the quintessential laughs and lovingly crafted characters and sets that Aardman are known for, offers something a little different to the similar sporting movies that have come before.
Its football focus opens up a number of opportunities for great visual gags, and wry humour towards British sports fans in particular. It is an odd combination, and one which perhaps doesn’t always work, but there is a certain charm to it, and the characters make it an easy film to like. Towards the end, it starts to drag a little, and when the conclusion seems pretty inevitable in a film such as this, it does make parts of it feel a little tiresome.
However, the laughs come thick and fast, and every time your attention wanes there’ll be a top-notch visual gag or a wonderfully British double-entendre to bring you right back into it. As with all Aardman films, it is the sort of film that demands a second viewing because there are just so many little background touches and jokes that will be easily missed the first time around.
On the whole, ‘Early Man’ is far from Aardman’s best, but is not without merit and its another “fun for all the family” film to add to their impressive canon. It also features the best (and perhaps only) visual gag involving a giant duck that you will see all year. Charming as always, and full of laughs, ‘Early Man’ just about wins this match.

The workload for the last Quarter of 2017 was unexpected to say the least. We ended up with more client systems work in those three months than the rest of the year combined and we’re still dealing with the overflow plus several new projects today. With the Holidays and Contract Renewals falling in the mix, it has meant very long days, constantly changing scheduling and resource juggling at a furious pace just to stay up with the workload while still keeping client networks at maximum uptime. Posting blog updates has taken a back seat to all of this so I’ll try to give you a synopsis of where we are and what we see coming at us in the remainder of FY2018.
The Windows 10 upgrade cycle in in full swing now. We have fielded about 10 percent of the total Workstation count with Windows 10 and fairly close to the same percentage of Servers with current Operating Systems at this point. With the January 2020 deadline for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 (which includes Small Business Server) in mind, we still have over 400 Workstations and 30 Servers that will become unsupported at that point. With less than 24 months to complete this task, simple math tells you that the next two years will be hectic no matter how you look at it.
If you throw in the requirement for enhanced security needs at each site, the growing demand for wireless connectivity and rapidly increasing use of mobile devices, it is obvious that this upgrade cycle is far more intense than any other we’ve seen in the last 24 years. On top of that, the Internet bandwidth required to support business operations has exploded, especially as more and more sites are using some form of Cloud computing. In some locations, bandwidth is still severely limited so trying to find a solution for those clients going forward is more than just a challenge. Several sites which we support can barely function today due to this issue and the Internet provider choices are either limited or nonexistent.
Obviously, this means the client base has to start some serious budgeting and planning now. The costs associated with this upgrade cycle are hefty just on the hardware side alone. If you have a software vendor that intends to make major changes to your applications in the next 24 months, expect that change to drive hardware upgrades whether you like it or not. We have already seen this happen in late 2017 at three sites. In short, even if your hardware works today, most of it is aging and most likely will be incompatible with some key element in the coming year or so. Again, take your budgeting and planning requirement seriously and prioritize it now. We can do a lot to help you work toward that goal but this cycle is one that won’t allow a great amount of “meets minimum requirements” where hardware is concerned.
In 2017, we made a major push to emphasize our Three Point Security approach. To review, this is a multi-layered setup that puts protection at the End User (Trend Micro), Gateway (SonicWall) and Cloud (Cisco Umbrella) levels. The most recent release of Support Contracts stated this as a requirement going forward in order for us to continue to provide support. We dropped several clients at the end of 2017 due to differences of opinion on this topic. I have no problem doing this again, if necessary. A few are scheduled to complete this requirement soon and we will not be accepting any new clients that do not meet this standard.
Security upgrades, like hardware and software upgrades is not about selling things. It is about making sure you can do your job safely, effectively and efficiently. To date, the network uptime across the entire client base remains near 100 percent. Virus infections and network intrusions are near zero. There is a reason for this. We are not sales people, we are techies. We constantly monitor the industry, test and evaluate hardware and software and implement solutions designed solely to make sure your business platforms work for you.
Enhanced security has become so important an element in the business environment that we started a second business that focuses exclusively on this area. Business Data Defender (http://bizdatadefender.com/) was created in 2017 to provide solutions to business operations that don’t necessarily want our Managed Services Support functions. It has taken off like a rocket and we expect to see hefty growth in security services continue at an accelerated pace in the coming years.
Another related requirement for providing support services is our Datto appliance. Since Datto provides Business Continuity functions, it crosses over between Managed Services and Security Services by providing rapid recovery in the event of actual network intrusion (i.e., Ransomware or Trojans) or hardware failure at the Server level. Again, this isn’t about selling anything. It’s about making sure you can continue to work in the event of any number of bad events. When we issue the FY2019 Support Contracts, Datto will be a default requirement to obtain continued support services from us. Please take note if your site hasn’t addressed this item yet.
We have pretty much managed to upgrade all site Datto devices, nearly all SonicWall devices and a fair number of the outdated and less-secure wireless devices throughout our supported base. We will continue to review and advise everyone on what needs to be replaced as we go through the next two years of this major upgrade. The end goal is to get the right items in place to meet your business platform’s performance and security goals.
On several occasions, I have been asked why we are so emphatic about Security and Business Continuity in order to provide support services. The answer is a two-part response. First, knowing the environment we have to support means we know what works. It’s tested and proven and we use what we require you to use. Secondly, having the right things in place means we can provide the best support with a limited amount of resources at the backend and that keeps performance up and costs down. I know it’s shocking to think, but unlike a lot of other IT providers, we actually care about your business and its success. We always target a win-win scenario and constantly work toward that end. So if we are suggesting changes to your infrastructure during this upgrade cycle, there is good reason for it.
So having discussed the challenges of this upgrade cycle and heightened security elements, we now have a new problem to face. Meltdown and Spectre exploits against Central Processing Units…
By now I’m fairly sure everyone has heard something (or likely several somethings) about Meltdown and Spectre and the potential impact these two may have on your systems. Since about two-thirds of the stories in the media concerning these issues are overblown, incorrect or hair-on-fire panic driven (maybe some of all three), I’ll try to filter out the noise and give you the actual info relating to your overall situation.
Meltdown and Spectre are exploits that impact pretty much all processors (CPU) built between 1995 and 2012. The vulnerability has been known for the past 7 years or so (some say as long as 10 years). It is a problem with the physical build of the CPU itself and cannot be fixed solely by a software patch. It doesn’t just impact PC units… it impacts anything with a CPU (phones, video cards, copier machines, and so forth).
Without getting too deep into the technical side of things, Meltdown can allow hackers to read passwords, encryption keys, or other data from the protected memory in your CPU. Spectre can do that plus access the same from other applications. Intel indicates that these exploits cannot corrupt, modify, or delete data, but if the hacker can access passwords and encryption keys the system is pretty much wide open to them.
There are two items of interest here where your operations are concerned. First, most of the exploits are targeted toward Cloud Service providers and are unlikely to impact your networks directly unless you have applications that are Cloud-based. Second, the required Operating System patches may result in reduced performance on your PC units (3% to 30+%). I don’t expect this to be a major deal for most of our supported units with the absolute exception of any PC that has an older Pentium 4 and is running the 32-bit version of Windows. The P4/32-bit units will likely just not work at all. Fortunately, we only have a very, very few of these left out there.
We’ll tell you when to panic- as always, we have been working on this since before it hit the mainstream media
The Meltdown fix is fairly easy to patch and has pretty much been brought under control with patching
Spectre has two variants and some mitigation has been done by processor vendors already but in the end, older processors will remain vulnerable to Spectre.
Updates to the BIOS are being released by PC vendors but even some of these have caused updated systems with newer processors to stop working
Will come mostly from Windows Updates so those of you who never log off or never let updates finish better plan on rebooting all units ASAP
Software updates from Microsoft have been released but the Antivirus product on the PC has to be updated first
We are already in the process of testing Trend Updates on our network in order to prep this for deployment to your networks
We have several Servers, a varying number of PC units, SonicWalls and Wireless setups in work for the January timeline. Additionally, we’re handling Server configurations for another company to deploy to their clients. If you think you might have project work coming up anywhere in January, February or March, please let me know sooner rather than later. I won’t hesitate to tell you we cannot get to your project if you call me with a last minute panic request. I have limited resources and a long client list to support. Quality support requirements to the entire client base aces out any failure to plan on anybody’s part, period.
We will continue to work the Meltdown/Spectre issue and get solutions in place in as timely a manner as possible. This whole thing is in a flux as new vendor revelations are showing up on a daily basis. We are watching this process and we may require your help getting people to log off when it comes to reboot the Server time so expect minor disruptions over the remainder of January.
This is why we have our services with you. We trust you and feel comfortable that we are getting the best of the best. Thanks for keeping us informed.

This picture shows the variation of swells directed at Broadstairs through an average August and is based upon 2973 NWW3 model predictions since 2006 (values every 3 hours). The wave model does not forecast wind and surf right at the coast so we have chosen the best grid node based on what we know about Broadstairs, and at Broadstairs the best grid node is 16 km away (10 miles).
The rose diagram illustrates the distribution of swell directions and swell sizes, while the graph at the bottom shows the same thing but without direction information. Five colours show increasing wave sizes. The smallest swells, less than 0.5m (1.5 feet), high are coloured blue. These occurred 87% of the time. Green and yellow show increasing swell sizes and red shows the biggest swells, greater than >3m (>10ft). In each graph, the area of any colour is proportional to how commonly that size swell occurs.
The diagram implies that the prevailing swell direction, shown by the largest spokes, was NE, whereas the the prevailing wind blows from the WSW. Because the wave model grid is offshore, sometimes a strong offshore wind blows largest waves away from Broadstairs and away from the coast. We lump these in with the no surf category of the bar chart. To avoid confusion we don't show these in the rose plot. Because wind determines whether or not waves are good for surfing at Broadstairs, you can select a similar diagram that shows only the swells that were expected to coincide with glassy or offshore wind conditions. In a typical August, swells large enough to cause clean enough to surf waves at Broadstairs run for about 1.0% of the time.

During yesterday's trading, the US dollar weakened against the majors. The dollar index (#DX) closed the trading session in the negative zone (-0.37%). Implementation of the tax reform in the US has faced some difficulties. The draft law, which was developed in the US Senate, is somewhat different from the draft law of the House of Representatives. Investors are afraid that disagreements in the draft laws may slow the adoption of the tax reform. Additional pressure on the American currency was provided by weak statistics on the labor market. Over the past week, the number of initial jobless claims increased by 10,000 to 239,000. Nevertheless, the US dollar tends to grow relative to the major currencies.
Today, the key event will be the publication of the report on the volume of production in the manufacturing industry in the UK. We also recommend paying attention to the government bonds yield and keeping track of current information on the tax reform in the United States.

After going through a particularly rough patch at work recently, I began musing what if anything I might be doing to contribute to my difficulties. The more I thought about it, the more I asked myself, “What exactly was I expecting at my job day by day?” Were my expectations positive and beneficial to my experience or were my expectations negative or fearful, leading to predictable trouble? The answer to those questions are the answers to your own life questions. What do you expect?
Similar to the old riddle, the chicken and the egg, comes a new riddle. Do your expectations and beliefs produce the reality you are experiencing or does the reality you are experiencing produce your expectations and beliefs? And although they would be reticent to admit it, I think most folks believe the latter. In other words, if things are going badly for them or if they’re experiencing difficulty and trouble, how would they be able to not expect more of the same? If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s a duck… Or, is it? What if your present reality is based upon your most recent, predominant, expectations? What if you are contributing to your own misery by the power of your own negative expectations? I’m guessing no-one would expect negative results if they realized the impact it had on their reality? Well, what do you expect?
It is infinitely easier to think that our lives are playing out in some grand drama whereby things are hurled at us unannounced and without rhyme or reason. However, on the surface alone this should show itself untrue. Does it really seem plausible that God is in the heavens passing out blessings and cursings at random to test and try or bless and benefit His creation? Would it be logical to assume that some people are highly favored and others are despised; some enjoy good things while others live in misery, all by chance or happenstance? Nay my friend, you know that isn’t true! What you think and believe forms the basis of what you expect and you get what you expect. Negativity, like positivity, is a persuasion coming from conclusions formed within yourself. The circumstances, good or bad, don’t decide your ultimate conclusions, you do! When you live in negativity, always expecting things to go wrong or for difficulties to get worse, you have been persuaded thus and will continue along the same lines as long as you continue along the same lines! What do you expect?
All of us think we are mostly positive and would swear by it. But, the acid test is revealed by what you say out loud. Do you want to know what kind of things you are expecting to happen in your life? Well, just listen to the things you say to other people. When people ask how you are doing, what do you answer? Or, do you even give it any thought before you belt out the well rehearsed, “fine.” What things do you say to people over and over again about your life? Those things, said in jest or not, are what you expect for your life. What are you excited about happening in your life? If the answer is nothing, call me crazy, but I would say your expectation is negative! If you now, since reading that, are trying to confabulate some mundane realities into something more exciting, your expectation is probably negative. Do you expect negative results?
It may surprise you to know that expecting good things takes no more energy than expecting bad things. However, because we live in such a dreadfully negative world, we have become accustomed to getting negative results. When things are going well for us we engage in silly superstitions like knocking on wood to keep the good continuing. Or, we have been conditioned that as soon as we announce something positive is happening, watch out, evil is preparing to get us (Don’t jinx it, right?)! Our job therefore is to escape the madness and focus on the good instead! We have to learn how to refute the negativity we are bombarded with and see, by our own determination, good results before we see good results. We have to make ourselves picture a good result. God, how weird, right? Profound thought ~ if you cannot even see a picture of the things you want in your life, the chances of you getting those results are minute if not highly improbable! Please go back and read that sentence again! Because it is what you will expect!
I’m completely aware that not everyone living is dwelling amidst some grand disaster needing immediate rescue. I would guess most people aren’t. Yet, I would submit that most people are living a life less than the life they would like to live. We may fantasize about living by the ocean when we are by the ocean, but when the vacation is over we shuffle back to our routine. It’s like we are always waiting for the circumstances to reveal what we desire is coming pass, so that we can get onboard with it happening, when in reality the circumstances will only come to pass after we have gotten onboard with it happening. Truly a world of riddles! Humans have dreams even if they are only flashes into something sublime they would like for themselves. Pursue the flashes. Explore the revelation. Dare to see something different for yourself completely not based on your current experience or reality. I know it’s unclear! I know it’s only hazy and vague! That’s why you aren’t living it now! Sharpen the image. God has already promised to bless you. However, He needs your cooperation. Start looking for God’s blessings like you’d look for a missing piece of jewelry! (Like it’s already there – get it?) You’ll find what you expect to find.
By now you might say, what if I expect good things and nothing good happens? Well, you can always get back to expecting the worst and keep on navigating through the storms of life until you finally have had enough. Let today be the day you have had enough! All the good there is, is here waiting for you. Will you expect it?
Have you ever, in a sudden flash of insight, wondered how in the hell did I end up here? All of us had our youthful fantasies where we were playing professional baseball or were the star actor in a hit movie. However choppy or obscure, all of us entertained some vague notions of how life would be for us in the future. Then, the future got here and it wasn’t exactly what we expected. For many folks it turned into a nightmare from which they are now seeking an escape. How did it happen? How did we end up here?
The short answer is, you were the one driving the bus! The longer answer is a little more tricky. The life that you are living today is a composite sketch you first outlined and then refined through days, months and years of thinking certain thoughts. Yes, my friend, you were driving the bus. Oh, I know it didn’t seem like you were always driving the bus. If anything it seemed like you were sometimes navigating the bus through difficult and confusing circumstances. Many days perhaps you were anxiously driving the bus with a death grip on the wheel, fearful of how things were going to turn out. At other times, for a myriad of reasons, you let someone else drive your bus trusting them to get you to a good destination. For years maybe you were not even aware that you are supposed to drive your own bus and just hoped with the rest of the world that God would somehow drive your bus for you if you were good to people and weren’t too much of a dick or something… But no matter the reasons, even the compelling good reasons, you are responsible to drive your own bus and choose your own destinations!
I believe that we all, on occasions, find ourselves scratching our heads at how we turned out to be exactly like our fathers or suffer from the same issues as our mothers, though we swore we never would. We didn’t realize that the same crap that got to them would eventually get to us as well. In our youthful wisdom, we didn’t see it coming, just like they didn’t see it coming. In reality it wasn’t our propensity to fall for the same mistakes that defeated us or even inherited weaknesses in the gene pool that got us. What got us; what defeated us; what we failed to see was “it,” manipulating behind the scenes and causing us to drive our buses in the wrong damn direction! All that precious time we spent focusing on things we didn’t want, left us driving on a road we didn’t choose, leading to a destination we do not like. You want to know how you got here? This is how you got here! The sooner you decide to take your keys back the better.
Aside from the incessant and persistent manipulation and every other force that drives us away from our best lives, there is another far more subtle power at work, also based on fear but far less obvious. This perennial flat tire to our happiness is the overworked and overused, insane, dishonest, “I have to please everyone else” mentality that seems noble but in reality is a cruelty afflicting both who you are and who you could ever hope to be! This slippery wrench in the works convinces you to make choices that aren’t really your choices in favor of playing it safe or protecting your family or whatever other bullshit you have been confessing to yourself to rationalize bad decisions and miserable circumstances. Your age, your income, your bad knees, your upbringing, your momma, your spouse all have nothing to do with your capacity; even your necessity to change your thoughts and slowly but surely change your life. You are no more stuck than the energy it takes to say so. None of us are ever truly mired in life’s circumstances, no matter how they present themselves. What we become stuck in is a wrong belief playing itself out over a thousand iterations. Change the flat tire!
How your life has played out thus far is a product of your own making and once you are finally able to own that, you can climb confidently back into the driver’s seat and chart a new course; one that you sought after on purpose. Refusing to own your part in this grand drama leaves you as the victim, pitifully wasting away your one short go-round, waiting for someone or something to change your scenario; change your course for you. No matter how bad things may have gotten for you, you still know what you enjoy, right? You still know what good looks and feels like, right? It may surprise you to know that God Himself, with all of His limitless power and ability, can only take you as far as you are willing to go. His job isn’t to drive you to your future destination. He made you the bus driver. Instead He can only encourage you through crazy blog-writers who have the audacity to repeat what His Word says, hopefully in ways that you can understand!
You think countless thoughts within the space of a day. Why not take a breath and find out what some of those thoughts are and then challenge them if they don’t fit the image of what you want for your life. Just because you thought a thought doesn’t make it true. Good bus drivers have to wrestle all of those unruly thoughts into submission and in doing so take over the wheel of their own ride.
However you got here to this moment in time only proves your history thus far. Your future is something you are planning for today by the thoughts you entertain the most. Recognize how big of a deal those little thoughts really are and work with the system people!

It is remarkable how much energy we squander reliving past moments and future times. When our recall is pleasant or our anticipation sweet, our time travel enhances our journey. But when with squinted eye we lament the past or rashly dread an imaginary future, we sully and tarnish our journey and cut ourselves off from the experience of life that is now.
Just as your mind was designed to think one thought at a time, no matter the speed, and always in succession, your experience of life was intended to occupy all the space of right now. The incredible sensory beauty of nature is to be both perceived and received now. The love of people and your relationship to them is to be performed and reformed now. The solution to your trouble, your difficulty, your toil can only be discovered and then rediscovered now. Your life is now. Your feelings are now. Your understanding is now. Your experience is now. Your decision is now. Your God (and mine) is now.
Our senses have become so easily distracted, so anesthetized, so diluted that we fail to register what we need to detect. We miss it. We look asconce. We harden our hearts. We blow past it recklessly and without thought. We never impressed on our minds what “it” is and why we need to address its beckoning. Instead we dart beyond it, nervously anticipating or retreating from its threatening, all the while never slowing enough to see it for what it is. Feelings of boredom or lethargy frighten us and in escape from them we fill the air around us with media or music or talking or booze or anything that will succeed in removing the threat. However, the specter is not removed just postponed. Then each postponed moment adds, multiplies and carries over until the life of the person is eventually lost.
A bad marriage isn’t one thing it’s a compilation of things. It’s a hundred unsaid sentences; a thousand unspoken thoughts, a million feelings unaddressed. The job you loathe became so by your own diminished effort, your silent acquiescence, your failure to shine and effervesce and move upward and onward. Your lack of money or respect or fulfillment came not because someone wrestled it from you, but because you gave it up in thought or in practice, or better said in failure to think and then act. You arrived at where you arrived at not by a sudden bolt or surge or happenstance, not by commission, but by omission. All that futile dragging about and wallowing in some long dead past moment or anxiously rehearsing some ghastly, dreadful, or shame producing future time succeeded in removing your precious perception from the thing you needed to take care of while it was still called “today!”
Our present time has become perilously occupied and as addicts we crave more and more of both quantity and frequency. We can scarce handle a break in entertaining media. In our compulsion our time diminishes leaving us exhausted and busy and tired. Instead of running, running, running we should stop and have the courage to take on the moment that is now. Don’t busy yourself with trifles. Don’t log on or search or shop. Don’t turn on anything but your beautiful mind. Allow yourself to feel again. Let pleasant and unpleasant emotions just be. Look at those thoughts that dog you and grab them by their leash. Consider whether they’re real or imagined. Push through the veil and see who has been driving your bus. Who or what has been moving you against your will from what’s most important to you in life and convincing you to settle for less than that? What wrong ideas or untested theories are hiding in the darkness and acting as chains to bind you where there are no limitations? The answers to these questions; to anything that ever plagued you are all right here, obvious and clear in the moment called now, in the sweet reverie between you and your Creator.
The message has been playing all around you since time was first initiated. It’s in the still small voice. It’s in quiet meditation. It’s in the honesty of prayer. It’s in yoga and in sitting still. It is found in every sunrise and sunset. It’s blended in the green of the tree leaves and grass and the bluish hue of the sky. It’s the ocean, the sand and the gentle breeze. It’s unplugged, outside and in every woods. It is your cherished life right now, and now, and now. It is your distinctive, wonderful experience of life both right now and in every incredible, future, unique now.
Don’t grieve God’s heart by passing time and finding things to get you from one moment to the next. Don’t occupy yourself for occupation’s sakes. Don’t waste time in mindless distraction or in things not worthy of your experience. Instead harvest the bountiful crop to be savored in every precious moment of life. Honor your own heart and your own feelings. Trust yourself and move confidently toward those things that warm you and ask your heart to speed up. Open your eyes and finally see the incredible attention to detail; the unfailing love; the miracle that is this life all wrapped up in the wonder of time right now…
I’m not sure how this kind of thing happens or what’s behind those sudden decisions we make in life, though I have some strong suspicions, but for whatever reason you suddenly find yourself consumed with the idea of putting yourself to the test in some capacity for some important reason. This is exactly what happened to me. I was about to return from a conference where I happily ate, drank and was merry. As the conference closing drew near, I finalized the idea that when I got home I was going to put myself on a drastic calorie reduced diet. My reasoning basically consisted of the idea that I had allowed myself to get fat and was getting to the point where I could barely tolerate that guy in the mirror. I knew this diet was the only plan that had worked for me in the past, so I put the naysayers behind me and began the 21 day quest. Naturally, my reduced calorie diet included an abstinence from alcohol for the next 21 days as well. I’m not the kind of guy that needs a drink to function, but I cannot recall the last time I hadn’t even had a glass of wine for 3 weeks. So the test and the learning commenced…
Much to my surprise, my first lesson made clear to me how important it is to make decisions, specifically the stronger your decision, the easier it is going to be to carry out your plan. When, by God, you decide how it is going to be, then, by God that is exactly how it is! Day after day I lost a pound as promised; did not cause my body to think I was starving; had vegetables and protein daily; did not suffer the litany of other ailments I would surely undergo from losing weight too quickly. My only pair of jeans that still fit soon took on the baggy look. I found a whole wardrobe of suits and shirts that magically worked again. Shoot, I could even wear a t-shirt to the gym without the all too familiar belly bulge! Victory!
Uber discipline in place for calorie reduction, my most pleasant surprise came by shaking up my familiar routines involving alcohol. Not having a glass of wine during the week was relatively simple, but not having any wine on the weekend days, that’s a whole other story! You may not realize this but Friday nights were made for wine. Choosing no wine on wine night is quite a slap in a habit’s face! Abstain I did, as I had already decided, and I was left with myself facing myself. You know what I found? Years of unresolved childhood issues and hurts left unattended? Painful realizations of what my life really consisted of? Ummm, no! What I found was that absent the anesthetic, I was damn productive. Suddenly I had a lot of shit to do! After I did it, I assumed my usual veg position on the couch minus the fatty chips and a glass of wine. When in doubt, do thinking… I think you’ll enjoy it.
My next realization and perhaps best lesson learned involved how I felt about myself. I’m not trying to tell you that abstinence is best or that you should live without many of the things that you enjoy. What I am telling you is that controlling yourself feels damn fantastic! Control yourself! Learn to say no! Resist! Take charge of the organism. Your desires, your wants, your enjoyments, your habits aren’t in control, you are! And when that day comes, for whatever reason, prompted by whatever logic, do it, feel it, overcome it. Controlling your own self is like crack cocaine to your self-esteem. You become the “effin” champion! It’s the most unusual, yet most profound thing in the world. Controlling yourself, not just for a rough 21 day test, but throughout your life, clearly is the best thing to do. I mean, if a small piece of cheese makes a mouse return to the same spot, the feelings you get from controlling yourself, alone, are worth any hardship you might face. It’s like God is telling you, “See, control isn’t bad, it’s everything good!” Try it…
At the risk of sounding preachy or, God forbid, religious, your brain really doesn’t need the substance to be okay. Your unaltered mental state can actually be very sweet and even more resilient than you have given it credit to be. The trick is to avoid rapid medication over just allowing yourself to be with yourself as yourself. Some jokes aren’t that funny. Some experiences are hysterical. In short, you start to figure out things that need to be done and things you want to get done. Have I sworn off wine forever? Of course not! But, I did put myself to the test and not only won, but more importantly learned some valuable things about myself.
My seemingly insignificant little experiment taught me so many things, the greatest of which is that control is not something to be feared, but rather something to be embraced and honored. Cliche’ aside, life is too damn short to be under anything’s control! Prove it to yourself!
Now, what’s next? What should you do? Well, if you don’t mind, find that thing that you cannot live without; find that part of life you’ve convinced yourself you have to have and go without it. Cut it off for a minute. Give it up. Just say no! It can be as simple as Dunkin Donuts coffee or as serious as a drug addiction. Point is – you don’t need anything outside of yourself to be happy and you can discipline yourself to give up almost anything (except what you need to live). But, don’t do it because I said so, do it when you also experience that urge; that calling; that determination to put yourself to the test and win.
In the Spring of 1982, I was a young college student when I first experienced the class that would change my life forever called, “Power for Abundant Living.” Having grown up with no religious training, I was fortunate not to have any compulsive, well schooled creeds to unlearn, except for one – fear. And, like most people, you would never know this by observing me. I said all the right things and generally made sure it appeared like I had it all together. However, underneath that deliberate facade, I was afraid of everything.
One of the first lessons from this class about the Bible was that fear is always wrong. (If you just mentally rehearsed some scenarios where fear is good, you need the class!) Fear has defeated more people’s lives than any other thing in the world. Fear always encases, always binds, always limits what you can and cannot do. Fear steals away your energy. Fear lowers your vitality. Fear produces inertia and eventually stops your life from moving forward as it should. “Fear is sand in the machinery of life.” Accordingly, “fear not” is the number one admonition in the Bible.
Fear is not simply an emotion or a sense of healthy caution that keeps you from walking off a cliff. Fear is a negative form of believing. What you believe in the depth of your being is what you receive or experience in this life, including that which you fear. The fears you unknowingly cling to either from wrong teaching or ignorance serve only to limit and thwart your life. When and where you have fear you have defeat in your life. Just as a person positively envisions some goal with the expectation of achieving it, fear is negatively envisioning something bad with a fearful expectation of receiving it. No-one would purposely expect bad things for their life and that’s why fear is always wrong! If you look for it and if you are honest, the places where you struggle the most have some fear interspersed in there. However, just as you began life without all of these fears, those fears can be overcome!
Fear, like any negatives that assault your life, doesn’t just show up overnight. Rather it begins as a process from which you are likely unaware. (If you knew it you wouldn’t participate…) Fear always begins with a doubt. Doubt appears following an uncertainty concerning some aspect of your life. The uncertainty you are experiencing leads to feelings that you have to “figure out” the source of your uncertainty. (This is a typical human response and why the technique is so effective.) As you begin in earnest to figure out the source of your uncertainty, you have to mentally entertain the troubling thought while you try to figure it out. Entertaining the troubling thought, though you are sincerely trying to solve a problem, now transitions into worry. Worry is dwelling on difficulties or troubles, always following uncertainty. “Dwelling on the darkness won’t bring forth the light!” Dwelling on and considering “potential” troubles doesn’t actually help to solve those troubles, but rather serves to entrench those troubles into your thinking. Entrenched worries now turn into fear. Fear means the devil is already inside the door. Fear is a hole in the hedge of God’s protection around your life. Your fear has now become a strong expectation for your life and if persisted in, will bring that negative potentiality into your life. Then you may exclaim, “I knew it!” and you would be correct but before it happened you had another choice! Get rid of fear in your life!
As frightening as this all sounds, it has been going on almost since the earth began, when another power gained access and began bringing fear into people’s lives. It continues to this day because it works wholly by deception. The reason you cannot solve the sudden uncertainty you are experiencing in your mind is because the uncertainty wasn’t true to begin with! You begin your attempt with a wrong starting premise. By entertaining the wrong idea, no matter your good motive, you are acknowledging it as true; as a real possibility for your life. In that you have already been defeated! If you start wrong you will end wrong. Instead of allowing the doubt to persist, leading eventually to worry and finally issuing in fear, you have to learn to control your thoughts and refuse to entertain the negative possibility! This is not an easy thing to do. You are going to feel real, real tempted to take that thing on in your mind. You’ll feel as if you cannot let it go and have to think about it. Well, it’s a trick and will always end badly. It’s not your job to protect yourself from all negatives and evil, it’s God’s job. Let God do His job while you do your job…
Power for Abundant Living taught me how, for the first time in my life, to completely rid myself of worry and fear. The class focused on the greater (greatest) power – God! It taught me how to understand the Bible for myself including those things written for my learning and those things directly applicable to my life. Ultimately the class taught me how to “receive” God’s power into my life via holy spirit and begin utilizing that power in my life, leading to power for abundant living! As vividly as I recall receiving God’s power into manifestation in my life, I also vividly recall and embrace being fear-free for the first time in my life! And although fear would continue its assaults on my mind and at times gain a little access, I continue to feel monumentally grateful for having learned these principles and to now experience my life as a son of God!
I encourage you my dear friends, no matter which path you may take, to learn for yourself the truth of God’s Word; to learn how to receive God’s power into your life; and to learn how to rid yourself of all fear in every category of life!
Whenever you speak of solving problems or repairing broken parts of your life, there is always the assumption that you actually know what your problems are and where your life might need some repair. To rashly conclude your life is in no need of any revisions or improvement makes you a dummy. But, if you are willing to at least consider that there may be something better out there for you, there are some things you have to get clear about first. You cannot fix what you cannot see…
I’m sure by now you are fairly clear on the reality that there is a right way to go and there is a wrong way to go. When you go the right way there is no downside to you or your life. There’s no negative price to pay or some sacrifice of something that is needful. The right way feels good and is good. There are no strings attached, no hidden snares, no “gotcha” waiting to get you. Conversely, the wrong way sooner or later makes itself known by reaching up and smacking you in the face! The cause may seem far removed from the effect, but the effect is always there as it necessarily must be. However, the wrong way carries with it another deleterious effect which you may not be aware of, namely its capacity to blind your eyes to its existence. In the same way that “right” clears your vision, “wrong” obscures it!
“A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.” There’s no walking the fence when it comes to right and wrong. Choosing right is going to bless you and choosing wrong is going to hurt you. The method in which wrong seeks to harm you is by hiding its effects on you. If you have a disease hidden in your body, the sooner it is discovered the better. The longer a disease process has to work on you, the deeper its influence on your body and the worse your chances of surviving it. Wrong, of which “disease” is a member, works the same way. For wrong to continue to have access to your life, there has to be some principle or maxim or belief you are unknowingly perpetuating. The wrong way is often a very subtle distinction. The glutton eats himself to death because food is to be enjoyed. The rich man loses his health and family and eventually his life because life is supposed to be prosperous. You cannot fix what you cannot see…
The first step in getting results is not only to choose right, but also to stop choosing or allowing wrong. Wrong is not the excitement or spice of life it purports itself to be. Wrong isn’t the fun in life that you’ve been missing or the sin God doesn’t want you to do because He isn’t into your enjoyment. Instead those things are simply wrong’s commercial, advertising a claim that isn’t true. God not only treasures enjoyment, He wants you to find that enjoyment in your own life. Again this is part of how wrong hides itself in your logic. In its true essence, right is all of those things you are seeking, even if you cannot see that at the moment. Right is the love, the joy, the peace, the abundance, the prosperity, the health you are sincerely after! But for right to have its way, you have to lay aside the wrong…
Perplex yourself no further in futility trying to figure out why the good things you want in your life aren’t happening for you. No, no, no don’t start there. Begin by identifying the wrong things you are clear about and put them all aside. Stop doing them. Stop indulging them. Stop putting up with them. Now don’t you get all religious on me by refusing yourself nachos or wine in the evening or having sex with someone you love. That bondage is more wrong. I’m talking about those things you know in your heart aren’t right. Those habits of thought and action that have been promising you the same results for years; good feelings, peace, happiness, yet consistently giving you something else; bad feelings, guilt, general unrest; those are the things of which to rid yourself. If every time you do a certain behavior you feel bad about it, for the love of God stop doing the behavior. Don’t ignore what is, in favor of what you hope might be. You can’t fix what you can’t see…
Deciding you are going to forever stop a pattern of thought or a behavior on its own is like putting yourself on a perpetual, strict diet. It only works as long as you remain determined or until a delicious cheeseburger keeps showing up. Instead, the better way to stop something is to replace it with something else. Replace that obvious wrong with a new behavior or a new approach. The best of the best would be to see the wrong for what it is – wrong, and stop putting up with its lies. Decide to see for yourself the error and deeply consider the negative effect it has had on your life; if the effect is only that you no longer like yourself. That’s enough on its own.
The more you adamantly decide to put off the wrongs in life, the more clear your vision will become. Like the former drug addict or alcoholic, you will see maybe for the first time the stupid things that have been plaguing your life. You finally get a glimpse of the wrong beliefs you have been harboring in your heart for years and years. Glory, hallelujah you can see! And in seeing you can change or repair any aspect of your life that wasn’t the best and get on a new course to victory, love, peace, joy and abundance. Or said another day, get on the right path. You surely can fix what you can see! I promise you.
With the New Year upon us, we often find ourselves making goals and plans for some new and improved version of ourselves. At its core, is a fundamental belief that something is not right about us. We have some fault or failing we need to remedy. And from that erroneous starting premise we desire to make repairs. The whole world seeks to fit itself within this system, yet continues to fail year after year after year! The fundamental reason for this persistent, pervasive, cancerous approach is that we are failing to ask ourselves the right questions.
Life is spiritual, not religious, spiritual. Behind everything that you experience in your life is a spiritual cause or influence. The only two spiritual options are good and evil. Sounds simplistic but it’s true whether you believe it or not. Good only seeks to influence you for a good end; happy, healthy and fulfilled. Evil seeks to influence you for something less than desirable and in most cases things that take your life away from you in part or in whole. The end of evil is always death. Short of killing you, evil seeks to “eff” your life up!
At your core essence as a human being there is nothing wrong with you. Persevering with questions about what is wrong with “me” are always the wrong questions. The right question is what are you allowing to influence your life? You have difficulties in your life and can easily see where and how the same things seem to defeat you year after year. You can tell by noticing how many times you have written the same goals, in earnest. You are frustrated because you ‘should’ know better and choose better. The wrong that you and I do is not because we are bad people, yet that is quite hard for us to believe. The wrongs we do are because we have been influenced by evil in some form or fashion. We have accepted something that isn’t true. We have too often taken the bait promising us something that we want only to find out later that’s not what we are getting. In short, we have succumbed to evil influence.
No-one would ever choose evil if they saw it for what it really is. Evil always comes with some deception, some guise, some hard to detect cover. Yet there it sits working behind the scenes on everything that has ever gone wrong with your life. Everything! “The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was to convince the world he didn’t exist.” (The Usual Suspects, circa 1995) Because of this, many, many people attribute things that go wrong to God, the source of all goodness. In catastrophe they seek meaning instead of looking for the evil influence and how it gained access. Absent an answer, again from asking the wrong question, they make up fables concerning God’s greater purpose etc. Goodness cannot do anything but goodness and His influence is always preservative and safe.
Being influenced by evil doesn’t just consist of pursuing lustful pleasures but also encompasses sin, guilt, unworthiness and all unnatural preoccupation with oneself. Feelings of not being worthy, perpetuated by churches and religion, always leads to the most powerful weapon in the adversary’s gun belt – fear! Once the enemy has convinced you that something is wrong with you, you have already been defeated. Once you get on the hamster wheel of making mistakes, feeling badly and doing good works to atone for your sins, get ready because you’re going to be spinning on that wheel for a long, long time. When you arrive there fear is at the threshold! Most of what has gone south on you in life is due to fear. Fear is the number one evil influence to extricate yourself from.
The right question to ask yourself in the New Year is what am I afraid of? Where am I unknowingly allowing evil in the door? What influences in my life are leading me astray? If you really want to see you can see and God will make sure of that. All humans are susceptible to these influences and true goodness will never put you in bondage to some religious behaviors you don’t really want to do. Escaping evil influences isn’t about focusing on your behavior and all you do and shouldn’t do. That poison will only put you in deeper. Instead the better question is what things have I allowed into my life that end up bringing me pain? Why have I allowed them and what false promises have they offered me that really aren’t true?
Detecting and discerning evil influences require a spiritual standard outside of yourself. What feels right only works on occasion. Many things that feel right or that you have no problem participating in, only feel right because you have long been systematized into their error. In this winning at life thing you cannot always trust your feelings. Instead you have to learn spiritual realties from the spiritual book called the Bible. Before you discount that for your life, you have to ask yourself do you really know what it says or have you made some snap judgments about it? I think it makes sense that the same influence messing your life up will also work to keep you away from that book! The Good Book is why we know that evil does exist no matter how many thousands of voices in the world shout disagreement.
The New Year, like any new year offers the promise of a better future. Gain access to your better future by learning to discern evil influences in your life. Quit making it all about you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with you! What is wrong is your failure to see what is behind all of your difficulties and challenges. None of us are good by our own merits. Thinking so is a dangerous game heading for disaster. See life for what it is spiritually and then pursue the good influences. The good influence will only help you and bless you and as is often needed, repair you! The Good Influence loves you no matter what you do. Isn’t that what you need the most? Sure it is and you know it…

Editorial State of the nation New South Wales teachers in government schools can now apply for a new position called a 'Highly Accomplished Teacher.' The new position is linked to the Professional Teaching Standards of the NSW Institute of Teachers at the levels of Professional Accomplishment and Professional Leadership. Undertaking accreditation at Professional Accomplishment or Professional Leadership is a prerequisite for appointment. The new position has been created as part of the Teacher Quality National Partnership so that the best of NSW government school teachers can seek an increase in pay to take their talents and experience into schools in some of the state's most disadvantaged communities. The 'Highly Accomplished Teachers' will work in the classroom but with a reduced teaching load so they'll have time to mentor and support other teachers and take a leadership role at the school without the need to move from the classroom and into administrative roles. The first applicants for the new positions completed online preliminary assessments in March. More positions will arise throughout the year. LINKS www.nswteachers.nsw. edu.au In Tasmania, the controversial post-Year 10 reforms, called 'Tasmania Tomorrow' are 'dead' or 'undergoing refinement,' depending on your point of view. Tasmanian Education Minister Lin Thorp in June announced 'changes to the current model for post-Year 10 education and training following extensive On the table for consultation by all members of the Australasian Teacher Regulatory Authorities (ATRA), teachers and other stakeholders around Australia has been the first draft of the national professional standards for teachers. The consultation ended on 21 May. ATRA has worked with teachers and other stakeholders in each state and territory to coordinate a national response to the draft. The response reflects the feedback of teachers from around the country. The consensus from teachers is that there is quite a bit of work to be done. We must have standards that work for teachers from Bathurst Island to Bruny Island and Byron Bay to Broome. They should be the national common reference point that articulates, celebrates and supports the complex and demanding nature of a teacher's professional life from preparation to the twilight of their career. These standards will be the building blocks of a national profession, and they must be right. consultations.' The Tasmania Tomorrow reforms created a pretertiary Tasmanian Academy, in place of the state's existing senior secondary colleges, and a vocational Tasmanian Polytechnic. The Tasmanian Academy will continue to enrol students aged between 15 and 19 years and will broker with the Polytechnic to provide students access to Polytechnic courses. The Greens, on whom the minority Labor government depends, insisted on the change to the system. According to Thorp, the main change is to bring the Academy and Polytechnic under the control of the Education Department by 2011. The changes also include scrapping the Academy and Polytechnic boards, restoring senior secondary colleges, which each get back their original name and a principal, and moving staff back to the Education Department. A Grattan Institute report using data from the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development claims that teacher management in Australian schools is dysfunctional. According to Ben Jensen, Grattan Institute Program Director of School Education and TALIS coauthor, only eight per cent of Australian teachers believe they'd receive recognition for improving their teaching, while 91 per cent believe they would receive no recognition for innovative teaching and 93 per cent believe their school principal does not take steps to address persistently underperforming teachers.
Electrical inspections are required whenever new electrical work has been done or upgrades to existing electrical components are made.
Municipalities and insurance companies require electrical inspections to be performed by a certified electrical inspector. In almost all cases, homeowner insurance companies will not cover any claims arising from new electrical work that was not inspected such as pools, additions, services, etc.
If there is any doubt that electrical work may not have been installed properly or inspected you may need an electrical inspection.

The 2018 annual meeting will be held at Archbold Biological Station, located on the southern end of the Lake Wales Ridge in south-central Florida. Except for the Saturday night social and awards dinner, all activities will take place at the Station, utilizing the Frances Archbold Hufty Learning Center. The unique field station setting will provide plenty of opportunities to unwind and experience the stunning biodiversity of the surrounding Florida scrub ecosystem. See www.archbold-station.org for more information about the meeting location.
As I’m sure you’re all aware, Hurricane Michael is expected to make landfall on the panhandle of Florida on Wednesday. This will undoubtedly disrupt travel plans for many of you. However, at this point we are going ahead with the meeting, considering at least 60% of the registered attendees are coming from areas that are not going to be directly affected by the storm.
Neither Archbold nor GTC have made any decisions yet about issuing refunds to those who cannot attend due to the hurricane. Rest assured we will do what we can, recognizing the need to cover costs of food and other meeting expenses that have already been incurred. If you know that you can no longer attend, please email me brothermel@archbold-station.org and cc facilitiescoordinator@archbold-station.org. We especially need to hear from any presenters as soon as possible.
We should have a better idea of possible changes to the meeting schedule by Wednesday and will be sure to keep you informed. In the meantime, good luck to all of you now prepping for this major hurricane. We’re keeping you in our thoughts.
Unfortunately, we have had to close registration early because we have reached maximum capacity for the facility. We apologize to those who we cannot accomodate.
Every meeting attendee must register as a visitor to Archbold Biological Station no later than Sept. 28th. This Archbold registration form also allows you to reserve on-site lodging and sign up for your choice of nature walks on Friday morning.
Please don’t forget to renew your membership or become a member of the GTC if you are not including it in your registration fees!

Twitter, Facebook, Soundcloud, YouTube . . . you have heard of these music/social media platforms and we love them, but there’s a new kid on the block and it’s called Klickjam.
Don’t get it twisted, Klickjam is not a competitor of any current music profile platforms, just think of it as an additional tool to slide into your trusty music toolbelt.
Priding itself in aiding musicians achieve further UNIVERSAL exposure, Klickjam is the world’s FIRST digital platform specifically designed to bring the ENTIRE world of MUSIC under one lens.
What else makes Klickjam different and worth your consideration? Well, unlike other online platforms where musicians are featured and do share interests, Klickjam is ENTIRELY established for music lovers as well as musicians, singers, bands, promoters, performers, songwriters, and agents alike. In addition, instead of just social sharing, at Klickjam you are able to connect and be connected to anyone and everyone from around the world who is either interested in your talent or who you show an interest in – and get this, you will have the contacts to make it happen as Klickjam has an easy-to-use search function with real-time updates from musicians around the world – to illustrate, you have THREE avenues to musically globe trot:

So, in a nutshell, let’s look at it this way: Imagine a large EXCLUSIVE sound hub that’s FREE where you can take a seat (so-to-speak) at the largest table in music and communicate with all sorts of music lovers and those in the music community from around the GLOBE. And while there, you can display your talent, take their information, give your contact info., share songs, stories, and connect. In other words, Klickjam is more of a “roundtable” global online experience where it is more ONE on ONE to get what you need, when you need it, for your career in music.
Already a bilingual site, it is set to add more languages with the platform currently available in English and French with Spanish on its way.

"Why fit in when you were born to stand out?" - Dr. Seuss
To honor this holiday I was looking for some cool quotes from the founding fathers. Well, it turns out I’m not as much into politics as I am emotional wellness and how it affects relationships, so this quote by Thomas Jefferson hit home:
“Nothing gives one person so much advantage over another as to remain always cool and unruffled under all circumstances.” – Thomas Jefferson
Ironically, studying the founding fathers of America will quickly lead you to the conclusion they too thought more about relationships and the emotional nature of humans than raw politics. Frankly, the Declaration of Independence , which was authored by Thomas Jefferson, and the Constitution are both written arguably for the sole purpose of defining and setting boundaries around the relationship between individuals and their government. Tomorrow, we celebrate the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4th, 1776, Independence Day.
One reason is that some people by nature want to lead and another is that there are a lot of hot and emotionally ruffled people in the world. The danger to the rest of us comes when the same person possess both of these qualities. Due to their innate instability, these people often seek to control others, be it people or animals. Worse yet, because they can’t “gain advantage” by means of their emotional health they satisfy their appetites for control in one of two undesirable ways, force or coercion. In general these people give off some pretty negative vibes. Jefferson had seen this type before.
Emotionally healthy leaders on the other hand, command respect through their behavior, drawing willing followers to them in a seemingly effortless fashion. You just simply feel good in their company. You trust them, no matter what the circumstances, to do the right and reasonable thing. They generally seek the good of others above themselves.
If you’re tuned in to emotion and body language you can easily identify both of these types of people from a distance. Without them saying a word, you can already know a great deal about them.
While I’m fairly sure Jefferson, the third President of the United States, wasn’t thinking about his dog or horse when he put this concept to words, I wonder if he ever had some inclination of the power this state of mind can have on animals. If he ever had a dog or a horse, I’m quite sure he did. If you need some practice figuring out who these people are quickly, here’s some advice, start listening to a dog or a horse.
Mosie can see emotionally unhealthy people coming from a great distance. She is our rescued, “All American” mutt. She’s like a fine tuned emotional health people meter. If you’re one of those that manages to “remain cool and unruffled under all circumstances” she is generally pretty cool with you. If, on the other hand, you are not so cool, and heaven forbid a little emotionally ruffled, look out, she just may dismember you piece by piece. Mosie is afraid, observant, and smart. She knows that a person who is not emotionally sound is a threat to her and cannot be trusted. By noting her body language as well as those she opposes and accepts I have learned a great deal about people and their character.
Horses are born skeptics. They can also precisely calculate your emotional health to such a degree of detail we can safely call them mind readers. Pat Parelli, a natural horseman, is often heard saying, “Some people can drive any horse crazy.” You can guess which type of persons they are by now. Yep, you know them. The folks that step inside the pasture holding a rope, behind their back in a futile attempt to hide it, and all the horses run away. They too, like Mosie, know that this person cannot be trusted. They will not willingly follow such an emotionally fickle leader.
Think of some of the biggest nut cases in history and they were probably tyrannical leaders of nations. These are folks that attempted to kill entire groups of people because of the way they looked or their nationality. Or maybe, at a whim, they executed individuals out of wrath, jealousy, envy, or even entertainment.
So Jefferson was really on to something. First, if you want to be a leader whose followers are willing, learn to control your emotions under all circumstances. Second, beware of emotionally unstable people, especially those attempting to lead, as they will seek to control and coerce. They cannot be trusted. Tomorrow, as a nation we celebrate Independence Day. Maintaining our independence as a nation as well as individuals depends on our ability to discern emotional stability in people. Third, work to stay cool, calm, and collected yourself. It’s attractive, offers an advantage, and it feels great! Here’s wishing you an emotionally healthy Independence Day!

Kildorrery Community Development Ltd. is a non profit organisation which was officially set up on the 4th of October 1993. The aim of the organisation is to promote Kildorrery as a welcoming and active community for our residents and visitors, thus encouraging tourism and industry into the area. There are a number of sub-committees working within the Community Development, namely: The Community Housing Association, Community Alert, Tidy Towns Group, Historical Society, Senior Citizens' Association, Community Garden Group and the Playground Group.
The Community Development Office is open Mon - Fri from 9.00am - 5.00pm. We offer a full range of administrative services; typing, photocopying, printing, broadband use, laminating e-mailing and scanning. We also a Fáilte Ireland approved Visitor Information Point. The friendly office staff will gladly help with any questions or queries that you may have be you a visitor or local.
The Community Office was restored and a restaurant developed in the extension of the original building between Oct 2012 and July 2013 with the help of LEADER Funding provided by Ballyhoura Development Ltd. The building was purchased by Kildorrery Community Development Ltd. in 1998 to house its office and also to facilitate the running of the local Community Employment scheme which is still managed through the office. The decision was made by the Development Committee to restore the building, but due to the historic nature of the structure and its inclusion in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH), an architectural & archaeological impact study was carried out before any plans were drawn up. The study found that this vernacular building was of a very early origin and consequently the plans drawn up for its restoration were sensitive to the integrity of its heritage. The corrugated tin that was on the roof from a least before 1901 (1901Census of Ireland) was removed and the original thatch exposed and restored to its original appearance. The original walls were retained and restored with a lime render finish contemporary with their period. The extension to the rear of the building, which now houses Thatch & Thyme Restaurant, was built in such a way as to incorporate the original building and not impact on its structural heritage. Originally the building was thought to belong to a phase of the re-development of Kildorrery village by the 2nd Earl of Kingston in c.1777. It has since been featured as one of thirty houses selected for inclusion in the Cork County Council publication ‘Heritage Houses of County Cork’, and further examination of the building for the book has proposed that it belongs to a much earlier development of the village possibly dating back as far as c.1606 when the village was being developed as a market town by Maurice Fitzgibbon of Oldcastletown- ‘The 10th White Knight’.
Oaklawn Housing complex was officially opened on the 30th of September, 2006 and all of the houses are currently occupied. There are 9 houses in the complex and a Community Centre. The houses are warm and comfortable and nicely situated close to the village. They are suitable for elderly people who may wish to move to a more secure environment but remain in the community they are familiar with. During the year the Housing Association hold social gatherings in the Centre which everyone is welcome to attend. We would hope to make more use of the Centre in the future so we are open to ideas.

A CENTURY ago, March 19, 1918 the government enacted Daylight Saving Time as a World War I effort to save coal. Even though it was halted later that year, it hung around here and there in one form or another until it was recognized again nationally in 1966 as part of the Uniform Time Act.

In 2008, a nissologist – one who studies islands – named Christian Depraetere selected a threshold of 0.1 sq km… and calculated that there are 86,732 islands at or above this size on earth. That acreage – 0.01 sq km – equals 107,639 square feet, or about the size of your average NBA star’s home.
REEL East Texas Film Festival is still none months away and already almost four dozen entries have been submitted.
I'll preface this with somewhat of a back story. Earlier this year I moved into a much larger house than I had been living in. As part of my decor to decorate the den/office/game room I now have a nice small shelf section that displays all of my LUNAR material stretching back to the SEGA CD releases. I have all the US release titles of every LUNAR game and also the two PS1 strategy guides (I am sooooo glad I went through and bought that LUNAR Eternal Blue Complete hardcover guide new back in the day, as they're worth a pretty penny now). There's a lot of nostalgia with this series and I like to display it proudly.
While I was not fortunate to own the SEGA CD Eternal Blue in it's original packaging my copy of LUNAR TSS on SEGA CD is in it's original long box. One thing I always noticed in the back was a card to order the official strategy guide. I have seen both the strategy guides for auction plenty of times, and not only did the same authors do both guides but I've also noticed that the same company did guides for other US releases on the SEGA CD like Vay and Popful Mail. However I have never actually seen the contents of the SEGA CD LUNAR strategy guides themselves. With there being a recent influx of posts regarding original artwork and articles from the early 90s of LUNAR, did the SEGA CD guides include any artwork that say wasn't utilized by Working Designs or in any other US release material? I do know that Toshiyuki Kubooka did a good deal of artwork for the original titles and it's often a work of piece meal to get it all in one place in high quality (pulling from the manuals, art books, etc).
My curiosity is purely for the sake of seeing more of Kubooka's work. Despite his work from LUNAR being far over his works still manage to stay relevant such as with the Idolm@ster series.
I'm curious about this as well. I'm pretty sure some of the drawings Kubooka did for the Lunar I+II art book found their way into the original Japanese strategy guides.
I'll try to remember to check. I don't think there were any drawings that weren't in the Lunar I+II artbook, but I'll see.
I own a physical copy of the Lunar I+II artbook, and downloaded a scan of the TSS strategy guide. There was one profile of Ramus' head I had not seen in the artbook (the smaller TSS section anyway), the rest are all contained in it, though the color was removed, or simply images from the actual game (again no color). The book is mostly EB, so I'll need more time to cross reference the EB strategy guide. Photo of said Ramus head is attached:
Dragonmaster Alex’s side profile shot, it’s similar to the one in the I+II Artbook however they removed his long hair or it got cut off in printing.
Thanks for doing that, since I clearly haven't gotten to it... though I did at least pull out the TSS guide recently. Some of the lineart may be in the Japanese TSS guides. I know when I first got them I felt like I was seeing things I hadn't seen before, but that was probably just memory not being accurate. I do feel like I've seen the smiling Ghaleon lineart elsewhere though.
The Dragonmaster Alex one is definitely the same one as in the artbook, just cut off slightly on the right side. Hard to say whether this was intentional or not.
I'm still at a loss for that Ramus pic, though. I dug through some of my Japanese TSS guides and specials and one has a fair bit of lineart in it, but didn't include that one of Ramus, though it did have the Ghaleon head. There are a couple of Nall heads that don't seem to be in the I+II artbook, though. I'll have to check in the SSS artbook later.
An interesting discovery, though, is that one of these attack specials (magazine inserts that came out around the game's release) has screenshots with earlier versions of character portraits for Alex, Luna, Ramus, and maybe Nash and Nall. I'll have to scan it. Unfortunately, it's printed on cheap pulpy paper and is kind of small, so it may be hard to make out much. There was also a screenshot of what the stone circles (MP-restoring shrines) looked like as an actual destination, not just a feature on the overworld map. Wonder if the graphics are still in the game data... Anyway, I need to rescan some of the I+II artbook and I'll scan these booklets at the same time. Whenever that is.
Issue 033 Author Interview: Brittany Pladek and “Notes from an Unpublished Interview…” | Luna Station Quarterly
Luna Station Quarterly is a speculative fiction magazine featuring stories by emerging women authors.
Mondays can be a bear, so why not start your week off with an interview with Issue 033 author Brittany Pladek as she tells us about her story “Notes from an Unpublished Interview with Mme. Delave, Fairy“?
LSQ: The sense of time and place is eloquently presented in your piece — you’ve managed to capture both the French Revolution and early 20th century Manhattan. Do you have a particular interest in either era? What was it about the French Revolution that prompted its inclusion in this piece (say, as compared to some other revolutions or social upheaval)?
Brittany: I study the era of the French Revolution, though as a literature scholar rather than a historian, and with a focus on England rather than France (so apologies to any actual historians who read the piece and find my inevitable errors). But I’m fascinated by the post-French Revolutionary period and the early twentieth century because they’re both eras of profound disillusionment. They’re times when people had to figure out how to continue working towards the good despite feeling like their hopes had been shattered. Those are instructive moments, I think.
LSQ: The interest of the fairy to massive social change (“What courage, to attempt such a spell!” Mme. says) I think says something very potent about society’s ability to sometimes make huge changes. Can you speak to this? Is there perhaps something in the current state of events that echoes these thoughts?
Brittany: Yes. This is the bluntest allegory I’ve ever written. It’s 2018, I live in the United States, and I’m too tired for subtlety: I’m watching a country that was at least nominally a republic become an autocracy. I wrote this story to try and keep my own hopes up and to remind myself that losing faith in the possibility of change is a sure way to keep it from happening. It’s so easy to lock yourself out of a world where revolution is possible.
LSQ: The narrative style of this piece (mostly newspaper interview) is somewhat unique. Did this story naturally lend itself to this format, or was it something that you carved out gradually between edits? Do you have any experience or background in journalism or digging through archives?
Brittany: I do spend a lot of time in the archives for my research. But I also love fiction that incorporates documentary artifacts, like Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness and N. K. Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy, which use archival fragments as part of their world building, or Sofia Samatar’s short fiction, which is often crafted from different (imaginary) texts layered together. This piece was a deliberate formal experiment following those models. It takes some pretty big liberties with the interview format—for example, I doubt any seasoned reporter would take such flowery notes.
LSQ: Fairies come off somewhat hedonistic in your story — also as tricksters and something more sinister. Can you comment on the state of fairies as portrayed in your view versus perhaps the “Disney” version of fairies that the general public may hold? How do you view the benevolent nature of the “modern” fairy versus the darker version of fairies in older fables?
Brittany: There are so many different fairy traditions! The one this story references is very specific, though. It’s a tradition popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—think Lord Dunsany’s The King of Elfland’s Daughter—that uses “Faerie” to express nostalgia for a vanishing world (usually coded as more mystical, hierarchical, agrarian, and conservative). The fading of Faerie symbolized the loss of that world. As an emotion, I find that nostalgia very compelling, though I don’t miss the world Faerie represented for people like Dunsany. But I’m fascinated by how powerful nostalgia is, and how complicated, as a type of desire. This story was an attempt to turn Faerie nostalgia towards something different, and it got grim pretty quickly. Nostalgia usually presumes you can’t get the thing you’re pining for back. Mme. Delave’s nostalgia for the days of revolutionary possibility means she believes they’re gone for good.
LSQ: What was the most difficult aspect about this story to write and why? What inspired this idea? Have you written about fairy lore before?
Brittany: The most challenging aspect of this story was deciding how much of the reporter’s personal life I wanted to include. In the end, she ended up being pretty marginal so I could focus on Mme. Delave. As for inspiration, I’d just finished a novel by John Crowley, whose most famous book, Little, Big, is a revision of the “fading of faerie” myth.
Brittany: I’m working on a few short stories and revising a post-apocalyptic novella about a city where every year, a group of debaters have to convince god not to destroy humanity.

Why is it that we pack holiday weekends so darned full? It’s the illusion of “so much more time” to do all those little projects with a three-day weekend! Am I the only one who does this? The week before I have all these great plans of everything I am going to get done, but then Saturday morning comes along and all I want to do is sleep in! Of course, that’s not really possible any more with an 8 month old with a precise inner clock. Daylight? Playtime!!
This weekend has been busy so far. I went to a reunion breakfast with two of the three other mamas I was in swim class with. We had breakfast out, together, the day I went into labor. Now, 8 months later, we gathered again (sans one member – we missed you A!) Seeing all the babies together showed me once again just how fast it’s all going.

As moms we are always on the go and have to be ready for anything. So what if I told you I found the perfect swimsuit that doesn’t look like a swimsuit, has a quick dry technology, you can run errands in without a cover up and you could even workout in? Would you believe me?
I recently received a Beach House Sport swimsuit and I absolutely loved it. As you all know we live in sunny Naples, FL. We have numerous public beaches, parks and playgrounds in the city. One of our favorite activities is going to Lowdermilk Park early in the morning for a play date, a walk on the beach and having a picnic!
Lowdermilk park is a playground, recreational area with public beach access. No matter the time we go to the park it always gets too hot & muggy, so the other day I decided to wear my Beach House Sport Swimsuit. The swimsuit was perfect for the park. The swimsuit top comes with a “breath easy” mesh tank for 2 looks in 1 for any women that wants to change up her style or for more coverage. It also has adjustable straps on the swim top and tank top. I felt that the tank was a perfect cover up so that I could still run errands in feeling comfortable. The shorts are stretch and provide lots of coverage. A bonus was the inside pocket in the shorts that could hold small items like, credit cards, money, keys, lipgloss etc.
The set I’m wearing is Beach House Sport Amani Double time tank top-blurred flare, size 4 and Chandra Swim Shorts – beach solids size 4. On their website you will find different styles from bikinis to one pieces to more sport style swimsuits.
Not only do I love this style because of the comfort and material being lightweight & breathable but it is perfect for our early morning park dates and will be for the beach or pool or just to run errands in. The suit is also 50 SPF and as I mentioned before has a quick dry technology. If it wasn’t for Red-tide, Emma and I would be swimming in the water!

Toyota is the most successful brand in the 2014 TÜV Report for the fourth consecutive year. In the latest edition of the report released today by Germany’s leading technical inspection agency - TÜV, no less than 15 Toyota models were taking Top 10 positions and the Prius the number one spot in two categories for vehicles aged four to five years and six to seven years.
The Toyota Prius showed the lowest defect rate of the category of four-to five-year old vehicles and this year in the category of six-to seven-year old vehicles. The excellent performance of the Prius again underlines the high reliability of Toyota vehicles and of its hybrid drivetrain. Toyota vehicles age particularly well with Toyota dominating the categories for vehicles older than five years.
Toyota has already been leading previous year’s reports from TÜV. This renewed excellent performance provides further evidence of the high reliability and long-term durability of Toyota vehicles.
First published four decades ago, the annual report by the TÜV has become a helpful guide to customers by showing long-term reliability and overall quality of vehicles available on the market today.
The majority of all mandatory technical inspections in Germany are carried out through the various bodies of the TÜV organisation. The 2014 TÜV Report is based on some 8 million vehicles inspected by the TÜV between July 2012 and June 2013.

The Daily Telegraph reported on the laudable changes to the law that attempt to prevent paedophiles travelling overseas to rape and abuse children. Good story. But it’s not “sex” tourism. It’s rape and abuse tourism.
Children cannot have “sex”. Sex requires consent, children cannot legally or morally give consent so it is not sex. Rape, sexual abuse and sex are not the same thing and they can not be used interchangeably in headlines.
The victim impact statements from child abuse trials are harrowing, a testament to the lifelong injuries suffered by people who were sexually abused as children. They are the litany of drug addition, alcohol dependence, gambling problems, depression, crippling anxiety, relationship breakdowns, suicidal thoughts, shame, self-hatred, mistrust of others and long term emotional damage so common in survivors of child sexual abuse. Children who have been abused are also significantly more likely to suffer further abuse, both as children and as adults.
The effects of sexual abuse of children then lead to the cycle of horror where victims become unreliable witnesses to their own abuse.
When the media, as it so persistently does, labels sexual abuse of children as “child sex”, we are weakening the public understanding of the extent and effect of such abuse. This has serious effects. A study conducted for the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found that juries who have a better understanding of the facts of child sexual abuse are less likely to make mistakes in their assessment of evidence given in court.
Children cannot have sex with adults. Sex requires consent and children, by definition, cannot give consent, so it’s not sex. It’s rape, it’s child abuse, it’s sexual abuse, it’s any number of terms that accurately describe a crime. An act perpetrated on an innocent victim, someone who was unable to defend themselves from the violence done to them, and who suffers for years, possibly decades, from the trauma caused by an adult’s choice to commit that violence.
That word choice is the key. Sex is a choice made by every person involved. Rape and abuse are a choice made only by the perpetrator. The victim has no choice.
No child has ever chosen to be abused. No child has ever done anything that caused or incited abuse. No child has ever wanted to be abused. No child has ever willingly participated in their abuse. No child has ever been in any way responsible for abuses committed against them by adults.
Despite this, many abused children believe they are willing participants. It is tragically common for abusers to manipulate vulnerable children into thinking the abuse is something that makes them special. Because they are children, they don’t understand that it is abuse and they don’t know what their abuser is doing is wrong. They only know that it was a secret, that they were the special ones for that moment because they were manipulated by their abuser.
That belief can become so central to the abuse that it can stay with the victims well into adulthood.
This is the tragedy of abuse, that so many victims do feel responsible for what was done to them. The shame that belongs only to the abuser is taken on by the abused child and incorporated into their lifelong view of themselves and their worth as a person.
When we name abuse as “sex”, we imply victims had a choice. We tell them the violence someone else chose to do to them when they were a child is the same as sex they can choose to have as an adult.
Raping children is a horrific concept, we should feel a natural revulsion at the very idea. But we can’t protect vulnerable children or deter predators by diminishing the reality of sexual abuse. And we further damage survivors with the implication that the crimes committed against them are something less than a horrific and violent crime.
There are far, far too many of those victims. You could fill the MCG eight times over with the number of children living in Australia, right now, who have been or will be sexually abused. You could empty out Brisbane and entirely refill it with adults who have suffered sexual violence in their lifetime. All these people see headlines.
Sexual abuse is not sex. Children cannot have sex with adults. Stop calling it what it isn’t and start calling it what it is.
FixedIt is an ongoing project to push back against the media’s constant erasure of violent men and blaming of innocent victims. If you would like to help fund it – even $5 a month makes a big difference – please consider becoming a Patron

Jennifer Hudson and Kelly Clarkson are returning as coaches for Season 15 of The Voice in the fall, alongside Adam Levine and Blake Shelton.
Clarkson is currently a coach on the singing competition series. Hudson coached contestants in Season 13 and also appeared in two seasons of the British version of The Voice.
"We are so excited to welcome back Kelly and Jennifer, two dynamic forces who bring undeniable soul, passion and inspiration as coaches," Paul Telegdy, president of NBC Entertainment's alternative and reality group, said in a statement Thursday. "They each have a unique understanding of what it's like to be in the artists' shoes. Bringing these two voices together with Blake and Adam for Season 15 is sure to make this one of our best seasons yet!"
"Girls against the boys, y'all," Clarkson said in the clip. "Team J. Hud. Team KC. We're coming after you, Adam and Blake. We're friends, but we're future frenemies."
Hey everybody. You know all that anxiety that’s been building up? Well, just let it go and relax now, because the Fourth of July is here. The Great American Holiday. The one with the noise and the colors and the hot. Now, it is summer. That’s what the Fourth is. Not just the day we celebrate the anniversary of the birth of the best country in the history of the world but also the heart of the season of light.
No matter what the astronomers tell us, it’s not the solstice that signifies the beginning of our season of mayhem. Not in America. It’s 7/4, 13 days later, when kids run amuck while parents drink beer out of cans and fall off of patio furniture. When families squeeze into minivans and travel long distances to get into fights over the logistics of eating fries at Mickey D’s and burgers at the King.
It’s when the senses are heightened. The smell of cut grass, the grip of a pair of sneakers, the sound of children playing volleyball on the beach, the tickle of butter from a roasted cob of corn dripping all the way down your arm to the elbow. The thunk of a Frisbee on the back of the head. The piercing cry of a loved one as they discover sand in the bed.
It’s a holiday that transcends normal political persuasions; a frozen moment in time when white wine sipping, NPR listening, Prius driving, Birkenstock wearing hippies stand shoulder to shoulder with country western listening, pickup truck driving, cowboy boot wearing, Coors Lite chugging rednecks, both groups clutching tiny American flags in a small town square watching a parade of bicycles with red, white and blue bunting woven through the spokes.
It’s beauty queens waving from the back seats of convertibles. And kids swinging on a tire tied to a tree over the bank of a pond. Slip and slides. Burnt marshmallows. Not getting dark until nine. It’s people deciding that any piece of clothing they can squeeze into, fits.
It’s the loudest holiday as well with marching bands and fireworks and the sizzle of burger fat dripping on the coals. The tinny mantra of a baseball game on an AM radio, wafting down from a porch. Motorcycles revving down the highway in packs. Politicians barking new promises through old bullhorns.
Have yourself one heck of a terrific summer and make it last. Swim and swing and swoon. Take long walks on unfamiliar paths. Buy a new chaise lounge. Watch, or better yet, play a game of slow pitch softball. Char some flesh, either animal or your own or both.
Make sure you find time for a little bit of fun because it won’t be long before we’re back at each other’s throats. You know, like Thursday the 5th. The same day the back-to-school sales start and all the sports channels start promoting football.
And have a happy birthday America, you great- looking country, you. May be going through a tough patch here. But you know what they say; tough times never last, but tough countries do. And you probably hear this a lot but you still look pretty good considering you’re 242 years old. Could use a little work around the eyes. Then again, couldn’t we all.

Effective 2016, teachers in their third year of year participation are now eligible to apply for a one or two year program extension. This would allow for a maximum of five years participation. Upon program completion all teachers are expected to return to their home country to share their experiences of their time in the U.S. and must reside outside of the U.S. for a period of two years before they can return under another J Visa.

Herman Marmon of East Hanover knows very well that scammers try to take advantage of unsuspecting people, especially seniors.
So when Marmon, 77, became the target of a scam, he chose not to ignore it. He decided to see how far he could con the con-artists.
Last month, he received and email from someone claiming to represent Budweiser. The writer, “Davidson Boone,” said he wanted to “wrap” Marmon’s car in advertisements, and in return Marmon would get financial compensation.
A short time later, he received a nearly identical pitch from someone claiming to represent Samsung.
Boone: Do you have an existing checking account where you will deposit your check for letting our company use your car?
“Note you will receive a check/Money Order, which will cover your weekly up front payment of ($350) for carrying the advert on your car/truck and an additional sum which will be forwarded to the decal installer/expert who will be responsible for the advert placing on your car,” Boone said in the email.
“They did not have any idea what my car looked like,” Marmon said. “Never asked. Could have been a scooter or 18-Wheeler.”
“This has a very bad odor. No question about type of car. Very strange. Please explain,” Marmon wrote, and his offered his address to receive the payment.
Boone didn’t answer the question, but sent instructions with a FedEx tracking number for the check. Marmon should deposit the check and email Boone a copy of the deposit slip, Boone said.
“Once the funds is made available, you are required to hold on to your $350 weekly compensation for the service you are rendering (Flying Budweiser Logo),” Boone wrote. “Payment for subsequent weeks will be mailed out to you weekly. Kindly get back to us immediately [when] your payment is received, do check your email for further instruction to avoid any form of delay.”
Marmon tracked the package, but it never arrived, even though the tracking information said there was a delivery attempt. Marmon never received a door-tag from FedEx, which he said he always gets if a delivery attempt is unsuccessful.
He went to his local FedEx branch. The rep looked for the package and said it was returned to the shipper.
“I said, ‘Whoa, please read the tracking information,'” he said. “She left and returned a lot slower this time. Said the package had been returned to FedEx Security.”
“FedEx refused to deliver your package and it is being handled by FedEx Security. It is being returned to sender,” he wrote. “Hope for your sake that there are not any law enforcement people showing up with the .5 lb box.”
Boone responded, this time with a tracking number for a USPS package that contained a $1,950 check, and he apologized for the delay.
Boone asked if the check had been deposited, and Marmon lied and said yes. Boone asked when the funds would be available and for the balance of Marmon’s account.
Boone: Go to any Walmart around you and tell them you want to buy greendot moneypak. Do you have any Walmart around you?
Marmon: Davidson, this has been a real pain. Western Union wanted to know why and where I was sending the 1650.00. They told me it was a SCAM and I should keep ALL the money you sent me. So I am going to keep it all. Thank you for the money. Herman P.S. The bank said there was no account with number on the check.
Marmon: She did. I kept a copy of deposited check and when I got home I called the Chemung Canal Trust Company in Elmira, NY and asked them if account 235512753 had been issued and “OFFICIAL CHECK” # 100075481 on 9/17/2014. I was told No! DON’T TRY TO CASH IT. THIS IS A SCAM!! What say you now, Mr. Davidson Boone?
Marmon said he played along to cost the scammers as much time and money as he could, plus to possibly build a case for law enforcement.
“I called Bamboozled wanting to warn as many people as possible to remember, ‘If something seems too good to be true, it probably, and most likely, is,’” Marmon said.
We need to implement certain selected keywords in our website optimization process in order to get targeted web site traffic. Let’s consider we have already discovered those keywords and now we want to use them for optimizing our site. We needs to see what changes should be applied to the site where such traffic is supposed to arrive.
The page we choose to receive the visitors is our landing page. It should be optimized for search engines so that it receives the type of targeted traffic we are looking for. In addition to the fact that it is vitally important to have a search engine friendly site as a whole, such a landing page should be double checked for such compliance with the major search engines.
Also the site shouldn’t have been using any illegitimate methods or violating the best practices of search engine optimization so that landing page improvement could lead us to obtain what we intend to achieve.
Now, at this stage of website optimization, we should enhance the landing page by using the keyphrase selected during the initial keyword research explained at the previous article (1 of 3). Then, such keyphrase should be used at the title tag, alt tag, meta description and meta keywords, and headings 1, 2 and 3 of the page. Of course, if the keyphrase is used in the internal linking structure of the site, it could be very helpful for our purpose as well.
Well, most importantly, the page textual content should contain this phrase in a moderate manner in particular spots like the beginning of the page, the end of the page as well as the middle of the content. We shouldn’t stuff the page with repetitive phrases. One way to avoid this is to use synonyms or other parts of speech if possible.
To get targeted web site traffic, you need to know how to write your copy that both attracts human beings and search engines (website optimization). Peoples should not feel that it’s a meaningless repetitive accumulation of sentences that doesn’t talk to their hearts. Engines shouldn’t sense that it is a bunch of sentences stuffed with the same phrase trying to spam them or it the keyphrase lacks enough weight.
Therefore, delicate professional skill is required to write such copies. That is why a new guild of writers has emerged since the Internet and search engine rules have come to existence. These are the people who are specialized to get targeted website traffic to your pages using the keywords you supply to them. Of course, their work will be completed by other measures earlier explained at this article. Without optimizing the page source code, it will not be very likely to attract the same type of visitors you want to see at your site.
Well, the answer is negative. Search engine optimization performs two series of methods to help a site get targeted web site traffic. They are called website optimization process or on-page SEO. There is a more important series of methods that are done outside your site, which are called off-page SEO.
Many SEO experts are working specifically to help their clients by increasing their link popularity, which is achieved through various methods like article marketing, press release marketing, etc. But, without an initial website optimization, off-page SEO cannot deliver its best results.
Site Booster helps you get targeted web site traffic through its website optimization services. Learn more at: http://www.site-booster.com.
Facebook has taken the wraps off Facebook Places, its location-based service for mobile phones. It follows the principle popularised by Foursquare of checking in to locations, and is accessible via the Facebook HTML5 mobile site (touch.facebook.com) or via the Facebook iPhone app.
The long and illustrious history of moving pictures all started with the zoetrope. Then there was the thaumatrope, the flip book, and my personal favorite, the phenakistoscope. And now we have (drumroll please): The Internet.
People have been excited about moving pictures for ages. But achieving a passable animation has never been as easy or required as little talent as it does today.
Previously, we made some suggestions for sites where you can get your webcomic on. This week, we’re bringing you five excellent ways to tackle animation, the next step in your pseudo-artistic journey.
For animators who would rather put in a little time rather than settle for a mediocre movie, GoAnimate is the way to go. The site offers enough customization to fully express creative genius, but it’s easy enough to master without any actual animation or technical skills.
For almost every component, the website offers a choice between complete customization and a library of already configured objects. Users can either choose a character or make a completely customized one; they can choose a soundtrack or upload one; they can have the computer speak the dialogue or record it themselves. All of these components are laid out visually on an easy-to-navigate timeline.
There’s also an interesting community feature similar to many social media sites. Users can collect followers, earn badges and send messages to one another. Personal dashboards track how many people view your animation, which is way more fun than feeling like you’re sending your brilliant clip into cyber thin air.
Devolver streamlines the animation process into a quick, six-step multiple choice project. Choose your background, characters and one of four plots; type in some dialog; choose some music; and — voila! — you have an animated movie. Despite the extremely limited customization options, it’s actually not a bad looking cartoon.
It’s quick to e-mail your animation to a friend, but they will need to visit the Devolver site in order to watch the movie and there’s no option to download. This aspect, paired with the fact that the dialog is really the only thing you can customize, makes this site more like a more exciting way to send an e-mail message than an actual animation; much like a customized e-card. Still, there are a bunch of situations that could warrant this of animation — an inside joke, a prom date request… a marriage proposal.
Instead of assigning actions to characters via a drop-down menu, Animasher users just hit a record button. Any movement that they create by dragging and dropping the images will be played back. Animators can compile multiple scenes of these moving images to complete a story.
It’s a pretty painless way to make a movie, but there are some drawbacks. The images move but aren’t actually animated, so it’s difficult to accomplish changing expressions. As a result, the animation comes out looking more like a puppet show than a movie.
Some tools that make the site more interesting are the ability to add your own images, record dialog with a microphone and add video clips. If you like the scrapbook-like look and process, there aren’t any better, free options out there without downloading or having actual software knowledge.
As far as visual quality goes, this site is impressive (which is probably the cause of the slow preview load times). The workspace is a little different than the other animation sites mentioned in this article. All character movement, sound bytes, expressions and gestures are added directly into the script where you type the dialog.
Unfortunately, the site’s options for free use are limited. Sarah Palin is one of two default characters in the “Starz” theme, for instance, but any other choices require cash commitment before you’re able to publish your animation. The same is true for “premium objects,” like different backgrounds that you’re able to preview but not publish, unless you pay. As evidenced by the site’s YouTube channel, there are definitely opportunities to makes some pretty cool movies, but the free version seems limited.
You can’t create much of a story with Voki, but you can create an animated speaking avatar. The site is extremely easy to use. Just choose a character base (choices range from Uncle Sam to classic normal-looking people), adjust the background and colors, and add a voice. To put words in your avatar’s mouth, you can either call a number and leave a message, type out a greeting and let the computer generate a voice with the accent of your choice, or record a message with your computer’s microphone. When you’re finished, you can embed the code in your website or e-mail your message to a friend.
Remember those choose your-own-adventure novels? This animation site applies the same concept to short cartoons. The site partners with Teletoon, a Canadian animation channel, to give children a starter in animation.
The site challenges you to use its animation tool to finish the stories, which chronicle the adventures of siblings Eva and Edgar. The best finished stories are then recorded by voice actors and turned into TV spots.
Which site was your favorite? What animation sites do you use? What features would you love to see in sites like these? Let us know in the comments!

The bedroom is very small. There’s barely enough space in here for the basic furniture pieces and the bed takes up most of the floor space. Even so, it doesn’t really feel that tiny. That’s partially because the room has a high ceiling which is emphasized by the long curtains.
The living room is also a dining room and it’s very large and airy. It has white walls and oak parquet flooring. The living room is also connected to the balcony that can be used as an extra room during warm months. The bedroom has large windows overlooking the courtyard and it’s spacious enough to accommodate a double bed and an office, reading corner or workspace. Overall, this is a vintage-modern apartment, very cozy and inviting.

{note} We attempt to document every possible breaking change. Since some of these breaking changes are in obscure parts of the framework only a portion of these changes may actually affect your application.
Update your laravel/framework dependency to 5.4.* in your composer.json file. In addition, you should update your phpunit/phpunit dependency to ~5.7.
If it exists, you may delete the bootstrap/cache/compiled.php file. It is no longer used by the framework.
After upgrading all packages, you should run php artisan view:clear to avoid Blade errors related to the removal of Illuminate\View\Factory::getFirstLoop(). In addition, you may need to run php artisan route:clear to flush the route cache.
Laravel Passport 2.0.0 has been released to provide compatibility with Laravel 5.4 and the Axios JavaScript library. If you are upgrading from Laravel 5.3 and using the pre-built Passport Vue components, you should make sure the Axios library is globally available to your application as axios.
In order to continue using the tinker Artisan command, you should also install the laravel/tinker package:
Previous, when calling the Gate::getPolicyFor($class) method, an exception was thrown if no policy could be found. Now, the method will return null if no policy is found for the given class. If you call this method directly, make sure you refactor your code to check for null:
If you would like to render unescaped content in a section, you must declare the section using the traditional "long form" style:
When defining channel name placeholders in Laravel 5.3, the * character is used. In Laravel 5.4, you should define these placeholders using {foo} style placeholders, like routes:
The behavior of the every method has been moved to the nth method to match the method name defined by Lodash.
In previous Laravel releases, you could pass an array as the first parameter to the bind or instance methods to register an alias:
However, this behavior has been removed in Laravel 5.4. To register an alias, you should now use the alias method:
Binding classes into the container with leading slashes is no longer supported. This feature required a significant amount of string formatting calls to be made within the container. Instead, simply register your bindings without a leading slash:
The container's make method no longer accepts a second array of parameters. This feature typically indicates a code smell. Typically, you can always construct the object in another way that is more intuitive.
The container's resolving and afterResolving method now must be provided a class name or binding key as the first argument to the method:
The share method has been removed from the container. This was a legacy method that has not been documented in several years. If you are using this method, you should begin using the singleton method instead:
If you were previously binding a service container binding for a db.connection.{driver-name} key in order to resolve a custom database connection instance, you should now use the Illuminate\Database\Connection::resolverFor method in the register method of your AppServiceProvider:
Laravel no longer includes the ability to customize the PDO "fetch mode" from your configuration files. Instead, PDO::FETCH_OBJ is always used. If you would still like to customize the fetch mode for your application you may listen for the new Illuminate\Database\Events\StatementPrepared event:
The date cast now converts the column to a Carbon object and calls the startOfDay method on the object. If you would like to preserve the time portion of the date, you should use the datetime cast.
Just like previous Laravel releases, this relationship will typically use user_id as the foreign key. However, the behavior could be different from previous releases if you are overriding the getKeyName method of the User model. For example:
When this is the case, Laravel will now respect your customization and determine the foreign key column name is user_key instead of user_id.
Related models will now use the same connection as the parent model. For example, if you execute a query like:
Eloquent will query the posts table on the example connection instead of the default database connection. If you want to read the posts relationship from the default connection, you should to explicitly set the model's connection to your application's default connection.
The query builder chunk method now requires an orderBy clause, which provides consistency with the each method. An exception will be thrown if an orderBy clause is not supplied. For example:
The Model::create & Model::forceCreate methods have been moved to the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder class in order to provide better support for creating models on multiple connections. However, if you are extending these methods in your own models, you will need to modify your implementation to call the create method on the builder. For example:
If you are currently passing a custom connection name to this method, you should now use the on method:
The Model::hydrateRaw method has been renamed to fromQuery. If you are passing a custom connection name to this method, you should now use the on method:
Calling factory(User::class, 1)->make() or factory(User::class, 1)->create() will now return a collection with one item. Previously, this would return a single model. This method will only return a single model if the amount is not supplied.
If you are manually implementing the Illuminate\Contracts\Events\Dispatcher interface in your application or package, you should rename the fire method to dispatch.
Support for event handler "priorities" has been removed. This undocumented feature typically indicates an abuse of the event feature. Instead, consider using a series of synchronous method calls. Alternatively, you may dispatch a new event from within the handler of another event in order to ensure that a given event's handler fires after an unrelated handler.
Wildcard event handlers now receive the event name as their first argument and the array of event data as their second argument. The Event::firing method has been removed:
The locale.changed event is now an object based event using the Illuminate\Foundation\Events\LocaleUpdated class.
The illuminate.log event is now an object based event using the Illuminate\Log\Events\MessageLogged class.
In order to provide support for Laravel 5.4's new Markdown mail components, you should add the following block of configuration to the bottom of your mail configuration file:
The middleware method of the Illuminate\Routing\Router class has been renamed to aliasMiddleware(). It is likely that most applications never call this method manually, as it is typically only called by the HTTP kernel to register route-level middleware defined in the $routeMiddleware array.
The getUri method of the Illuminate\Routing\Route class has been removed. You should use the uri method instead.
The getMethods method of the Illuminate\Routing\Route class has been removed. You should use the methods method instead.
The getPath method of the Illuminate\Routing\Route class has been removed. You should use the uri method instead.
Laravel's session handlers no longer implements Symfony's SessionInterface. Implementing this interface required us to implement extraneous features that were not needed by the framework. Instead, a new Illuminate\Contracts\Session\Session interface has been defined and may be used instead. The following code changes should also be applied:
All calls to the ->set() method should be changed to ->put(). Typically, Laravel applications would never call the set method since it has never been documented within the Laravel documentation. However, it is included here out of caution.
Laravel 5.4's testing layer has been re-written to be simpler and lighter out of the box. If you would like to continue using the testing layer present in Laravel 5.3, you may install the laravel/browser-kit-testing package into your application. This package provides full compatibility with the Laravel 5.3 testing layer. In fact, you can run the Laravel 5.4 testing layer side-by-side with the Laravel 5.3 testing layer.
Once the package has been installed, create a copy of your tests/TestCase.php file and save it to your tests directory as BrowserKitTestCase.php. Then, modify the file to extend the Laravel\BrowserKitTesting\TestCase class. Once you have done this, you should have two base test classes in your tests directory: TestCase.php and BrowserKitTestCase.php. In order for your BrowserKitTestCase class to be properly loaded, you may need to add it to your composer.json file:
Once you have created this class, make sure to update all of your tests to extend your new BrowserKitTestCase class. This will allow all of your tests written on Laravel 5.3 to continue running on Laravel 5.4. If you choose, you can slowly begin to port them over to the new Laravel 5.4 test syntax or Laravel Dusk.
{note} If you are writing new tests and want them to use the Laravel 5.4 testing layer, make sure to extend the TestCase class.
If you would like to install Laravel Dusk into an application that has been upgraded from Laravel 5.3, first install it via Composer:
Next, you will need to create a CreatesApplication trait in your tests directory. This trait is responsible for creating fresh application instances for test cases. The trait should look like the following:
Once you have completed these preparatory steps, you can follow the normal Dusk installation instructions.
The Event fake's assertFired method should be updated to assertDispatched, and the assertNotFired method should be updated to assertNotDispatched. The method's signatures have not been changed.
The Mail fake has been greatly simplified for the Laravel 5.4 release. Instead of using the assertSentTo method, you should now simply use the assertSent method and utilize the hasTo, hasCc, etc. helper methods within your callback:
If you are using the {Inf} placeholder for pluralizing your translation strings, you should update your translation strings to use the * character instead:
The trans helper signature has been updated to remove the unnecessary $domain argument. The new signature is as follows:
The forceSchema method of the Illuminate\Routing\UrlGenerator class has been renamed to forceScheme.
Date format validation is now more strict and supports the placeholders present within the documentation for the PHP date function. In previous releases of Laravel, the timezone placeholder P would accept all timezone formats; however, in Laravel 5.4 each timezone format has a unique placeholder as per the PHP documentation.
The addError method has been renamed to addFailure. In addition, the doReplacements method has been renamed to makeReplacements. Typically, these changes will only be relevant if you are extending the Validator class.
We also encourage you to view the changes in the laravel/laravel GitHub repository. While many of these changes are not required, you may wish to keep these files in sync with your application. Some of these changes will be covered in this upgrade guide, but others, such as changes to configuration files or comments, will not be. You can easily view the changes with the GitHub comparison tool and choose which updates are important to you.
We broadcast, you decide. JB is a democratic broadcaster, seeking for the truth from a bilateral, fair perspective.
Today, let's talk about the "controversial" Yasukuni Shrine. Have you ever heard of it?! Well, my fellow Samurai Justin Bieber visited there recently. What's interesting, as Mr Beiber had done, the Yasukuni today is a major "tourist attraction" for many foreign tourists, including the Chinese.
Then, why do they visit?! - if they ARE actually indoctrinated by their government (PRC)’s smear campaign against pre-war Japan?!
The answer is, to my knowledge is that the Chinese nationals are pretty much skeptical over their autocratic PRC’s unilateral argument. But instead, although some may hold grudge against our ancestors, quite a few of them still do have a place in their hearts to mourn the souls of the war dead who dedicated their lives for their beloved nation.
There are heaps of misunderstanding globally regarding this shrine. Of course, Beiber did not have the slightest need to succumb to the anti-Tokyo Chinese-Korean activists and "go down on his knees". I'll explain why.
Western corporate medias as well as Beijing Communist Party mouthpiece "China Daily" and Xinhua today enjoy demonizing the Yasukuni - to meet its political ends, claiming that it is an evil spirited "Spooky Voldemort Castle" where the so called the war criminals are "buried".
1. First of all, in Shintoism, you do not "bury" the dead. Instead their souls are ENSHRINED. Tombs do not exist. Foreign correspondents often never do their homework unfortunately, and tries to see things from a western stereotype which is pretty much misleading.
2. Why would over five million people (5 million) visit the Yasukuni annually, if the place is "evil" ?! It simply does not make sense. We've got to bear in mind that the Kamikaze fighters were merely 20 years of age during WW2, and that we the Japanese as well as foreign visitors go to the Yasukuni to pay respect for his courage and dedication.
3. Established in 1869, the Yasukuni enshrines the souls of the 2.46 million Japanese, including women who died while serving for the military-volunteer corps (in places such as the bloody battlefield of Okinawa). Heroes of Sino-Japanese war (1894 - 95), Russo - Japanese war (1904), World War 1 (1914 - 1918) as well as WW2 -"Battle of Peleliu" (1944)sleep in peace in the Yasukuni.
4. Talking about the so called the “WAR CRIMINALS” - Personally, I do not condone everything the Imperial Japanese Army did during the war. And my coherent stance was, and still is that it is highly irresponsible for the Japanese nationals to put a total blame on then PM Hideki Tojo, Foreign Minister Koki Hirota and their ‘friends’ - because the majority of the public were infatuated with the military-led government during the war.
5. Besides, it was hilariously and blatantly hypocritical for the U.S McArthur led “Victors” to label Tojo and other 28 former leaders as “WAR CRIMINALS”. If Prime Minister Tojo was to be an indisputable war criminal against ‘Peace’ or ‘Humanity’ - then what about Theodore Roosevelt who dropped 2 A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki massacring over 210,000 innocent women and children instantly?!
We got to bear in mind that thousands died of radiation sickness in the years to come, totaling the casualties to somewhere between 400,000 to 500,000.
6. Lastly, in the history of mankind there had never been a case where the victors would put the vanquished on a trial until after WW2. While Stalin led Soviets had kidnapped 600,000 Japanese to freezing Siberia to build a railway ‘after' Tokyo’s surrender - the victors never questioned that Russian“Crime against Humanity” that resulted in the deaths of approximately 60,000 men.
What’s more appalling, the a U.S.S.R sent one of the 11 judges to the Tokyo trial (1946 -48) that labelled the 28 former Japanese leaders as an “A Class war criminal” - turning a blind eye to its own atrocities.
That being said, the stereotype“Yasukuni enshrines war criminals so never go” narrative is not only hypocritical and blatantly double standard but simply unconvincing.
And it also explains why more than 5 million people, mostly Japanese visit the holy shrine annually, to mourn the souls of those who paid ultimate sacrifices for their beloved nation.
Just think for a minute ladies and gentlemen, isn’t it a universal right for any citizen worldwide to commemorate those who sacrificed their lives for their country? Americans visit the Arlington, the Australians visit the "Australian War Memorial" and the Japanese visit the Yasukuni. And just as a reminder, the shrine is nowhere near a "Dark Evil Voldemort Shrine" often depicted by Chinese state run media- propagandas, but in fact also a jolly place. Yasukuni Shrine Mitama Festival - Way of enjoying guide will tell you why.
I go to the Yasukuni on a Tozai line subway, Kudanshita station to pray for world peace. And so do the others.

Many credit card holders aspire for a higher credit card limit. The obvious reason for this is that a higher credit card limit enables the purchase of otherwise unaffordable merchandise.
First and foremost, credit card holders need to remember that to get a higher credit card limit, they must abide by the terms and conditions of the credit card company or bank.
• The most important thing to do for getting a higher credit card limit is to prove your credit worthiness. This is the first thing that banks and companies look for when giving a higher credit limit.
• Attract positive attention from the credit card company or bank by paying finance charges once in a while. Obviously, this is not advisable on a repeating basis and should only be used as a last resort to increase your chances of getting a higher credit limit.
Proving to credit card companies and banks that you are good "borrower" can be a convincing way to get a higher credit limit. But be careful because this strategy also means that you will be paying finance charges which can accumulate in a hurry.
And always remember, a higher credit card limit means greater purchasing power, but it also increases the risk of your having to pay greater interest charges and other processing and late fees.
• Always spend within your credit card limit because doing so means that you are capable of controlling your expenses.
• Use your credit cards regularly. Don’t keep your cards for emergency use only. If you use your credit cards sparingly, banks and credit card companies will be unable to understand your spending and pay-back behavior. Under these circumstances, most banks and credit card companies will be reluctant to give you a higher credit card limit.
• Never make minimum payments. Instead, try to pay for the entire outstanding amount. This will usually give you a better chance of getting a higher credit card limit.
• Avoid late payments as much as possible. Not only will your increase payment increase, but you may also have to pay an additional fine for not clearing bills on time. This will also dim your chances of getting a higher credit card limit.
• The best and simplest strategy for getting a higher credit card limit is to use your credit card wisely. Always keep in mind that credit card companies keep a record of your transactions and payment patterns, so always pay on-time.
The bottom line is that your performance in the records of banks and credit card companies will determine whether you’ll get a higher credit card limit or not.

The party may soon be over at the nightclub made famous by “Jersey Shore,” with its last call potentially coming from a superior court judge.
Seaside Heights officials said they will seek an injunction to shut down Karma nightclub because of alleged violations of borough ordinances, most notably the lack of a restaurant on the premises, which is required as a condition of Karma’s liquor license.
Jean Cipriani, the borough attorney, has been instructed to “seek an emergency injunction against the operator of Karma nightclub preventing the nightclub from continuing to operate.”
The nightclub, located at 401 Boulevard, is already for sale, with the property being marketed toward residential developers. It is owned by John Saddy, who also owns the nearby Bamboo nightclub, which is also for sale. Saddy is facing additional legal troubles over his stake in the former Merge nightclub property, which could be subject to demolition after being left largely abandoned and deteriorating for the last six years.
At the heart of Seaside Heights’ case for the injunction are a number of issues that are alleged to have surfaced over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, including six drug overdoses and underage drinking citations. But the legal reasoning surrounds the liquor license. In order to operate, the Karma property must also have a restaurant on premises. This spring, Savor restaurant, which was located on the opposite end of the property from the nightclub, announced it was closing. Sources have told Shorebeat the restaurant closed after Saddy was unwilling to offer its owner a formal lease. Without the restaurant portion, officials charge, the nightclub portion is operating illegally – outside the bounds of the restrictions on its license.
A borough ordinance allows nightclubs on the Boulevard to operate “only with on-premises restaurant facilities ‘whose primary purpose is to regularly and principally provide restaurant meals to the public as an integral part of the operation,'” Borough Administrator Christopher Vaz wrote.
“The operator of Karma recently announced its opening on Memorial Day weekend as a nightclub through social media with a dance party on Saturday night and a Hyperglow party scheduled for Sunday,” Vaz said.
There was no immediate reaction to the borough’s announcement, but the nightclub posted a message thanking first responders for their service over the holiday weekend.
“Memorial Day Weekend was amazing and we never wanted it to end!” a Facebook post said. “Thank You to our wonderful team of EMT’s, licensed security, crowd managers, and event organizers for providing a secure event. We look forward to bringing you more in the near future!”

1. Protecting personal data and other confidential/sensitive information from security breaches is an important requirement that we need to assure. On the other hand, proper management of the keys for deciphering encrypted data under protection generally would involve considerable extra effort and inconvenience. In tackling this problem, ITS is now implementing a new Information Rights Management (“IRM”) solution so as to facilitate departments and individual staff members in mitigating the risks of information leakage in the processes of email exchange, and document retention and sharing.
2.The IRM solution provides the information owner the following controls of the information (through encryption) so that it will only be accessible by the designated persons in restricted ways:
3. Professoriate staff and other staff members who are on Band E or above (or equivalent) are initially assigned the licenses so that they can use the IRM service readily from now. (The IRM usage settings for those colleagues who do not use the service from now until end of May 2017 will be nullified and the associated licenses will then be reclaimed.) The IRM usage settings for other staff members would be enabled upon requests of their departments/offices on need basis.
4. A staff member using the IRM service should ensure that the following prerequisites are met, in addition to the eligibility as stated in (3):
using PCs installed with RMS sharing application (or mobile phones installed with Azure Information Protection Viewer ("AIP Viewer App"))
*Important Note: The IRM service that we are implementing does not support the use of public email accounts, such as those of @gmail.com or @yahoo.com. It is therefore recommended to confine the use of the IRM service for document exchange/sharing among staff members of the University.
5. Full features of the IRM service are supported on Windows platform. The features supported on the Macintosh and iOS/Android mobile phone platforms are generally limited to viewing of the protected documents.
6. From now to June 2017, we have scheduled a number of training workshops to help staff members in understanding the IRM service and its usage, as shown below. I would be obliged if you would help in drawing the attention of your staff to participate in any of the sessions.
7. Upon request, we are happy to arrange separate training sessions for departments which are prepared to deploy the IRM solution across their staff members for improved information/data protection.

Considered by many to be among the greatest works of political philosophy, especially in the English language, "Leviathan" is Hobbes' book, published in 1651, which outlines his theories on an ideal state and its creation. The structure of a society and a legitimate government, as he reasons, is perhaps the earliest example of social contract theory, which outlines the need of rule by an absolute sovereign. In Hobbes' time, the political and social structures of England were in a changing and uncertain state, which explains to some extent his ideas on the need of a strong central government in the face of a chaotic civil war. Hobbes believes that the prospect of peace this system would provide is worth giving up some of the natural freedom of man, who is essentially a being of individual fears and desires. This brings about his discussion of dissident forces, which threaten the commonwealth, itself the monstrous Leviathan at risk of war. A continually challenging work with reasoning that has stood the test of time, "Leviathan" has in some part contributed to the advancement of the modern world
This presentation explores the social and political turmoil during which Leviathan was written, including an examination of the radical political philosophies spawned by opposition to the Stuart monarchy in England. It explains the materialistic foundation of Hobbes' philosophy and how this influenced his theory of man, society, and government. Special attention is paid to Hobbes' theory of the "state of nature", the social contract, and the governmental sovereignty. The right of resistance against unjust laws and the right to liberty of conscience are also discussed

The work is illustration…I tell stories about time and our natural and human environment using familiar images and materials in unfamiliar juxtapositions creating illusion of concepts we think we know. The present, that fleeting moment between memory and anticipation and the relation of all three to what we perceive to be reality feeds the concepts for the stories.
Glass, bones, cast body parts are pieces of the whole. They are artifacts/relics of lives once lived and/or ingredients for animistic objects yet to come.
The use of glass speaks to the duality of our lives, relations of thoughts to actions. Glass is an architectural building material with both properties of strength and vulnerability, protecting and revealing simultaneously. The reflection and transparency create play with light giving the work an animism that invites the viewer to explore the dualities expressed by glass of beauty/danger, security/vulnerability, voyeurism/participation. With layering of the materials, images, and forms, the work tells stories of relations of generations of human and natural worlds and our dependence on and struggle with each other throughout time.

Welcome to VCU Blogs. This is your first post. Before you start start blogging, check out an overview of the basic blog set-up.
Encoders are devices for measuring the rotation of a spinning shaft. Encoders are typically used to measure the distance a wheel has turned which can be translated into the distance the robot has traveled. The distance traveled over a measured period of time represents the speed of the robot, and is another common use for encoders. Encoders can also directly measure the rate of rotation by determining the time between pulses. This article covers the use of quadrature encoders (defined below) For non-quadrature incremental encoders, see the article on counters. For absolute encoders the appropriate article will depend on the input type (most commonly analog, I2C or SPI).
A quadrature encoder is a device for measuring shaft rotation that consists of two sensing elements 90 degrees out of phase. The most common type of encoder typically used in FRC is an optical encoder which uses one or more light sources (LEDs) pointed at a striped or slit code wheel and two detectors 90 degrees apart (these may be located opposite the LED to detect transmission or on the same side as the LED to measure reflection). The phase difference between the signals can be used to detect the direction of rotation by determining which signal is "leading" the other.
The FRC FPGA has 8 Quadrature decoder modules which can do 4x decoding of a 2 channel quadrature encoder signal. This means that the module is counting both the rising and falling edges of each pulse on each of the two channels to yield 4 ticks for every stripe on the codewheel. The quadrature decoder module is also capable of handling an index channel which is a feature on some encoders that outputs one pulse per revolution. The counter FPGA modules are used for 1x or 2x decoding where the rising or rising and falling edges of one channel are counted and the second channel is used to determine direction. In either case it is recommended to use the Encoder class for all quadrature encoders, the class will assign the appropriate FPGA module based on the encoding type you choose.
The encoder class has 3 sampling modes: 1x, 2x and 4x. The 1x and 2x mode count the rising or the rising and falling edges respectively on a single channel and use the B channel to determine direction only. The 4x mode counts all 4 edges on both channels. This means that the 4x mode will have a higher positional accuracy (4 times as many ticks per rotation as 1x) but will also have more jitter in the rate output due to mechanical deficiencies (imperfect phase difference, imperfect striping) as well as running into the timing limits of the FPGA. For sensing rate, particularly at high RPM, using 1x or 2x decoding and increasing the number of samples to average may substantially help reduce jitter. Also keep in mind that the FPGA has 8 quadrature decoding modules (used for 4x decoding) and 8 counter modules (used for 1x and 2x decoding as well as Counter objects).
There are a number of constructors you may use to construct encoders, but the most common is shown above. In the example, 0 and 1 are the port numbers for the two digital inputs and false tells the encoder to not invert the counting direction. The sensed direction could depend on how the encoder is mounted relative to the shaft being measured. The k4X makes sure that an encoder module from the FPGA is used and 4X accuracy is obtained.
Max Period - The maximum period (in seconds) where the device is still considered moving. This value is used to determine the state of the getStopped() method and effect the output of the getPeriod() and getRate() methods. This is the time between pulses on an individual channel (scale factor is accounted for). It is recommended to use the Min Rate parameter instead as it accounts for the distance per pulse, allowing you to set the rate in engineering units.
Min Rate - Sets the minimum rate before the device is considered stopped. This compensates for both scale factor and distance per pulse and therefore should be entered in engineering units (RPM, RPS, Degrees/sec, In/s, etc)
Distance Per Pulse - Sets the scale factor between pulses and distance. The library already accounts for the decoding scale factor (1x, 2x, 4x) separately so this value should be set exclusively based on the encoder's Pulses per Revolution and any gearing following the encoder.
Samples to Average - Sets the number of samples to average when determining the period. Averaging may be desired to account for mechanical imperfections (such as unevenly spaced reflectors when using a reflective sensor as an encoder) or as oversampling to increase resolution. Valid values are 1 to 127 samples.
The encoder will begin counting as soon as it is created. To reset the encoder value to 0 call reset().
Distance - The current distance reading from the counter. This is the count multiplied by the Distance Per Count scale factor.
Period - The current period of the counter in seconds. If the counter is stopped this value may return 0. This is deprecated, it is recommended to use rate instead.
Rate - The current rate of the counter in units/sec. It is calculated using the DistancePerPulse divided by the period. If the counter is stopped this value may return Inf or NaN, depending on language.

Just wondered if anyone else here had bought the new Mario Golf for 3DS? Seems pretty good so far. Controls aren't quite as tight as Hot Shots but still the second best game of golf out there.
I agree that the controls are not as good as Hot Shots Golf. There are enough contents with season pass that is being offered. 4 full courses and 6 9-hole courses as well as 6 downloadable course are decent. I really wish Hot Shots Golf will have enough courses for the next iteration.
Your Mii character as well as 10 others, I think. I bought the season pass as well. There are some wacky challenges.
I'd get this game if I had a 3DS. Maybe someday! This makes 3 games I'd get the system for (the Etrian Odyssey games being the other 2).

Termite exterminators are vital resources when trying to keep your house in the best possible shape, mostly because they can help mitigate or prevent any termite damage. Listed below are three ways that an exterminator can help you deal with termites before they can cause too much damage to your home.
A service that is often overlooked that most termite exterminators can provide is an annual inspection, which is a bit of a problem because an annual inspection can help ensure that you do not end up finding out you have termites throughout your home after the termites have already caused a lot of damage. The reason that this is a problem is that most signs of termite infestation do not really become visible to the untrained eye until after the infestation has already been in place for quite some time and the damage has already been done. However, if you have an exterminator come to your house once a year to perform a thorough termite inspection, you can greatly reduce the odds in your home will sustain termite damage.
A vital step to take in order to prevent and eliminate a termite infestation is to find any potential issues that can attract termites to your property. However, this can be quite difficult as the average homeowner is not likely to know what exactly termites are looking for and what attracts them, which is where an exterminator can be very helpful.
This is because the exterminator can look for such issues, such as excessive moisture near your foundation or numerous plants in close proximity to your home, that can often result in termites in your home. Once those issues have been identified by an exterminator, you can then take steps to resolve them in order to not only deal with the termites that are already in your home but to also help ensure that more termites do not show up in the future
Finally, an exterminator can help you deal with termites by utilizing numerous different extermination techniques in order to find one that is most effective for your particular breed of termite. This is extremely beneficial because what might work well for eliminating one particular type of termite may not be very effective for another type. Some of the techniques that an exterminator can utilize in order to deal with the termite infestation can include using heat or cold to kill off the colony or utilizing a number of different poisons and chemicals that are specifically designed to not only kill off the termites but also keep the termites away from the area for some time to come.
Speak with a local termite exterminator today in order to discuss the various ways in which that service can help you deal with the termites in and around your home. Termite exterminators can help you out by performing an annual inspection on your home, identifying issues that might attract termites to your property, and utilizing numerous different extermination techniques.
Your dogs and cats can bring pests into your home without you even knowing it. Once a few fleas catch a ride in the house, you may quickly find that those few fleas have turned into hundreds in no time. Fleas, along with other pests can quickly become a problem in your home if you don't learn how to identify and put a stop to the issue. My blog will show you how to identify the problems and tips for putting a stop to the spread of the infestation inside your home and in your yard where it all begins.

They reduced their suggested equity allocations to 65 percent, the lowest level since September 2015 and down from 70.6 percent a month earlier, according to a poll of eight China-based fund managers conducted this week.
The fund managers have boosted their suggested bond allocations for the coming three months to 15.6 percent from 10.6 percent.
They have also hiked recommended cash allocations to 19.4 percent from 18.8 percent in the previous month.
“The collapse of trade talks between China and the United States was beyond market expectations, while Beijing’s continued deleveraging campaign also aggravated already tight liquidity conditions in the market,” a South China-based fund manager said.
The deleveraging effort has driven up borrowing costs for businesses and slowed the economy, and the fear is that any turmoil in China’s markets could restrict Beijing’s ability to pump-prime the economy as it tries to mount a defense in the trade battle with Washington.
Overall, the fund managers surveyed held mixed views on asset allocations for the next month, with six recommending the same level of equity exposure, one suggesting an increase, while another one suggesting a cut.
According to the poll, average recommended allocations for consumer stocks in the next three months rose sharply, those for financial services shares also edged up, while those for most other sectors fell, indicating fund managers’ defensive stance as they “huddled together for warmth” in defensive plays including consumer firms.
For the month, average recommended allocations for consumer stocks leaped to 40.8 percent, the highest level since the launch of the poll in 2007, while those for finiancial stocks were raised to 11.5 percent from 11.9 percent a month earlier.

Earlier this week, we linked to a brief comment that Prof. Szalai posted in Outsourcing Justice regarding a decision the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued at the end of October. In that decision, Goodwin v. Branch Banking & Trust Co., 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 21629, the court applied West Virginia contract law to refuse to enforce an arbitration provision based on the unconscionableness of some of its provisions.
Alvin Goldman (Professor of Law Emeritus, University of Kentucky, NAA Member) writes to us with the following observation:
“According to the appellate court, WV law does not allow a party that imposed an unconscionable provision in a contract to waive it so that the rest of the contract can be enforced. In constitutional law the analog to this contention is known as the due process doctrine of void for over-breadth. The underlying rationale is that because the illegal portion of a statute (or regulation or executive decree) may chill the exercise of a protected right on the part of those who cannot afford to bring a legal challenge to its enforcement, or who do not want to expend the needed resources for litigation, the entire statute should be struck down. Thereby, the overbreadth doctrine deters legislatures, agencies and other law makers from trying to reach beyond their constitutional authority. Applying that reasoning to the law of contracts, the effect is to deter dominant parties from inserting unconscionable provisions when contracting with those who may be forced by circumstances (or ignorance) to abide by what should not have been in the contract in the first place.
In the linked blog, Prof. Szalai praised the appellate court for creating “good policy for courts when reviewing the fairness of arbitration clauses involving vulnerable parties.” That praise, I think, is premature inasmuch as the Fourth Circuit did not adopt the principle as part of the federal law of arbitration. Instead of applying this concept based on the applicable state law, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit could have gone a step further and adopted that result as a US Arbitration Act remedial principle in dealing with agreements that violate any applicable state’s contract law. Had it done so, I would agree with the professor’s praise.”

MEMORANDUM OF OBJECTS AND REASONS The concept of an Exclusive Economic Zone evolved as a result of the claims of certain States consequent on rapid technological advances in the mining of offshore mineral resources. This Zone sought to encompass, beyond the existing twelve miles territorial sea, an additional one hundred and eighty-eight miles from the seaward limit of the territorial sea. Jamaica, as a participant of conferences dealing with the Law of the Sea, has accepted that there is a need to protect the marine environment in such a Zone. Jamaica, having adopted the Convention on the Law of the Sea, now seeks, in the protection of her marine resources, to enact legislation to give effect to this and also to adhere to the provisions relating to an Exclusive Economic Zone contained in the Convention. Consequently this Bill seeks to: establish an Exclusive Economic Zone; (b) make provision for the manner in which exploration of and exploitation for the resources of the Zone may be carried out; (c) prescribe penalties for any breaches of the Act; (d) permit the making of regulations in relation to activities in the zone; and
17 Page 17 (e) make consequential amendments to other Acts. David Coore, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade A BILL Entitled An Act to Establish beyond the territorial sea a Zone to be known as the Exclusive Economic Zone and to provide for matters incidental thereto or connected therewith.

An emergency meeting of the Guardian Angels has been called. Christ is missing. It is surmised that he had made an unscheduled trip to modern-day Earth to participate in the Christmas celebration. However, no one has heard from him since, and this elite "Search and Rescue" squad has been dispatched to locate him.
It's just days before Christmas at Santa's Workshop, and there's still lots of work to be done - like getting the elves and reindeer in the proper holiday spirit with song, dance, and big belly laughs! Elf hosts Holly Daze and Mistletoe Merryman welcome judges Mrs. Claus, the pun-loving Ruby the Red-Lipped Reindeer, and Old St. Nick himself to judge the talent show in this reality TV spoof. Contestants Jack Frost and Snow Queen get a chilly reception at first, but even they can't take the warmth and good spirit out of this friendly competition!
Celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2018, "Sha la la Joseph you're doing fine! You and your dreamcoat ahead of your time!" One of the most enduring shows of all time, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is a reimagining of the Biblical story of Joseph, his father Jacob, eleven brothers and the coat of many colors.
The old fishing pier out on the end of Cypress Lake has just fallen under the magic of another Catfish Moon. It was the favorite hangout for three best friends when they were kids—skipping school, skinny dipping and even experiencing the mysteries of kissing girls. Now Curley, Gordon and Frog are older, and they have tasted the bitterness of life as well as the sweetness, and time has eroded the closeness between Frog and Gordon. The final straw comes when Frog discovers that Gordon is dating his ex-wife. Curley, the "big brother" of the bunch convinces Frog and Gordon to go on an overnight fishing trip like old times. On the pier, the weight of adulthood is lifted by laughter and their love of fishing, and the three guys discover that their friendship was never really lost. However, in the midst of catching the biggest fish of all time, life brings them back to a painful reality. In the end though they realize that life is too precious and too short to let true friendship get away.

The MLS Technology and Emerging Issues Subcommittee (TEIS) of NAR’s Multiple Listing Issues and Policies Committee is at it again. This group (and its previous iterations) has labored to sort out the issue of Broker A displaying Broker B’s listing in social media for years it seems (yup, I just checked my old files; I think it’s appropriate to pronounce the subcommittee’s acronym as “tease”). The efforts came to something of a head in May, when the NAR board adopted a policy change that effectively permitted IDX through mobile applications. I think that was great news: though I expect we’ll see problems of one kind or another with it over the coming months and years, I expect we can work them out.
Drop me a line if your MLS wants help sorting out how to implement the mobile app in IDX stuff. Generally, it requires slight changes to your data license agreement (you do require anyone who gets access to your data to sign one, right?) and rules.
But the MLIPC also directed the TEIS to try on social media again. Last week, the TEIS came out with its further recommendation. It’s based on feedback NAR received from the whole MLIPC and a conference call by the TEIS earlier this month. According to an NAR staffer’s summary, the feedback from the MLIPC over the summer reflected several tendencies of thought: First, there was not a consensus whether NAR policy should even address the display of listings outside of IDX and VOW. Some folks are hostile to the idea, and think that “display of other participants’ listings outside of VOW and IDX may result in overexposure, misappropriation of listing data, failure to attribute listing participants, and license law violations.” This is no doubt true, but it’s also true within IDX. Most MLSs make some effort to police for these problems in IDX; and it may be difficult to police social media sites in the same ways. So, for example, stale data and its consequences would likely be a more widespread problem in social media displays (or at least the ones I’ve seen described). Of course, there are other folks who strongly believe that “display of other participants’ listings outside of VOW or IDX will give greater exposure of listings to consumers, enhancing the possibility of quicker sales.”
Second, there is a consensus that there’s not a consensus on how to define what actually constitutes a “social media” site. I posted at length on this last year—no need to rehash here.
Third, there is a consensus that if there is a policy, it should be optional for the MLS and the listing participants; that is, each MLS can decide whether to adopt it, and each listing broker can decide whether her listings will be included in it.
The TEIS cleaved to these principles when it proposed the following new policy, which will be on the agenda in Orlando:
MLSs may but are not required to give participants the ability to authorize electronic display of their listings by other participants outside the context of the Internet Data Exchange (“IDX”) policy and rules and the Virtual Office Website (“VOW”) policy and rules.
Participants may not be required to consent to display or distribution of their listings through non-IDX and non-VOW channels as a condition of participation in MLS or as a condition of participation in IDX. Electronic display and distribution pursuant to this policy contemplates, but is not limited to, Short Message Services (“SMS”)/texting technologies, and interactive “social media”. All electronic displays and/or distribution of other participants’ listings conducted pursuant to this policy must comply with state law and regulations and applicable rules.
Displays addressed by this policy may be subject to technological limitations on disabling/discontinuing third-party comments/reviews, disabling/discontinuing automated displays of market value, “refreshing” displays on a periodic basis, and possibly other issues which should be taken into consideration when developing rules and policies governing such displays.
There’s nothing controversial here, unless you were hoping the TEIS would give your MLS a blueprint for how to do this. OK, so this is really just punting to the local organizations, but I don’t mind that, as the locals make good laboratories.
So, now we’re looking for an MLS or two burning to adopt this optional policy; we’d like to help sort out the complex of legal, operational, and technical issues. If the project works well, maybe NAR will adopt your approach as a model for the rest of its MLSs. We can have some fun with it in the meantime.
I’m really interested in comments from folks (a) who think that MLSs SHOULD adopt an approach like this and (b) who are willing to share specific concerns/reservations about the idea.
Doesn't the mandatory MLS model rule already cover the first point authorizing electronic display outside of IDX/VOW?
A listing shall not be advertised by any participant other than the listing broker without the prior consent of the listing broker. M
Great article and summary. Me wonders if the broker will be able to opt in or opt out on a listing by listing basis. Me also hopes that the default setting is opt out. Me also questions if the issue will die on the vine.
By the way, I was reminded that I neglected to say who I am and which MLS I refered to in my original comment. Paul Kriewall Project and Contract Manager for the Arizona Regional MLS.
@Paul: The answer is "sort of yes". But NAR adopted a change in May that allows display _within_ IDX but via media like mobile.
This new proposal would allow an MLS to create a new category of display, outside IDX, but similar in that listing brokers would be able to opt-out of it.

# Covered Call BREAKING DOWN ‘Covered Call’ The outlook of a covered call strategy is for a slight increase in the underlying stock price for the life of the short call option. Consequently, this strategy is not useful for a very bullish investor. A covered call serves as a short-term small hedge on a long stock position and allows investors to earn a credit. However, the investor forfeits the potential of the stock’s potential increase and is obligated to provide 100 shares to the buyer of the option if it is exercised.

The Verb of my late Father-in-law Mark Tiersma was Gratitude in all things. I am finding this a good season to practice this in the midst of chaos... and the sense that every day is a gift is gripping my soul in a deeper way than ever before.
I am glad that my friend who was homeless for a few days is now renting an appartment that he can afford.
I am glad to recieve art supplies from a stranger during a yard sale... just because what we are doing is something he wants to contribute to...
I am glad for the hawk I got to see up close... there is wild life in the city skies... and it is not only pigeons and crows (which are also cool to me).
I am glad for the generosity of friends who buy hats at yard sales ; ) and chose to pay much more than I ask for it... and how I was able to pass on this generosity to others...
I am glad for old interns who visit and find themselves right back in the mix... even if it is for a day -- Thanks Dan!
This Week has been about getting a friend out of harms way. We all have a past... and many of us wish we could change the realities of that past... We become tired at some point at hurting others and ourselves... and those of us who find God and work the 12 steps of AA / NA also seek to make amends whenever we can... but to do that we have to be safe and stay safe... Avoiding the people, places, and things that might hinder God's work in our hearts.
One of my friends this week chose to become homeless rather than take the path of violence... I respect that. We got to share our small home with him for a couple of days... Not enough room for 3 of us in our humble home...
We recovered as much of his stuff from his old appartment... and God ansewred our prayers quickly for a new home...
What others intended for evil God has worked out for our good to the glory of His name and praise -- Less rent in a safer environment.
We will by God's grace seek to live, love, and return only good for whatever comes our way, in order that we may become on the inside more like Christ -- Romans 8 and Ephesians 3:14-21.
Pray that our faith will become stronger having once again gotten tested. May we grow the seeds of love and grace that can sustain us and the coming generations. May God's peace rest on all that read this...
Norma called me this morning. Her son is in the hospital with a blod clot in his leg. She and her daughter both have the flu... and she is still recovering from her car accident. She so much wants life to get back to "normal". Her neighbors have poured out a tremendous amount of love in this season. She has not hardly had to cook a meal since her car accident. This is one of the strengths of our neighborhood -- its loving hospitality. She is very thankful to God for the many answers to prayer in the journey.
Kathy Henry also asks for prayer for a mystery illness... maybe caught in her sacrificail work at Clinica Oscar Romero... that is causing her considerable suffering and discomfort.
Saturday I had a very sucessful yard sale. We raised enough money to help 3 friends with thier living expenses. Pray for my formation of a business plan to start a thrift store. Also I hope to have more yard sales in the future. If you have stuff that you might like to contribute... let me know.
My friend Willie is currently living in a weekly rental hotel. He longs to be in a regular appartment by the new year. He is paying much more rent than Jude and I are to live in a space less than half than what we have... and we live in a small one bedroom apt. Prayer and any tangible help and support in this journey is welcome.
I have been looking back on my life. I have noticed that what I give myself too the most ... both in terms of passion, intention, and action... that is what I worship. I have found that a centered focus on God through Jesus Christ cause me to love deeply -- Ephessians 3:14-21. When I drift on this "Practices of the Presence of God", then the quality of my love drifts as well.
Some say that worship is easy... not for me... I get easily distracted from the main point of focuss... I have found that I need support in the journey... Fellowship, good supportive tools, Like Don Postama's Book "Space for God", and I need Music...
Today I am feeling a call back to worship. We can serve a lot of small and insignificant wants and desires... or we can worship with our lives the God who made us.
If you are worshipping God, then your love will grow and overflow... If you find yourself inwardly blocked and tied up somehow... figure out what has to change... You can not worship and then not love... without the meaning of your worship becoming hollow; You can not love with out drawing from the source of love -- That is the point of Worship.
I plan to spin The above worship songs tommorrow and to continue to reflect on this call in my heart.
Randa has just found out she has breast cancer. This means that she gets to stay with us longer... it also means that she has to wait on her dreams. And so it goes... Here are her own words and a mailing address where notes of encouragement can be sent ; )
I had intended this newsletter to be the one where I explain to you all the details of when I would be moving to India and what I would be doing there. I am learning once again that we are not in control of our lives and must rely on the Lord for wisdom for each day.
In my routine medical check-ups before leaving for India the doctors found breast cancer. Within 48 hours all my plans have changed. I have met with the surgeon and will be having a lumpectomy on November 24th (the day before Thanksgiving). After the surgery they are expecting 6 weeks of radiation and possibly chemotherapy (this depends upon what they find when they do the actual surgery). With this in mind I will be delaying my move to India.
My mom & two sisters will be coming for the surgery. They will stay with me until Nov. 30th. At that time I will move in with my friend (and also my boss), Sue Lloyd. I'll stay with Sue until I leave for India, which is tentatively set for late August at this point. Since I'll be able to work while getting the treatments the wisest decision seems to be to stay in LA and continue to work with InnerCHANGE.
I would appreciate your prayers. It looks like the cancer is contained in one mass and has not spread to the lymph nods. A lumpectomy will take only the mass and the surrounding tissue. They will also be doing a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy which means they will follow the path internally that the cancer would have traveled to my lymph nodes and take samples of these to check for cancer. If cancer hasn‚t infected these first few lymph nodes it will mean that it hasn‚t traveled outside of the immediate area.
I have always loved reading the Old Testament, especially the books of Israel‚s history. Many times Israel was surrounded by enemies who outnumbered them and the situation seemed impossible. Cancer is a huge "enemy" and from the first day of hearing that I had this disease I felt assured that the God of Israel is my Lord and Protector. He will fight this enemy and I will come out of this fight victorious. Prayer is the weapon that will conquer cancer and I would appreciate your joining me in this stand of faith in God‚s power to deliver me.
My Dad is in the hospital because what they thought was Cancer, adn then TB in the lungs is not acting like either... so he has moved into being a mystery diagnosis... and they are trying to figure it all out... Think Limbo.
My mother-in-law affectionately know as "MeM" or Arlene went to the hospital with an irregular heart beat. She is stressed out because her husband just recently passed away.
It is the little things that get to me... Today I went to pick up a donation for a yardsale on Sat. but the person who offered the donation was called away by her job and thus was unable to pass on the donations.
I heard a lecture today that talked about slavery and the Killing fields of the Sudan. Good content with hope in very dificult times... it made all my personal pain seem so petty... and yet I have to be real with God and not ignore my heart.
Got to go to a meeting this evening. Which is both good and bad. The hours won't be wasted... but tommorrow I think I need to spend some extra time in prayer.
My mindset was punctuated with the blues last night and I could not get to sleep because of a large "Ghetto Bird" (a Helicopter) buzzing arround our neighborhood until 2am in the morning. There was a "manhunt" going on looking for someone who had a gun... this also made parking impossible... and so it goes...
Growth comes from focussing and learning what is within our power and responsibility. That is part of what makes the "Serenity Prayer" such a helpful prayer.
My friend Mel is going to be sharing with a group of JR. high youth about Character growth and development. There are key ideas that I have found useful to point out to my younger friends that have helped them learn to make better choices...
I will be adding some of those comments as I think of them on my blog for her and others. Feel free in the comment section to add your own.
Growing on the inside is the most effective way to improve the quality of your life, because you live with yourself 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
The content and quality of our lives are built on the content and quality of our rleationships with God, ourselves, one another, and our environment.
There is pain in the process of learning, but the pain is worth it... Remember when you learned to ride a bicycle... the diziness, the falling, and the triumph... and anyone who has learned to ride a bicycle can ride further and faster than they can run...
Do you want to learn enough to choose what you want to do to make a living; or do you want to be doing what someone else tells you to do?
Timing is everything... Practice is a key way to be ready for the right momment and opportunity... Example... a great batter in baseball knows when and how to swing the bat... and it is not every day that the bases are loaded and you get to be at bat... Either you are ready or you are not...
Our capacity to Give and Recieve Love depends on our Maturity in Character (I Cor. 13, II Peter 1:3-11). There are no short cuts to growing in Character.
Poor communication skills will lead to a lonely life. Good communication skills will open the door to many friendships.
We are creating history every day by our choices. We Live with the history we create for ourselves and others for the rest of our lives. Learning to make good choices is key to having a good life.
Recently Jude went to visit her mom in Visalia. Her mom was ever so glad for her being there with her ... her car broke down three times while she was there.
As some of you know Norma -- who is close to our community -- had been out of work and on disability for months and had just gotten reassigned to a job she could do in the LA School System... and now her accident has her sidelined again... now in pain and seeking to continue to persue what God wants to bring through this... her car was totaled and she isn't sure where she is going to get the money for a new one...
Willie had his ATM and Pin Number Stolen and his Bank account cleaned out of the little that was in there... Yes we have corrected this but we are still working through the paper work... When it rains Willie can't eat at home because water leaks from the roof on to his electric stove.
In November/December the LA team is going to be lead through a community discernment process to set out on some new dreams together. We have come to a time of closure on some old ones... The Cambria Appartments for example (See our web-site)... are completely in the hands of the tennants and the non-profit corp they have started... and the board that they elect...
There have been an exponential increase in annoying events as we move towards this time... pray for God's guidance and peace in the midst of seeking what new things God would have us do.

I wanted to illuminate something on the island that is both private and very serene, but also very easy to pass by without much notice. As a disclaimer, I happen to find cemeteries very appealing for their inherent peacefulness and for the insight they provide into different cultures, so I tend to visit them when traveling. In recent years the Mustique Company set aside a plot of land on a gently sloping hill near the airport to serve as a permanent burial ground for the island’s natives and villa owners alike, should they chose it to be their final resting place. The cemetery is bordered with a hand-made, white fence along one side and by dense trees on the other three. So far the island has been fortunate to have lost very few from their community – there are only about seven plots which have been filled to date.
Graves are dug by the loved ones of the departed and a burial is followed with joyous celebration of life (and probably some local rum too!). Each grave is lovingly bordered with a small enclosure of poured concrete which creates a natural flower bed in the center and delineates the plot. Some are decorated with conch shells, which can be found in abundance on the island’s beaches. Each headstone is identical in size and style, putting everyone on a level plane. The stones appear to be made of poured concrete as well, which has debossed black lettering. In the end, they all exhibit a beautiful restrained simplicity.
As one would expect on an island, cemeteries eventually become very crowded. There is no way to expand when you’re surrounded by water. For many years cemeteries such as that in Venice, Italy have been placed on a system of rotation, where a family has access to a particular plot for a finite number of years, at which point the body is exhumed and the plot turned over to someone else. The cemeteries on St. Vincent are to a point of over crowding as well, though there there are frequently no markers, so one wouldn’t guess when visiting the cemetery. The Mustique Cemetery has provided some relief for this problem and a permanent final resting place for the island’s wonderful people.
Interestingly, another option is a burial at sea. One villa owner chose this route not too long ago, requesting everyone to wear white. The beach was flooded with loving bystanders who assisted in pushing the flotilla out to see.

Hey folks, been awhile since my last note letting folks know what was happening in the trucking business.
Well it’s not all bad. As most of you know the fuel price is slowly coming down, although not as fast as it went up, but still much better than it was. The drop, which is not as much as gas prices, still has a substantial effect on the bottom line. From a high of $4.89 per gallon to today’s current price of about $3.50, it is certainly a big savings when the average over the road truck will burn between 5-600 gallons a week. That’s the good news.
Now here is some of the not so pleasant news and a lot of the reason you will not see prices on commodities come down any time soon. Cost of operations skyrocketed as the price of fuel went out of sight, tires and parts to keep these rigs on the road increased nearly 50 percent as it takes oil to produce both rubber and steel.
As inventories had to be replaced prices skyrocketed due to oil increases. Now, one year later, after dealing with all the increases of doing business, the stock market crashes and takes with it any ideas people may have had of trying to increase their business. Not much building going on; the lumber business in Maine alone is off drastically. Has anyone been to a big box store, Lowes or Home Depot lately? Like a small ghost town when I was there recently! Folks, it’s not just here in Maine either. We have trucks traveling all over the eastern half of the country and the story is the same everywhere. No money, no work!
That all being said, let me fill you in on some the political stink that’s in the air. First, isn’t it nice that our Maine turnpike authority can just raise rates, 23 percent in fact, because they don’t have enough money to meet expenses? I feel their pain, believe me, but do you suppose they ever heard of cutting back on expenses? Maybe, just maybe, they could do without quite so many people standing on a shovel watching one man work. Or maybe they could stop riding up and down the turnpike plowing water 10 hours after the snow has passed and turned to rain. Oops, I forgot, that’s all overtime and we can’t cut that.
Or maybe, just maybe, turnpike officials could have their next cocktail party out in one of the luxury garages that they fix equipment in rather than at the Inn by the Bay for $4-5000, or cut out the trip to Italy to check out the European roads for twenty odd thousand bucks. It’s not a lot but $10,000 here and $10,000 there and pretty soon you’re talking real money! Seems to me like maybe we need to look at the budget of the turnpike a little closer before we just roll over and enjoy their 23 percent increase in tolls.
To put it in perspective, from Portland to York in an 18-wheeler will cost 80 cents a mile or $36 to go 44 miles, in tolls and road taxes. If that’s not enough, trucks can only use two out of the three lanes available; that’s two thirds, for full price! How’s that fair? Does one think that any of these hikes in cost will have a bearing on what goods will cost down the road a ways?
The Coalition to Lower Fuel Prices, which we formed last winter to help educate people on the ever escalating fuel cost has been asked to sit on a task force that is overseeing the fine structure here in Maine as it pertains to trucks. It is fairly common knowledge in the trucking business that we in Maine have one of the highest fine structures for violations in the country.
One of our members who runs a six axle truck, permitted for 100,000 lbs., was cited for being over weight by 2500 lbs. in Maine, and the fine was almost $900 dollars. Two weeks later he was stopped in New Hampshire and his permit had expired for 100,000 weight and they automatically go back to federal limit of 80,000 lbs, this made him over weight by almost 20,000 lbs., almost ten times as much as Maine: fine, 300 bucks! One might say just the cost of doing business. I would say “just one more thing that makes Maine anti-business!”
Well enough of the ranting, Our coalition has found a lot of work to do to improve the trucking climate in the state, and the dialogue that was developed last winter and spring with the Governor and legislature surely will be beneficial in dealing with all the politics involved.
I thank all of those who have supported us. Your words of encouragement were priceless in our battle with state and federal officials. Till next time, God bless and keep on truckin’!

Just a short ROW 80 check-in today. I’m happy to report that despite distractions galore, I’ve been keeping my focus on my writing and other important goals. So far this week I’ve written 2327 new words on my WIP, The Heart of the Goddess. I’ve made a new plan to get back on track with blogging, which has slipped a bit this summer. I outlined my September post for the Kind Over Matter website, which is due Friday.
Today, besides the book, I’m working on writing website and marketing copy for our free e-book collaboration, Goddess Awakening: The Rise of the Feminine Divine, which gets published on September 12th (eek! so excited!).
This was the week of the triple birthdays – my Mom, my Aunt (who lives right next door), and my son were all celebrating. We had a fantastic triple birthday bash, with 16 people all eating outside on my Aunt’s deck. It was so much fun! We also had some friends visiting for part of the weekend, and then an annual family reunion with my Dad’s side of the family tree. So, it’s been quite a busy patch, which is normal for us for late August.
Still, I’ve made some writing progress since last Sunday. I’m now at 77,244 words on my WIP, which means I wrote 2948 words this week. Not too bad. I also had a polarity session with my favorite healer, and as a result had a bunch of personal journaling to do. I feel like I’m in a really good space right now, making progress on creative projects and upgrading my mindset in general.
Amazingly, I also got some swimming in. BlackLion and I are making plans with our fantastic photographer (aka his Mom), to do a book cover shoot soon. We’ll be doing a “two-fer,” since we need a cover for the e-book collaboration we’re working on as well as my WIP. My daughter is going to be the cover model again. This time our setting will be the seashore. Seems to go well with two works that are focused on the Feminine Divine! We now have all the material for the e-book collaboration, and we’re just working on transcribing and editing.
My focus for this week will be on writing, transcribing, and editing, and I’m rather looking forward to it. Oh, and I need to get caught up on a bit of blogging, as well. I hope you have a wonderful week, whether you’re heading on into fall mode or, like me, still savoring the last few weeks of summer.
I’m a member of this Facebook group where some friends and acquaintances share gratitude lists. It ebbs and flows, with people dropping in when they feel like expressing what they love about their current moments. This week I’ve been deliberately focusing on gratitude, so I posted on the group every day. I want to share today’s post with you:
“Today was a long poem of gratitude, rest, and just BEing. I love sleeping in. I love rising slowly, and my lover making me breakfast. I love meditating, and writing in my journal. I am thankful for my home and I love keeping it tidy and pretty. I love my cats hanging around, purring, preening, sleeping, the usual cat things – and sharing their intense beauty with me. I love reading. I love taking a nap, just because my eyes got sleepy. I love the breeze flowing in my window. I love making salsa to share with my family, and making it together is fun, the laughter and kitchen ballet. I love having my kids and their loves around. I love that I worked on my book because it felt like the most fun thing to do before dinner. I love eating together and telling stories with my family. I love that we adopt people into the fold so seamlessly, and that my kids’ companions feel comfortable and cared for here. I love that BlackLion offered to go out so I could still stay in my PJs – I love staying in them all day without meaning to. I love this restful day.”
That’s just what I needed after a very busy week. I’m still making steady progress on the Heart of the Goddess book. My word count is now 74,296 on the way to a target of 120K. Getting there! I don’t know if I’ll finish by my self-imposed deadline or not, but luckily since I’m creating the deadline, I can move it as needed. Well, within reason. I do want this book to launch in early November.
We have nearly all the material we need for our Divine Feminine e-book collaboration. We have 14 amazing contributors, and I cannot wait to share this material with the world! It’s really fantastic. And we’re making all kinds of wonderful connections with people around it, already. I’m so excited! We also make our 4th video for another collaboration we’re part of – and discovered that even though we were very late submitting the video, it’s okay because they’ve had a delay in the launch. We’ve got some time to make our 5th video when we get to it. We had a little extra fun with this video, as you can see in the picture – that’s BlackLion about to interview my daughter ElvenTiger.
I’ve been walking and swimming a lot, still. The weather is just gorgeous. Summer in Maine – there’s nothing like it. I know I’m really blessed to live in a place that is considered a vacation destination for so many people. I’m very thankful.
I guess that’s all for now. I wish you a fun and creative week, and I hope you enjoy the final weeks of summer!
It’s been two weeks since my last update here. Time flies! I’m still working on my WIP, and that’s my main focus this Round. I’m now at 68,212 words, on my way to 120K or so. That means I’ve written 8,106 new words in the past two weeks. Not bad, but not the pace I’m looking for, if I’m to reach my goal of finishing the draft by early September. I guess it’s my stately summer pace. I want to find ways to pick up that pace, while still enjoying all the summer activities and getting other work done.
I’m not sure how to do that. I do have some research that I still need to do before writing some of the sections, so that will help. I’ve made it a priority to do that research in the near future. Other suggestions for picking up the pace are certainly welcome! It’s not that easy to do writing sprints with a non-fiction project. I might need to start scheduling multiple writing sessions in the day, since I only seem able to come up with 700 to 1000 words in each session.
My goal of building community for my business, Feline Dreamers, is going well. We’re now compiling the interviews for our Feminine Divine e-book project, and the content is fantastic. We have a bunch of really inspiring leaders who are participating. I’m very excited about that! We’re plugging along with the monthly workshops, and gradually preparing for our other upcoming events, all while keeping up with our blog and newsletter. I’m happy with our progress so far, though of course I wish we were bringing in some money.
My physical health goals are going well, too. I’ve been doing lots of swimming – in ocean, river, and lake – and walking. I’m eating less, and have lost a few pounds over the past couple of weeks. My spiritual practices are going strongly, and for the most part I’m having fun. The family is generally well, and I really can’t complain. So I won’t.
I’m writing this with my dear Percy cat on my lap, and a steady rain falling outside my window – we’ve had a bit of a drought here, so it’s much needed. It’s also good weather for getting some blogging and other tasks done. I hope your week is productive and enjoyable. Blessings!
Pronoia is the Antidote for Paranoia: How the Whole World is Conspiring to Shower You With Blessings
After hearing and discussing an excerpt from Sharon Creech’s Walk Two Moons, students will plan to create a unique description of a character that uses memorable actions that “show” a person’s character. They will brainstorm verbs that might prove or “show” two personality traits. Students will then turn their brainstorm into an original character sketch that shows the reader both personality traits, borrowing techniques from Creech's novel. Teachers: click here to read the entire lesson plan.
Students will focus on the trait of idea development, in particular using vivid and memorable detail. Author Sharon Creech does a great job of using specific details to show (and not just tell) us her characters. Word choice is a secondary trait focus, modled after Creech's use of strong verbs to describe what her character does and doesn’t do. Creech paints a compelling picture with her choice of words to describe her character.
I'm realizing that all food tells a story. Many times it lies largely undetected in the fabric of our lives, yet sets a vivid background for our most significant memories.
Two of my favorite summer tastes combined in one delicious treat. Lemon and blueberries. Living so close to Michigan, blueberries are so abundant this time of year. I made this yummy cake for my husband's birthday and it was definitely a hit. So much so that I had a request to remake it for Labor Day - only the second time I made it as cupcakes. The cupcakes were definitely a hit, but I think I'm recommending this as a layer cake. Getting mouthful after mouthful of tender cake, tangy icing and fresh blueberries is the way this dessert should be enjoyed. It will take a few steps, but it is well worth it.
Cream shortening; add sugar and beat well. Add egg yolks one at a time until combined. Beat at medium speed until well creamed.
In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt, and wisk together. Add flour mixure to creamed mixture alternatively with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Add zest and lemon extract and blend well.
Pour batter into three greased and floured 8 or 9 inch round cake pans. Bake at 350 for 25-30. Cool in pans for 10 min and then remove from pans to cool completely.
In a medium saucepan, combine 2 cups of blueberries, sugar and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer a minute or two. Strain most juice off of the blueberries (but reserve just in case your filling gets too thick). Turn off heat. Add cornstarch to lemon juice and mix until cornstarch is dissolved. Add cornstarch mixture to blueberries and stir until sauce is thickened. You're going to want it to be pretty thick so it doesn't run off of your cake. Add 1 cup of fresh blueberries. Stir a couple of times and let it sit to cool.
Cream the butter, zest, vanilla and lemon extract and salt until fluffy. Add sugar alternatively with milk until mixture is cream and smooth. Add lemon juice and blend. Add more sugar or milk to achieve desired consistency. P.S. - You will probably need to double this if you do a three-layer cake or use as much frosting as I do.
Frost the top of each layer of cake with a thin layer. Place blueberry filling on top of the frosting, in the center of the layer, leaving at least one inch around the sides. Stack cake, then frost top and sides of cake.

Archeologists have recently discovered jade ware that dates back over 4,000 years at a site in central China's Hubei Province, local authorities said Monday.
Jade battle-axes, an astronomical instrument and a tube, dating back to between 4,600 to 5,100 years ago, have been unearthed at the Mulintou site in Baokang County.
Besides jade ware, other items including human skeletons, stoneware and pottery have also been found at the site.
"A jade battle-axe was considered as a symbol of power. The astronomical instrument also indicated owners of the tombs were high-level people," said archeologist team leader Da Haobo.
Fang Qin, curator of the provincial museum, said that the new findings are crucial for the study of the funeral customs of the Qujialing culture, a late Neolithic culture discovered in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
There, the inspector for mission Gottfried Holland and the secretary general Frank Spatz planted the tree in a ceremony on the 8th of November 2017. Frank Spatz presented the background of the concept by explaining the connection to the Luthergarten in Wittenberg. Gottfried Holland as well as Carlos Kunz (director of the MEUC) emphasised the importance of a relation between the MEUC and the Evangelical Gnadauer Association. Moreover an information board was installed to establish a memorial site for the reformation anniversary. As a reminder of the shared community of faith stands a quote from the 2nd Cor 5.19.20: "In Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God."

High-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with BCVAC regimen followed by maintenance chemotherapy for children with very high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia
1. Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Children’s Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the recommended treatment for children with very high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but it requires adequate institutional infrastructure, experience, and expertise, especially for alternative donor HSCT. We review our experience with high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT), followed by post-APBSCT maintenance chemotherapy for children with very high risk ALL. Between August 1997 and November 2012, our institute was not successful with HLA-haploidentical HSCT. Thus, if patients lacked HLA-matched allogeneic donors or cord blood donors, we treated them with HDCT and APBSCT with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and cyclophosphamide, followed by post-APBSCT maintenance chemotherapy with vincristine, oral prednisolone, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine.Ten patients underwent HDCT and APBSCT due to relapse, biphenotype leukemia, Philadelphia translocation, MLL rearrangement, hypodiploidy, and initial white blood cell count above 20.0 × 109/L. At a median 7.4 years from HDCT to APBSCT, overall survival (OS) was 70.0% ± 14.5% and event-free survival (EFS) was 70.0% ± 14.5%. Adverse events were tolerable, without treatment-related mortality.This historical analysis may be a useful reference when allogeneic HSCT including alternative donor HSCT cannot be performed for children with very high risk ALL.

Abstract：In information propagation, users have forwarding preference when receiving same message repeatedly. Modeling forwarding preference is fundamental to information propagation and other related applications, e.g., influence analytics, cascade dynamics and social recommendation. In this paper, we suggest forwarding preference is mainly affected by interpersonal influence, determined by both influence and susceptibility from the sender and the receiver, respectively. We propose to model such user-specific latent influence and susceptibility by the Forwarding Preference Model. We compare our proposed model with state-of-the-art forwarding preference models on the dataset from Weibo, which demonstrates that the proposed model consistently outperforms other methods at two evaluation measures.
In a bid to stay on top of emerging edgier competitors, beauty brand Sally Hansen has created a product which allows consumers to recreate salon trends at home. Sally Hansen Salon Effects Nail Nail Polish Strips are embedded with real nail polish and can be applied in the comfort of one’s own home by simply peeling off a protective layer, then fitting and filing the nail.
The strips were designed to mimic the effects of the widely popular salon process, ‘Minx’, a favourite with celebrities such as Lady Gaga. It can cost more than £30 to have Minx nails applied, and the process is often time-consuming.
“Minx is very big, and we’ve found a way to allow women to do it at home for much less,” said the vice president of marketing for the sally Hansen Group, Annette Devita. “We looked at how we can translate Minx at home.
The strips, which last ten days are DBP, toluene and formaldehyde-free, odourless and do not need to dry. Designs include neon, metallic and high-shine patterns and will cost just under ten dollars for a set containing sixteen strips (room for mistakes!), a cuticle stick, a mini file-buffer and full instructions.

A large, national retail chain came to Kaploss with a security issue. They had acquired another retail chain and wanted to remodel the acquired stores and safely store merchandise during renovation. They were using temporary trailers outside of each of the store locations that needed to be secured while merchandise was being stored. We were asked to secure these trailers.
Kaploss supplied and installed high security trailer locks as well as high security padlocks and keys. Our service department scheduled with our certified network of locksmithing technicians the installation of above mentioned products with store management personnel and once store was remodeled, we removed hardware and re-cycled from one location to the next.
All merchandise in temporary trailers were secured. Our service technicians promptly responded to the needs of the store managers so merchandise was brought into the renovated stores immediately. We ultimately saved our client time, money and peace of mind.
Kaploss Security took control of securing merchandise for over 1500 temporary trailers at over 700 store locations. We successfully scheduled installation, removal and re-cycling of our security hardware till end of project. A job well done.
One of our major national chain store clients needed to reduce operating expenses and improve security of its stores. They had a large volume of employee turnover. With the large employee turnover comes the task of managing keys used at retail locations. Kaploss Security, Inc. suggested and implemented the Insta-Key System to enable greater key control and cut costs.
Prior to initiating the Insta-Key System, locksmiths had to be called in regularly to re-key locks and cut new keys which skyrocketed security costs.
Insta-Key offers interchangeable key cores that can be installed in most existing door lock hardware. The Insta-Key cores use patented technology that enable a step-change key to enter an existing lock and re-key (reconfigure) that lock, rendering all existing keys inoperable with a single key turn. Each core is capable of nine re-keys, each requiring a re-key kit. A kit includes step-change key and a full set of keys to be distributed to all employees after the re-key is completed. This ensures continual store access by all current employees and lowers costs dramatically.

I thought it was about time I posted...something. Anything. I do hope to try and blog more in the New Year. If anything, at least I'll finally finish up blogging about our trip to Italy. Here is a sneak peak: We went to Pisa. We spent one last day in Florence. We headed home. We had a horrible experience at the Amsterdam airport (is there any other kind of experience there? People say it's so great, but every time I've been there, the lines to get through security have been interminable). We had a nice experience at the Yotel in the Amsterdam airport (if you have a long layover there and are just sick and don't want to venture into town, this is a good alternative). We made it home.
I also hope to post at some point about my marathon experience! Yes, I did it! I completed the Twin Cities Marathon. 5:26...more details to come.
I am also knitting my husband a sweater. Really all that is left to do is the finishing. Which includes a zipper, so we'll see how that goes.
This is a fun giveaway! Cindy Rushton is allowing me to give away a free ticket to the UHSE (Ultimate Homeschool Expo). Have you been thinking about attending this online event - the largest of its kind for the homeschooling community? It is going to be very fun.
I feel privileged to be one of the 35 speakers and my session is on Wednesday (June 3rd) at 2:00pm CST on the topic of the 7 Essential Ingredients to Homeschooling Success. I hope that you will join me.
That's it! Enter the drawing quickly, because we'll draw our winner in time to be included in the entire week long event which starts at 10:00am CST on June 1st. So, we'll conduct our drawing at 9:30am so that you won't miss anything. Sound good?
What do I think? I think it sounds WONderful! I'm very familiar with some of these folks and I respect them a great deal. Even as a veteran homeschooler, I know there is always more for me to learn - especially from the line up of speakers in this Expo!
I have to say, however, that the absolute BEST part of this whole concept is that you don't have to sign in "live" to reap the benefits of these seminars or to access the freebies and drawings. As a military wife stationed overseas, I frequently find myself "cut off" from my homeschooling friends when I most need support - I'm a day ahead and it makes me feel behind. Add in the fact that while there are homeschoolers on our island, but no conventions, and you can imagine how lonely I feel at times!
This is a great concept - many thanks to all the speakers for participating and best of luck to you all! And Terri - thanks for posting the contest - what a wonderful opportunity for the winner. :-)
I hope to win because I can't listen in next week, but it is nice that the discussions will be posted and available whenever it is convenient.
I have been looking forward to Cindy's UHSE this year. I missed out last year. I have been listening to some of the preview shows as my schedule allows. I am most excited about the kid's classes. I think it will be fun for my children to be able to have a class from someone other than me. I'd love to win as we don't have the funds to buy a ticket at this time.
This year is so full of exciting workshops. I can't believe how much Cindy has managed to cram into UHSE. I was blessed last year as a brand new homeschooler by Cindy's UHSE and this year is heading to even bigger blessings
I love it that the sessions are live but "saved" at the same time. It will be so great to be able to listen to EVERY session and not have to pick and choose - "Which will I go to and which ones will I have to miss?"
This looks amazing! How fun and wonderful that you don't have to go anywhere with gas prices to reap the benefits of so much knowledge and experience!
The only conference in my area is 5 hours away and I had to miss it this year. I love online conferences, so this would be great :)
I was looking at the info on the Expo last week - drooling!!! I would love to be able to be a part of this this year. I missed last year's but heard rave reviews!
The best part is that I don't need to find a babysitter for my 5 dc! I can just listen in when the kids are in bed and the house is quiet. :)
It sounds really interesting. I was planning on going to our local homeschool conference next weekend, but my husband is not going to be able to make it so I am staying home. I am amazed at how many speakers/workshops you have set up.
The Homeschool Expo looks fantastic! I love the idea of being able to attend session in "real time" or listen to them later. That's besides the shopping! With this economy the way it is, I'd love to win a ticket to the expo. Thanks!
Thank you for such a great opportunity!! I am really looking forward to the possibility of winning a ticket... the lineup looks amazing, and I am really hoping to glean much needed wisdom and insight!
Wow! I can't believe how many seminars are offered. The ones that caught my eye are "Fitting in Fitness" (which we have a hard time doing) and "Teaching Science Out of the Box" (my 4th grader wants to study Chemistry next year and I'm not sure how I'm going to do that).
I love the idea of an online conference because we always have a hard time finding babysitters and the money to go to a traditional conference. So I would LOVE to win a ticket!
Wow, I'd heard of this before but thought you had to listen live, which could be difficult in a house full of kids. ;-) This looks awesome, I'm especially intrigued by the Life in the Fishbowl workshop and the virtual vendor hall. Too cool!
What a sweet give-away you two ladies have come up with!!! I was able to join in the UHSE last year and it blessed my socks off! I've been homeschooling for 6 years now (unless you count from birth then it's been 12 years!) and I am still learning so much! I feel like I can always find new ways to improve my teaching methods. Plus the spiritual encouragement during the UHSE for us as parents is amazing!
Thanks agian for the chance to participate in this wonderful giveaway! I'd love to join you gals again this year!!!
Cindy Rushton puts together THE best workshops and conferences. I have most of her conferences saved to my computer and still go back and listen to them all the time. I LOVE how everything is so organized and saved on a website that you have access to long after the conference is over. Her conferences are always new and refreshing, packed full of great information and encouragement! I thoroughly enjoy all the great speakers! Thanks again!
This is a revolutionary idea! And I love Cindy Rushton :-) She was the first one to turn me onto notebooking. Thanks for entering me in the drawing! I'd love to be a part :-) JuicePlus.Alicia@gmail.com
I saw this last year and really wanted to do it. This sounds so cool 'cause you can do every session you want in your own time.
This is such a great opportunity for busy moms. Since you can take a break whenever you need one and come back to hear some more, there is no chance of information overload. You can 'fuel up' when you are ready or feel the need for some encouragement.
I think the seminars listed truly offer "something for everyone". The seminars will help the new homeschooler get off to a fantastic start and the veteran homeschooler to recharge their batteries!
I love Cindy's UHSE! That's what I think and I don't think I could ever tell enough people. Cindy herself inspires and enlightens me; through the Holy Spirit, she always manages to lift me up and offer hope when all I see is chaos. The speakers who also speak at the UHSE have helped me so much as well in the past. I listen to last year's UHSE while I'm on the treadmill in the morning and I am absolutely inspired to begin the day with my children. Because we are not able to purchase (even for the awesome sale amount) the UHSE this year, and our internet connection is so wiggy that I can't count on listening in live, I was really thinking I would miss out. But not if I win this contest!!! So, thank you Terri for offering that possibility.
I love the fact that I can get all of the workshops as MP3s, since I don't really have enough time in any one week to listen to all of the material offered in the workshops...I can listen and be edified while I clean the house, cook dinner, or on one of those many sleepless nights...and the goodie bag looks like like a lot of fun too! I would be SOOO pleased to win a membership for this year's convention!
I think this is wonderful. The nearest conference I could attend is a 3 day event - 3 hours away. With conference fees, motel, finding someone to take care of my youngest children - this is totally out of reach. At most I could attend only 15 workshops anyway. I would love to win this!
I was able to get in on the conference last year, after the fact, and am still listening to some of the conferences from that. With job losses and everything else, I had determined it wasn't going to happen this year. I'm totally impressed with the lineup -- my 2nd son would love for me to attend the homeschooling in the kitchen one. I think I need the one about putting first things first.
Wow, the site looks great and the workshops do as well. There are many that I really need to listen to!!
While I have listened to some of the early chats, I have such a busy month coming up that it will be difficult to listen to many more. I won't be able to afford buying a membership right now...So, I would love to win one!
I like that you can listen to all of the classes and you don't have to pick and choose. I love that it's all in one place and I can listen in my pj's if I want. lol
How exciting and ingenious to have an online conference?! Most of the reasons why I have never been to a home education conference was the added hassle and expense of travel!
The speakers and subjects offered are spot-on to help answer questions and fulfill the needs of a variety of home educators. This is truly a wonderful opportunity!
I heard about this last year but was not able to participate. Love the idea that anyone can browse through at their pace. Thank you for the opportunity.
As a first year hs I am really looking forward to this even. I am unfamiliar with much this goes on in this seemingly alternate universe. (hs) It looks like it will be informative and even fun. Thank you for including me in the drawing.
I attended the first ever UHSE and loved it! It offers such an amazingly broad range of topics and speakers...awesome! I also love the kids' section of the event this year!
With finances the way they are this year, we couldn't afford to attend a live homeschool conference or even buy a ticket for this. With 8 children, and 2 more coming this summer (ages 7 and 9 from Haiti), I can always use some good doses of encouragement and ideas to stick with homeschooling!
Thanks for offering this. I pray many will be blessed by this conference, including whoever wins a free ticket!
The conference sounds great. There are a lot of the seminars that I would love to listen to as well as "send" my kids to some of the classes. Thanks so much for the opportunity.
This looks so cool, I have always wanted to do this but I never really have!!! I would love to win, I am a fan of Cindy Rushton she has so much great stuff. I listen to her on BlogTalk Radio. If you do not, then you should it is a blast!!! Anyway for whoever wins, I hope you enjoy!!!
Thank you for passing this on. I love the idea that you can listen to the sessions when you have the time to really concentrate on the topic. Live sessions are hard to attend. Thanks.
This would be such a blessing! It looks like some wonderful topics, great speakers, and useful information! And the best part? Being able to listen on your own time! Thanks for the chance to win!
This conference sounds great. I just found out about Cindy a few weeks ago and was able to listen to some of the free preview chats. They were awesome, I can only imagine how great the conference is going to be! Thanks for considering me for the drawing.
I think it is wonderful!!! I love Cindy and her workshops. I have for the last 2 years attended most her events. I have purchased a ticket to the last 2 UHSE....they were wonderful. I have not been able to purchase one this year.....so I would love a chance to win a ticket.
The UHSE sounds wonderful and so informative and helpful. I am in need of some encouragement about now to help me gear up for next school year! This sounds like just what the doctor ordered =)
I attended the UHSE last year and really enjoyed teh sessions. The Mommy's Grab Bag was AWESOME! I loved all the great gifts!
This sounds great. I like that I do not have to tune in at a specific time. The kids classes look interesting, too. Thanks for the chance to win such a great prize!
As an overseas missionary, I don't have the chance to attend the homeschool conference back home. I bought a ticket to last year's UHSE, and it was marvelous. I'd love to win a ticket this year.
What a wonderful opportunity! I have been eyeballing this conference and longing to attend, there are soooo many great speakers and incredible topics, that I don't even know which one I want to listen to or try most! I have been trying to find someone to split the friend subscription so that I can attend because our finances are incredibly limited right now (we just found out we have to replace our furnace and it's going to cost around $5000). I sure do hope I can win the free ticket. Thank you for the opportunity!
WOW !! I attended my first real in person Convention this year after 9 yrs of being in the trenches It was wonderful yet at the same time it was hectic away from home parking was a big mess missed some speakers because of too much time in the vending hall . This sounds wonderful and what a mix of speakers and topics . I would Love to win a ticket . Please enter me . tberra@yahoo.com
Hi! I was really excited to receive your e-mail, offering to give away a ticket to Cindy’s UHSE. You see, we are a military family, and on a VERY tight budget. So much so I couldn’t afford to purchase a ticket. I have perused the UHSE website for days, just wanting “to go”! We have just finished our first full school year and I am now searching for new curriculum, for both my present homeschooler (a DD), and possible other DD of high school age (that one has me excited and scared all at once—LOL!). Anyway, thank you Terri and Cindy for all that you do! :o)
This looks wonderful. I am not very good at using the computer and have never tried to do an online conference but this would be amazing to try and learn from!
What a wonderful line up of speakers and sessions! This is such a wonderful idea for us moms that have little ones and infants. It is always a challenge to actually HEAR the speakers when you attend a convention with little ones. Trying to juggle naps and lunch and diapers is always part of the trip. With the UHSE, you can do everything you need to do AND not miss a beat with your kids. I would LOVE to win this ticket. I could really use the encouragement.
I think this is a great conference is great, we have participated the last two years, unfortunately we can't afford it this year. :( Thank you so much for providing an opportunity at winning a ticket!
I got to "attend" last year's UHSE and would love to win a ticket to this year's. There are so many excellent workshops. When you go to a physical conference you have to choose one workshop and miss all the others at the same time (or pay above and beyond the conference price to get recordings of the missed sessions); That's not the case here--not only can you be part of every session, you can listen to them over and over again.
I would love to participate in the UHSE! I was able to participate last year, and was tremendously blessed. Finances won't allow it this year, so I'd love to win the ticket! Thanks for all you do!
I think it is phenomenal how much is included in this! It certainly seems like far more than one year's worth of encouragement and "training"! Very impressive.
Even if you are just beginning the homeschool journey, or have been homeschooling for 16 years...there is something here for everyone. What a terrific line up and I would love it if my name is drawn as a winner. I will be praying for everyone involved next week!!!
Oooh, aaah, I love the UHSE. I bought a ticket last year AFTER the conference and it's still blessing me. I listen to the downloadable audios while I'm washing dishes, and even put some on my DH's iPod for him to listen to as well. This year looks even better if that's possible - classes for kids! Too fun.
All I can say is ~ WOW ~ and I so hope to work it into my week. Thanks for the reminder about it Terri or I would have forgotten!
UHSE is the best! The workshops offered this year are going to be even better than last year. What a blessing this is to me and my kids!
I would love to be a part of Homeschool Expo - I've seen it advertised the last couple of years, yet somehow felt as I'm "all the way down in Australia" it would somehow be too difficult to feel a part of all the fun! I've been fortunate to have heard of many of the speakers - it's sounds like it will be fantastic!!
The lineup of speakers is awesome... So very much good stuff... The workshops for the children are an especially good idea...
i haven't been to a homeschool convention - it seems like forever - because of finances. thanks for the opportunity to be able to win a ticket to the ultimate homeschool expo!
I have looked this over a couple of times now. There are so many timely topics, that I cannot narrow it down as to why I would love to win this ticket. Thanks for the heads up.
It is next to impossible to merely skim through the Ultimate Homeschool Expo page! Once you begin reading about all the wonderful speakers and resources available, you will be hooked and ready to sign up! Thank you, Terri and Cindy, for offering this awesome opportunity!
Cindy's expos are always a lot of fun, and you get lots of free goodies. I'd love to win. Thanks Terri.
WOW! What a superb line up of sessions you have. I have never heard of the homeschool expo prior to this year. I would love to win a ticket. This is so much better than taking time away from my family to attend a conference. Finances are limited for me, so I'm praying for a winning ticket.
This looks very exciting ~ what's even better is that there are no fees for gas and lodging! Thanks for the opportunity to enter this contest:o)
The Expo and all the benefits sounds great. Too good to pass up. You did a great job of giving information. Thank you for including Mac (iMac) computers. Just one small question since I did not see the information -- Will there be any shipping fees involved? What I mean is: When I purchase something from a vendor in connection with the Expo, will they charge shipping fees during this time (for a period of 30 days, for example)?
My next and final question-- If I'm not expecting too much----- If I win the free ticket to the EXPO will I get my $39.95 back? I don't see how I could wait and hope for the free ticket, then not win and have to pay at the last minute. So, today I am just about to pay for one ticket to the EXPO.
I would love to attend this event! I have listened to some of the complimentary sessions and loved them. I am homeschooling on a shoestring right now and can't afford a ticket. I really need a boost.
WOW! This looks absolutely wonderful and so full of encouragement. It is a great idea for those of us who are unable to attend a conference in our area.
I would love to win. I feel sometimes like I'm drowning in the this homeschool journey and I think this encouragement would be great.
Well I like the fact that I could attend this in my pajamas lol! No seriously the seminar put on about History & Geography through Literature intrigues me.
What a great idea! The speakers look wonderful. I would love to participate in this conference. I cannot believe all of the information will be available for so long. Glad to see you are participating!
Hi, I looked at the online site for Cindy's UHSE. 3-words-AWESOME/AWESOME/AWESOME. This would be a dream of mine. Presently my family consists of Me- a single Mom and two teens, 15 and 17. The 17 year old is a brain tumor survivor, 2006. He still has a rare syndrome P.F.S and a piece of tumor is growing=slowly. We have been home schooling since second grade. There has never been an opportunity for us to attend a curriculum convention. Lack of finances, time and travel means. I work full time, manage a home,feed the poor,mission at church and home school. With high school being so demanding, this would be a huge blessing. Both teens plan to go to college. One for nursing, and one for music therapy. Every year ,we have no clue, where the money is coming from for the curriculum!!! By faith, God provides. It was an online site like this that gave me the courage to accomplish this task. We will definitely email this online information to our Home school friends. P.S. My maiden name is: Terry Johnson. Thank you for encouraging all of us to continue to stay in the race!! Blessings from Terry, C.J., and Becca {liv2belikejesus@yahoo.com}.
An intriguing concept, and one that is new to me -- I already spend too much time in front of a computer, and yet some of these titles really call to me, even though I am an old, gray haired, veteran mom. :o) I hope I win!
Oh man there is so much good stuff going on there. My friend Maridel Willer is going to speak so I would love to hear her. I joined last years and loved it. I would love to win a ticket to this years. Sounds wonderful.
This confrence looks like a great big blessing to all those who are not able to go to a near by convention. I was looking it over and the line up of speakers looks fantastic. I jittery with anticipation!
I think it is wonderful that you will be allowing one lucky person to win. Especially in this economy it has hit many of us. For the past 3 years I have attended the CHEA convention here in Calif. This year is no such luck! This looks like it will be a great alternative.
Wow, this is an awesome idea! I love the speaker lineup and the freebies and goody bag make this a real event to me! I only wish I had purchased a ticket to this expo before I purchased tickets to our local homeschool expo. I'd love to win a ticket!
I love Cindy! The line up of speakers and the topics are so inspirational! I love that there are kids classes this year!
Having attended "in person" conferences, I always felt overwhelmed because I couldn't go to Every Session or be in two sessions at once that I was really interested in. This way it's like having my cake and eating it too because the sessions are live as well as saved so I can "attend" at my leisure. Pure genius upon Mrs. Rushton's part!
I think the best part is that you can download the lectures to MP3's later so that you can listen at your own convenience. That's important to those of us with many little learners around!
I am not able to attend the homeschool convention I was originally going to go to, so this would be a great alternative. Really interested in what they have to say.
I think that it looks awesome. I will be starting High School with my eldest this year, so, some of the topics are very timely for me. I think that it is essential to attend at least one convention, conference or expo each year. We all need some excitement to spur us on. This Ultimate Expo will definately do it!! Frances
I would love to win a free ticket. I was very impressed with the line up of speakers and their topics.
I was able to attend the first one 2 years ago and it was GREAT.The addition of the kids classes this year are a great idea! My hubby was out of work, so I won't be able to pay this year and it can be hard to catch it live. I hope to win! :-)
Terri, I am intrigued with the idea of the UHSE. I have tried to make it a point to attend a hs conference every year as a way to regroup and be refreshed for another year of instructing my sons. The online approach is a novel idea in so many ways. I am working FT as we wait for God to lead us into ministry and it is nearly impossible to attend a conference outside the home because of the already overwhelming daily tendings I face. I really like that I wouldn't have to miss any classes I'd be interested in since they are ALL "taped". Plus, they are offering classes for the kids and one son will be home alone for a week; maybe there's a class he could join in on during that time and give him a change of pace for that week. We are winding down homeschooling with our oldest yet I still enjoy listening to veteran homeschoolers because I know there is something I can glean from others and implement here. Thanks for the offer and I look forward to being able to participate either way, win or not.
I really enjoyed the UHSE last year, and am looking forward to it again this year! Looks like a lot of useful topics and information there!
Sounds incredible! With 6 children, i cannot travel to conventions! So this is a wonderful solution!
I'm really interested in SO many of the topics available! From saving money with coupons to lapbooking...there's enough info here to keep me more than busy and encouraged for a year!
I've looked at the Ultimate Homeschool Expo website at least 3 times now and just can't decide whether or not to buy a ticket. It does look truly amazing and everyone who talks about it seems to think so as well. Thanks for the contest! Although $40 for all that is included is a good deal, it's still $40 (USD). It would be very exciting to win!
This is almost too good for words. I can't imagine have this much information, encouragement and inspiration AT HOME! In my jammies...with a hot cup of coffee! Way to go Cindy...definitely God inspired.
This sounds so neat! I have attended a few workshops in my local area and it is so frustrating trying to get from one spot to another and to take meaningful notes without being wiped out. This would be great, at my convenience, and I would not be under the pressure of missing something that I really wanted to "attend". Please enter me for a free ticket. hoshawj@bellsouth.net
Looks like a wonderful way to reach a wide audience with an excellent line-up of speakers. I've been blessed to hear a few of the speakers in person, and can't wait to listen to the others! Thank you for providing this opportunity.
I would Love to win a ticket. We are using Lynda Coats unit studies for the first time this year and we need all the info for it we can get. I also see many other speakers I am interested in.
I will be starting homeschool in August after bringing my children home from traditional school. I sure could use all this great information to get on the right track. I am enjoying my Homeschooling ABCs.
All I can say is WOW !!!! I am loving that they have added the Kids classes and SO Much about taking care of yourself as a Mom including Finding time for Fitness. There are also many workshops about getting the Bible into your life and your children's lives. I NEED that guidance. Unfortunatley this is NOT a year that I can afford to attend. I did attend last year and LOVED every moment! I spend hours listening into the live workshops then several more hours going thru all the stuff in the Grab Bag !! It was truly amazing !! I am entering this contest to hopefully win a ticket, so I can attend this year too but if not, I pray the experience touches someone elses life, the way last year's touched mine ! Blessings, Jessica Jesstwins01@comcast.net
Besides, you, I'm really excited to see Israel Wayne and Kathy Kuhl as part of your line-up. It's also great that there are things for the children this time.
The real time stuff is the best, but it's nice to know that if you miss it, you haven't "missed" it as you can catch it later!
I am brand new to homeschooling and have been fervently seeking out any and all information I can get! I am struggling to gather the materials needed to feel prepared to teach my three sons (ages 8, 4 and 1). I have not been able to attend a local convention and this one seems like it covers EVERYTHING! I love that I can listen to everything and really absorb the info and not feel rushed. I would LOVE to win because I cannot afford to attend otherwise. Oh, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE - Pick Me!
I have participated in this event in the past and would love to do it again this year. The line-up looks super. Let me know if I win. Adoptionmom@gmail.com
I hope I win because the kids classes sound great, the doorprizes and freebies and bonuses are usually excellent, and it is going to be more Ultimate than last year.
Wow! Awesome speakers and sessions. I also like that you can listen to them anytime throughout the year if you bought/won a ticket. So it's not just a one time event but a year long event!
I am very excited about this opportunity. Being so close to the start time I had just told my husband maybe next year. So many speakers on so many topics for me the kids even my hubby. What a wonderful blessing this will be for me or any homeschooling mommy.
Sounds like a fun way to learn about lots of new hsing ideas & products. I've never 'attended' a conference like this & am curious about it.
There are so many great speakers and topics! I'm excited about the kids' classes being offered this year.
Please sign me up for a chance to win this. I bought a ticket last year and was so blessed by all of the speakers I heard. I love that I can listen to all the workshops at my convenience and all the freebies are wonderful!
This looks wonderful! For the past couple years I have looked at this at think, this looks great I should do this! I haven't for whatever reason. Maybe this year will be the year :)
I haven't been to a conference in several years due to finances. This sounds too good to be true. I'd love to have a ticket.
I love, love, love the idea of an online homeschool conference. I am returning to homeschooling my children and would love the encouragement, but wouldn't have the time and money to invest at our local christian homeschool conference this year. I love what I have read about this, and would be thrilled to win the ticket. :-) Keep up your good work! I enjoy your site!
Wow, what a great idea! An online homeschool convention. I love it! Loved looking over the site and seeing the huge list of speakers and resources.
I missed the conference last year. Thanks for reminding me! It sure would be great to go for free since everything seems so expensive this year!
I'm excited about the opportunity to listen to all the speakers. I attended the FPEA Homeschool Conference last week-end but had to choose between shopping and lectures; it seemed unfair. UHSE solves that problem.
A conference that I can attend without the exhaustion of driving, packing, parking, or even getting out of my PJs. Sounds great!
I was surprised at how many classes there are. I'm not familiar with many of the speakers, but many of the titles look great. I think I'll send this to a friend and see if she wants to buddy with me:)
This is exactly what I'd been wishing for -- an online homeschooling conference that has lots of enriching speakers and other resources AND everything is "saved" for us to use at our convenience. Also, I really appreciate the breadth and depth of topics!
I think an online expo is an awesome idea! I would absolutely love to "attend"! The best part is that I don't have to figure out which lectures I would want to go to. I can listen to ALL of them in my own sweet time without having to miss out on the shopping (which is my favorite part!). Thank you Cindy!!!
I think it looks amazing. I saw this last year but couldn't 'attend'. I won't be able to this year unless I am lucky enough to win your giveaway.
I am a single mom and have been laid off for 2 months. Cindy is a name I discovered when I first started hsing 2 years ago. She is from the same state as I am and I have always been impressed with her ideas.
I enjoyed this so much last year and it looks even better this year! I was especially checking out the kids classes--COOL!
WOW Terri, this is incredible...75 workshops given by 35 speakers, this is totally awesome. Oh how I wish I could afford this or win the ticket..To be able to attend a conference at my leisure and have my children involved!!! I keep repeating myself "TOTALLY AWESOME". Thank you so much for the opportunity.
I love Cindy Rushton. I attended last year and she is such an amazing encouragement to me. I have tried to listen in live to as many as I could this year, which is an awesome benefit that Cindy gives. Money isn't so great this year, so winning would be fantastic for me.
Ok trying again to leave a comment! I attended the Expo last year and am still being blessed by the downloads. This years looks even better.
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Pick me, pick me! (Jumping up and down, waving my arms excitedly in anticipation that it might be me!) This is a totally new concept for me but I'm very interested in this conference because I had to miss my state convention this year due to a conflict.
This year's convention looks absolutely great! I wish it was in person too. I would sure love to win a ticket, I won't be able to go otherwise. Thanks so much,
I love that there is so much offered! It's nice to know that you can listen any time and don't even have to leave the house.
I have so much respect for Cindy Rushton, everything she does is so good! What a gift to be able to access so many great minds for such a low price!
This sounds so great! I can't get over how many amazing people are part of this week. I know I would grow and be better for being part of it.
I have never been to a convention in my 13 years of homeschooling for one reason or another but mostly due to the long distance I would have to travel and childcare cost. I'd love to be a part of this online deal. Whoever thought of the idea of offering a convention online is a genius! Thank you, in advance to everyone who has put this together. Whether I win a free ticket or not, I will be part of this, my first ever convention and in the convenience of home.
What? No crowds, no babysitters, no driving? This is the best thing going! I am really looking forward to this . . .
I have been seriously thinking about signing up for this conference, and even though it is reasonably priced, I don't know if we can really afford it. So, thanks for having this drawing...
This looks like a WONDERFUL conference!!! And best of all, you can download the sessions and listen to them at your convenience. The session titles all sound wonderful... it would be a shame to miss any because of scheduling conflicts. What a blessing to homeschoolers worldwide!!!
I have been homeschooling for seven years and thought that I had heard of most speakers. But, I haven't heard of half of the speakers listed; so I'm looking forward to what new and fresh things there are to learn from new faces (and voices).
The expo looks incredible, but I'm new to homeschooling and don't want to get overwelmed! Also I have spent alot on curriculum for next year so our funds are just about out. On the other hand if I won, it wouldn't cost me anything! Thanks for spreading the word.
It sounds like a dream being able to attend from home whenever you can! For me, with 4 children total and 2 with special needs and 1 nursing, I can only catch little bits of time to read or listen to anything...including typing... :-)
What do I think? I think that once again Cindy has put together another Awesome event. This one has so many speakers that will add to each family no matter how long they have been homeschooling.
I personally know that even though I have been homeschooling for 24 years, I still come across material that is incredible. The amount of information alone is worth more than the price. Awesome Job Cindy Hats off to you again.
An amazing opportunity to gain knowledge and insight without leaving your home. Excited to see opportunities for the children also! Love the online conference idea as opposed to attending conference and returning exhausted and overwhelmed.
I would love to win because I have learned so much from Cindy since last years Expo and am unable to afford it this year. Our family is paying off our son's funeral and burial expenses since he passed away 7 months ago. I would love to learn more about the different ways I can teach my 7 year old son who is now always distracted by his grief or baby brother. There is so much for out family to benefit from the 2009 Ultimate Homeschool Expo. Thank you.
Wow...this sounds absolutely amazing. I think my favorite part is that you can listen/watch anytime it's convenient for you!
Since I can catch only moments of time to read anything...usually during nursing...this expo sounds like a dream!
It sounds great. Would love to have a chance to win something like this. I missed it last year due to curcumstances
I would love to be able to attend. I am having surgery on Tuesday and will not be able to attend any of my local homeschool conferences. This would be great thing to do while recovering!
I have heard so many of Cindy's things and have never been disappointed. I think I would really like to hear the presentations on Writing and History.
I think this sounds like an answer to prayer! I have been trying to arrange and rearrange my schedule to make time for the local conferences without success. Now I have a chance to see and hear so much more from my own home. Plus I will be able to get mp3 recordings. How great is that?!?!
This would such a blessing to be able to listen to these speakers and receive a boost in my prayer life, spiritual self, self-confidence, and overall mental health. Thank you for the opportunity to win a ticket to this fantastic resource!
We live in Singapore and there are VERY few homeschoolers here. It will be so GREAT to win this! Thank you so much for this opportunity!
What a great way to do an expo! The wide variety of topics is a big plus. With all my little ones it would be so nice to get the benefit of such a large home schooling expo without having to leave my home. :)
I think this is an excellent idea. I've been to a couple of Expo's and I've had to choose who I can listen to and who I don't have time to listen to. Sometimes I wanted to be in 2 places at the same time. This way, I can hear everything and I don't have to worry about dragging my reluctant kids with me.
I think that this is an incredible advancement of technology so that so many of the homeschooling community can enjoy hearing and learning from some of the "best of the best"! I won't be able to make it to our local convention this year and what a wonderful way to get some of the same great information at any time via the Internet! Thank you for doing this for everyone!
This sounds incredible! As a new homeschooling mommy, I feel like I'm going to need all the help I can get - and this looks to be an awesome resource. Thanks for the info about joining, and the chance to win a ticket!
Cindy Rushton has truly wonderful ideas. I've bought many of her resources through the years and highly recommend anything that she puts her hand to. This ticket would be a great way to bless my friend. My email is "kellyandstan@bluefrog.com"
I'm so new at this "homeschooling" thing that I didn't even post the comment properly! (should be the anonymous one immediately preceeding this post) Sorry about that. Laura J ljtuppware@juno.com
I think this is a great idea. I didn't know about this conference last year, or I would have signed up.
We are approaching a new level in our homeschooling and I would like to get more information on a variety of topics. This sounds like the perfect venue for me!
I agree with so many that Cindy's always got great speakers for her various workshops ~ this year's UHSE is no exception from the looks of things! And whoever said that "we don't have to pick and choose, we can listen to them all" made a great point - I have last year's and it's wonderful.
I can't listen live this year either as we are leaving to visit our baby grandson and am frantically trying to get everything done before we go ~
This sounds so wonderful and exciting for a "new" homeschool mom. I recently attended a Convention that was terrific bu this is almost sensory overload. I hope I win! This would be very encouraging and helpful. Thanks for the great contest.
I am a teacher and am home-schooling my young son right now. We got some products from Cindy last year and have just loved everthing. She is so helpful and gives so many resources, like finding you Terri. I love to listen to Cindy's live radio, when I am not busy with family, house, etc. It makes me feel like I am connected and not without a support system, which is always helpful. So I just want to thank you for all your tips and newsletters. Thank you.
The godly girl time sounds the best for me since i am homeschooling three girls. The bible and homeschooling one sounded great also.
Just a fabulous idea! It's like a permanent homeschool conference in your computer ;) Lovely! I pray this will be a blessing to many and encouragement to all to keep persevering at homeschooling. How generous of you to share it for free! Thanks!
I can't believe the line-up of speakers... Many I have not heard of but am intrigued by the titles. Thanks for the give-away.
I think it sounds awesome!! I am especially thrilled with the addition of the kids' classes! I hope to hear you there (and I must admit I hope I win!)
It's great that this year Mac users can join in as well. I'm also encouraged to see so many talks about homeschooling high school as we are beginning that part of our journey soon.
This sounds great, I missed our local conference and now wish I had gone. So nice to get refreshed and renewed, have always home schooled 16, 13, 13, and 11. I would love to win the free ticket, but it not may have to find the price of admission somewhere (things do have a way of working out). Look forward to hearing all the great talks planned and being able to listen to them over. Thanks for offering the free ticket! Denise
It sounds fabulous! I have never tried anything like this. How exciting...to think of sitting in my own home and listening to all of these classes! No driving in traffic miles away and having to pay to park, then find a parking place, then walk forever to get in! This is great. I love homeschooling and could really use some new ideas! Money is tight so a free ticket this year to try this out would be AWESOME!!
This sounds like it is full of great information. I was able to go to our state convention this year, but I had a limited window of time. You should have seen me rushing through the vendors' displays! There was no time to hear any of the great speakers. I'd love to have the opportunity to listen to the pros.
Wow, I've heard of this before, but this year seems much bigger--all the kids' sessions and just gobs of speakers. Your title is intriguing. :-) I'd be delighted to be entered in the drawing. Thanks for giving me this opportunity!
I looked through the workshops. I have to say WOW!! Moms (and Dad's) workshop with kids workshop included. WOW! A wide variety of homeschooling ideals in this expo. A lot of names ring a bell with me. Whoever wins the ticket will be blessed tremendously. This is a gem! I love the fact that it is not narrowed down to one method but a variety. It doesn't matter if you are a Charlotte Mason, Elcectic, traditional, classical or a unit study educationalist....ALL will benefit!
This sounds so wonderful. Of course I'd love to listen to your talks Terri. As a relatively young home schooler, I'd love to know how to make this a succuessful venture. And as for the multi-level homeschooling talk you're giving, will you also address homeschooling with a baby, toddler and preschooler all home too? That will be my situation next year! I feel terrible doing this but I'm finding that with a lot of little ones in tow, the only way I can surviveis to use a lot of workbooks. Is this my preferred homeschool method? Of course not! But how do I meet the needs of my little ones (and the ever dilapidated looking house!) while embarking on more time intensive but fun and memorable hands on projects that my kids would love? I'm afraid I'm at a loss! So I'd appreciate any advice I could get!
As for the rest of the conference, I love the fact that it's so well rounded! You get a little bit of every subject here! I also love the fact that they have kids programs too. And the fact that you don't have to be present to hear it all. Again, with all the little kids, the best I can do is snippets of time here and there after they're all asleep. Over all, this sounds wonderful!
I love the concept. What a great idea! It sounds like a great bargain, too, because you get so much, but money is just too tight around here right now. So I hope I win a free ticket! The only thing I would wish for is more information about the grab bag. And one subject I'd love to see covered (maybe I just missed it) is how to organize all of your online resources. I'm overwhelmed already with all of the resources I have! Thanks for the opportunity!
The conference sounds wonderful. Living so far away means that we cannot attend any of the physical conferences, and the R/$ exchange rate is so high that it is prohibitive to buy a ticket. So here is holding thumbs that I get to attend this year.
I always love the Ultimate Homeschool Expo. Cindy always has such a great line up of speakers. The downloads and freebies are always awesome. This is something that anyone would love to win.
What a great idea! I would love to be able to listen to these talks slowly and to have time to think about each one and implement the ideas one at a time. I see myself listening to them while I go walking, which would give me extra motivation to get out and walk!
I see a lot of talks that would be helpful to me right now, such as learning styles, teaching literature, teaching multiple ages, and building a home library. These are just a few of the sessions that appeal to me. The classes for children sound helpful, too.
I think it sounds terrific. I like the versatility because there can be so many unexpected events happening in any day! There appears to be something for everyone. I'm glad Cindy thought of it - it's a blessing to us all.
I don't know if this will get in before the deadline, but I hope so. I was wanting to attend our state's homeschool convention this summer, but it doesn't look like it will work out for me. But the Homeschool Expo looks AWESOME! And the fact that I could "attend" anytime would be such a blessing. Thanks for the opportunity to win a ticket.
I can't wait for this year's expo! Even today, a year later, I am still listening and listening again to the speakers from last year. If I could buy the previous year's expo, I would! All that I learned has blessed our homeschool, our marriage, and our spiritual walk!
Thank you Cindy for putting this expo together!! You can't beat this for the price and content. I spent the weekend at a similarly priced convention and didn't have nearly a third of the speakers and vendors that Cindy has put together. Plus, she allows you to listen again as part of the entrance price. I would have had to pay an additional $53 to have an MP3 download of the other convention. Thank you again Cindy for helping moms make the most with what they have!!
I got to attend this conference last year and loved it, especially since it was online!! This year it sneaked up on me, and since I haven't gotten around to getting my ticket yet i thought i'd see about winning one. I am really interested in your talk Terri so i'll probably get a ticket tomorrow even if i don't win one. Thanks, Jodi Tuten jtuten@juno.com
Where, in this world, could you attend a conference with at least 35 high-calibre speakers who are experienced in their subjects, door prizes for everyone, and gifts galore for a mere US$40??And,as if that weren't enough, you have the rest of your life to re-live the excitement, as well as digest and action the highly valuable information!!
WOW!! UHSE09 is an investment for homeschooling families that will more than pay for itself in the years to come!!
What a wonderful way to feel the encouragement of a homeschool convention without having to find daycare and driving there and back. I missed our convention here in Montana due to it being five hours away for several days away from my children without daycare.. I would love the opportunity to be included in this.. thanks for offering a giveaway. I would LOVE to see more of these online conventions.. Many blessings
I think this is a fantastic way for homeschoolers to get wonderful info and support from others!! What a wonderful idea!!
I attended the Ultimate Homeschool Expo last year and have SO enjoyed listening to the seminars all year. I haven't really even scratched the surface yet. I'd like to attend this year's expo especially for the kids classes!
I used to live in the San Jose, CA area where I was able to attend homeschool conventions - now we live in West Texas and are 6 - 10 hours from the nearest large homeschool conventions. This would be a great opportunity to "attend" a convention again! Hope I win!
I love Cindy. She has really helped me a lot in changing my life. I plan on trying to listen in as much as I can but would love a ticket as I missed the majority of the preview chats.
Oooh! So many of these topics speak to my heart - home management, high schoolers, encouragement, multi-age homeschooling. I need them all!!
I love these...we just can not afford to go so this would be a blessing...thank you for the opportunity that someone will be blessed with.
I think it is a fabulous idea! It makes a conference so accessible to people who are tight on money, or who live a long way from a IRL conference! Very Cool!
I am happily married and have six children. That alone is enough to make people stop and look (or shall I say "count"). On top of that, we've been homeschooling for 11 years and running our own business for 7 years. Todd and I are enjoying this sometimes crazy, often loud and always busy life!

This 0.24 carat cushion cut Natural Fancy Brownish Pink diamond has a nice muted, neutral color. This pink diamond also boasts good brilliance and beautiful shape with nice proportions. GIA-certified.
The color grade for a fancy color diamond is the most important factor in determining the diamond's value and price. First a dominant hue is determined. If there are any other colors in the diamond, a modifier is added to the color. For example, a diamond's color may be graded as "Pink" or "Purplish Pink." In some cases there is an equal amount of more than one color so the colors are hyphenated—for example, a Purple-Pink diamond.
The intensity of a diamond's color is based on two things—tone and saturation of the diamond's hue. The intensities the GIA uses to modify each color grade are Faint, Very Light, Light, Fancy Light, Fancy, Fancy Dark, Fancy Deep, Fancy Intense, and the most coveted Fancy Vivid. A diamond's value is directly related to its saturation and tone. The stronger a diamond's saturation (Fancy Intense and Fancy Vivid), the more valuable the diamond is. The deeper the tone of the color (Fancy Dark and Fancy Deep), the richer the color appears.
How well a stone is polished may determine how well the diamond reflects and refracts light. The GIA polish grades are excellent (EX), very good (VG), good (G), fair (F), and poor (P). At Diamond Envy, we only carry diamonds with EX, VG, and G polish grades.
A diamond's symmetry affects the pattern of light and shadow within the stone. Symmetry is one of the factors the GIA uses to grade the design and craftsmanship of a diamond. The GIA symmetry grades are excellent (EX), very good (VG), good (G), fair (F), and poor (P).
A round brilliant's measurement is written as minimum diameter –maximum diameter x depth. A fancy shape's measurements are listed as length x width x depth. All measurements are taken in millimeters.
A certificate from an independent gemological lab provides you with a comprehensive list of the diamond's grades. It also includes a map of all the inclusions or blemishes a diamond may have. Since no two diamonds are alike, this map is often referred to as the diamond's fingerprint. All our loose diamonds are certified by the GIA. All our jewelry is certified by either the GIA or EGL.
A color diamond's beauty and rarity comes from its color, so most are cut to the shape that best shows that color off. Anything other than a round brilliant cut is referred to as a fancy cut. This includes pears, hearts, ovals, marquises, radiants, cushions, asschers, emeralds, and princesses. Brilliant cuts have facets shaped like kites and triangles that sparkle with color when rocked. Step cuts have straight facets making them an excellent choice for showing off the clarity of a stone.
The clarity of a diamond is determined by how many inclusions or blemishes it may have and how noticeable they are. The GIA clarity grades are flawless (FL), internally flawless (IF), very very slightly included (VVS1, VVS2), very slightly included (VS1, VS2), slightly included (SI1, SI2), and included (I1, I2, I3). In general, any diamond graded SI1 or higher will be eye-clean. The distinction between the higher grades is in how difficult it is to find an inclusion using a loupe with 10x magnification.
Some diamonds fluoresce blue or yellow under long-wave UV light. The GIA grades fluorescence by color and strength—strong, medium, faint or none. Unless a diamond has strong fluorescence, it is unlikely to affect the diamond's appearance.
Diamonds are measured by carat weight (not to be confused with gold karats). The more a diamond weighs the rarer and more valuable it is. Therefore, a 3.00 carat diamond will cost more per carat than three 1.00 carat diamonds.
In a piece of jewelry with more than one diamond, the combined carat weight for all the diamonds listed is referred to as minimum carat weight or total carat weight.
The most commonly used metals in jewelry are gold, silver, and platinum. These three are often referred to as precious metals. At Diamond Envy, we always provide you the metal weight in grams. <
Rings are sized in quarter measurements. The average women's ring size is 6-7. To request information on ring sizing, please call one of our diamond sales representatives at 888-918-8288.
There are many ways to set a diamond. A prong setting maximizes the amount of light that can pass through a diamond. Bezel settings create the look of a smooth finish. Channel set diamonds sit side by side between two rows of metal. Pavé set diamonds tend to be small and are laid smoothly into the metal to resemble the source of the word—pavement.

Much has been written about the efforts of Republican’s to “reform” the tax system. As an aside, I would support at least a few of the provisions in the current bills. But for every good thing there are ten terrible ideas, both economically and politically. If it passes, I believe that it will be an albatross around the party’s neck in 2018. Notwithstanding the utter irresponsibility of adding another $1-2 trillion to the debt, supported by idiots like Malibu, who opposed deficit spending by Bush and Obama when the economy was on life support, there are things that are almost unimaginable. For example, since 35% of American stock is now held overseas, the bills would result in a windfall for those investors. Between $31 billion (Senate bill) and $50.4 billion (House) that was going into the treasury will remain overseas. In comparison, the total combined tax cuts for families in the lower 80% of income brackets in the 30 states won by Trump, would be $39.4 billion. Ship that money overseas, make America weaker again!
We won’t have to wait for the deficits to see the war on the poor. Republicans have refused to renew CHIP, the Childrens Health Insurance Program. It cost $13.6 billion last year. That is about what Trump’s cabinet will gain from the bill. You righties who fell for this must be so proud.
So, back to my neighbours across the pond with another classic French funk release, this time from the mysteriously mustached bikers that called themselves the Harlem Pop Trotters. Bizarre name, bizarre front cover, but a great album of jazz/funk fusion.
I won't even pretend to have got my hand on an OG version of this as everything has it's limits including my bank account. This is from a French reissue by Kif/Melodie En Sous Sol from 2004 which is very reasonably priced and definitely worth picking up. The original version appeared on the highly collectible Les Treteaux label home to many much sought after records including the legendary Godchild.
To my shame I know pretty much nothing about this band apart from that this appears to be their only album and that it was released in the mid seventies. I have also been led to believe that the men behind it are Library musicians Jean-Claude Pierric and Francois Rolland though I can't back that up with proof. I like to think that this adds to the legend of the album but that could just be me being lazy.

A Forum post raises a question of the practical usage of streaming in the ASN.1 code generated by asn1c:
Hello, I want to use the protocol to send a lot of data, but the device isn't able to hold the whole amount of received data in RAM. It has to work only with parts of the structure at a time.
If I get only the first half of the Big Message, I want to work with all received messages and then I have to to free my buffer due to limited resources. When I get the second part, I want to work on it and I want to know, if the message was valid...
The ASN.1 streaming is easily the most exciting thing the asn1c has to offer. It's not something that's needed too often, but when it does, it's invaluable. Let's split the problem into two parts: how to decode in constant space and how to encode in constant space.
Today's email was asking me about an interesting case of ASN.1 extensibility. Usually, extensibility means adding new members to existing structures. In this case, the user was asking whether ASN.1 supports removing structure members.
I am using the ASN.1 compiler and for an application I am developing. I am using this to store the datastructure in a file, for persistence. I am trying to find out whether forward compatibility is support. By this I mean the following.
Now when I read the existing file (generated with the older version of ASN.1 specification) with the newer version of the software, I get the following data back: x = 111, and z = 222.
Can you please tell me whether it is possible to get x = 111 and z = 333. If yes, then what ASN syntax should I follow? I am using der_encode and ber_decode.
After co-founding Echo, I had to put the asn1c's development on hold, for the sheer lack of time. (If you don't know what my asn1c is, think of it as the most evolved open source ASN.1 compiler.) Despite suspending development, I've been tracking the ASN.1 evolution, as well as the emergence of some newer technologies competing with what ASN.1 has to offer. I am referring to FaceBook's Thrift, Google's Protocol Buffers, Cisco's Etch, and the likes. Yet to this day I had no opportunity to actually use any of those in production.
I have my own personal score with the ASN.1 world. The standard is laden with design-by-committee complexity, no doubt evolved to “address the real world demands”. Its mind-numbing standardese and semantics effectively prohibit any newcomer from ever entering this field and producing a decent new compiler. So, we're stuck with something like 2.5 alive ASN.1 compilers covering some 3 mainstream languages (C++, C#, Java). The commercial products are often cost prohibitive: they're squarely aimed at rich telecom market. Where would a small Ruby or Python startup go? (While I am at it, Erlang has a free decent ASN.1 compiler, you know).
Yet, there's an opposite side to this complexity. Many things you struggle with or “invent” for the purpose of better data serialization have already been invented in the ASN.1 world. Things like broiled-to-perfection TLV-based encodings (BER/DER/CER), bitwise Packed Encoding Rules (competing with gzip'ing your serialized binary blob), Information Object Classes (think of SNMP MIB macros on steroids), or Encoding Control Notation have a lot to offer and learn from.

Even though Halloween ranks last on my list of favorite holidays, it does fall during my favorite season. I do find it fun to participate in the seasonal festivities. In honor of that, I’ve created a list of suitable Halloween themed entertainment that fits the theme without including a scare factor. Consider these movies, books and songs for the upcoming weekend and holiday.
Edward Scissorhands: Despite the seemingly eerie, Frankenstein-like concept of Johnny Depp’s character having large scissors for hands, this story explores the scary consequences of fearing differences or unknown. Kind hearted Edward enters a new community and navigates interactions with neighbors as they respond differently to the newcomer. Winona Ryder’s character’s family welcomes them into their home and provides some romantic intrigue.
Warm Bodies: This movie also tackles the treatment of those considered different. It has the added bonus of being a zombie story following the love saga of Romeo and Juliet. The main walking dead character goes by R, and he meets Juliet and attempts to get her to safety. As Juliet figures out that R somehow has some humanity left, she works to uncover the rest of R’s name and details. I love this movie. It has a great story, awesome soundtrack and a beating heart.
Twilight: What falls under the Halloween category better than vampires? This year also marks the 10 year anniversary of the release of the movie. Again, this movie follows a forbidden love story and focuses more on the romance and friendships than horror. This vampire clan doesn’t even feed on humans.
Dracula by Bram Stoker: I’m currently reading this for the first time. This classic text begins the vampire legacy and introduces Count Dracula. Though it may venture more into the scary realm, I look forward to learning more about the vampire lore. Something tells me it differs a bit from what we see in the Twilight Saga. Also, the diary entries end on November 6, the same day Stranger Things begins in 1983.
Frankenstein by Mary Shelley: This classic story celebrates its 200 year publication anniversary. Where Dracula shares the first background of vampires, Frankenstein serves as part of science fiction’s development as Victor Frankenstein conducts his famous experiment. Perhaps the inspiration for Edward Scissorhands, this book depicts a scarier outcome from an experiment resulting in a creature.
The Rules of Magic by Alice Hoffman: My best friend and I have chosen this prequel to Practical Magic as our fall themed buddy read. This story maintains the light hearted and romantic vibe from Practical Magic as it follows three young siblings coming of age. Growing up feeling different but having the truth avoided by their parents, they finally learn their heritage. Part of that involves a curse that hurts anyone who loves them, and the teens must decide how to navigate their identity and their choices.
This song captures 80s pop culture as much as it does Michael Jackson’s rise as the King of Pop. Fun rather than scary, the hit has pep and even includes its own zombie inspired dance. It also makes a perfect background song for the Stranger Things 2 trailer, a modern cultural phenomenon showcasing the 80s that released Halloween weekend last year.
This song has the lyrics and the video to capture the more emo side of Halloween. The music video takes place what could represent Dracula’s castle and its eerie outskirts, including a graveyard. The song mentions nightmares and references Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas. It even uses a simile comparing a spider eating insects caught in its web to relational angst as they sing, “like the webs from all the spiders/ catching things and eating their insides/ like my indecision to call you…” Oh, how I miss the teenage years when I first heard this song.
You can't make advances if you don't take chances. These posts share my perspectives of my journey as I step forward, walking in the Light.

On September 5th, 2017, President Donald Trump announced his intent to rescind the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program after a six-month waiting period. While the administration claims that the status of DACA recipients is not in jeopardy within those six months, it is unclear what further actions may be taken.
Therefore, Global Programs recommends that those in the DACA program do not pursue study abroad. Doing so would increase the risk of deportation from the United States upon attempted re-entry into the country.

Bad boy business casual is a great way to look killer and stay professional. Alpha welcomes you to the next installment of Bad Boy Style video series. Aaron Marino of alpha m. presents bad boy work wear. It's all about consistency, so keep it bad boy consistent! Alpha demonstrates what bad boy business casual DOES NOT look like. Bad boy is more about HOW you are wearing rather than WHAT you are wearing. Alpha starts at the shoes. They are stylize, sleeker, streamline, and lower profile. Pants are fitted and slimmer with flat front. The belt matches. The shirt is fitted and works... and check it out, no undershirt! Bad boy style has been elevated. But how to take it to a 10? Change black shoes for tan or chestnut which adds detail and dimension. If you're not into blue, go with white. Layer with a fitted v-neck sweater or rock a cardigan. And if you want to level up, add a sport coat and / or a tie. Great socks take it up another notch, but loud, zany socks are not an option with professional environment. Instead, opt for subtle and solid that coordinates with pants. The one thing that takes your bad boy persona to the next level are bad boy underwear. If you are gettin' down to bad boy business, the clothes are coming off, and you're wearing tired ass boxers, you are now William in Accounting again! Yo! Bill has left the building! Tani is bad boy underwear that is luxurious, has an amazing fit, and the fabric is 2nd to none! So for all of you viewers going back to around late 2013, you know that Alpha loves Tani.

Today marks my very first video devoted to Men's Fashion! I've been wanting to create some content centered around the subject for quite some time now. Some of the content in this video I actually got to use for another channel I manage for Easy Agent Pro. The center of focus in this video is men's business casual attire. All three of these outfits can be dressed up or down even further than what you see in this video. You have quite a bit of flexibility with everything I show you here. Before I dive into the outfits themselves though I bring some attention to some of the staple items of my wardrobe that I like to use on a very frequent basis. The Shoes, Watch, Belt, and Sunglasses #1 - Double Monks (Cole Haan) These are easily my favorite dress shoe, and they are definitely under-represented in the professional community. If you're looking to attract attention and stand out start with a pair of double monks. #2 - Chrono Watch (MVMT) Very simple and versatile watch that gives you plenty of flexibility. I'm a very big fan of MVMT, the balance of quality and price they bring to the table is insane. The cut out the middle man in the pieces which allow them to keep their costs lower than higher priced timepieces out there. #3 - Leather Belt Always make sure you have a belt and always make sure it matches your shoes. I matched the belt and shoes very closely here but you can also play around with different shades of brown to add more contrast between the watch, shoes, and watch. #4 - Clubmasters (Ray Ban) I've been a fan of Ray Bans since I was a little kid. This specific pair is a pair of clubmasters (black and gold). Subtle touches of gold can have a dramatic impact on the overall feel of an outfit. I defintly think it adds to the level of professinoalism in every single outfit.

It's often hard to bridge the gap between dressing well and dressing casually. Therefore I wanted to highlight 5 casual clothing items that every man should own. When I started to improve my style I naturally gravitated towards formal attire. I invested in suits, I wore shirts, I wore dress shirts and dressed up whenever I could. The issue? I worked from home. I hardly ever had to wear formal attire. My casual items consisted of very relaxed sportswear meaning I either overdressed or looked too underdressed. I wanted to give you 5 casual clothes that helped build my casual style alongside showing you some casual outfits for men. What one is your favourite? How many do you own?

What do you wear when the dress code says SMART CASUAL?https://gentl.mn/smart-casual #smartcasual #dresscode #notsponsored If you want to learn more about the different dress codes, click here: https://gentl.mn/2GsOyXz Interested in business casual? Watch this video https://gentl.mn/2Iugex4 SHOP THE VIDEO: 1. Petrol Blue Men's Gloves - https://gentl.mn/2E8wnEU 2. Reversible Scarf in Burgundy Red and Blue - https://gentl.mn/2J9ip9q The term casual today can be anything from gym clothes or athleisure, all the way up to something that's office appropriate such as a dress shirt and chinos. Now obviously, there is a big disconnect and just having the casual dress code is no longer enough. So if you get an invitation with a dress code smart casual, I hear your pain. You really don't know exactly what to wear so we'll help you out, we will define what smart casual is, what it's not, the historic background, as well as the do's and don'ts. So what exactly is smart casual? Historically, the term was coined because people showed up overly casual and the smart implied that you can't show up with joggers and trainers. If you look at the urban dictionary, it defines smart casual as a nonsensical dress code that people slap on to events, parties, and workplaces. Completely down to interpretation, this always causes confusion and often spectacular results. The mixture between smart and casual should not be taken literally. So while it's hilarious, sadly, it's not very helpful. So here is our definition of smart casual. First, the urban dictionary got it right by saying don't take it literally. That means, don't wear tennis shoes with a dress shirt, or combine sweatpants with a blazer. So in a nutshell, smart casual is not about mixing different pieces of clothing from different degrees of formality but rather to pick something that is in between a very casual outfit and a formal or businesslike outfit. A hoodie would be too casual and pleated wool dress pants would be too formal, instead, if you go with chinos, they are less formal, as well as a polo shirt, you hit that perfect sweet spot of smart casual. You can usually find smart casual dress codes in a social environment such as cruise ships, restaurants, or resorts. The whole idea is to look neat and presentable without being overly stuffy. So let's say you work in a white-collar office and you have an invitation to a smart casual event afterwards and you usually wear dress shirts, ties, and pinstripe suits, you definitely want to bring a change of clothes. Now that we defined the broad range of smart casual, let's talk about specific items you can wear. On the formal side would be an odd jacket or a blazer. Odd jacket meaning it has a bolder pattern, another color, and it doesn't match the pants. You don't want to wear a suit, a combination at most. When it comes to shirts, you should definitely stay clear of t-shirts but you can wear dress shirts. Go with checked shirts maybe in a collar such as the green one I'm wearing here right now. When it comes to pants or slacks, don't wear jeans and don't wear pleated pants made out of worsted wool because that's office wear and both of them are too extreme. When it comes to accessories, color is your friend. You can be much bolder than at the office and you can experiment and simply have fun. If you decide to wear a blazer or an odd jacket, I strongly recommend you wear a bold pocket square or maybe a boutonniere that is just contrasting, it's a pop of color, it's different, and it's fun. Another way I like to spice up smart casual outfits is to use colorful socks. You could be bolder, you can experiment, you can go really out there, or you can be a little more subdued. If it's cold outside and you need some gloves, I suggest to go with fun colors such as dark green, maybe a light tan, blue, or red, and stay clear of the traditional black gloves, or just boring Brown gloves. When it comes to shoes, I suggest you stay with leather shoes. They can have a leather sole or a rubber sole but they must not be black because that's too formal. Instead, go with brown tones or tans but you can also venture into green, maybe off-white, or dark burgundy red At the end of the day, it's your call. Personally, I'd always urge you to get a little bit more formal within the smart casual dress code because that way, you always look dapper and properly attired. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Want to stay updated?

When it comes to business attires, you just can’t just throw on the tee that sits nearest to you. You have to wake up shave, make sure your outfit is ironed without even a crease left and then head to work after setting your hair and polishing your shoes. Most firms have dress codes that you have to follow. Some of them are okay with their employees dressing informally while others are very strict about it. You don’t necessarily have to wear suits, on some occasions they look absurd as well. If you work at a fun place where no one wears suits and everyone is to dress casually then you can perhaps dress in any way you like. But that’s not how it is for most businesses. If you don’t want to wear a suit you still can’t wear ripped jeans. Here’s all the info you need on business attires. 1. Business Internship Attire 2. Business Attire for Seniors 3.

Here are the finer points of proper dress. Step 1: Put on your tails If the invitation says "white tie," men should wear a black tailcoat with a single stripe of satin or braid; a white pique wing-collared shirt with stiff front; a white vest, white bow tie, and white or gray gloves; and black patent leather shoes and black socks. Ladies should wear a floor-length evening gown. Tip In Europe, the man's tailcoat should have two stripes. Step 2: Get out your tux For black tie, men wear a black tuxedo jacket and matching pants; a pique or pleated front white shirt; a black bow tie; a black cummerbund or a vest; black patent leather shoes, black socks, and no gloves. Women can choose between a floor-length gown or a short, dressy cocktail dress. Tip In the summer or on a cruise ship, wear a white dinner jacket and black trousers. Step 3: Have your pick When the invite reads "black tie optional," men have the choice of a black tuxedo or a dark suit, white shirt, and conservative tie. Women have three choices: a gown, a cocktail dress, or dressy separates. Step 4: Be creative For "creative black tie" men can add a touch of whimsy to a black tux, like a colored or pattered bow tie. Women can jazz up their gown or cocktail dress with a feather boa, interesting shawl, or eye-catching jewelry. Step 5: Go halfway Wear a dark business suit with a white shirt and conservative tie to a "semiformal" event if you're a guy, and either a cocktail dress or a dressy skirt and blouse if you're a woman. Step 6: Be festive Think "bright," "sparkly," and "colorful" when the invite says "festive attire," which is basically cocktail party attire – business suit for men, and a cocktail dress or dressy pants outfit for women – with a holiday-themed accent. Step 7: Dress kind of casual Men, wear a sport jacket or blazer, slacks, and an open-collar shirt if the invite says "dressy casual" or "business casual." Ladies, wear a dress, a skirt with a fashionable top, or a sleek pantsuit for dressy casual and a skirt or slacks, and a shirt or sweater for business casual. Step 8: Look good Look good in whatever you're wearing and you can get away with breaking some of the previous rules. Did You Know? Nearly 40 percent of managers feel their workers dress too casually, according to one survey.
Whether you're going for the casual or formal look, we're going to talk about how to shop for men's dress shoes. Today we take a look at Stacy Adams shoes. The most important rule of thumb to remember is that a black, well polished, lace up dress shoe is the most appropriate for formal attire. As you get into different styles and colors, the shoe becomes less formal and more casual. So whether you're looking for a way to dress up jeans, or attending a black tie event, these tips should help you figure out the shoe must haves, to add to your ultimate shoe collection.

What to wear to a beach wedding? https://gentl.mn/beach-formal SHOP THE VIDEO: 1. Shantung Silk Striped Two Tone Bow Tie - https://gentl.mn/2tizSsh 2. Light Blue Veronica Persica Boutonniere - https://gentl.mn/2FqX4ZZ 3. Orange Mottled Knit Tie - https://gentl.mn/2Ff0XC2 What is Beach formal or Beach wedding? It's typically used for beach weddings and it's comprised of the most formal things you can wear at the beach without looking totally out of place. WHAT NOT TO WEAR: 1. Sandals First, never wear any sandals with a suit. It just doesn't go together. If you wear long pants, you could just take off your shoes, take off your socks and roll up the hems. That way it works with the beach wedding theme. 2. Shorts Don't wear a suit jacket or a blazer with shorts. That's maybe a look that is originally from Bermuda and they wear it with over the calf socks. 3. Short sleeved shirts Avoid bringing short-sleeved shirts because either you go a little more casual and have a polo shirt with short sleeves or you take a long-sleeve shirt and if it's quite warm you can simply roll up your shirt sleeves. 4. Monochromatic look By that, I mean pants or a jacket or shirt and even a tie all matching in the same color. It lacks contrast and overall monochromatic outfits are never flattering. What should you wear? First of all, if you think you don't have anything in your current closet it's better to buy something than to rent something because you can always wear it whenever you travel into warmer climates. So what are the items you should invest in? 1. Casual closed-toed shoes If you're often in warmer climates I suggest thinking about a perforated leather shoe because it's something that keeps you cooler and it's definitely more casual than a regular leather shoe. 2. Belt Just make sure it picks up some colors in your outfit. Definitely, don't show up in shorts unless the bride and groom have specifically asked you to do so. 3. Buttoned barrel cuffs It's just one layer of fabric and if you're really overheating you can even unbutton the shirt button on your cuff. 4. Suit Go with something lighter colored maybe a seersucker suit or a lighter suit maybe in khaki or tan or you can go with a combination of let's say seersucker pants and a lighter jacket like just the one I'm wearing here right now. Definitely, opt for more casual details in your jackets which means notch lapels or patch pockets rather than peak lapels and jetted pockets. 5. Accessories In terms of accessories, it's okay to go without neckwear because it is warm. However, it's a wedding after all and you want to put your best foot forward. I suggest to either go with a knit tie because it has an open weave or maybe a bow tie because it's lighter in weight. You can also have bolder colors or summery colors and you can look for fabrics like this shantung silk here which is more knobby and more casual than a traditional wedding tie or an office tie. On top of that, a little boutonniere in your buttonhole can be a nice addition. However, sometimes that's reserved just for the wedding party so when in doubt I'd rather skip the boutonniere and normally go with a pocket square. So you go with shoes do you need to wear socks? Basically, I always like to have over the calf socks that will take off. If that's too much for you maybe go with a pair of no-show socks so that way you have that beach look but you still have shoes on and you're not sweating or you don't get blisters inside your shoes. #notsponsored #beachformal #dresscode --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Want to stay updated?

Full Business Casual Guide, here: https://gentl.mn/2yWhx4p BUSINESS CASUAL SHOES: https://gentl.mn/2FhMPZ0 So how do we get from suit, dress shirt and tie to a very relaxed dress code with khakis and Polo shirts? Well, it all started with Aloha Fridays. This trend became quite popular in Hawaii and was eventually adopted on the mainland. Subsequently, people were familiar with it and wore it more often. So what does business casual mean in a nutshell? Basically, it means no suit but also no jeans. 1. White collar business casual - Bank, law firm, accounting firm The core piece in your wardrobe would be the dark navy blazer. Stick with just dark horn buttons. Stick with a single breasted and notched lapel look for a very normal appearance. You can also go with other kinds of sports coats that are patterned. When it comes to dress shirts, you should invest in some oxford shirts. They have a nice 2-tone appearance to them which makes them more casual and perfectly suited for business casual. When it comes to pants you can either wear chinos or khakis or dress pants in grey, light grey, mid-grey, not blue, especially if you have a navy blazer because it's too close but not the same. Basically, you want to have a certain amount of contrast. As far as accessories go, you can have a pocket square, you can go with a dressy watch or maybe with a naval strap to mix it up and make it more casual, depends on your specific office. When in doubt, always go a little more formal. For shoes and boots, you can basically wear anything in the color brown, reddish brown, or dark brown, maybe even tan. Since you're at the office, you should always bring a bag. A proper gentleman always carries a bag. It could be made of leather, of canvas, or a mix of the two but leave the backpack at home and only use it when you go hiking. 2. Service business casual or more relaxed office environments If you have client contact, chances are you are required to wear a jacket, sportscoat, blazer, at all times. If you're not, maybe you can get away with just wearing a dress shirt or a polo shirt. If you feel a sportcoat would be too formal, you can also try just to go with a vest because it's dressier than just a dress shirt but less formal than a jacket. For shirts, button down collars are good as well as long sleeved polo shirts. Neckties are entirely optional. At this level, denim or jeans are still not okay to wear, go with chinos or khakis. During the colder months of the year, sweaters of all kinds are great, you can either have them with a tie or without. Alternatively, have a cardigan or a sweater vest. Simply an ideal look for this environment because it's dressier than just having a shirt. As far as shoes go, I personally would suggest you go with classic shoes such as derbys, monk straps, loafers in brown because they work with everything and are just the perfect business look. Of course, the bag you should have can be a little more relaxed so it can be canvas, could be more weathered. Of course, a vintage leather patina bag is always appropriate and looks phenomenal. 3. Startup Business casual It's always to your advantage to put your best foot forward and that means, dressing up a bit more. Wear a polo shirt even if it's short sleeved. Rather than wearing shorts when it's warm consider maybe a pair of seersucker pants. Instead of crocs or flip-flops, switch over to boat shoes, you can also go with driving mocs and a sockless look. When it's cold outside, you can't just go to the office with just your blazer so ideal companions would be a trench coat in between seasons. When it gets much colder, you can get something like a peacoat which is shorter but it covers your jacket and it's very warm. If you want something lightweight that's more fun, you can think about something like a quilted jacket. #businesscasual #dresscode #notsponsored _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Most Popular videos: How to accept a compliment - https://youtu.be/_EKXNmM1PUo 101 things that change when you dress up - https://youtu.be/JyGDd_iYaCI How to tie a Bow Tie - https://youtu.be/2I3cfa0BOOc __________________________________________________________________ Want to stay updated?

For a more comprehensive guest attire guide: https://gentl.mn/what-to-wear-as-a-wedding-guest The number one rule as a wedding guest is that you never ever want to overshadow either the bride or the groom. Basically, you tone it down. You don't wear wild colors, you don't wear bold patterns or accessories like a top hat or something that makes maybe other people uncomfortable or something that is decidedly dapper than what the groom is wearing. If the wedding is an evening event, it's going to be more formal than a day event. As a man, you can wear a dark suit either a navy or charcoal. Traditionally, you should always have some form of neckwear. Definitely, avoid monochrome looks because it looks odd and there's not enough contrast. Your best bet for a wedding is a crisp white dress shirt although light blue may work as well. If you get an invitation that does not stipulate a dress code, please reach out to your host and ask them what would make them feel comfortable or what they expect. The most formal one you can find today is probably black tie. Most of the time in the US, you'll see black tie optional. That means you can wear black tie on some with the black bowtie. Another popular dress code for wedding is cocktail attire, it basically means you have a dark suit or suit has little sparkle or something special, a little more of a pop of color, a little louder than the business suit and you can wear a dress shirt, you can wear a tie, something that is still formal but just with a little more fun. If your wedding is an outer event or in a garden setting and it's during the summer, you can wear lighter colors but the best thing is to ask your host to get an idea of what kind of dress they want, And what kind of event it is. When it comes to accessories, apart from the tie, a pocket square is really fantastic because it elevates your outfit, it's very easy to fold, just takes a few seconds, and just underlines the event and its importance.

http://gentl.mn/best-cocktail-attire-men To get the accessories I'm wearing, visit links below: Field Scabious Boutonniere Buttonhole: https://gentl.mn/2kZZTof Madder Silk Tie in Purple with Paisley: https://gentl.mn/2kZRnW8 Pocket Square with Monogram Initial Classic White Irish Linen: https://gentl.mn/2kZWhm8 In today's video, we're going to talk about Cocktail attire for men. If you receive an invitation that asks for Cocktail attire, the proper thing to do is simply to adhere to it. But what does it really mean? Most of the time, this dress code is used for wedding invitations so let me go over what you should wear if the dress code is cocktail attire for a wedding. First is you want a dark gray to mid-grey suit. Preferably solid, you can also have a light pattern, a glen check or a shark skin but with solids, you're always right. If you must, Navy works as well. Two, you should have a white dress shirt, maybe off-white, you can also have maybe a white collar shirt with a striped body but it should be somewhat formal. Do not wear brown shirts or purple shirts or turquoise shirts, that just looks awful. Next up comes the neckwear, you should definitely wear a tie. Maybe a bowtie can get away with it but usually for the wedding, stick with the tie because you don't want to take attention away from the bride and groom. Ideally, what you can wear is a colored tie with a small pattern like the one I'm wearing right now in purple with some paisley or you can wear a solid necktie like the one here, you want some texture like a knit tie like this one is good or maybe you can also wear satin if it's an evening event but I would usually stay away from that and go with something a little more textured. Since this is a more festive event, you want to go with a pocket square. If you have a white shirt, a white pocket square works. If you have a different colored shirt, use a different kind of pocket square. For shoes, you should preferably go with black dress shoes, that means leather sole and neatly polished black cap toe Oxford is ideal. If you must, you can also get away with burgundy, try not to go with tan shoes or anything like that. No sneakers, no trainers, black men's dress shoes, please. What's really important is that you wear over the calf socks because you never want to expose your hairy calves to the public so make sure you get over the calf socks that ideally match your trousers and then you'll be just fine. If you want to add a dash of color, you could also use socks that are slightly contrasting, maybe taking up the color of your tie but that's a little more advanced so it's up to you. Make sure you have a good clean hair cut, trimmed at the back. If you have a beard, of course, you want to be well groomed and it's all suppose to look neat. Never wear a tuxedo when the invitation states cocktail attire because that's simply overdressed, it's wrong and it's not an option so if it says "black tie optional", you can wear a tuxedo but when it says "cocktail attire", stick with a suit. As a general rule, you should always keep in mind that more patterns, more colors make things stand out more so ideally, if you're not quite comfortable yet, just start with one accent piece, either you have a bolder color jacket or you have a strong red or yellow tie. Don't try to mix it all together, try to go one accent piece at a time and if you feel more comfortable, maybe you can add two but never overdo it. Chances are, you already have the core pieces like the jacket, suit, and the shirts in your wardrobe but if you want to create a unique look with that boutonniere, pocket square, and tie, check out our selection of Fort Belvedere things, everything you see here, is available in our shop and much more. ======================================= To never miss any of our videos again, sign up here for free: http://gentl.mn/1RKv7bi Want to see more videos?

For our full-fledged written guide, click here: https://gentl.mn/boots-for-men-styles-and-mistakes #bootsformen #notsponsored #mensboots Get the accessories I'm wearing: Two-Tone Knit Tie in Black and Magenta Pink Changeant Silk: https://gentl.mn/2kdcO9i Ivory Silk-Wool Pocket Square with Hunting Motifs:https://gentl.mn/2lyQaUV Unfortunately, there's not one boot that works for everybody because we all have different needs and preferences. 1.Chukka boot or desert boot A great boot for students. You can invest in one pair of boots and it works with a lot of combinations. It's also a fantastic boot for men who like to wear denim or jeans. It's a boot that pairs well with corduroys when it's cold outside during fall & winter, or with khakis when it's warmer outside. I suggest you go with a dark brown, a choco brown, or a mid brown because it's most versatile. If you wear a lot of suits, it's not the boot for you because it's very suited to casual outfits. 2. Jodhpur boots. Personally, I like them a lot because they have a very clean, elegant silhouette yet, they have some history. The characteristic of Jodhpurs is the buckle and it goes around. I think it works really well with casual suits, flannel suits, and sport coat combinations. You can also pair it with a leather jacket or jeans, or chinos. Because there's no broguing and it's a flat boot, you can also pair them with a regular suit. It's great for men who like clean, classic, elegant lines and you don't just want to buy a boot anybody else has. Ideally, a mid brown or something lighter, maybe tan, works best and it's most versatile. If you're in a hurry and you don't have the time to buckle the boot every time and take it off, it's not a boot you should go for. 3. Chelsea boots A timeless classic because they have that insert and it's easily recognizable especially if you have a colored insert just like here. They're perfect for men who look for a convenient, easy slip on version of the boot. Even though they're quick to put on, they are super elegant and classy and don't look sloppy at all. They're also great for eccentrics because you can add green, red, or blue inserts that really give you a personal note. I believe every man should have at least one Chelsea boot in their wardrobe because they are so timeless, versatile, and easy to use. 4. Balmoral boot It's a classic dress boot that works well with formal outfits. It's basically the choice of elegant gentlemen who want something like an oxford shoe as a boot version. It's a fantastic boot if you have lots of formal outfits in charcoal, navy, and grey. It's also fantastic with three-piece suits or you can wear it with a morning coat, or with a stroller suit. I suggest you start with black with black suede insert. If you are more advanced, you can have a contrasting insert in beige or buff or off-white and if you have that, you can move on to something in brown, burgundy, or other colors. 5. Winter boots If you live in a climate where it gets close to freezing outside, you need winter boots. They may just look like regular boots but they have a wonderful fur lining. With fur, I usually mean sheepskin or lamb skin. It's quite plush and insulating and cozy warm especially if you're outside a lot when it gets cold. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most Popular videos: How to accept a compliment - https://youtu.be/_EKXNmM1PUo 101 things that change when you dress up - https://youtu.be/JyGDd_iYaCI How to tie a Bow Tie - https://youtu.be/2I3cfa0BOOc --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Want to stay updated?

Solution copyright © Mike Marcelais. Version 1.2, June 13, 1999. The newest version of this solution is always delivered to the Spoiler Centre: http://www.the-spoiler.com/ first. Check here for the latest and most complete version before complaining to me. Thanks to Andrew Becker and Mark Sunderland for providing some of the information in this solution. Introduction. Might and Magic VI is a very loose game -- i.e., there is very little linearity. To solve the game merely means going to each location and dealing with all of the small quests in the area and exploring the local dungeons. Because of this freedom, the walkthrough will be in the style of a "tour" of the lands. Each major grid location is listed (along with a screen capture of the map from the game), and all surface locations noted.
For towns, each building is described, along with what and who can you can talk to, who to buy skills from, and what quests are available. For the outlying areas, the dungeons are listed. Dungeon maps are not given -- they would be too extensive to fit easily into a web page and the automapping in the game is excellent. Also, every dungeon should be explored completely to get all of the loot, but only puzzles and hidden locations are described. I also skip most of the fighting because it isnt something that you can easily describe, nor does it matter in most places, except that you have to survive it. I do list the creatures that you will encounter in a dungeon or grid location to give you an idea of how difficult the location is. Stores are listed with a "buy" and "sell". The "buy" value is multiplied by the items value to determine the price you have to pay for it. The "sell" value is divided by the items value to determine the price you can sell it to the store for. Higher is always worse, and a "buy" or "sell" of 1 means that you are buying/selling an item at cost. Every location has a "reset" timer. This starts when you first enter the area, and after it "goes off", the entire grid square resets: monsters reappear and random treasure is replaced. Nonrandom treasure (including most stat-gaining liquids) is not replaced. All dungeons have a reset of 2 years (24 months), unless otherwise noted. Overland areas have reset times listed with their descriptions. Artifacts are unique items that can be found. They come in two flavors: Minor artifacts are always benificial and have a value of 20000gp. Major artifacts always have a drawback, but their benificial powers are much stronger. They have a value of 30000gp. There are 15 minor and 15 major artifacts -- some of these artifacts are placed at specific locations; others are randomly generated. Table of Contents.

Mother Gaia February 2, 2017 by Laura Phoenix https://www.facebook.com/mothergoddess36 Since the beginning of time we have been fighting the battle of the sexes . I pushed away the divine masculine, it felt like it threatened my power . I didn't allow it to nurture me anymore . I didn't know how to balance this energy. I am a very evolved soul but at the time I was just experiencing with creators energy through me . The power of the divine masculine is just as powerful as the divine feminine. I feel that women have been trying to focus in the divine feminine but have forgotten the value of the divine masculine energy. Just as I Gaia have neglected it in the past. It has returned to the planet to help me heal. The divine masculine has return to me once again. Time is an illusion, we are in the now, we are healing all time lines. As they are existing now. You assumed the divine feminine has been missing. It was both. There is balance that was lacking in my being. I didn't allow the divine masculine to merge with me anymore. Now it has returned in this life time, and you are experiencing it on earth. I am allowing it to nurture me when I'm in pain. It is nurturing the entire planet. I indeed need the nurturing energy of the divine masculine energy. Everyday I feel this energy growing stronger in my being. It's breaking down the energy blocks in the earth. It's flowering my consciousness. It's also flowering your consciousness. Be acceptive of the power from the divine masculine. It has so much to offer the earth. We have neglected the divine power of the divine masculine. This energy is not only merging in me. It is being reborned. I'm caring this divine masculine in my womb. I am transmuting all the energy of the divine masculine, returning it to its purity once again so we can merge as one.

For more videos on technology, visit http://www.Techytube.com By [email protected] SQL server is a powerful database platform, this means that it can also be complex to understand and work with. However the major users of the data in the database are still a non-technical business user. A key problem that most business users face when it comes to working with SQL Server is the dependency on an IT professional to query and return the data in a CSV format or Excel sheet. With the ability of MS Excel to be able to connect to SQL Server via the ODBC Drivers allows users to work with SQL tables within the familiar Excel User interface. This approach allows users to be productive with SQL Server without having to know Transact SQL. The feature set provided with MS Excel and newer versions of SQL allow business users to do much more than just query the database. These include the ability to query and view data in pivot format for large data sets using power pivot. Perform ad hoc calculations to underlying data and create models that are specific to their business case using the powerful DAX language. Embedding reports in SharePoint services using PowerPivot. Working with Excel is one of the most powerful ways that end users can work with MS SQL Server to deliver results faster and improve productivity.

Many people know Chicago has a vibrant restaurant culture and is home to some of America’s biggest food companies, but they may not know about the start-up culturing blossoming in the shadow of the city’s skyscrapers, with success stories like RXBar and SkinnyPop just two of the notable success stories.
The City of Big Shoulders​ has 4,500 food and beverage companies, from ranging in size from the enormous like Kraft-Heinz, Mondelez, ConAgra, Mars-Wrigley Confectionery, and McDonald’s to some very innovative start-ups and everything in between.
The Chicagoland Food and Business Network​ (CFBN) launched in April 2017 to bring the industry players together, to provide a forum for collaboration and support, and to bridge the divide between big and small. Other cities in the US are also doing a fine job of nurturing entrepreneurial food and beverage companies, but few, if any, can compare with Chicago, says Alan Reed, CFBN’s executive director.
“Because of the scale and scope of the food industry here, what I’ve heard from entrepreneurs elsewhere, if you want a food and beverage attorney in Austin there are a couple. We have 20 and they’re all experienced with different points of view,” ​said Reed. “It’s similar for PR firms and design agencies and accountants and consultants. With this great scale and scope comes this great depth of experience and talent. ​

Here you will find ideas for holding your own robotics competitions, and also information about current and completed Parallax contests and design challenges.
See which robot can locate the opening in a Box Maze and escape in the shortest time — a Robot Competition Idea for the Boe-Bot, Shield-Bot, or ActivityBot robot.
Devise a strategy to touch the walls at as many high-scoring spots as possible in 60 seconds. The catch? Students don't know the numbering until 30 minutes before the contest! A great idea by Gary Reynolds, Physics Instructor at Santa Ana High School.
Touch sensors and accurate turning are the skills being tested as a robot drives from wall to wall, aiming to touch the high-scoring spots as many times as possible in 60 seconds.
Can your student's robots run through the maze without touching the masking tape, yet stop right on the target?
A test of skill in tuning robots to drive straight, without the use of encoders, plus the ability to sense and stop at a wall.
Challenge your competitors to run a 3-dimensional maze in this Robot Competition Idea provided by the Zillah Robot Challenge.
Robot Competition Idea - Like two cyclists in a velodrome, two robots start simultaneously at opposite sides of an oval wall and see which robot can catch up with the other first. PING))) Ultrasonic Distance Sensors are used to detect the wall — but touch it, and you're out!
The objective of this game is for the S2 robot to activate 10 flags located in the competition field. When the S2 robot bumps the front of the Kicker, a Flag goes up. The S2 robot that raises the most flags wins.
Sized for classrooms, this Robot Competition Idea is designed for Parallax ActivityBot, Boe-Bot, Shield-Bot or SumoBot chassis-based robots. The objective is to find and push the most objects off of a low platform in the least amount of time. Creative use of sensors and custom-built plows encouraged!
This challenge consists of each SumoBot robot seeking out the opponent robot and pushing it out of the Sumo Ring (thereby earning a Yuko point), and to avoid being pushed out of the Sumo Ring itself. A game for the SumoBot Competition Kit and Applied Robotics with the SumoBot.
This challenge consists of a race between two S2 (Scribbler) robots, each in their own track separated by a wall, with a cross-over point. The S2 robots can navigate by detecting the walls or following a black line on the tracks.
This competition is a timed aerial race where the racing track is set up in 3 dimensions. It is open to any fixed multi-rotor aircraft, including the ELEV-8 Quadcopter.
This Boe-Bot style robot challenge consists of distributing the colored balls into the different scoring zones of the field. Each ball must be taken into a matching color zone.

Blockchain technology is the biggest innovation after the internet, this technology is going to be the next big thing in the fitech world as well as in other sectors. The technology became popular with the introduction of the bitcoin crypto-currency, the first usage of digital currency transfer.

On the bitcoin, the technology is backed by blockchain, works on the decentralized system making all the transactions safe and secure. The first bitcoin market was set up and allowing the exchange of money for bitcoins in October 2009. According to CB Insights, in the USA, the number of deals in bitcoin and blockchain reduced to 132 in 2016 from 161 in 2015.
In India, the demand for blockchain based solutions has significantly increased after hacking incidents with leading banks. The financial institutions, fintech companies, entrepreneurs, governments find the blockchain technology as the alternative and revolutionary technology. The blockchain technology would go to the mainstream in a couple of years.

Transparency: When it comes to peer to peer transactions, it should be more transparent. Blockchain transactions can’t be tampered or deleted post-execution.
Reduce Process Time: The transactions over blockchain platform would consume very less time comparing to the existing platforms. There won’t be any centrally authorized process to complete all the transactions.
The blockchain technology is going to change the fintech world in the future as the companies in the financial domain have already explored this as an alternative method. The search for “blockchain” has increased by 1900 percent since 2013 on Google.

The UC Davis Student Housing department welcomes you to your new home. We’re glad you’ve chosen to live in the residence halls and we look forward to a successful and exciting year.
Our purpose is to provide you with a safe, pleasant living environment which supports and enhances the academic mission of the university. We think you will find the halls well maintained and staffed to assist you in your transition to university life. Our University Dining Services offers nutritious and satisfying meals. We also provide many social, educational, and cultural opportunities that will complement your learning experience at UC Davis.
"The University of California, Davis, is first and foremost an institution of learning and teaching, committed to serving the needs of society. Our campus community reflects and is a part of a society comprising all races, creeds and social circumstances. The successful conduct of the university's affairs requires that every member of the university community acknowledge and practice the following basic principles:
We affirm the inherent dignity in all of us, and we strive to maintain a climate of justice marked by respect for each other. We acknowledge that our society carries within it historical and deep-rooted misunderstandings and biases, and therefore we will endeavor to foster mutual understanding among the many parts of our whole.
We affirm the right of freedom of expression within our community and affirm our commitment to the highest standards of civility and decency towards all. We recognize the right of every individual to think and speak as dictated by personal belief, to express any idea, and to disagree with or counter another's point of view, limited only by university regulations governing time, place and manner. We promote open expression of our individuality and our diversity within the bounds of courtesy, sensitivity and respect.
We confront and reject all manifestations of discrimination, including those based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, religious or political beliefs, status within or outside the university, or any of the other differences among people which have been excuses for misunderstanding, dissension or hatred. We recognize and cherish the richness contributed to our lives by our diversity. We take pride in our various achievements, and we celebrate our differences.
We recognize that each of us has an obligation to the community of which we have chosen to be a part. We will strive to build a true community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring."
The University of California, Davis, does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, pregnancy (including pregnancy, childbirth, and medical conditions related to pregnancy or childbirth), physical or mental disability, age, medical condition (cancer related or genetic characteristics), ancestry, marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or service in the uniformed services (includes membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation for service in the uniformed services) status as a Vietnam-era veteran or special disabled veteran, in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws, and with University policy. As required by Title IX, the University of California, Davis, does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its educational programs, admissions, employment, or other activities.

Inquiries related to Title IX at the UC Davis Medical Center may also be referred to the Deputy Title IX Coordinator for the UC Davis Medical Center:
Student Housingâ€™s mission is to provide living, dining and academic support services that facilitate a successful transition to the UC Davis community and foster ongoing learning and life-skill development.
The University of Californiaâ€™s Sustainable Practices policy provides a strong framework for the continued development of sustainable practices. The definition of sustainability is â€œto meet the current populationâ€™s needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs,â€ Brundtland Commission (1987). Student Housing and Dining Services at UC Davis is dedicated to this effort and strives to be a model program for the integration of sustainable practices. We are committed to developing and maintaining healthful educational living and working environments while fully integrating sustainable practices.
Institutionalize sustainable practices such as: green building design, clean energy, energy efficiency, sustainable building operations, recycling and waste management, sustainable food services, sustainable water systems and more.
Use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system as a guide for new construction projects, renovation projects and ongoing maintenance of facilities.
Educate residents and staff through presentations, involvement, work groups and the development of living- learning environments.
You can take action to contribute to UC Davisâ€™ sustainability efforts. For more information on Student Housing and Dining Services sustainability efforts and actions you can take, please visit housing.ucdavis.edu/sustainability.
Just ask the chef to customize your meal to your liking i.e. ask for no bun, half portion, no cheese
Residence hall staff are here to help you! You will no doubt get to know many of the Student Housing staff whose job it is to help make your residence hall experience an enjoyable one. The staff who work in your area are well trained and eager to be of assistance. Please introduce yourself and ask them for help when you need it.
Residential Education Staff are primarily responsible for planning and supervising programs offered in the halls. The central staff (160 Student Housing, 530-752-1736) works closely with residents in promoting a well-balanced array of services and programs for you.
Coordinators are full-time professional staff, many with advanced degrees as well as extensive experience working with students. Some of their duties include helping residents with academic, housing, and personal issues; advising residence hall activities; providing residents with educational programs; supervising and training the Senior Resident Advisors; and helping students develop positive communities. There are three to four coordinators working in each of the three residence hall areas.
Senior Resident Advisors (SRAs) are upper division undergraduates who live in the halls. Their role is to assist the coordinators with Resident Advisor supervision and daily facility operations.
Resident Advisors (RAs) are undergraduates who live in the communities and have extensive experience with student concerns and campus resources. They receive many hours of training and are available to help you with problems and questions. RAs are knowledgeable about academic advising and can help you meet your academic goals. Another of their roles is to help you and your neighbors create a positive and productive living environment. They are also responsible for communicating and interpreting Student Housing policy and are expected to respond to policy violations. Resident Advisors will sponsor and help organize many social and educational programs throughout the year.
Residential Services staff (160 Student Housing, 530-752‑2033) are the people to contact if you are leaving school, participating in the Planned Educational Leave Program [PELP], transferring to another campus, or graduating.
Area offices are the hubs of many activities that affect daily life in the halls. Residents should get to know the office coordinators and the student staff. Office coordinators are responsible for resident and public contact. They oversee Area Service Desks (ASD) and mail service operations and supervise students who work at the ASD and deliver mail. Residents can report needed repairs, pick up packages, obtain general information, check out cleaning supplies, lockout keys, temporary access cards, games, sports equipment and kitchenware. Area Service Desks are open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., Monday through Friday, and noon to 11 p.m., Saturday and Sunday. Holiday service desk schedules are posted prior to each holiday.
Custodians in each residence hall area are responsible for helping you keep common areas, e.g. community bathrooms, hallways, and lounges clean. Custodians report maintenance and equipment problems to keep your community in good repair. Custodians have a heavy workload and are not expected to clean up unusual or excessive messes; they are required to report such incidents. The cost of cleaning is charged to the community by a reduction in community damage funds.
Maintenance staff are highly skilled individuals who perform all basic maintenance in the halls. Routine requests should typically be handled within two working days. Prompt reporting of damages and service needed keep rooms, suites, and halls in good shape. Residents are not authorized to perform repairs. Service requests can be submitted at any time through MyUCDavis on the Student Housing channel.
Food Service Directors provide a variety of food service information aimed at making your dining experience exciting and new.
Residential Student Accounts staff are located in the Student Housing Office, Room 170 and are available if you need information regarding housing costs, payments and meal plans. They can be reached at 530-752 2481.
No coin necessary to dial 911 from pay telephones and charge-a-call phones. When reporting an emergency by dialing 911, your phone number and address are automatically displayed at the Campus Emergency Dispatch Center. This allows the center to quickly locate you if your call is disrupted by a crisis. If you have an emergency call or if you are calling from a cell phone, call 530/752-1230 for police or 530/752-1234 for fire or ambulance.
The Student Health & Wellness Center is open Monday through Friday from 8am‑5:30pm, except Wednesday (9am-5:30pm) and Saturday (9:30am‑1pm). It is closed on holidays.
Call the UC Davis Escort Service if you would like a safety escort while walking on campus at night. A Cal Aggie Host will escort you to your campus destination or residence hall. For hours of operation, please see http://police.ucdavis.edu/campus-services/aggie-host-program-escort-service.
Student Housing attempts to house as many students as feasible at the lowest possible cost. To accomplish this, there must be a consistently high occupancy level. Therefore, all housing contracts that begin fall quarter are effective for the entire academic year; residents are expected to comply with the provisions of that contract to the fullest. Be sure to read the contract and its conditions carefully so that you will know what is expected of you. Entering into any other housing agreement during the period of your contract will have no effect upon the conditions of your existing housing contract, unless specifically agreed to in writing by the student and the university
Refer to the Residence Hall Fee Schedule on the Residence Hall Fees webpage to determine payment amounts for your specific room configuration and meal plan option. The fall quarter housing fees are due September 15, winter quarter housing fees are due December 15, and the spring quarter housing fees are due March 15.
Housing payments become delinquent after the tenth of the month; if this falls on a weekend, payment must be made the Monday immediately following. To ensure consistency regardless of payment method, all payments must be received by 4pm on the tenth day of the month to avoid a $75 late fee.
Payments must be delivered or mailed to the Cashierâ€™s Office in Dutton Hall. Make check payable to UC Regents. Include your name and student identification number or use the payment coupons provided in your online housing assignment information. Mail payments to: Cashierâ€™s Office PO Box 989062 West Sacramento, CA 95798-9062. Campus mailboxes are located in each residence hall area can be used to send check/money order payments without postage. View other payment options by going to mybill.ucdavis.edu.
If you have problems making a payment, contact the Residential Accounts Office at Student Housing , Room 170, 530-752-2481, before the due date to discuss payment options.
A computerized program randomly assigns roommates based on information provided on your Room Assignment Request. You and your roommate should have a conversation about individual likes, dislikes, needs, and use of the room and belongings. The more you are prepared for possibilities that could arise, the more enjoyable your roommate relationship can be. Communication goes a long way toward heading off potential problems and establishing understanding. Each person can expect their roommate and neighbors to have different outlooks, traits, likes, dislikes, and lifestyles than their own. Roommates are required to fill out Roommate & Suitemate Agreement Forms at the start of the year and whenever a person moves to a new room. Students are not released from their housing contract due to roommate conflicts and Student Housing may administratively relocate students to resolve conflicts. If you have difficulty communicating with your roommate, contact your RA, SRA, or one of the professional staff in your area for assistance.
Students with a vacancy within their room/suite must be prepared to have a new roommate at any time. Residents are expected to be welcoming to prospective new roommates and should not discourage others from occupying a space. Students that discourage others from moving into vacant spaces may be relocated to a new room and/or referred for disciplinary action. Residents should not homestead the room: spread their belongings throughout the room or use furniture designated for the new resident. Residents found to be homesteading will be billed for costs required to make the contracted space available to a new resident.
Moving within the residence halls is not difficult but there are some important procedures you must followâ€”failure to do so will result in administrative charges for an unauthorized move! The room transfer period begins the second Monday of each quarter after instruction begins, and ends two weeks before quarterly final testing. During spring quarter, room transfers end four weeks prior to the end of the academic year. Refer to the online Student Housing calendar for specific dates. Room transfers are made based upon space availability. Students wishing to move to another room must meet with a coordinator to obtain a Room Transfer form. A coordinator must approve and sign the room transfer form. Students may not move (even within suites) without following the proper procedure. Your area office or Residential Services staff (530-752-2033) can provide details. The university reserves the right to assign or reassign students to other rooms and halls for pending disciplinary action or in order to make the most effective use of the available accommodations. If space is available, requests for room transfers because of personal safety concerns, i.e. physical or sexual assault, will be honored.
Students who withdraw from school, file for a planned educational leave [PELP], or transfer to another school must provide written notification and process a Notice of Cancellation with Residential Services [160 Student Housing]. Daily room and board charges will continue to accrue on a student's account until Student Housing is provided with written notification of student status and all proper check out procedures have been completed. If a student has unusual circumstances, a meeting should be set up with a Coordinator. The Coordinator will explain Student Housing's contract release policy and give advice on release procedures.
Students who get married while they are living in the residence halls or transfer housing can cancel their contract and apply to live in Solano Park or off campus. Student Housing requirements state that only students registered as full time students are eligible to live in the residence halls and Student Housing Apartments. Student Housing offers our Solano Park Apartments for married students and students with children. Please see Solano Park Apartments Information to learn more about the housing options for married students.
Students that are no longer eligible to live in the residence halls or have been released from their housing contract must go to Residential Services [160 Student Housing] to begin the check out process and complete a Notice of Cancellation. A check out packet must be picked up at the area office. Checking out involves cleaning your room/suite, returning your key, and filling out a forwarding address card. A pro rata adjustment of the quarterly room and board rate is based upon the date the written request is approved by Residential Services. Students moving out must return their portion of the room or suite to its original condition. New students assigned to the room have a right to a clean and properly furnished space.
As a resident of UC Davis' residence halls, you possess specific individual rights that your roommate and those living around you must respect. These rights carry with them a reciprocal responsibility on your part to ensure that these same rights exist for your roommate, suitemates, and other residents. Your basic rights are listed here; you and your community may choose to add to this list. It is important that these items and the concept of others' rights and responsibilities be discussed throughout the year.
UC Davis Student Housing neither can, nor does, guarantee you will achieve these rights at all times â€” you share the responsibility. Help ensuring these rights are upheld through thoughtful discussion and open communication with your roommates, suitemates, and other floor/hall residents. Student Housing staff is available and wants to help you accomplish this goal.
UC Davis residence hall students are responsible for their actions. You are expected to show respect for the rights of others and the educational mission of the university. Conditions that are part of your residence hall contract govern acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Residence hall staff will intervene if your actions are contrary to policy or considered a disruption to community standards. In addition, your behavior may prompt referral to the Office of Student Development, which will determine if contract termination, transfer to another space, or disciplinary sanctions are needed. Our sincere desire is that students will choose behaviors which support and respect all community members.
The Office of Student Judicial Affairs (sja.ucdavis.edu) is responsible for administering the university disciplinary process and will, if warranted, confer with and sanction students for behavior violating university policy. Students must comply with the University of California: Standards of Conduct for Students in the residence halls, and failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. Disciplinary sanctions include warnings, censure, restitution, probation, loss of privileges, suspension, or dismissal from UC Davis. A student's actions may also subject him/her to criminal or civil liability.
Student Housing staff, while striving to protect due process for individuals, are compelled to act on behalf of the interests of the entire community. Though we prefer to work directly with individuals involved in behavioral problems, students collectively involved in negative behavior can expect to be confronted and may be moved to other halls or have their contracts terminated. You are responsible for your actions and will be held fully accountable.
If something is illegal off campus, it's illegal on campus. University property does not insulate you from being accountable for all your actions.
The University of California: Standards of Conduct for Students (sja.ucdavis.edu/policies.html) extends beyond campus boundaries. As a UC Davis student, you are expected to adhere to a high code of honor and interact with others in a lawful, respectful, and honest manner on and off campus.
While the university community and the city of Davis are relatively small, friendly, and safe, neither is immune to the realities of the larger world. You will need to take precautions to secure personal property (e.g. locking your door, engraving your possessions, registering your bike). You must also consider your personal security and be aware of vulnerable situations. Keep your roommate and neighbors informed about your whereabouts and let them know when you will be returning home. When possible, travel with a friend and check campus maps for the best lighted paths. Report any suspicious activity immediately to your RA, SRA, or the police, and never leave outside doors or courtyard gates ajar. With so many people (and bikes, computers, and stereos, etc.) living together, the halls are prime targets for thefts. Your careful attention to security is in everyone's best interests.
The university expects all students to report crimes immediately by contacting the UC Davis Police. Fire, police or medical emergencies can be reported in person or by dialing 911 from any telephone on campus. Emergency aid can also be requested using the emergency system located in most campus elevators. If the call is non-emergency, or when calling from a cell phone, please dial the UC Davis Police Department at 530-752-1230 or the UC Davis Fire Department at 530-752-1234.
As you prepare to become more involved in the UC Davis community, you will have opportunities to share information about yourself. Some popular ways to share information are in the form of online journals, "blogs" and/or community websites. Take great care with the amount and type of information you advertise on the Internet. Anyone can access this information and use it to victimize you and/or your friends and family. You should not display your personal phone numbers, class schedules, screen names, date of birth and e-mail addresses. Although it is important to become a part of this community, do not put yourself at risk by offering personal information. Visit housing.ucdavis.edu/computers for more information about online security.
Access to residence halls is limited to building residents and their invited guests. In all areas, you will need your student ID card (AggieCard) to gain entrance into your building. You can promote building security by making sure doors and gates are locked whenever you enter or leave buildings â€” you can also help by not letting strangers into the building. If you jeopardize building security by loaning your access card, room key or corridor key to someone else, letting in strangers, or propping open doors or gates, you will be subject to disciplinary action. If you see someone loitering or acting peculiar, contact your RA, SRA, or the police department.
Residents in Cuarto will receive a key to access their rooms. Alder, Thompson, Miller, Bixby, Gilmore, Malcolm, Ryerson, Regan (all buildings), Kearney, Laben, Wall, Campbell and Potter Hall residents, as well as residents of Pine, Scrub Oak, Currant, Live Oak, Sequoia, Mahogany, and Hawthorne, will use their student ID card (AggieCard) to access their rooms. If your room key or student ID card (AggieCard) is lost or stolen, you are required to report it immediately to your area service desk. You will be charged $50 to re-key your room to protect your personal property and secure your safety as well as that of your roommate. Failure to report lost keys and access cards places you and your suitemates/roommates at risk.
If your room door has a lock button on the inside, simply pushing the button in does not fully lock the door â€” be sure to turn the lock 360 degrees with the key to make sure your door is locked. We strongly recommend you lock your room every time you leave and never allow anyone to enter your building that you do not think belongs there!
Be sure to carry both your room key and student ID card with you at all times. If you get locked out of your room or building, you may check out a temporary key or access card from the area service desk (ASD). ASD hours are 8am to 11pm, Monday through Friday, and noon to 11pm on weekends; holiday hours vary by holiday (check with the ASD for specific holidays) and an RA is on call. When the area service desk is closed, the RA on call in your area can check out a key or access card for you to use.
If you cannot come in person to get a temporary key/ access card, you must provide written authorization to be presented by the person sent to pick up your key; key permission slips are available at area service desks, or simply write a note including the date, your signature, your hall and room number, and the person's name authorized to pick up a temporary key/access card for your room. You must return the temporary key within three days; after five days your lock will be changed and you will be charged $50. Temporary access cards must be returned within three days, after which the card will be deactivated; a $25 administrative fee will be charged for each unreturned card.
Please be careful not to lock yourself out often â€” there is a $25 charge the fifth time you check out a temporary key and the fifth time you check out a temporary access card. Temporary keys and access cards must be returned immediately because they must be available to other residents in case of emergency.
If you lose your key or do not return your temporary room key to the service desk, your room lock will be changed. You will be charged for any lock change. We do this to protect the personal safety of you and your roommate, as well as the safety of your belongings. Your roommate and suitemates will need to be reissued keys as well.
If you lose or damage your original student ID card (AggieCard), you will need to get a replacement. Replacement AggieCards are available in the AggieCard office in 161 Memorial Union. A $15.00 replacement fee will be charged to your student account for a lost or damaged card (charge may vary; check with the AggieCard office for most current amount). After receiving your replacement card, please go to your Area Service Desk so they can update the Housing access system. Housing staff will notify University Dining Services to ensure that your meal access is also updated in their system.
The Residence Hall Watch Program is a community-sponsored program in which residents help protect themselves and their community by being alert and informing university police when a crime or suspicious activity is observed. This program has a very positive impact when residents join to make it work.
All desks in the residence halls have a 1"x4" hardwood horizontal brace that provides a place for you to lock down your computer with a cable or link chain if you would like to do so. What you will need is the following: Each piece of computer hardware [CPU, printer, monitor, etc.] you would like to lock down needs a link chain or cable affixed to it. The link chain would need to be at least 40" long; cable would need to be at least 6' long. You will also need a padlock. Make sure the "shackle" on the padlock is small enough in diameter to fit through the chain link, but long enough to fit through two chain links or both ends of your cable.
It is important to remember that the university does not assume any responsibility for the loss, damage or destruction of personal property kept in the halls or on university property, so think ahead about protecting your belongings. You may also want to take valuables home during the breaks. Some homeowner policies cover property away from home and special insurance can be purchased; check with your insurance agent. Student Housing maintains an Insurance Resources webpage, which has information about renters insurance and tuition insurance, for those who want to learn more.
UC Davis is served by its own police department with over forty police officers. UC Davis officers patrol campus 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and provide a full range of police-related services. The crime prevention unit gives presentations and provides information on personal safety. The department is on Kleiber Hall Drive, southeast of the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC) and across the street from Briggs Hall. Students are encouraged to tour the department and get to know officers by riding along with an on-duty officer.
Video cameras in the lobbies and exteriors of some residence halls have been installed to deter theft and vandalism and to assist in investigations after an incident has occurred. The cameras will store images to a computer for later viewing. Footage is not monitored so residents should take normal security precautions and not rely on the cameras as a security measure.
Fire safety is taken very seriously in the residence halls and you are expected to adhere to the following regulations. For reasons of safety, the fire department has imposed restrictions on furnishings and some electrical equipment. Large wall hangings [such as tapestry and large posters] must be treated with a flame retardant. Students are not permitted to use anything that produces an open flame, such as candles, cigarettes, hookahs, and incense, in their rooms or suites. Hallways and walkways, as well as building entrance and exit areas, need to be clear at all times. No items should be stored in these areas at any time. This includes, but is not limited to, bicycles and trash. Students may not store or repair motorized vehicles in the residence halls. It is also prohibited for students to store gasoline or other flammable liquids in any living units. Cooking/warming appliances may not be used in residence hall rooms with the exception of coffee pots, Keurigs and microwaves [see Electrical Safety]. Resident and Community Kitchens located throughout Student Housing should be used properly and maintained by the residents. Appliances in rooms often activate the sensitive fire alarm system; small appliances and hot air popcorn poppers may be used in community kitchens. No person may use or store fireworks of any type in residence halls or on campus.
All residence halls are equipped with fire detection devices and manual pull stations. When manual pull stations are activated, the building fire alarm will sound and the UC Davis Fire Department will respond. Student rooms in all residence halls are equipped with smoke detectors that sound a local alarm within the affected room. Residence halls also have fire detection devices in public and common areas that sound the building fire alarm and the Fire Department will respond. Fire Sprinkler/Riser Valves located in the Resident Hall stairwells are only to be handled/operated by authorized fire personnel, when operated/turned they will activated the building fire alarm and the FD will respond. Additionally, all residence halls (except for Emerson Hall) are equipped with an automatic sprinkler system that when activated will sound the building fire alarm and the Fire Department will respond.. Fire department personnel will respond immediately to all alarms with a full complement of firefighting equipment. It is the responsibility of each student to evacuate the residence hall when an alarm sounds; failure to leave during an alarm will result in disciplinary action.
Each resident needs to be aware of the sensitivity of fire detection devices in their rooms and hallways. They can be activated by foreign materials (e.g. water, smoke, aerosol sprays and dust) or sudden shock (e.g., being hit or touched). Fire detection devices cannot function as designed if they are covered, taken down, or have objects hanging from them. As a result, such activity is not permitted. Tampering with or activating an alarm in a non-emergency situation, or the presence of illegal cooking devices that cause an activation of the system, will result in disciplinary action as well as the assessment of a charge for costs attributed to the false alarm.
All living areas are equipped with fire extinguishers to be used in the event a minor fire occurs. Should a fire extinguisher not be present within 75 feet of your room or kitchen area, please notify residence hall staff or your area office.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued a warning to consumers that the light bulbs in most torchiere style halogen lamps can reach very high temperatures and could start a fire if they come in contact with curtains, clothes, or other flammable materials. It is because of this increased fire and safety risk that torchiere halogen lamps are prohibited in the residence halls.
Doors for rooms, stairways, and corridors are equipped with electromagnetic hold open devices and contain a self-closing device to aid in the closing/latching the door during a fire alarm activation. These doors cannot be propped open and tampering with these door is a violation of the fire/life safety code.
The use, possession, charging, and/or storage of hoverboards, defined as a battery operated, self-balancing devices used for personal transportation, is prohibited in any building owned or operated by Student Housing. The batteries in certain hoverboards may catch fire while charging and therefore present a significant safety risk.
The success of the Student Housing program depends on your involvement and support. All programs need students to participate in decision-making, planning, and implementing events. This is your community and you have the right and responsibility to help make it what you want it to be. In addition, your involvement in the following activities will be a positive addition to your resume and will enhance your academic experience at the university.
A great way to get to know people within your own community is by joining the neighborhood committee. This group plans activities and study breaks for the community.
One significant way for you to get involved in your new home is to take part in your community’s development. Residents are asked to discuss such things as quiet hours, lounge use, kinds and level of social activities, and expectations of roommates and other residents. These meetings provide you the opportunity to get better acquainted with other members of your community and to discuss community concerns.
The Residence Hall Advisory Board (RHAB) is an advisory group composed entirely of residents. They advise and give input to Student Housing administrators on any issues that affect residence hall students. If you are interested in becoming a member, or have a question or concern, contact your Resident Advisor.
A judicial board is composed of residence hall students who meet with students who have been involved in quiet hour policy violations, vandalism, messes, alcohol policy violations, or guest policy violations. The purpose of the board is to review and respond to the incident with the student and work with the student to establish guidelines for positive behavioral change.
Each residential area has a Leadership Council. The Leadership Council is designed to maximize student representation and involvement while providing leadership opportunities for residents. The Leadership Council sponsors and plans social, leadership and diversity education activities. Activities include dances, talent shows, leadership conferences and much more. All activities are planned by students with the advisement of the Leadership Coordinator.
Community Socials all have a Learning Outcome Objective tailored to the needs of individual community members.
The Student Housing Damage Reduction Program is designed to encourage residents to take responsibility for their living environment and thereby help reduce the cost of repairing damages and cleaning. Each year, a significant portion of the Student Housing budget is earmarked for repairing unnecessary damages and cleaning in the halls. If a community keeps the area clean and damages to a minimum, the balance will be returned to the students of that community. This money, the Damage Reduction Award, can then be used by the community for social activities, shirts, pictures, etc. Awards are distributed five times during the academic year.
Your role in the Damage Reduction Program can best be fulfilled by being an active and concerned community member. As a member of a residence hall community, you have a responsibility to those with whom you are living and to the physical environment. Your responsibilities as a community member in terms of the Damage Reduction Program are to:
Take care of your community facilities. Please be courteous to others and do not leave trash in common areas such as lounges, kitchens, restrooms, or hallways.
Assist staff in determining who is responsible for community damages. Residents are held responsible if invited or uninvited guests cause damages or messes.
Help your community decide how to spend its Damage Reduction Awards. Five times a year, communities that have kept damages to a minimum are given monetary awards. As a member of your community, you can help decide how the money will be spent.
Damage reduction funds cannot be spent on video rentals, the purchase of alcohol or gifts for staff, donations to charities, or any event or activity that is not consistent with Student Housing or university purposes or policies; your RA can advise you on how to spend your award. Some things on which communities have used their Damage Reduction Awards follow.
The Office of Student Development staff at UC Davis is working hard to provide you with the academic support you need to be successful at UC Davis. Several academic resources are included here. In addition to these resources, you should also visit the Orientation website.
Residence hall staff and the First-Year Experience staff are committed to enhancing the academic success of residents. Throughout the year, informative programs related to academic needs are offered from our Residence Hall Advising Team (RHAT). Some topics covered are: “The Night Before Classes,” “Thinking About Summer School,” “Checking Your Academic Progress,” “Your Major, Your Minor, Your Career,” “Planning Your Winter Quarter Schedule,” and “Looking Ahead.” In addition, faculty members will be invited to speak on a variety of interesting topics. This offers you the opportunity to talk with your professors in an informal setting outside of the classroom. All of these programs are designed to assist you in making the most of your college career by acquainting you with the many resources available on campus. Your RA will alert you when these programs will occur. Many First-Year Experience Peer Advisors also serve as Orientation Leaders over the summer. Academic Coordinators are also trained in general academic advising issues and can provide helpful information on a myriad of topics. Just ask!
Academic Advising Centers are located in the Segundo, Tercero and Cuarto areas. In each center, peer advisers from the four undergraduate colleges and First-Year Experience Office are available Monday through Thursday from 10am to 6pm and Friday from 10am to 1pm to help you select courses, plan a course of study, explore majors, understand requirements, and discuss educational goals. Tutors are available in the evening, Monday through Thursday from 6pm to 8:30pm to assist you with subjects such as math, chemistry, statistics and biology. Tutoring subjects vary by quarter. Please visit rhat.ucdavis.edu to view the current tutoring schedule. Students are encouraged to utilize all academic resources in the residence halls, and seek out their Academic Coordinator with any questions.
The Computer Centers for Student Housing residents are located at three sites: the Segundo Services Center, the Tercero Services Center, and Emerson Hall. The Computer Centers offer a variety of resources and services including computer & internet access, document scanning and shredding, CD-ROM drives, a variety of software and quiet study environments. Centers are open for all residents 24/7. Please see the Residential Computing website at housing.ucdavis.edu/computers for more information.
Residential Computer Support is a service that provides technical support and advice to students living in the residence halls. Residential Computing Assistants (RCAs) are available for drop-in support during office hours or through the online HelpDesk accessible on the Housing Channel on myUCDavis. The RCS program is tailored to the most common computer needs of students living in the residence halls beginning with network (ResNet) connectivity; computer safety & security (virus protection, enabling operating system firewalls and automatic updates, safe use of music and media file-sharing programs); setup and configuration of printers, wireless keyboards and other peripheral devices; other common computer problems and technical issues. Please see the Residential Computing website for more information about this program at http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/ computers.
Television bulletin boards are located throughout the residence halls. They display important information about deadlines for meal plan changes, room transfers, program activities or special notices. The bulletin board channel is also available on any TV that is plugged into the Student Housing television broadcast (see cable television service for more).
All students living in the residence halls have access to ResNet. ResNet provides direct, high-speed access to the internet for those with a network-ready computer. Specific websites that use excessive bandwidth and are not for educational purposes may be evaluated by the university and marked for limited use. Residents are responsible for maintaining computer compatibility for Res- Net access. Student Housing provides information and support services. If you plan to utilize ResNet, refer to housing.ucdavis.edu/computers for system requirements and setup information. All residence halls have ResNet access. Keep in mind that just like your home, UC Davis can have power supply problems that can affect your equipment. Consider purchasing a surge protector for your computer and other personal electrical equipment in your room.
All students are required to establish a campus computer and email account. The University and Student Housing use email as official means of communication with students in connection with their education and the provision of services.
Cable television connections will only work if you have a cable-ready television. Student Housing broadcasts a wide range of television channels over its closedcircuit television system, as well as educational programming and its bulletin board channel (see television bulletin boards). For more Student Housing TV information, including a channel guide, please visit the Student Housing website at: housing.ucdavis.edu/tv.
In addition, Student Housing broadcasts feature films on two of its channels. Resident and staff input is solicited in selecting these movies, not all of which appeal to all residents. If you would like to provide input on movie selections or see a listing of movies scheduled, please visit the Student Housing website at housing.ucdavis.edu/movies.
University Dining Services at UC Davis provides an excellent selection of food and meal times to meet the needs of our diverse and busy residents. Monday through Thursday we offer four meals, beginning at 7:00 in the morning and ending with a late night meal at midnight. Three mealtimes are offered Fridays, and brunch and dinner are offered weekends and holidays (dining.ucdavis.edu).
You may dine in any of our three resident dining facilities: Segundo, Tercero or Cuarto Dining Commons. All offer a complete variety of dining choices with unlimited seconds. To keep your costs reasonable, we ask that you reduce waste by eating what you take and refrain from removing food from the dining room. You are permitted to take out an ice cream bar/cone, piece of fruit/dessert that you are eating, and a beverage only in the bottle provided by Dining Services at the beginning of the school year; all other food must be eaten in the dining room. Additional dining program information is provided in the Resident Dining Guide distributed during Fall Welcome Week and can be accessed instantly online at dining.ucdavis.edu.
Simply to Go meals are available at the convenience stores near the dining room in each housing area. These meals to go allow flexibility for busy students.
A dietician is available to assist residents with special dietary needs and those who have nutritional questions and concerns. For special dietary needs, please email Linda Adams or call 530-752‑9604.
For special diet requirements in the dining commons, please completed the Special Accommmodation Request Form and submit it to the Student Housing office.
If you are ill, have a friend obtain a get well tray request from your RA. With this form and your meal card, your friend can prepare a meal to go for you.
Students often enjoy social events, including dining, outside the dining rooms. Floor parties, field trips and picnics can be planned through your RA in conjunction with the dining services management team.
Although backpacks are allowed inside the dining room, we remind students that food is not to be taken out of the dining room. The exception is an ice cream cone, piece of fruit/dessert that you are eating and a beverage in the approved container.
Your student ID card (AggieCard) also serves as your meal card and may be used only by the person to whom it was issued. Anyone using another studentâ€™s card or giving his/her card to another student may face Student Housing and/or Student Judicial Affairs action.
You may change your meal plan each quarter between the dates listed below. Changes may be made online at My.UCDavis.edu by scrolling to the Housing Information section and clicking on the â€œView My Informationâ€ link, at your Area Service Desk, or in the Student Housing Office, Room 160.
The following residential dining facilities offer “Grab & Go Snacks” and beverages and provide an opportunity to take a break and socialize with fellow residents.
Selections include many convenience store favorites, beverages, candy, chips, pretzels and ice cream. In addition to cash, residents with the Aggie Cash option can use their dining cards at these locations.
Residence hall staff are here to assist you. RAs are “on call” from 5pm until 8am the next morning Monday-Friday and 24-hours on Saturday and Sunday. They are available to assist you with questions, problems, or emergencies. Cellular phone numbers for “on call” staff are posted throughout buildings and on the Student Housing website at: housing.ucdavis.edu/staff.
We have a great custodial staff working seven days a week to keep your lounges, public bathrooms, hallways, and stairwells clean and looking nice. Custodial staff is responsible for cleaning public areas in your community — you are responsible for upkeep of your room. Please drain and re-pot your plants outside rather than in the bathroom sink or laundry room! When using common areas, it is your responsibility to ensure that the space is clean before you leave. Cleaning after a large event or after someone has “trashed” a space is the responsibility of the community, not your custodian. If it is necessary for our custodians to clean up excessive trash caused by community members, money will be deducted from your community’s damage reduction fund. In the Segundo and Tercero areas, a floor poster tells you when you can expect the routine cleaning and disinfecting of your bathroom. Your bathroom is closed during these times, so you will need to use an alternate bathroom while cleaning is in progress — this will assist us in completing the necessary services for your community restroom quickly and thoroughly. Cuarto suite bathrooms will be cleaned every two weeks by housing custodial staff. A cleaning schedule will be provided at the beginning of the quarter. Refusing to have your bathroom cleaned is not an option.
To help keep your room and community clean, a supply area is stocked with cleansers, mops, dustpans and brooms for your use (either in your laundry room, a closet, or at the Cuarto area service desk). Vacuum cleaners may be checked out from area service desks or your resident advisor. Please remember that this is shared equipment so you will need to return it after use. Toilet paper is provided for Cuarto and Primero Grove suites and is available at the area service desk.
Each room is furnished with a landfill and recycling container. Compost collection containers are available upon request. Email sustainablehousing@ucdavis.edu. Please empty your room waste in the designated area in your building/floor or in the large dumpsters outside; waste may not be left in hallways, bathrooms, laundry rooms, or walkways for health and safety reasons. Visit https://housing.ucdavis.edu/sustainability/wdg/ for a waste diversion guide that has detailed instructions for proper waste sorting and locations of landfill, mixed recyclables, compostables, cardboard, reusables & eWaste bins. Cardboard boxes must me flattened and placed in the proper location, never put cardboard boxes in the chutes as they will clog and create a hazard.
Laundry rooms with card-operated washers and dryers can be found in each community. A WASH AccessCard will be issued to each resident at check in; cash value may be added using cash, credit, or debit card at a centrally located â€˜Add Valueâ€™ stations in your residence hall area. Please request repair and refunds from WASH Service Company at the 800 number posted in laundry rooms; be sure to note the machine identification number. Contact your area service desk for problems with the WASH AccessCard.
Many buildings have lounges with comfortable furniture where residents and their guests can sit, talk, or study. Non-residents may not use these spaces unless accompanied by a resident. The lounges are also central to many of the social and educational programs that enrich community living. For this reason, at least half of the participants in any group meeting or gathering must be residents. Furniture is for the use of all residents and must not be removed from public space. Note: Copyright law prohibits public showings of rented or purchased videos in residence hall lounges and other public spaces.
Some recreational and cooking equipment is available for check out in some areas. Ask your RA or area service desk staff for details.
You and your roommate are responsible for the condition of your room or suite at all times. A room condition form should be completed by each resident; the form is available on MyUCDavis under Housing Information. For your protection, you are required to complete this form listing the condition of your room/suite and the furnishings as soon as you move into your room. When you vacate your room, this information will be used to determine whether any charges for damages or cleaning beyond normal use and wear will be billed to you. If you do not complete a room condition form, you are accepting the room as is.
Your prompt report of damages or items requiring maintenance, especially those that affect the security of the building, will greatly expedite repairs. You will not be charged for the repair of something that breaks due to normal wear and tear. Remember, only maintenance staff is authorized to make repairs.
Service requests can be submitted at any time through MyUCDavis under Housing Information. Click on Submit Service Request and enter complete location and details of needed service.
Service requests may also be submitted by calling the Student Housing Facilities Service Desk at 530-752-8200 during business hours, Monday through Friday, 8:00am â€“ 4:00pm, excluding holidays and mandated department closures.
All emergency requests should be reported to the Student Housing Facilities Service Desk if during business hours or your RA on Call at all other times.
If you live in a suite, we want to help you maintain the carpet and upholstered furniture. If you spill something on your carpet or furniture and cannot get the stain out with water or by vacuuming, please submit a service request through MyUCDavis under Housing Information.
At times throughout the year, major maintenance projects may be scheduled to enhance the quality of the facilities. Student Housing makes every effort to minimize the inconvenience to students caused by such projects. Hall staff will also keep you informed when projects occur in your area.
To ensure a minimum of wear to the furniture, furnishings are not to be removed from rooms and suites. When you move out of your room, you are expected to return furniture to its original location and configuration.
If you have a roommate or suitemate who moves out during the year, it is possible that a new person will check in at any time. Therefore the assigned room and the common areas of a suite must be ready to receive a new resident. During quarter breaks, the room may be inspected before your new roommate or suitemate moves in. You will be charged if staff is required to clear or clean a space to make it habitable for a new resident.
A few touches here and there can transform your room into a special place. Always consider safety when making decisions about decorations. Keep things away from sources of heat. Use colored lightbulbs instead of placing paper over them to change the mood of your room and do not use candles. Posters and other wall hangings brighten things up. One request: please do not apply stickers or decals to any surfaces in your room — they are very difficult to remove!
If you live in the Segundo or Tercero areas, your heater/ air-conditioner can be regulated with a two- or threespeed switch or thermostat. Temperature systems in these buildings are centrally controlled and can only function as either a heating or cooling system at any time — residents cannot switch between heating and air conditioning systems. Central heating systems will be turned on once temperatures reach a consistent evening low of approximately 42°F with daytime highs below 70°F. Central cooling systems will be turned on after five consecutive daytime temperatures above 85°F with a forecast of continuing high temperatures. All units in the Cuarto area have independent heating and air conditioning systems, allowing full control by residents.

With an enchanting beachfront location and minimalist design, The Library Hotel on Koh Samui's popular Chaweng Beach is the perfect place to curl up with a good book. True to its name, this unique conceptual hotel features a large library with more than a thousand books to borrow. This wealth of literature is complimented by the clean lines and bold design choices of its 46 luxury pool villas, suites and studios, each furnished with a reassuring assortment of premium amenities and technology. Likewise, a world-famous red swimming pool provides stark contrast to the white buildings of the property. With Koh Samui Airport within minutes by car, this outpost of modernity successfully blends contemporary design into nature.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Library. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the facility was beautiful. The sundeck, pool, and beach were perfect. We especially loved the quietness in the midst of a busy tourist area.
Superb location. Swimming pool was stunning. Food was great, esp the lavish breakfast. The (studio) room was great, very aesthetically designed. The book library and the DVD rooms were the personal highlights for me.
I would like to say what a lovely stay we have had again. This is the second time we have stay at The Library and we would recommend it to anyone. The service is fabulous, the food interesting, and of course the rooms are delightful
Clean, cool, comfortable! If you look for a stylish environment that s the place! Staff very kind, very nice beach. Quite expensive, but in my opinion it worth.
Absolutely fabulous in every aspect. In the beginning there were some noisy and annoying families in the hotel, but after they left, it was just paradise!
The Library is a stunning conceptual hotel built in a semi-minimalist architectural style, located at the heart of Chaweng Beach in Koh Samui, Thailand. The project was shaped by the hands of an island local who was inspired by books and a simple lifestyle philosophy. "The book is never out of date," says Mr. Kasemtham Sornsong, Owner and Managing Director of The Library. "As time passes, many things will change, but the book is immortal." Working on a 64:00 square meter plot of heritage land with a 50-metre beachfront area, Mr. Sornsong, together with concept designer, Ms. Tirawan Songsawat created what is now the trendiest hotel in Thailand (2012 Traveler’s Choice Awards, Tripadvisor.com).
The Library has a total of 26 unique accommodations in the form of Exotic Suites located on the ground floor, Smart Studios on the upper levels and a new ultra-luxurious unit called The Bookmark which is closest to the sea. In order to maintain the site’s natural ecology, Mr. Sornsong and Ms. Songsawat realized the design without the use of bulldozers. Thus in addition to the ocean, each room provides guests with a glimpse of age-old trees, lovingly preserved and now part of the complex.
Interspersed with works of art and sculpture, The Library and its surroundings boast a balance of nature and culture, in which verdant gardens, blue waters and pale beaches are offset by a bold color scheme dominated by white, red, black and gray. Interiors bathed in an ultra-minimalist palette are completed with modern facilities such as 42-inch plasma screen televisions with DVD players, iPod touch, and iMac computers with high-speed Internet connection. True to the designers’ belief that a good holiday equals an opportunity to enjoy a good book, guests are invited to lounge and enjoy the vast collection of books available, which gives The Library its distinctive name.
Listen to the soft chorus of swaying trees and lapping waves as you settle in on one of The Library’s exquisitely designed upper floor accommodations. The space is divided into 3 areas: the master bedroom with living corner, the balcony and the bathroom with dressing area. The Studio offers spectacular views of the garden and a glimpse of the turquoise sea from a private terrace. With its ultra-minimalist design of sleek uncluttered spaces accented by exotic art furnishings, it is the perfect pick for couples or honeymooners in search of artistic and intimate experiences. There are a total of 13 Studios available at The Library.
One master bedroom with living corner, balcony, bathtub and rain shower, dressing area, individually controlled air-conditioning, 42-inch plasma screen television with DVD player, iMac with broadband Internet connection, in-room bar and refreshment, electronic curtains, contemporary design furniture, digital safety box.
Relish your private time in one of The Library’s beautifully-appointed Suites designed to offer quiet comfort, pure pleasure and deep relaxation. A wide uncluttered area is provided for the main bedroom, and an adjoining open-air patio invites the sweep of gentle trade winds through rustic wooden shutters. Stretch out in our spacious Jacuzzi in the private bathroom for a soothing soak, and retire to a bed of your own favorite cushions from our extensive pillow menu. In front, outdoor mattresses are set aside serving as sun loungers for guests to enjoy. Located on the ground floor, the Suite is an ideal choice for guests who prefer to stay close to the earth and require a suitable space to read and write during their stay. There are a total of 12 Exotic Suites available at The Library.
Garden with deck chairs and glimpse of the sea, open-air living room with lazy chair, contemporary wooden bamboo writing desk, custom-made king-size bed, Pillow Menu, individually controlled air-conditioning, ICE CUBE Jacuzzi by Bathroom Design and rain shower, 42-inch plasma screen television with DVD player, iMac with broadband Internet connection plus dock station and speakers for iPod, Lavazza espresso coffee machine, snack bar with daily compliments of 9 snack varieties, digital safety box.
Expansive private spaces with bespoke furnishings and facilities including a custom 11-feet wide bed, separate him and hers walk-in closets, triple-sized tandem rain shower, Jacuzzi bathtub and an 8-meter long saltwater swimming pool plus designated work space, living and dining areas.
The theme building of The Library is named The Lib, with its impressive collection of books to leaf through and an array of DVD movies and music CDs of various genres to enjoy. Minimalist alabaster-white interiors, coupled with stunning views of the sea and The Red Pool provide a picture-perfect backdrop to an afternoon of light reading and relaxed entertainment.
The Lib is divided into 2 zones: a traditional library and an auxiliary multimedia gallery joined together by an openair space in the middle for outdoor reading. iMac computers with Internet access are also provided for guests to keep in touch with family and friends. The Lib is open from 09:00 to 21:00 hours.
The Fit is The Library’s fitness facility with has 270 degrees of sea views through floor to ceiling glass windows. Whether it be a quick aerobic workout or a full-scale bodybuilding regimen, The Fit provides the necessary equipment to keep the heart pumping or to highlight a perfect washboard abs. Service hours are from 07:00 to 19:00.
The Content is The Library’s reception area consisting of 2 adjoining units embraced by a group of high growth trees. The Content team gives a warm welcome and farewell to guests, as well as assists them in arranging their daily activities in and around the hotel. Normal check-in time is 14:00 hours and check-out time is 12:00 hours.
Unwind by The Library’s signature Red Pool with the lulling warm breeze of the pristine beach beyond. Selected as one of the world’s most spectacular hotel swimming pools by both Tripadvisor and CNN, The Red Pool, with its mosaic tiles of orange, yellow and deep red, presents a dazzling spectacle of brilliant color and sophisticated style. The size of the Red Pool is 20 x 12 meters and is located between The Lib and The Page. Surrounding the pool area is a wooden deck with red mattresses and black over-sized bean bags scattered around. Service hours are from 07:00 to 19:00 hours.
Combining contemporary elegance with a highly sophisticated concept design, The Page is a refreshing modern take on Koh Samui’s upscale dining scene. With a menu offering of Thai and international fusion and a host of "original experiences" found nowhere else on the island, indulge in culinary delights that excite the eyes and tingle the taste buds. Enjoy the sunrise with a signature Breakfast Culture on the beach or a light casual lunch overlooking the sea. Then chill out at The Beach Bar with its 101 unique cocktail selections and artistic tapas and snack interpretations or explore the innovative cuisines available for an exceptional dinner engagement. The Page is a beachfront restaurant divided into 3 zones: an air-conditioned space with a walk-in wine gallery, a roofed open-air venue with a grand view of the beach and a terrace area for all-day alfresco dining.
Eclectic by nature, artistic by character and thoroughly unique in style, Drink Gallery is an alternative dining platform unseen in Koh Samui. It’s an island first - an upmarket bar and restaurant where one can sip on an amazing drink, groove to some wonderful tunes and still hear each other speak! Located next to the resort along Chaweng Beach Road, Drink Gallery stays true to the stylish and art-inspired aesthetics The Library is famous for. A medley of accessories and seating such as wooden benches, chairs and stools make up the playful setting, and a long solid table at the center invites up to 14 people to drink and mingle over an exquisite home-style feast. The restaurant has both a sense of casualness and a sophisticated quality. Its approach on food is artistic simplicity with a homey feel; the drinks are tastefully layered, whimsical and form-breaking worthy of a night’s discussion. Opens daily from 11:00 till 01:00 hours.

Anyone who keeps office plants knows that indoor foliage can brighten a dull, dreary atmosphere and create a refuge from everyday stresses. Office Plants can also remove common toxins from indoor environments and add oxygen to stale air. Given these benefits, you'd think that indoor office plants would be as common in offices as staplers and annoying coworkers!
Sadly, most of us know only two kinds of office plants: the silk ones and those dusty brown fire hazards on top of the filing cabinet. While many of these leafy casualties could have been saved with proper care, it's critical to choose plants that can thrive in the challenging office biome. With a little forethought, you can choose the perfect plant to improve your workplace's aesthetics and your health. Plants affect people. Research indicates most people experience increased production and reduced stress when plants are present. Plants have also been proven to clean the air of toxic chemicals, suppress bacteria and molds and add humidity, making a room feel healthier and more comfortable.
Plants are a vital part of a professional office environment, providing the finishing touch to our business setting. Naturally, plants have the unique ability to humanize an office, encourage productivity, stimulate the mind and promote creativity.
Plants in the workplace ARE PROVEN to improve morale, absorb noise, clean the air and reduce worker stress. Now, more than ever, stress at

I got my Ph.D. from SOAS in November 2004. I did it in two years which is I believe the record for shortest time at that institution.
Yesterday I walked through Ataturk Park and saw the Afghan War memorial. In addition to a statue it also lists the soldiers from the Kyrgyz SSR that died in the war from 1979 to 1989. At rough approximation there were 130 names on the slabs that I saw. But, I think this total must be incomplete. In many ways Afghanistan was the Soviet Union's Vietnam.
Today I walked down the Kievskaya side of Ala Too Square rather than the Chui side. Just after the statue of Chingiz Aitmatov I ran into a former student of mine. He is doing quite well. It is kind of strange to think that I have taught hundreds of Kyrgyz, thousands of Ghanaians, and only a half a dozen Americans. At this point I am sure my impact will be much greater in Africa and Asia than it will ever be in my home country.
I would like to count myself as one of your American students, even if only at a distance, especially on the history of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Central Asia and the Soviet Far East. The opportunity to learn more about my heritage keeps me coming back.

Three out of five stars didn’t bode well for the Baytown Outlaws, a movie we found streaming free on Amazon Instant Video (we’re Prime members). One thing I’ve discovered in my many years of action flick watching is that the critics don’t dig action. If the critics say it sucks, chances are I’m going to love it. True to form, I LOVED this movie!
Billy Bob Thornton plays his usual piece of trash character and Eva Longoria plays the pretty piece, as was her lot prior to her hitting the jackpot with Devious Maids & Telenovela. These are not stand-alone reasons to see any movie. Meh…moving on…
Here’s the blurb: When three redneck brothers agree to help a woman save her godson from an abusive stepfather, they become targets on the run from an odd cast of characters.
Paul Wesley is in this movie too. Vampire Diaries fans will be thrilled. He’s even got some good lines.
Here’s the real hook: three idiots that you expect to be completely unlikable become unlikely heroes despite the fact that this wildly entertaining movie is overflowing with blood and bullets and is equally offensive to whites, blacks, Hispanics, Jews, men, women, disabled, heterosexuals and homosexuals alike (I may have missed a few groups, but know that the writers were thorough in being offensive to all).

Get a copy of the top 10 Toyota leadership lessons that Mr. Isao Yoshino has shared with me. Click here to get your copy!
Japan is famous for customer service and hospitality, known as “omotenashi” in Japanese, and for being a safe and clean country – and my experiences on recent trip to Japan last month were no exception.
What I want to share with you today are three amazing experiences that left me saying “only in Japan!”, all of which happened in one 8 hour period. Even though I learned to expect the types of experiences when living in Japan, they still astound me in contrast to what you would likely experience in most other places in the world.
If you want to learn more about omotenashi, check out the article I wrote after returning my first trip back to Japan after moving back to the United States: Life in Japan: Omotenashi – the spirit of Japan’s customer service & hospitality.
I was in Japan in January to prepare for an upcoming Japan study trip on behalf of the Ohio State University, some of which I highlighted in my most recent post.
Update as of February 15: If you are interested in joining the OSU trip on May 12-19, 2018, there are a few spaces remaining that OSU is opening for general enrollment!
The program Rick Guba and I have put together will be a fabulous and fun learning experience, which will include unparalleled access to Isao Yoshino, a 40-year Toyota leader and John Shooks’ first manager in Toyota City, over three days of the trip.
These three “only in Japan” experiences from January all happened in an eight hour period on the Saturday following the study trip preparation week, on a day spent with some of our best friends still living in Tokyo.
After you read about these experiences, let me know if you think that any of these things would happen in your country?
Perhaps one, maybe, but it’s highly unlikely that all three would happen in the same day anywhere but in Japan.
On our way to a bus-train interchange in Shibuya, my friend accidentally left her wallet on the bus. She didn’t realize it until we were about to enter the train station. By then, the bus and wallet were long gone.
Okay, so not a picture of the wallet, but a photo of our delicious okonomiyaki lunch at the restaurant where I first tried okyonomiyaki three years ago! I love Hiroshima style.
I might have been more concerned for my friend had I been a new visitor to Japan. However there is a sense in Japan – even in the dense metropolis of Tokyo – that you are in small community where everyone is looking out for each other because they know each other. In this case, people don’t usually know each other, but there is a sense of community and safety that I’ve not experienced anywhere but small towns.
I also had a prior experience of a lost wallet being returned in 2015 when my cousin visited and left her wallet in the train station. When she realized this 3 hours later, she was in a panic. We tracked down the wallet at the Lost and Found area at the station, and sure enough, someone had turned in her wallet, all money and belongings included.
So on this Sunday in January, this being Japan, we headed out for lunch as planned figuring that her wallet would 99.99% likely be turned in promptly with all money and personal items untouched.
Several hours later, after enjoying a delicious okonomiyaki lunch sitting at the counter bar, my friend went to the station headquarters, talked to someone who spoke some English, was directed to another lost and found, and was reunited with her wallet – 100% intact, as we expected.
In the United States, or most anywhere else, we likely would not have had the confidence that the wallet would be returned promptly and intact.
Certainly, people do return things in other countries (like the camera I left on a train in Barcelona in 1991!), but the probability of everything being there (including money) is less likely.
Imagine, a slightly more crowded platform than when I took the photo, people rushing to line up for the soon-to-arrive train. You rush up and see a uniformed station worker extending her arms to you. What do you do?
You might have assumed, like our group of 5 did, that she was directing us where to line up for the train, and rush to gather in line with her outstretched arms.
She looked at us in horror when we tried to stand right under her arms in the midst of the crowd as the train arrived. We were doing the exact opposite of what she had intended.
I was able to get my phone out and snap this picture right before our train pulled out of the station.
I grew accustomed to delightful customer experiences when living in Japan, and also some frustrating ones, examples of both I highlighted on my article on Omotenashi.
I once described Japanese hospitality to Mark Graban as constantly high levels service with no customization (don’t ask for the tomatoes on the side if the menu says tomatoes!), where is the U.S. high levels of customization are generally accommodated, but there is great variation in actual service delivery.
But the delightful ones always are a special reminder of what it means to more than satisfy a customer.
I forgot to mention that the week I was in Japan was the coldest weather on record in Tokyo in nearly half a century. It was well below freezing and I was grateful for the two puffy coats that I brought and simultaneously wore out in the evenings.
After an already delightful and delicious meal with our friends, we collected our coats and ventured out into the sub-zero temperatures. We put our hands in our pockets to find them delightfully warm.
My husband and I ran back to the restaurant to thank the staff, and there two of them were standing, in the sub-zero temperatures, waving to us and saying “thank you”.
This type of service that goes over and beyond what is expected is not uncommon in Japan, and is something that we all can learn from.
Of course, it also is balanced out by the many instances of frustration with the rigidity and lack of flexibility to requests that one also experiences. But I’ll take the delight!
Instead of having to drag your own bags off of the carousel at the airport baggage claim, the bags are pulled off and neatly arranged for passengers.
For example, on my arrival to Tokyo’s Narita Airport, I got through Immigration quickly and was one of the first people to baggage claim.
One could argue that this is overprocesssing by increasing the number of human touch points in the baggage handling process, but as a customer, I appreciated it!
I’ll be writing soon about my entire visit to Oishi Accounting in the Tokyo area with Tim Wolput and Christoph Roser (author of the All About Lean Blog) to experience their engaging morning meeting, but one of the impressive nice touches of “omtenashi” that the company provides for all visitors and customers is a personalized water bottle.
Spending three days with my friend and Toyota mentor Mr. Isao Yoshino, from whom I always learn words of wisdom and insights.
Visiting over 10 Japanese companies and organizations to learn about their approach to kaizen and respect for people including:
Learning about the “7 Minute Miracle” by talking with the former President of the Shinkansen cleaning company that is famous for its customer service and 7-minute changeover (which I mentioned in a previous post).
Eating at the “lean” sushi restaurant chain I visited last May and visiting a “lean” public restroom that paralleled the one I visited years ago.

Hi, I am trying to build a template. The compilation of this template results in a weird exception. I have isolated the cause of the exception to the following point:
The warnings you're seeing are the second of these: when ikiwiki tries to process templates/foo.mdwn as an ordinary page, without interpreting the <TMPL_VAR> directives, inline receives invalid input.
This is a bit of a design flaw in template and edittemplate, I think - ideally it would be possible to avoid parts of the page being interpreted when the page is being rendered normally rather than being used as a template.
There is a trick to avoid parts of the page being interpreted when the page is being used as a template, while having them appear when it's rendered as a page:
Perhaps the right solution would be to change how the template plugin works, so that templates are expected to contain a new definetemplate directive:
with templates not containing a [[!definetemplate ]] being treated as if the whole text of the page was copied into a [[!definetemplate ]], for backwards compatibility?
OK, here is a branch implementing what I said. It adds the definetemplate directive to goodstuff as its last commit.
i'd put it in core, and add a transition for the time compatibility gets broken, provided the transitioning system will be used in that. templates can't be expected to just work as markdown+ikiwiki too.
first i was sceptical of the approach of re-running scan to make sure the my %templates is filled, but it is indeed a practical solution.
the name "definetemplate" gives me the first impression that something is assigned (as in #define), but actually it highlights a region in the file. wouldn't "templatebody" be a better description of the meaning of the directive?
Thanks for your feedback! Looking at its description on this wiki, I agree that type/web doesn't fit, and core does seem better. I like your templatebody suggestion, too, particularly if templates remain restricted to /templates. I'll try to come up with better wording for the documentation to say "use templatebody, like this", with a note about backwards compatibility later.
Rationale for my %templates: yes it does seem a bit odd, but if I used $pagestate{$tpage}{template} instead of a my variable, I'd sometimes still have to force a scan, because template has to expand the template at scan time so that it can contain links etc. - so I have to make sure that if the template has changed, it has already been scanned (scanning happens in random order, so that can't be guaranteed). This means there's no benefit in reading it back from the index, so it might as well just be in-memory.
I suppose an alternative way to do it would be to remember what was passed to needsbuild, and only force a scan for templates that were in that list - which potentially reduces CPU time and I/O a little, in exchange for a bigger index. I could do that if Joey wants me to, but I think the current approach is simpler, so I'll stick with the current approach if it isn't vetoed. --smcv
@name: even outside /templates, [[!templatebody ]] would be interpreted as "when this page is used as a template, this is what its contents should be", and be suitable.
@%templates: my surprise wasn't to it not being in %pagestate, but rather that the scan function was used for it at all, rather than plain directive parsing that ignores everything else -- but i agree that it's the right thing to do in this situation.
Branch and directive renamed to ready/templatebody as chrysn suggested. It's on-by-default now (or will be if that branch is merged). Joey, any chance you could review this?
There is one known buglet: template_syntax.t asserts that the entire file is a valid HTML::Template, whereas it would ideally be doing the same logic as IkiWiki itself. I don't think that's serious. --smcv
Looking over this, I notice it adds a hash containing all scanned files. This seems to me to be potentially a scalability problem on rebuild of a site with many pages. Ikiwiki already keeps a lot of info in memory, and this adds to it, for what is a fairly minor reason. It seems to me there should be a way to avoid this. --Joey
Maybe. Are plugins expected to cope with scanning the same page more than once? If so, it's just a tradeoff between "spend more time scanning the template repeatedly" and "spend more memory on avoiding it", and it would be OK to omit that, or reduce it to a set of scanned templates (in practice that would mean scanning each template twice in a rebuild). --s
Commit f7303db5 suggests that scanning the same page more than once is problematic, so that solution is probably not going to work.
The best idea I've come up with so far is to track whether we're in the scan or render phase. If we're in the scan phase, I think we do need to keep track of which pages we've scanned, so we don't do them again? (Or perhaps that's unnecessary - commit f7303db5 removed a scan call that's in the render phase.) If we're in the render phase, we can assume that all changed pages have been scanned already, so we can drop the contents of %scanned and rely on a single boolean flag instead.
This is not actually good enough for the templatebody directive, which does in fact need to scan certain pages during the render phase, namely when a page that is rendered due to dependencies uses a template that no other page being rendered in this pass was using. I've reverted this optimization, to fix wrong rendering of templatebody, and applied a more limited version which only optimizes rebuilds (the worst case of this memory consumption). --smcv
%scanned is likely to be no larger than %rendered, which we already track, and whose useful lifetime does not overlap with %scanned now. I was tempted to merge them both and call the result %done_in_this_phase, but that would lead to really confusing situations if a bug led to render being called sooner than it ought to be.
My ulterior motive here is that I would like to formalize the existence of different phases of wiki processing - at the moment there are at least two phases, namely "it's too soon to match pagespecs reliably" and "everything has been scanned, you may use pagespecs now", but those phases don't have names, so write doesn't describe them.
I'm also considering adding warnings if people try to match a pagespec before scanning has finished, which can't possibly guarantee the right result, as discussed in conditional preprocess during scan. My wip-too-soon branch is a start towards that; the docwiki builds successfully, but the tests that use IkiWiki internals also need updating to set $phase = PHASE_RENDER before they start preprocessing. --s
reviewing those modifications, i think this is a good way to go. along with warning about pagespecs evaluated in scan phase, i think it should be an error to invoke scan in the render phase; that would mean that readtemplate needs to check whether it's invoked as a scan or not to decide whether to scan the template page, but would be generally more robust for future plugin writing.
At the moment templatebody really does need to re-scan templates in the render phase, unfortunately. Not scanning in the render phase seems to be precisely how wrong rendering of templatebody happened. --s
addendum: if the new phase state is used to create warnings/errors about improper ikiwiki api use of plugins (which is something i'd advocate), that should likewise warn if add_link actually adds a link in the render phase. such a warning would have helped spotting the link-related template evaluation oddities earlier. --chrysn

Well, Chevrolet is asking you to show off your Chevy Spark EV knowledge for a chance to win a trip to California.
If you’re stumped by any of the questions, then we’re sure you’ll find the answers somewhere within the realms of InsideEVs.
Yeah, it was way easy. However, this is obviously a marketing gimmick and thus it is supposed to be easy since they want as many people as possible to “win.”
You’d think an EV Contest for the “Chevy Spark EV” would in someway include access to the revolutionary vehicle? Not even a single day with the EV, no test drive, no chance to expierence the torque! Sorry no luck, this one is fully un-plugged, lacking EV Spark!
Win a trip to California? So the quiz is really for people that DO NOT live in California to learn about the Spark EV.
Actually there are many CARB states where they could sell it and benefit for ZEV, but not the CA carbon credits. However, if they want to get serious and sell it in cold-winter states they’d need a heat pump. The 3 serious BEVs, the Model S, Leaf and i3 all have one either as standard or as an option.
I wonder how the winner will be notified by phone when there was no phone number box to fill in the entry form. And I wonder if the rental will be a 2014 Chevy Spark EV.

Randomized Controlled Trial of Chlorhexidine Dressing and Highly Adhesive Dressing for Preventing Catheter-related Infections in Critically Ill Adults
Jean-François Timsit; Olivier Mimoz; Bruno Mourvillier; Bertrand Souweine; Maïté Garrouste-Orgeas; Serge Alfandari; Gaétan Plantefeve; Régis Bronchard; Gilles Troche; Remy Gauzit; Marion Antona; Emmanuel Canet; Julien Bohe; Alain Lepape; Aurélien Vesin; Xavier Arrault; Carole Schwebel; Christophe Adrie; Jean-Ralph Zahar; Stéphane Ruckly; Caroline Tournegros; Jean-Christophe Lucet
To determine if chlorhexidine-impregnated and strongly adherent dressings decrease catheter colonization and CRI rates.
A total of 1,879 patients (4,163 catheters and 34,339 catheter-days) were evaluated. With chlorhexidine dressings, the major-CRI rate was 67% lower (0.7 per 1,000 vs. 2.1 per 1,000 catheter-days; hazard ratio [HR], 0.328; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.174-0.619; P = 0.0006) and the CR-BSI rate 60% lower (0.5 per 1,000 vs. 1.3 per 1,000 catheter-days; HR, 0.402; 95% CI, 0.186-0.868; P = 0.02) than with nonchlorhexidine dressings; decreases were noted in catheter colonization and skin colonization rates at catheter removal. The contact dermatitis rate was 1.1% with and 0.29% without chlorhexidine. Highly adhesive dressings decreased the detachment rate to 64.3% versus 71.9% (P < 0.0001) and the number of dressings per catheter to two (one to four) versus three (one to five) (P < 0.0001) but increased skin colonization (P < 0.0001) and catheter colonization (HR, 1.650; 95% CI, 1.21-2.26; P = 0.0016) without influencing CRI or CR-BSI rates.
A large randomized trial demonstrated that chlorhexidine-gel-impregnated dressings decreased the CRI rate in patients in the ICU with intravascular catheters. Highly adhesive dressings decreased dressing detachment but increased skin and catheter colonization.
Recent literature suggests that bedside lung ultrasound may have a role in the evaluation of infants with bronchiolitis. B lines, which are multiple and diffuse vertical artifacts spreading from the lung pleural interface to the edge of the ultrasound screen, have been associated with thickened interlobular septa, extravascular lung water, and diffuse parenchymal disease. The aims of this study were (1) to describe the prevalence of B lines in children younger than 24 months presenting to the emergency department with wheezing, (2) to determine the interrater reliability of lung ultrasound findings in this setting, and (3) to determine the association of B lines with atopy and other clinical findings.
This was a pilot, prospective, observational study of a convenience sample of patients younger than 2 years presenting with wheezing to a large academic pediatric hospital emergency department. Investigators performed lung ultrasound examinations, and a second provider reviewed the ultrasound examinations to determine interrater reliability. We performed univariate analyses to test for associations between ultrasound findings and atopy, acute illness severity, age, and treatment response.
Studies were obtained on 29 patients (mean [SD] age, 291 [187] days; 62% male). Twenty-one patients (72%) had compact B lines. B lines were significantly associated with older age and an absence of atopic features. There was poor correlation of lung ultrasound examination interpretation among enrolling providers.
In this small sample of patients with bronchiolitis, B lines were associated with older age and an absence of atopic features. Lung ultrasound interpretation had poor interrater reliability.

Hans Wulz was one of the important Viennese painters within the tradition of the Austrian late-expressionism. The essential subject of his oeuvre are figurative compositions by those he explains all the diverse concerns of human life. Deep, heavy colors dominate on his oil-paintings. He mainly appreciated the blue colors, as to be the mystic colors. He confessed his artistic credo by the words: "I am motivated by my impression and I use the colors in order to realize my expression".
Besides his figurative compositions, landscape painting was one of the essential contents in the art of Hans Wulz. He produced an endless number of town pictures and landscape paintings of Austria, Switzerland, Southern Germany, England and of Italy.
Also, Hans wulz has been proven as a fresco-painter. Besides others, he created altar frescoes for churches and the large wall frescoes for the Viennese Historical Army Museum.
His biggest work was the figurative creation of the huge 300 ft x 30 ft crucification panorama oil-painting in the "Kreuzigungspanorama" located in the Swiss town Einsiedeln.
Art-historically regarded, Hans Wulz ranks among the important painters of the "Alte Wiener Künstlerhaus", since 1948 he was a member of the "Gesellschaft Bildender Künstler" residenting there. The spirit and the tradition of this oldest exhibition house in the German-speaking area influenced the painting of Hans Wulz and of many of its contemporaries.
Demi Lovato was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital on Tuesday after suffering an apparent overdose and is now “stable,” a source close to the singer says.
A representative for the Los Angeles Fire Department tells PEOPLE they “transported a 25-year-old female patient to a local hospital,” while the Los Angeles Police Department confirms both departments “responded to a medical emergency at the 8000 block of Laurel View Dr. at 11:40 a.m.”
Audio of the emergency call obtained by TMZ reveals the pop star was unconscious upon their arrival and revived with Narcan — an emergency medication to reverse the effects of a narcotic overdose. While TMZ reports the overdose is heroin related, a source close to Lovato claims that it is not.
Lovato has battled addiction, mental illness and disordered eating for years. In 2011, she entered treatment, where she was treated for bipolar disorder, bulimia, self-harm and addiction. She relapsed after she left the treatment center, then entered a sober living facility for a year.
Last March, Lovato revealed she celebrated six years of sobriety, but in June she released a new song, “Sober” on which she revealed that she had relapsed.
“Mudbound” star Mary J. Blige has come on board in a leading role in “Body Cam,” a horror-thriller set up at Paramount.
Variety first reported on March 21 that Malik Vitthal had been tapped to direct “Body Cam” for Paramount Players. The project, produced by Matt Kaplan, was the first major purchase for Paramount Players chief Brian Robbins last year.
Nick McCarthy and John Ridley have performed rewrites of the spec script originally penned by Richmond Riedel. Described as “Get Out” meets “End of Watch,” the story follows several LAPD officers who are haunted by a malevolent spirit that is tied to the murder of a black youth at the hands of two white cops — all of which was caught on a body cam video that was destroyed in a cover-up.
Blige will portray a police officer in “Body Cam” who begins seeing visions and starts to investigate the cover-up.

Fabienne Gendron Furniture, 2017-12-18 18:11:16. A lot of us have tried or are probably still using spring mattresses. We could say that sleeping on spring beds or mattresses is comfortable until we got stung by a broken spring. Spring mattresses have been the standard for many decades but the memory foam mattresses have become even more popular to date because of the undeniable comfort as well as the overall body support that many would not believe until they have tried these out for themselves. So why do more people choose memory mattresses over the standard spring mattresses? There have been comparisons made between memory foam mattresses and spring mattresses and a lot of people could attest that they found sleeping on memory foam mattresses to be better. Lying on a spring mattress does feel nice but when it comes to body contouring as well as spinal support a spring mattress do not even comes close to what the memory foam mattress could give. When you use a spring mattress, your body conforms to it. While your weight is on the spring mattress, the springs exert a resisting force against your body. A spring mattress relies only on a varied number of springs that are pushing back against you with all of them having the same force. Since your body does not push evenly against those springs, it is impossible for you to get proper support. And because of this and the fact that you are the one who is adjusting to the spring mattresss shape, your pressure points will lead to poor blood circulation and you would probably be complaining about body pains or sore muscles or stiffness when you wake up in the morning.
Fabienne Gendron Furniture, 2017-12-18 18:11:15. Before shopping for a mattress you need to arm yourself with pertinent information. First determine what type of bed is best for you. Do you like soft or hard beds? Would you prefer a standard mattress or a foam mattress? If you are not sure, go try out a few different mattress types. Second, consider your budget. This is not a purchase you want to scrimp on, as a poor nights sleep can affect your whole day. Try to get as much value as you can for your budget. Finally, size is a very important factor especially if there is more than one person sleeping in the bed. Ideally, you should both be able to lie on the bed with your arms behind your heads and not touch. A bed needs to be 10-15 cm longer than the tallest person sleeping in that bed. Also pay attention to the height. Lower beds can be easy to get into but harder to get out of. High beds can be hard to get into, especially for shorter people, but very easy to hop out of in the morning.

With the year fast drawing to a close and examination time approaching, it is apt for us to remember our motto for the year, ‘Push Past Impossible.’ It is at this time that we need to redouble our efforts and not slack off. No matter the personal challenges that we all face, now is the time to show real grit in order to surpass what we think is possible.
Our Boks showed just what was required to succeed when they managed to overcome the mighty All Blacks, arguably the best team of all time, in New Zealand. This victory did not happen by chance, it happened because our team prepared thoroughly, believed in their hearts that they possessed the skills to win and most of all were prepared to fight for all eighty minutes for victory. Given these factors, we should not have been surprised at the result.
I pray that each one of our pupils, during this examination time and indeed into next year, would rebel against accepting mediocrity and allow themselves to be challenged to far surpass even their highest expectations.

Does anyone know if Wisconsin has anything in the works to allow IL? I spend time in IL, WI and FL and I hate to need 3 cards.
While he doesn't work in the CCW section, a contact who works with WI DOJ told me informally that since IL uses the BGC's that WI requires there should be no problem with WI accepting the FCCL... but that they are in no hurry to do so. Understandable given the back and forth that they went through themselves.
Despite their rallying around us at election time, honoring only 8 hours of Illinois' 40+ hour law enforcement class towards a 16 hour requirement shows the contempt that our elected officials hold us in.
For me, the states I would most like to see honor our permits are Colorado, Florida, Wisconsin, and South Carolina (even though I already get Wisconsin with my Utah non-res. permit).
My Mom said she heard something on Jim Fisher's radio program yesterday about them changing their mind.
All I have are Galesburg and Monmouth phone books or else I'd call the Scott County Sheriff's office and see if they know anything.
If the thief is found breaking in, and he is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt for his bloodshed.
Gun control is not about guns, it's about control. Once they have all the guns, they'll also have complete control.-Abolt
Yep, Florida and New Mexico. From the Florida DOA. The Division of Licensing constantly monitors changing gun laws in other states and attempts to negotiate agreements as the laws in those states allow.
Correct, my quick check is that a FL CCW will also gain Florida and New Mexico (if someone already has UTAH CCW).
the "create a map" page on handgunlaw.us is pretty handy to see the difference in coverage between different permits.
Illinois' FCCA is a prime example of the maxim that sufficiently advanced incompetence is indistinguishable from malice.
sorry i meant does anyone have insight on whether or not Florida will reciprocate with IL....thus saving us the process of applying for a FL ccw. Therefore, saving us $100+ and saving us to have to carry another CCW card in our wallets.
The current IL law has no provision for reciprocity or recognition of other state's permits at all. So the chance of that is really close to zero. The only reason it's not zero is the tiniest chance that some state might accept the car carry provision as IL's recognition of their permits.
If IL law changes to allow for recognition of other state's permits, then states like Florida, Colorado, and others that require reciprocity will be possible for IL permit holders.
Explain please the concealed and open carry laws in Wisconsin and how they apply to someone with Fla/Utah/Illinois CCL's.
Ohio requires a reciprocity agreement with the other state. Current Illinois law has no provision for reciprocity, or agreements.
I travel through there abut 5 times a year. But would not OC without clear understanding of their OC laws as well as no carry zones and retail signage requirements.
Thanks for any help as I hopefully will be camping there for the first time this summer. So State and national lands would also be helpful.
It appears WI recognizes UT (including non-res permits) but not FL nor IL. And you may open carry without a permit/license.
"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up." - Galations 6:9 (NIV)
"If you can't explain it to a six-year old, you don't understand it yourself." - Albert Einstein (paraphrased)
It's very possible that WI will recognize IL permits at some point, just unknown if for sure and when.
So, if you want the most states that you can carry in, what's the combination of CWLs one needs that you don't need to travel to get?
I believe the best combination for the most states without traveling is Illinois Utah and Florida to get 36 carry states. Not 100% sure though
That's what my research indicates. At that point you can start working on tougher places but it's state by state.
I believe the glitch with Illinois is that fingerprinting is not required for all. This is the reason my insructor gave for Wisconsin not recognizing our Permit.
Florida will not honor the Illinois license. Here is the answer straight from the Florida Dept of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
No, Florida will not be recognizing the Illinois concealed carry license. Let me to explain the reasons for this.
Under Florida law, we will honor the concealed weapon licenses issued by another state provided that authorities in the other state meet one condition: they must agree to honor concealed weapon licenses issued by the state of Florida. (This essential condition is set forth in section 790.015(4), which reads as follows: "This section applies only to nonresident concealed weapon or concealed firearm license holders from states that honor Florida concealed weapon or concealed firearm licenses.") Florida imposes no other condition as a basis for reciprocity with another state. Once we receive acknowledgment from authorities in that other state, we automatically reciprocate.
Unfortunately, the state of Illinois does not honor concealed weapon licenses issued by any other state. There is an FAQ on the Illinois State Police's webpage (http://www.isp.state...firearmsfaq.cfm) that specifically addresses this issue. That being the case, Illinois does not satisfy the basic condition that would allow Florida to honor Illinois licenses.
So if Utah is on the list then why are all these instructors advertising the Utah carry as being included in the IL carry course?
And having a UT non-res gains RTC in WI. Important for some of us who travel up to cheese country on occasion.
I include Arizona application materials in my classes. It's the easiest and cheapest way to carry in Wisconsin, along with multiple others. Arizona is only $60 as compared to Florida, and doesn't require additional training like Utah. Sent from my Galaxy S4 using Tapatalk
I was looking at which states I could carry in if I added Florida, (I already have Utah and waiting on Illinois) if I get my Florida it will give me New Mexico, If I got a Arizona instead of Florida it will only give me New Mexico and not Florida,
So for a few extra dollars for me I may go ahead and get my Florida I have all the training its just a cost issue if I want to spend 100 or so for 2 extra states. hmmm
We were allowed to get a Utah for example without having a CC permit in Illinois because we didn't have one at the time so Utah allowed Illinois residents to apply, Now that we have a permit will people that don't get our permit for what ever reason have to give up or not be able to apply for CC in other states?
New Hampshire requires you to have a home state permit unless your state does not require a permit to carry. The FOID card was required for Illinois residents.
Now that Illinois has a permit will New Hampshire require the permit instead of just the FOID? will any state that requires you to have a home state permit allow you to keep their license?
re: New Hampshire Yes. Now that an Illinois License is possible, I am pretty sure you must have an IL CCL to get the NH Permit ($100/5 years and only gets you NH, I think). I would include a copy of my FOID with the application.
re: Utah "If you reside in a state that recognizes the validity of the Utah CFP or has reciprocity with Utah, you must obtain a CFP or CCW from your home state and submit a copy of it with your application for a Utah permit. For a list of reciprocal states visit: http://www.publicsaf...i/FAQother.html Residency will be determined by your state-issued identification. If your state does not recognize the Utah permit this does not apply"
I think you are OK in Florida and Arizona. The rest of the states that might give you a license/permit are single state gets. The other states do not issue to non residents. I love PA, but you have to apply in person (takes no time!) and I don't think it gives you any extra states.
I guess what I am getting at is... No Illinois license = NO any license anywhere would that be fair to say? granted that's only if I live in Illinois. Or in any state for that matter. You must have a CCL from your home state.
Why I say this is because it seems at least at this point in the game Illinois is making it hard for what ever reason and we never had to produce a license from Illinois for other states because we didn't have one.
To go one step further for instance, my application is denied will I have to surrender all permits from other states I may have now that Illinois has a permit ?.
Just putting that out there I am sure their are non resident permit holders for other states that may be denied.
To go one step further for instance, my application is denied will I have to surrender all permits from other states I may have now that Illinois has a permit ?. I don't know.
Illinois has no agreement to recognize a Utah permit, so you CAN get a Utah without your Illinois. It's unlikely Illinois will recognize UTAH (or any other state) anytime soon. You can still get Florida and Arizona without an Illinois. I don't see that changing.
If you are prohibited/denied from getting an Illinois License (which is different from you just haven't obtained one yet), you probably can't get on from any other state. It's certainly possible that you might lose non resident permits on renewal, or earlier, if you are denied having an Illinois license. I don't know for sure.
The only state that I would love for it to get recognized as in California which I doubt it will ever happen anytime soon that's where 99 percent of my family lives

In 1969, one week after turning 17 and two years after dropping out of high school, I went to the Army recruiting office at a shopping center near my home in Suitland, Maryland. Two weeks later I was riding a bus with other new recruits on the way to Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
The bus arrived at the reception center at 4AM and a drill sergeant came on board and screamed at us to “Get off the bus, now!” “Line up on the marks” “No talking”
I was terrified, and immediately began to question my decision to join the Army but it was too late for that, because I had already signed the papers and taken the oath. They fed us and put us to bed for a couple of hours. Later that day, we got buzz cuts and our new uniforms. After a week in the reception area, we were assigned to platoons for basic training.
Our days began at 4:30 AM, with the drill sergeant yelling at the top of his lungs for us to get out of bed. I had a hard time adjusting to waking up that early, especially since I was usually exhausted by the training. After I didn’t jump out of my rack immediately a couple of times, the drill sergeant assigned my squad leader the job of insuring that I got up promptly. I slept on the upper bunk and he the lower one, and every morning when the lights went on, he would push up on my mattress from below with his feet and I would go flying out of the top bunk and land on the floor.
While visiting family, I was playing around sliding on some ice when I fell and heard a crunch in my shoulder. I had cracked my collarbone.
After I got back to Ft Bragg and resumed Basic training I realized that my shoulder was still messed-up and I was unable to do things like push-ups without a lot of pain. I told the drill sergeant that I had hurt my shoulder while on leave and couldn’t do the exercises, but he wasn’t buying it. He told me to go on sick call and I had better come back from the doctor’s office with a note for light duty or I’d be in trouble for lying to him.
Well, the doctor determined that I had indeed cracked a bone but he only gave me a note for one day of light duty. One day! When I showed the note to the drill sergeant, he just smiled at me and said, “Enjoy your one day off. I’ll see you tomorrow.” The next day he showed me no mercy and I just had to tough it out till my shoulder healed.
For obvious reasons, the Army is very careful when training recruits to shoot rifles. “Firing Range Discipline” means listening very carefully to instructions; like always keep your weapon pointed downrange, don’t load ammo until ordered to do so, etc. One day at the firing range, I was all the way on the end of the line; the farthest away from the drill sergeant and couldn’t hear the instructions clearly. So I followed what the guy next to me was doing when he did it. He loaded his weapon, so I loaded my weapon.
The next thing I knew the drill sergeant was screaming at us. He had not said to load weapons, but the idiot I was watching had loaded his rifle and I did the same. Our punishment consisted of running around with our rifles held over our heads till we collapsed from exhaustion. I was physically and emotionally exhausted already by the rigors of basic training and had tears in my eyes while I was running around. Of course the drill sergeant noticed and pointed it out to the entire platoon with a heavy dose of ridicule.
After graduating from Basic and being promoted from Buck Private (E-1) to Private (E-2). I was sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky for “Advanced Individual Training” which in my case was Field Radio Mechanic school. The training was very good and even though I was a high school dropout, I did well. 95% of the graduates were promoted to Private First Class (E-3) upon graduation and the top 5% were promoted to SP/4 (E-4). I was one of those new SP/4s.
In less than six months I had gone from E-1 to E-4. However, I was still just 17 years old and had only completed 9th grade. I was too young to go to Vietnam at that point because they weren’t sending 17 year olds at that time, so I was sent to Germany instead. I was stationed about 30 miles Southeast of Frankfurt in a little town called Budingen. The town center was surrounded by a castle built in the 1200s and our Army base was just outside the town limits.
Because I had done so well in radio school, I was assigned to the Headquarters Company (they called them Troops, because it was a Calvary unit) instead of a line unit in the 3rd Squadron, 12 Calvary, within the 3rd Armored Division. Our unit was completely mobile; with helicopters, tanks, tracked vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and lots of trucks and jeeps. Everyone was assigned to a vehicle; either as driver or a passenger.
Not long after I arrived, I was assigned a jeep. Though I had driven a car a couple of times, I had never gotten a driver’s license because I never owned a car. No one seemed to mind when I mentioned that, so I taught myself how to drive the jeep by practicing in the motor pool area. The jeep was in terrible condition and I was supposed to be fixing it up. I was allowed to drive around the post trying to get parts and repairs done.
One day when I was joy riding around the post, I was stopped by a friend who asked me to give him a ride to the airfield, where the helicopters were kept. In order to get there one had to leave the post and drive one mile. I was not supposed to leave the post without permission, but I didn’t think that meant I couldn’t drop someone off at the airfield, so I said OK and took him there. On the way to the airfield it started raining a little.
I had very little experience driving, and no experience driving in bad weather. On the way back, the cobblestone streets were wet and slippery and I was going too fast. Disaster ensued. As I went around a bend in the road, the jeep lost traction and started sliding. I overcorrected one way and then the other, and then slammed head on into a brick wall. The jeep was totaled...and so was my nose from hitting the steering wheel!
In a few moments, the Army arrived to assess the damage and recover the jeep. My commanding officer (CO) also showed up and ordered me to go to the First Sergeant’s office and wait there for him.
The CO arrived and called the First Sergeant into his office while I stood at attention in the hall. After a half-hour or so they called me in and presented me with an “Article 15” -- which is non-judicial punishment administered for mostly minor infractions. I was demoted to Private First Class, restricted to post for 2 months and my pay was docked. I was also supposed to pay for the jeep, but for some reason that never happened.
Next, I was assigned a tracked vehicle called an M577. It was a “command” version of the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, that was taller and carried teletype equipment, radios and cryptography gear. I did such a good job of taking care of my vehicle and doing my everyday job as a radio repairman that I was eventually promoted again to SP/4. Later I was assigned to the job of Battalion Crypto Clerk, which was a wonderful gift given to me by the Communications Officer, who thought very highly of me despite my youth and uneven service to that point.
The Battalion Crypto Clerk’s job was truly a dream come true. I had the third floor of the Headquarters building all to myself and no one was allowed in my area except for the Communications Officer and a couple of other senior officers. The job required a Secret security clearance and I carried a 45 cal pistol in a shoulder holster at all times.
I was responsible for maintaining “Signal Operating Instructions” (SOI) booklets which contained frequencies and call signs to be used in case of deployment. I was also supposed to be the crypto operator and was sent to school to learn how to operate and maintain crypto machines, which were used to scramble and unscramble teletype messages sent via radio.
Normally, the job only required about two days of actual work each month, to duplicate the SOIs and put together the books in case I needed to hand them out for deployment or an “alert” which were unannounced training exercises. I was supposed to fire up the teletype and crypto machines once a month and communicate with headquarters in Frankfurt, but the equipment never worked properly the whole time I was there.
We would have had no way to communicate securely with headquarters if the Russians had ever crossed the border of West Germany, but no one at HQ ever seemed to care.
At this point, I got orders to go to Vietnam. I was supposed to go home for a two week vacation and then report to Fort Ord, California for shipment overseas. I was initially scared, but I eventually got used to the idea and figured I’d probably be OK as long as I was stationed in some base camp fixing radios rather than going out on patrol. I lucked out when my orders were cancelled just two weeks before I was supposed to leave Germany. I never did figure out why.
After a few months working in the crypto room, the CO decided it would be better if I lived on the third floor of the Headquarters building right outside my office. This was another great development because I didn’t have to live in the barracks any more and I didn’t have to show up for required formations, mornings and afternoons. The First Sergeant used the formations to inspect uniforms and haircuts, so I was able to avoid that for several months.
I let my hair grow out and stuffed it up under my hat any time I had to go outside my restricted area. But one day I had to get a paper signed by the Executive Officer (XO) and while I was in his office he pulled my hat off, and flipped-out. I was obviously a subversive with that long hair and he fired me from my job as crypto clerk. I had to move back into the barracks and was faced with returning to the motor pool as a radio mechanic unless I could work something out. I knew most of the other officers in HQ and talked to the intelligence officer to see if he had a job opening I could take. He offered me a job as a file clerk, but that only lasted about two weeks before the XO found out and demanded that I return to the motor pool and work as a radio mechanic.
Most of my days were spent wasting time and smoking hash with my buddies in the motor pool. Sometimes we would get in a track and close all the hatches, and then smoke bowl after bowl of hash. We were wasted all day, every day, and every night. We stole C-ration boxes off of the vehicles and kept them in the barracks for late-night snacks. We went into the little town of Budingen a couple of nights a week to hang out at the bars and try to hit on the few girls who were available.
On weekends we would go to Frankfurt and hit the bars there looking for women. Occasionally, before heading home we'd go to a huge whorehouse called Crazy Sexys where we could get a quickie for $15.
During this period, I met a really nice girl who was visiting Budingen and started a mostly long-distance relationship with her. She lived in Northern Germany but we corresponded regularly and spent time together whenever we could. See: “Ingrid, the Best Christmas Present.”
I settled down for a while and got my high school diploma and went to the gym in the evenings. But I lived in a room with four other guys and over time we became the main hash dealers for the entire post. We would go to Frankfurt once a week and pick up one or two kilos of hash. We took it back to our room, divided it up, and were open for business 24/7. We got away with it because no one in authority seemed to care what went on in the barracks and no one ever conducted a surprise inspection the whole time I was there.
Command’s disinterest wasn’t just confined to personnel matters. The boilers broke down in our barracks building and we went without hot water for an entire year! We were showering with cold water in the middle of winter and there was very little heat in the shower room as well.
The crypto clerk who replaced me got very ill and for a short time I was assigned to take his place. While this was going on, our unit was sent to a training area near the Czech border while I and a few other support personnel stayed behind in Budingen. When the time came to update the SOIs, I flew by helicopter to the training area and handed them out. I wasn’t supposed to return to Budingen for a couple of days and was hanging out with my buddies when I decided to take an M577 for a joy ride.
It wasn’t the first time I had taken a vehicle, including tracks, for a joy ride but it was the last. A friend and I went to the makeshift motor pool in the training area and took one of the 577’s for a ride in the woods. Some time later I was driving down a dirt road very fast when a deer bounded across the road and into the woods to my left. I immediately turned left as well to try and chase down the deer. We were plowing through everything in our path and loving it!
Then the deer went over an embankment and I followed right behind. Unfortunately it led to a creek bed and the slopes on both sides were very steep. So steep, that the 577 was wedged between the V-shaped slopes and the tracks weren’t making good contact with the ground. We were stuck! The tracks would spin but we weren’t going anywhere. We got out some shovels and tried to dig the track out but it was hopeless.
There was only one thing to do if we wanted to avoid trouble. We walked all the way back to the company area, got another friend to agree to help us, went to the motor pool and got another 577, and drove it back to where the other one was stuck. The new driver had been to Vietnam and really knew how to handle these vehicles. First, he knocked down a bunch of trees to make room to maneuver and then hooked up a tow cable and pulled the stuck 577 out of the creek bed.
We were so happy that we started racing the 577s on the way back to the motor pool. I was driving one while the Vietnam vet was driving the other. Suddenly the engine blew on the other 577. One of the pistons actually went through the drivers cab and almost hit the guy! Now we were truly screwed.
We hooked up the tow cable and towed the 577 into the motor pool area. It was getting dark and the area was almost deserted. No one was paying any attention to us as we spent several minutes positioning the 577s in line with the others so it would look like nothing was wrong, even though my 577 had a ring of mud around it from being stuck in the creek bed. Then we went back to the temporary barracks and acted as if nothing had happened.
The next morning, the two guys who were involved in the previous evening’s activities asked me if I had any clean uniform shirts and I loaned them both a clean shirt — both of which had my name tags on them. A couple of minutes later, a sergeant showed up and told us three to report to the First Sergeant. We knew what that meant.
We were standing at attention in the First Sergeant’s office when the CO came in and looked us over. He saw the name tags; Padgett, Padgett, and Padgett standing before him and that really set him off.
He came up to me with his nose a half inch from mine and screamed at me that this time I will pay dearly. But it wasn’t that bad. I got another Article 15 and another demotion to PFC, and I was supposed to pay for the engine that blew up. But once again, they never actually charged me for the damage.
Back to the motor pool I went. I spent many more days wasting time and smoking hash while I waited for my enlistment to end. I decided I should get my teeth fixed while I was waiting, so I went to the Post dentist office and asked for an appointment. They told me to come in on Thursday. I asked for an appointment slip that I could show to the new communications officer because I knew he was a hard ass. They told me I didn’t need one and to just come in on Thursday.
Thursday arrives and I tell the Commo officer that I have a dentist appointment. He says, “Where’s your appointment slip?” I said, “They said I wouldn’t need one.”
He says, “You can’t go without one.” I had had just about enough of the Army stupidness at that point and I swore, “Goddammit” and threw my hat on the floor. A bit childish, to say the least. He says, “Report to the First Sergeant.” Oh boy, I thought. Here we go again.
While I was standing at attention outside of the First Sergeant’s office and waiting for the hammer to fall, I realized that the only people who saw the exchange between me and the Commo officer were two other enlisted men who were friends of mine. I figured that they would not be witnesses against me — that they would say they didn’t see anything.
I got called into the CO’s office and there was the CO and the Commo officer looking pretty grim. They had my Article 15 already typed up and demanded that I sign it. When presented with an Article 15, an enlisted man has the option of demanding a court martial. But losing in a court martial usually means spending some time in the stockade before they give you a dishonorable discharge and kick you out of the Army.
I said I wanted a court martial and they looked at me like I was crazy. I said nothing happened at the Commo shop and I had no idea what they were talking about. In the days that followed and while they conducted their investigation, it became clear to them that there were no witnesses and so it was my word against the Commo officer’s. They soon dropped the case and I was permanently reassigned to the First Sergeant’s detail.
The First Sergeant’s detail was a squad that was made up of one guy selected each day from each platoon who had to work for the First Sergeant that day. The detail was anything the First Sergeant wanted done, from cleaning nasty stuff to sweeping streets to digging holes etc. It was basically punishment but in most cases it was work that actually needed to be done.
After 3 months or so on permanent detail, I went to the First Sergeant and asked him to give me break. I promised to stay out of trouble if he would ease up on me some. Well, he had another job for me alright — buying the ingredients for and making 300 baloney sandwiches every day, and stocking sodas that the CQ (Charge of Quarters — a sergeant who stays up all night in the barracks) sold to men who got the munchies at night.
The money the First Sergeant earned off of this was supposed to go to the “dayroom fund” (recreation room for the men that has pool tables, TV, games etc). The dayroom was beautiful, but it was never open because the First Sergeant wanted to keep it nice for inspection. Perhaps if he had let us use the dayroom once in a while we might not have smoked so much dope.
So, from then on I worked about two hours a day doing my job as the First Sergeant's Baloney Sandwich Guy. I would go to the PX and buy 10 cases of soda and enough bread and baloney to make 300 sandwiches. Then I would slap a piece of baloney between two pieces of bread and put them in sandwich bags. I also provided large jars of mayonnaise and mustard. I had his concession running so smoothly that the First Sergeant left me alone and I was free to spend my days doing whatever I felt like doing.
And what I felt like doing at that point was improving myself in mind and body because I would soon be hitting the real world again and have to fend for myself.
I was about six months away from the end of my enlistment when I heard that because the war in Vietnam was winding down the Army was letting some folks out early. Unfortunately my service dates fell just outside the deadline for qualifying for an “early out” and I was really annoyed at that. I went to the First Sergeant again and asked him if he could do anything about it so I could go home. He said, “Don’t worry about it, I’ll take care of everything.” And he did. I served a total of 2 years, 8 months and 14 days of my three year enlistment and was honorably discharged in July 1972.

As we cannot always drive ourselves to catch our flight or ask someone we know to get us there, we often use the help of a transportation service. While some of these transportation services are offering the best help they can there are a number of them who are not good at offering good help. That is simply because they are not good at doing their job right. That does not means there are no reliable or good door to door airport transfers for you to use. There are such good transportation services. However, you can easily make the mistake of using the wrong service. If you do that you should know these results you get to experience are going to be negative.
Missing the FlightIf you have hired the worst transportation service in the field you can at times face the worst result which is missing your flight. This can happen due to a couple of reasons. There is the situation where the vehicle does not arrive at your home at the right time. That is usually because the transportation service has not either gotten to know the right time you want to leave beforehand or simply because they are not careful with providing a good service. There are also times when you miss your flight as the vehicle they provide to you goes through mechanical problems. Again that is a problem with the transportation service as vehicles which are not maintained well are often going to face such problems.
Having To Have an Uncomfortable Travelling Experience When anyone books one of the private airport transfers sunshine coast they are hoping to have a comfortable ride to their destination. They are not getting ready for a bumpy ride which is going to be quite uncomfortable as the vehicle they get is going to be a really old one which is not maintained well. Such an uncomfortable travelling experience is not the perfect way to begin your journey.
Not Having Enough Space to Keep the LuggageThere are also times when you have to travel in a vehicle which does not have enough space to keep your luggage. This can be fine if you are the only one travelling. However, when there are a couple of people and you have to travel a distance that is going to be a really uncomfortable ride. If you are using a bad transportation service for your trip to catch your flight you should be ready to face any of such negative results. They can ruin your whole experience.

If you want to maintain the good looks of your car, it is best that you should know how to clean aluminum wheels of it. Taking good care of your car does not only limit until giving it a full body wash or vacuuming inside it. Aside from the exterior part of the car, the aluminum wheels should also be cleaned and taken good care of. Since it is one part of your car that is exposed to road debris, brake dust and other toxic materials such as road salt most of the time, it can give your car a dirty and dull appearance, which is not nice to look at. Also, knowing how to clean aluminum wheels of your car will prolong its lifeline therefore giving you the maximum service you need from it.
Sure driving your car into a car wash can be done easily, but do you know you can clean the aluminum wheels of your car just by yourself? You won’t need to spend a cent on it because even the materials that you will use can be found on the four corners of your house. All you will need to prepare are a bucket of water, spray hose, soap and 2 terrycloth rags. When you have these items on hand, you can know start cleaning the wheels of your precious car.
First of all before you start cleaning, check the condition of your wheels. Do not start cleaning if it is still hot. Let it cool down for some time before starting anything else. Spraying cold water on the brakes that are hot will damage the rotors. On the other hand if you spray warm water on the hot brakes, it can cause spotting. Nonetheless, you have no choice but to wait for your brakes to cool down for a while.
Remove the road debris, brake dusts and other particles off the alumni wheels by using a water hose. For better removal of debris and other particles, use the nozzle attachment of the water hose because this gives a higher water pressure. Mix water and soap with warm water on a bucket and make soap suds. Soak the terrycloth rag into the bucket until it is saturated. Get the rag and rub it on each surface and corner of the wheel. Reach out to the farthest part of the wheel to make sure that all debris and dusts are removed from your wheels. Use a brush with long handle for those parts where you cannot reach by your hand to remove the particles completely. However, before doing so, test the brush’s bristles in a small area and check maybe the bristle is too hard.
Brushing with a hard bristle can lead to scratching of the aluminum areas of the wheels. As much as possible, we would like to avoid this unwanted scratch. Remove the wheels and let it dry out by airing. Simple as this, you now know how to clean aluminum wheels by yourself.

Energy deregulation has been in place for several years however there are still a lot of people who are confused or who have not fully understand the implications, structure, details and workings of energy deregulation. Many simply know that energy deregulation means people now have the power to choose their electric companies – a diversion from the previous system where a single utility company provides services for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.
In terms of renewable sources like solar and wind, weather impacts supply. California’s duck curve[cite] shows the difference between electricity demand and the amount of solar energy available throughout the day. On a sunny day, solar power floods the electricity generation market and then drops during sunless evening, when electricity demand peaks.[117]
For example, in 2012, Hawaii residents had the highest average residential electricity rate in the United States (37.34¢/kWh), while Louisiana residents had the lowest average residential electricity costs (8.37¢/kWh). Even in the contiguous United States the gap is significant, with New York residents having the highest average residential electricity rates in the lower 48 U.S. states (17.62¢/kWh).[6]
Residential and business consumers in deregulated energy markets have the power to choose their energy supplier. The power to choose gives consumers the opportunity to compare suppliers and find energy plans that satisfy their usage needs and budget requirements. Whether in a deregulated city in Texas, New York, Ohio or another state, you can shop for electricity or natural gas and find the best plan for you!
The inclusion of renewable energy distributed generation and AMI in the modern electricity grid has introduced many alternative rate structures. Simple (or fixed) rate, tiered (or step) rate, TOU, demand rates, tiered within TOU, seasonal, and weekend/holiday rates are among the few residential rate structures offered by modern utilities. The simple rate charges a specific dollar per kilowatt ($/kWh) consumed. The tiered rate is one of the more common residential rate programs, and it charges a higher rate as customer usage increases. TOU and demand rates are structured to help maintain/control a utility’s peak demand. The concept at its core is to discourage customers from contributing to peak-load times by charging them more money to use power at that time.
No deposit electricity plans also offer a subjective advantages. Thanks to smart meters, electricity providers can offer you smartphone apps that send notifications when your balance is getting low, so you can purchase more kilowatt-hours before your account drops to zero. However, this also means you will track your energy consumption more frequently, as opposed to only once per billing period. Energy consumers who monitor their kilowatt-hour usage tend to consume less energy that those who only wait for power bills once per billing period.
When it comes to pinpointing specific months rather than seasons, every part of the country has its own highest- and lowest-demand months. For example, hotter states, such as Texas, have their lowest demand anytime between December and March.[2] When it comes to your own location, you can determine typical demand trends by taking a look at your area’s weather patterns or your billing records that showcase your personal monthly demand levels.

We are a “Regular” Lodge under the regime of the United Grand Lodge of England, under whom we were consecrated in 1998. The founders of the Lodge were formed from and by brethren who were regular members of the UK Mason forum list and other Web forums.
Now the first or one of the first questions we are asked is “How do you meet on the WEB?”, the short answer is we don’t. We are regulated by the Grand Lodge of England and in full compliance with that governing power. We hold three regular (Physical) meetings a year with the Installation of the Master in March in Manchester and the start of our Masonic year. The other two meeting are normally the choice of the current Master, this Year 2018-19 I have meetings planned in Tamworth, Staffordshire in August, and Harrogate, Yorkshire in October where the Ladies festival will be held.
Currently we have 470+ brethren in the Lodge whose homes are stretched Worldwide and as far away as East to Japan, stretching to the West and the West Coast of the USA. So as a member of the Lodge you should find other members within your area (it may even be in your city or state). As part of the “family” we actively encourage the wives, partners and friends to enjoy our weekend meetings from the Welcome dinner on the Friday evening to entertainment on the Saturday evening after the meeting OR even attending the festive board for the speaker’s presentation. You may even see that in the past we have ventured further afield to meet and visit so many countries as the “Family”
My chosen charity for the year is Fisher Homes, a charity formed in USA but now worldwide who cater for the Families of wounded Veterans. The recovery of our Veterans from physical and mental injuries should be made as comfortable for the families as possible and “Fisher Homes” is a charity helping in this way. My second Charity is the 1st Bangor Scout group who are a long-established group looking after the needs of youngsters in Bangor, County Down, NI.
Why did I choose these two charities to support? Well I and my wife are both Veterans, having served in the Royal Navy, although in the ten years I served I saw no conflict. The support for the Scout and Guide movement is a deep belief that we both also share with children and grandchildren in the movement as well as both of us still supporting the local group in the Birmingham Children’s Hospital on a Thursday evening for an “hour”!
Our Web pages are full of reports, postings on research from both our members and visitors so please click away.
I started my Masonic journey in 1978 having left the Royal Navy and Fleet Air Arm and was initiated into the Nautical Services Lodge No.5629 in Worcestershire. Their meeting place was in the suburb of Stechford in Birmingham, which is about as far away from the sea and salt water possible in England. I was initiated by my father in law, but on the evening, I was not aware it was him until a time during the ceremony of initiation, BUT I was aware he was a mason as he was my proposer. I progressed through the offices in the Lodge and was installed into the Masters chair in 1987, again being installed by my father in law. Since then I travelled the world experiencing Freemasonry as far away as Hong Kong in the 1980’s and 1990’s.
BUT what drew me to the “Internet Lodge No. 9659” for me it was the friendship shown on my first visit in 2006 and how much enjoyment I gained from that single visit on a cold March Saturday in Manchester. The World is YOUR oyster, as since my joining I have had the pleasure of meeting in many Masonic Halls in England and Wales. Also, with the Lodge I have travelled to countries and States as far away as Atlanta, USA, Bucharest, Romania, Edinburgh, Scotland and more, this year as Master I shall be taking the brethren to Belfast and Bangor in Northern Ireland to witness Irish Constitution working, that I know they will enjoy.
I extend MY hand of friendship to everyone to look at our pages on the Web, and perhaps fill out a joining form, you WILL be made VERY, very Welcome.
Abstract. The nonlinear forced vibrations of magnetization and elastic displacement in normal magnetized ferrite plate having magnetoelastic properties are investigated. For modeling of these vibrations the simplified system of two connected oscillators, one of which has magnetoelastic properties, is proposed. On the basis of this model the possibility of excitation of forced vibrations having auto-modulation character is shown. It is found six frame auto-modulation vibration regimes. For their interpretation two models are proposed: generalized potential and harmonic frequency generation.
