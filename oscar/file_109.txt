His favourite way of punishing you is to give you the silent treatment. This guy will not scream and rant if he is upset, but will stop talking to you or responding to your overtures. The point of this is to keep you guessing about what you did to anger him. Another way of putting you in your place is to withhold affection and sex. Even if you try to get close, he pushes you away.
A common tactic is to agree with what you are saying just to avoid an argument or fight. For instance, if you are trying to resolve issues in your relationship, your man will pretend to go along with you just to shut you up. However, he will not follow-through in the long run.
When a passive-aggressive man gets angry, he will not have a huge blow-out with you, instead he will make his unhappiness clear by brooding and simmering resentment. He refuses to sort out the issue with you and even if you ask him what’s wrong, he will deny being upset with curt phrases.
A passive-aggressive will annoy you and provoke you just so that he has the pleasure of seeing you upset and angry. This could either be by saying provoking things or by doing things that get your goat like being spendthrift or going out with his female friends without informing you.
He will be sarcastic and belittle you whenever he can because he needs an outlet for his deep-seated resentment of you. This could be in the form of a direct taunt or guised as humour. For instance, he will make a sarcastic remark about your cooking skills when you have people over just so that you feel bad about yourself.

That sounds fair right guys? If you’re investing in this very significant purchase for your future wife, maybe you should get something equally valuable like a new car…
When men are engagement ring shopping, oftentimes they are not certain what their girlfriend likes. They assume she will like a round brilliant solitaire (the odds are pretty good on a round since it is the most popular cut by 70%+) or pick something a jeweler might be trying to sell them, but shape and style is very important, gents. It is a serious risk to purchase without gathering the intel of your fiance’s style, desired setting and diamond shape preference.
An engagement ring is very personal and has significant emotional attachment. Speaking on behalf of the thousands of women I have helped (you can learn more about me here), the engagement ring is an extension of our identity, femininity and most importantly a symbol of your love. Knowing the style, shape and aesthetic is imperative if you want her to truly be happy with the ring you give her.
The best analogy to describe how women feel about their rings is to bring it back to cars. Men, you love your cars. For a majority, they are an extension of your personality, style and are a statement about who you are. So, what if your future wife was picking out a car for you. Would you want her to pick the white SUV Volvo with cream seats (since that’s what she likes)? Didn’t think so. You would rather she pick out EXACTLY what you will like, since you are the one who will be driving it. Grigio Maratea Metallescent Maserati, yellow break calipers, black stitching on the seats. Surround sound. More your style right? Think about that as you search for her ring.
And think about how many times a day (50), and how many days a year (365) she will be staring at her ring. That is 18,250 times a year on average (some of us admittedly stare at our rings wayyyy more than that). Trust me when I say, you want her thinking “Oh my gosh I love him so much, he really gets me” every time she stares at her ring. You don’t want her thinking “Why did he get me a pear shape? Why didn’t he get Yellow Gold instead of White Gold? I don’t like how this halo looks.” It sounds nitpicky I know, but my job is to help my clients avoid these situations so you don’t have to redo her setting in the future. You can learn more about my services here.
To recap, you may not get that new car for now, but with the right intel you will have one beaming, smiling, giddy wife who will daily be loving her ring and loving you to the moon and back for knowing what she loves. Congrats on finding the one and feel free to leave a comment below, I read them all.

Sanity? Why yes, indeed, I do have sanity. I've got loads of sanity, all kinds of sanity. Perhaps I've got a little too much sanity. I've got so much sanity, it's driving me out of my mind!
I'm a socially and economically conservative, progressive and liberally educated, dedicated fundamentalist Christian (Anabaptist/Pietist), and a computer geek (with Unix-oriented tendencies). My current medium-term project, which I've been working on since late 2003, is a six-year set of freely redistributable Vacation Bible School curricula. I have also perpetrated a NetHack variant. Sorry about that.
No. If you have to call the library and ask if your child is here, the answer is no. I know your child probably told you he'd be at the library, but what that really means is he didn't want to tell you where he was going to be, either because he hadn't decided yet, or because he just doesn't want you to know. This is true for children of all ages, but of course it goes double for teenagers. The library is the number one leading lie American children tell their parents about where they are going to be. This was true even before the Spiderman movie a couple of years ago gave the idea to the other 7% of kids who hadn't already come up with it on their own or picked it up from a friend.
Almost all kids who come to the library come with their parents. If you aren't here, then your kids almost certainly aren't here either.
Yes, we do have kids in the library all the time who are not accompanied by their parents, but it's the same two or three dozen kids all the time. (Some of them are here almost as much as they're in school.) If your child were one of them, you would know.
Let me reiterate that: if your child were one of the ones who comes to the library, you would know. If you have to ask, then he's not here. Please stop calling the library and asking if your child is here. Your child is not here.

In a very real sense, Tom Allen’s seafaring career began on the day his father’s ended. As Tom Allen Senior watched the barque Contest go to pieces on the beach at Rockingham, Western Australia, he decided to call it quits.[1] The year was 1874 and the 58-year-old Cork Irishman had been at sea for forty years. He had carried the last convicts to Hobart,[2] been falsely accused of smuggling in California, and had traded coffee through South-East Asia during the Crimean War.[3] It was time to settle, and time for his eldest boy to assume the mantle.
Tom Allen Junior, born at Port Adelaide in December 1859, first went to sea in 1861 when his father became master and part-owner of the barque Schah Jehan. A year later, he had a younger brother with even greater reason to claim the sea as his native element. Sarah Allen, who had sailed with her husband for most of their married life, was not troubled by the prospect of giving birth at sea, but the timing of the second boy’s arrival could not have been worse. On April 29th, 1862 she went into labour during a fierce electrical storm off South Australia’s Cape Northumberland. The storm was so severe that Captain Allen was unable to leave the bridge; he had no alternative but to leave his wife in the care of Schah Jehan’s steward and a thirteen-year-old girl passenger. The birth, although dramatic, was trouble-free. According to family folklore, little Seaborn Allen arrived to thunderous applause and a magnificent display of St Elmo’s Fire along the ship’s wires and masthead.[4]
Four years later, the birth of another boy was similarly commemorated. Marmion Allen was born at the Emerald Isle Hotel in Fremantle,[5] and proprietor William Marmion, later the Honourable William Marmion of the John Forrest Ministry, became the child’s godfather.[6]
Thomas Maurice Allen, conservative by nature, was probably grateful that by the ordinary circumstances of his own birth he was spared a lifelong reminder of his parents’ eccentricity. Within a few months of his p166 father’s retirement, he had left the Port Adelaide Grammar School and signed on as ordinary seaman aboard the City of Madras. Or was it City of Ningpo? Or City of Benares? Across the span of years, his mother could not remember exactly which of the Glasgow ‘Citys’ had taken her boy from home. More precisely recalled was his return as able seaman of Northern Monarch, which delivered 400 British immigrants to Port Adelaide on June 12th, 1876.[7]
It was in May 1878 that Tom Junior, as a quartermaster of the Orient liner Cuzco, faced his first major challenge at sea. On a voyage from Plymouth to Melbourne, Cuzco called at Cape Town for coal before steaming further south to take full advantage of the ‘roaring forties,’ the boisterous but reliable westerly winds south of the 40th parallel. For eight days Cuzco made wonderful progress, running at full speed under both steam and p167 canvas, but on the morning of May 23rd, about 600 nautical miles south-west of Cape Leeuwin, her main propeller shaft broke.
Captain Murdoch immediately ordered more sail set. Cuzco’s size, speed and disposition to the sea were all fortuitous; her conversion from sail-assisted steamer to fully fledged barque was accomplished quickly. Notices were posted at several locations, advising passengers that there was no cause for alarm. Disruption would be minimal, Murdoch insisted; the ship’s fine masts and good sailing qualities would carry them all safely to port.
The captain’s reassurance was a little premature. After further inspection, chief engineer McDougall told his commander that the break had occurred very near the sternpost; precisely how near, he could not say. There was a possibility that the propeller, with what little of the tailshaft remained attached to it, might slide aft and be lost. And if the propeller were to break free, it could take the rudder with it.
Later that evening a decision was taken. In daylight, an attempt would be made to secure the propeller by passing a heavy cable beneath it. As the fine detail of the operation was worked out, new advice was transmitted to the passengers. Their journey, Captain Murdoch now conceded, was likely to be of longer duration. Short ration allowances would apply in all classes while uncertainty remained. By all accounts, the passengers accepted the revised outlook very well, some even going so far as to send messages of support and condolence to the bridge.
If a line were to be slipped beneath the hub of Cuzco’s great propeller, it would first need to be fed through the gap between the sternpost and the rudder. On a ship with the rudder visible from the stern rail, that could be a straightforward operation, but Cuzco’s graceful rising stern extended some forty feet beyond the sternpost. Her propeller and rudder were far below and out of sight. The officers decided that two men—volunteers, if volunteers could be found—would be lowered over the sides, one from the port quarter and the other from starboard. At the rudder post, just above the waterline, one would use a pole to feed a light line through the gap; the other would endeavour to catch it with a hook. The light line could then be used to pull a heavier, weighted line into place. It was hoped that by keeping lines taut and vertical by means of carefully placed weights, a loop could be guided around the blades and hub of the propeller. Once that was done, a heavy cable could be made to follow the same path.
One of the men lowered over Cuzco’s side, for a different experience of the southern Indian Ocean, was eighteen-year-old Tom Allen. The identity of the other man is not known. That they succeeded in passing the line is remarkable. Although it would later be shown that the propeller had remained secure after the accident, and could never have eloped with the rudder, the visible restraint delivered peace of mind to a captain whose ordeal was far from over.[8]
p168 On Tuesday, May 28th, the weather turned. For the next twelve days Cuzco met storm after southern storm, culminating in a gale on June 8th that Captain Murdoch described as the worst of his 27 years at sea. “The sails were blown clean out of the bolt-ropes,” he later told a reporter from The Sydney Morning Herald.[9]
After sixteen difficult days, Cuzco found refuge at Portland, Victoria, where residents were surprised at the sight of an immense steamer coming into the bay under canvas. A few days later, upon a more compliant sea, the ship was towed to Williamstown for repair. She was the largest vessel ever to enter the graving dock, and Melbourne newspapers reported the progress of her repair in surprising detail.
It was discovered that the outer or propeller section of the shaft had broken only about a foot inside of the stern post. The adjoining section was disconnected . . . and the great rod of iron, about 10ft. in length and 18in. in diameter, was drawn out of the tunnel, and lifted p169 into the hold. The remaining 9ft. of the broken shaft is that portion which passes out through the stern, and holds the propeller. This will be removed from the exterior. In order to effect this the vast propeller is to be taken to pieces, four fins, each weighing about two tons, being unbolted separately and taken off.[10]
As repairs went on below, the local agents for the Orient Line opened Cuzco to the public. A correspondent for The Argus joined the throng.
Yesterday afternoon the graving dock was visited by thousands of people, the steamer Gem conveying a large number across the bay. The visitors were courteously permitted to inspect the ship, and her saloon and excellent appointments generally excited considerable admiration. The P. and O. Company’s steamer Assam was lying at the graving dock jetty, and H.M.V.S. Nelson was moored across the end of the dock. Both were open to inspection, so that visitors had an opportunity rarely offered of gratifying their curiosity in respect to naval architecture, both ancient and modern.[11]
Tom Allen Senior must have been delighted by the progress of his son’s career. At twenty years of age Tom Junior left South Australia again, as bo’sun of the Pacific liner Sorata.[12] While away he completed his Board of Trade examinations, and in 1883 returned home as first mate of the Meeinderry, a little 200-ton coasting steamer built for the Sydney–Shoalhaven run.[13]
The early experience of Tom Allen Junior was broad but not unusually so. His formative years were the years of transition from sail to steam, and he learned his craft aboard vessels that sported both masts and funnel. Without doubt, there was much to be learned. No aspiring commander could ignore the new machinery of motion, but respect for sea and sky still defined the age-old vocation.
It appears that Tom Allen Senior lived just long enough to see his son rise to the rank of master. Tom Junior’s first command—the first of many—was a brief elevation. In August 1884 he took the helm of the old barque Verulam when her captain was injured in a late-night fall from the Wallaroo Jetty.[14] Verulam had been trading on the coast since 1858. Although the old ship now earned her keep carrying coal, she had in her prime been one of the crack clippers of the home trade. It must have warmed the heart of a proud but ailing father to learn that his son would cut his teeth exactly as he had done, in a ship that conversed sweetly with the wind and paid no heed to the modern ways.
Only for one short period of his adult life was Tom Allen Junior wholly disengaged from the sea. When alluvial gold was discovered at Teetulpa in October 1886, Tom was one of about 4,000 optimistic South Australians who set up camp on the new field.[15] But gold prospecting was mere dalliance for a young man happily married to the sea. By late February, he was back in the arms of his long-time love.
A dozen ships later, Captain Tom Allen would freely have admitted that he had benefited greatly from the discovery of gold, but not in the way he had imagined as a restless 26-year-old. When the Western p171 Australian goldfields opened up, the Adelaide Steamship Company struggled to meet the demand for westward passage, especially from Melbourne. It chartered two ships: Buninyong from Melbourne and Tekapo from New Zealand. With the new vessels came opportunities for advancement; indeed, the sudden expansion of the fleet forced a wholesale reorganisation of the company’s officers and engineers. Tom Allen was perhaps the single greatest beneficiary of the reshuffle; on April 15th, 1894, he took command of Tekapo. The 2,400-ton steamer was no glamour ship but she answered the needs of both her young master and her impatient gold-seeking clientele.[16]
By the judgment of their peers, two classes of mariner are considered most accomplished: the masters of large cargo vessels, and the pilots who guide large and often unfamiliar vessels in and out of a major port. But these acknowledged experts enjoy very little public recognition compared to the ever-popular masters of passenger liners. And strangely, although frequent travellers may treat the captain as a personal friend, it is those who travel rarely who may feel the stronger bond. Like doctors, priests and midwives, ships’ masters rise to prominence at significant moments in their passengers’ lives. In October 1895, Tom Allen assumed the command that would guarantee such recognition. For several years the graceful, reliable S.S. Marloo had been a passenger favourite in all the ports of southern Australia, and some of that popularity was immediately accorded to her new master.[17]
p172 Tom Allen probably looked forward to a long association with the ship, but a terrible shipboard accident was to end his captaincy after only fifteen months.
It scarcely needs to be stated that if a ship has two decks above a cargo hold, hatchways one-above-the-other must pass through them. Marloo was such a vessel. Whenever she arrived in port, it was the responsibility of the chief officer to supervise the opening of the hatchways, and to ensure that stanchions were placed to prevent any passenger or crew member from falling into an open hold. The hatchways were a well-recognised danger, and cabins or bunks near them were often assigned to crew rather than passengers. On Marloo’s ’tween deck, however, no such reservation was feasible. A ring of double bunks surrounded the forward hatchway, and strict protocols were needed to keep passengers away until loading was completed and the dangerous openings were ‘trunked over.’
When passenger Francis Blackwell boarded the ship at Fremantle on the morning of Saturday, December 12th, 1896, things went terribly wrong. The 48-year-old had just arrived from the goldfields, to sail east and spend Christmas with his wife and five children in Ballarat. Although the ship was not due to sail until mid-afternoon, he came aboard at 8 a.m. and asked fore-cabin steward Tom Connor if he might have a particular bunk on the ’tween deck. Connor escorted him there.
Neither man knew that the stanchions directly opposite Blackwell’s chosen bunk had been removed and not replaced, and that only a heavy canvas curtain divided the narrow corridor from the open cargo hold. As Connor and Blackwell conversed, two men entered the corridor through an open door. As the steward turned to speak to them, Blackwell out of courtesy stepped backward to let them pass. The canvas curtain gave way as he lent on it; he fell backwards and head-first into the cargo hold, fracturing the base of his skull as his head struck the wheel of a traction engine. He never regained consciousness.[18]
The inquest held in the Fremantle Courthouse on January 7th, 1897[19] was a strange affair. Although Coroner Thomas Lovegrove presided, a jury of three non-nautical men would deliver the verdict. Across two sittings, Lovegrove conducted the investigation in a purely interrogative way, as if he alone would determine its outcome. Very quickly, three members of Marloo’s crew were shortlisted for blame.
Captain Tom Allen was not on duty at the time of the accident; he had handed command of Marloo to his chief officer upon their arrival in port. But that fact, he knew, was insufficient to absolve him. Under cross-examination he testified that no person was allowed to take down the stanchions without the permission of the chief officer, although it was frequently necessary and frequently done. The stewards, he insisted, were under strict orders not to permit passengers to enter the dangerous areas while loading continued.
p173 Chief officer Tom Truscott testified that when heavy cargo was being lifted, it was often necessary for crewmen to remove some of the stanchions so that the cargo suspended by derrick could be guided in or out of the hold. On the night before the accident, he had issued orders to the stewards to close off the dangerous areas, and to admit no passengers.
Fore-cabin steward Tom Connor testified that, under orders from the chief officer, he had secured the access doors the evening before the accident. The following morning, however, he had found the doors open; observing some passengers already in the area with their swags, he had escorted Francis Blackwell to the bunk he had asked for.
Whether Tom Allen expected any censure or suspension is difficult to judge, but when Coroner Lovegrove delivered his final summing-up, he focussed almost entirely on the actions of Tom Connor. To the jury he said: “The question you have to consider is, whether it was on account of neglect or laxity on the part of the fore-cabin steward that the deceased met his death.” Having framed the question so prescriptively, Lovegrove then proceeded to tell the jurors how it should be answered. In his opinion, the conduct of Connor had resulted in Blackwell’s death. In the eyes of the law, therefore, Connor was guilty of a very serious offence. “It is hardly necessary,” he declared, “for me to tell you what that offence is. I will leave the matter in your hands.”[20]
In criminal proceedings, there is no question whatever about who is on trial. Here, there was no such simple premise. The jury understood its broad prerogative and chose to exercise it. After retiring for only 35 minutes, the three men concluded that a serious criminal offence had indeed been committed, but not by Connor. They returned a verdict of culpable negligence—tantamount to manslaughter—against both Captain Allen and his chief officer.
Police Sergeant Houlahan, it appears, had been brushing up on his procedures in expectation of a finding against Connor. As soon as the jury foreman resumed his seat, the sergeant sprang to life. “In view of the verdict of the jury,” he declared to the bench, “it is my duty to apply for a warrant for the arrest of the captain and chief officer.”
Coroner Lovegrove was taken aback. “In view of my directions to the jury,” he replied, “I am surprised that you ask for it.”[21]
Barrister Matthew Moss, who was present as legal observer for the Adelaide Steamship Company, could not contain himself. Suddenly aware that two long-time servants of the company might be shackled and led away, he burst forth: “Do I understand that the sergeant is making an application for a warrant? The idea of the police attempting to take any further action after the strong expression of opinion which fell from you, Mr. Coroner, is inexplicable. . . . As a matter of fact, you would be stultifying yourself if you did issue a warrant.”[22] Moss’s point was clearly made, although his choice of words was odd. p174 The sergeant’s application was unforeseen, certainly, but “inexplicable” it was not. History records that Coroner Lovegrove stood his soft ground. No warrant for the arrest of Allen or Truscott was ever issued.
In quick succession, Tom Allen Junior left the witness stand, the courtroom, the Marloo, and the Adelaide Steamship Company. The adverse finding, it appears, damaged neither his reputation nor his prospects; within a year he had accepted a position of unquestioned responsibility as a Port Adelaide pilot.[23]
There is here a remarkable parallel between the careers of Tom Allen Junior and his father. Both men joined the Port Adelaide Pilot Service in the immediate aftermath of a questionable finding of negligence. In May 1862, in heavy weather, Tom Allen Senior had scuttled Schah Jehan beside the Wallaroo Jetty. Although the action was taken to save the vessel and to limit damage to the jetty, the Court of Marine Inquiry saw things very differently. The court’s criticism of the master was severe indeed, but one aspect of its finding was silly enough to cast doubt upon the rest. Tom Allen Senior had a 25 per cent stake in the vessel and was bankrupted by its loss, and yet the court condemned his “gross inattention to the interests of the owners.”[24]
Although father and son came to the Port Adelaide Pilot Service in similar circumstances, their respective engagements would end very differently. In September 1866 the steamer Coorong, with Tom Allen Senior in command as pilot, ran down the mailboat Mercury, slicing it in two. Two men including a fellow pilot were killed. Although the subsequent inquiry found that the skipper of the mailboat had erred in attempting to run across Coorong’s bows, there was broad agreement that the steamer had been travelling too fast. All censure was reserved for Tom Allen Senior; he was dismissed from the Pilot Service and forever banned from holding a similar position at any South Australian port.[25]
The cautious, teetotalling Tom Allen Junior determined never to make his father’s mistake. For ten years he safely guided vessels large and small into and out of Port Adelaide. It was a decade of service that established his reputation and delivered what he would remember as a highlight of his career.
On July 4th, 1901, Adelaide newspaper The Advertiser reported that Tom Allen, the youngest member of the Port Adelaide Pilot Service, had been chosen to pilot the royal yacht Ophir into Port Adelaide.[26] The royal visit had been a long time coming. More than two months earlier Ophir had slipped quietly by, carrying the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York to Melbourne for the opening of Australia’s first federal parliament. Since that great ceremonial day, the future King and Queen had toured Brisbane, Sydney, Auckland, Wellington, and Hobart. Only now, near the end of their six-month southern sojourn, would the couple step ashore in South Australia.[27]
Tom Allen’s honour was greatly extended by Ophir’s early arrival at the anchorage. He had expected to board the vessel early on Tuesday morning, but the call to service came on Monday evening. When the launch left the dock, conditions were far from ideal, but wind and rain played a part in making the night memorable. Against a sky coal-black and starless, white Ophir was dazzling: “one blaze of light from stem to stern,” the scribe from The Register would later declare.
Once aboard, Allen learned that arrangements had been made for his overnight stay. After being escorted to a fine cabin, he was told that the ship would receive other visitors during the evening, and that at 9 p.m. there would be a concert attended by the duke and duchess.[28] The young pilot probably thought that a brief introduction at the evening’s soirée would be his only direct contact with the royal couple. It was not so; his dealings with the duke would continue, on ground more natural and familiar. George had been a naval officer and remained a keen sailor. When the time came for Ophir to be guided into port, the future King George V joined Captains Winsloe and Allen on the bridge for the run up the river. And when Ophir was secure at the overcrowded dock, he complimented the pilot on his handling of the vessel and presented him with a scarf pin bearing the emblem of the White Rose of York. For Tom Allen, that accolade was next-best to a knighthood. Friends said that he treasured that pin and wore it often.[29]
p176 Among the most sought-after assignments for an Australian shipmaster was to be sent to the old country to bring out a new vessel. It was just such work that drew Tom Allen back to the Adelaide Steamship Company in 1906. In late October he boarded the Royal Mail Steamer Oruba as a passenger, bound for London and Glasgow to collect the new cattle steamer Junee. Six months later, after trouble-free trials and an easy delivery voyage, he handed the ship over to another master.[30] Just ten weeks later he was England-bound again, for a delivery assignment of even greater interest and prestige. His second trust was the innovative cargo carrier S.S. Echunga, nearing completion in the Middlesbrough shipyard of Sir Raylton Dixon & Company. Such was the early interest in Echunga’s design and capability that the ship was fully booked in advance. There would be no delivery voyage as such; she would proceed direct to New York to load general merchandise and only then make her Australian debut. Echunga’s ability to manage more than 3,000 tons of water ballast gave her officers extraordinary control over draft and trim, and cantilevered framing created a huge, unobstructed cargo space. Indeed, on the eve of her first arrival in Sydney, The Sydney Morning Herald hailed Echunga as “the largest cantilever steamer in the world.”[31]
Tom Allen probably expected to retain command of Echunga, but not long after her commissioning, international demand fell so sharply that p177 the company saw no alternative but to lay the vessel up.[32] The commercial uncertainty lasted only a few months, but by the time Echunga returned to service, her first commander was otherwise engaged. Tom Allen had settled back into the steady, reliable work of carting coal from New South Wales to South Australia. As master of Winfield, he plied between Newcastle and Port Pirie for most of the next three years. Although there were brief secondments to other ships,[33] it seemed that the 45-year-old, now as accomplished as any man in the mercantile marine, was biding his time.
It is not known when John Rees, master of Koombana, and Tom Allen, master of Winfield, first discussed the possibility of swapping ships. Perhaps Captain Rees made a formal request to be transferred from the Nor’-West run, or perhaps the two men reached private agreement and only then approached the company. At a glance, it seemed odd that Rees was willing to trade fast, elegant Koombana for coal-smudged Winfield. After all, he had been present at Koombana’s launch, had taken part in her sea trials and had brought her out to Australia. He was to Koombana what Tom Allen was to Echunga.
For Tom Allen, the swap was an opportunity. Koombana was considered by many to be the finest ship in Australian service, and the Nor’-West run was broadly acknowledged as the most demanding. Whatever the private thoughts of the protagonists, the company did not object to the exchange. In Sydney, during the last week of August 1911, the two experienced masters traded places.[34]
To her new master, Koombana delivered a difficult initiation, just as she had to his predecessor. On his first run into Port Hedland, Tom Allen grounded the ship on the western bank of the channel. He was not greatly troubled; the seabed was soft and there seemed very little likelihood of damage to the hull. He ordered one starboard-side ballast tank pumped out, and within an hour was afloat and on his way to the jetty. He noted the occurrence in the ship’s log, recorded Koombana’s draft fore and aft, and determined not to make the mistake again.[35]
Four weeks later he approached Hedland from the south for a second time. Using his first approach as a guide he raised the ship higher by emptying tanks both port and starboard. But once again he found the bottom. This time the contact was a mere scrape; Koombana slithered over the bar without any need to stop or reverse.[36]
What Tom Allen quickly learned was that Koombana’s schedule was not moulded to client demand or company convenience; it was tightly bound to the cycle of the tides at two particular ports. For about three days in every fourteen, at Port Hedland and Broome, there was insufficient water for Koombana to reach the jetty, even at the top of the day’s highest tide.
A round trip from Port Hedland to Derby took seven days, and therein lay an intractable problem. Seven days is one quarter of the lunar cycle; p178 it is the gap between the spring and neap tides. If Koombana were to leave Port Hedland on high spring tide, with water to spare beneath her keel, she would almost certainly be locked out of the port on her return. This quirk of geography was the bane of Koombana’s working life. Tom Allen could not choose a different track to Derby any more than he could sway the cold mistress of the night sky. Like his predecessor, he recognised that the only viable option was to negotiate Port Hedland on the shoulders of the spring tides, when the depth of water over the bar was marginal at best. If the port could be reached three or four days before ‘springs’, he would have just enough to get in on his way north, plenty of water at Broome in both directions, and just enough to re-enter Port Hedland on the way back. It was a delicate arrangement, and any delay could break it.
Not all of Koombana’s Nor’-West voyages terminated at Derby. It was also her mission to serve the tiny settlement of Wyndham, five hundred miles further north and east. On the longer run, the problem at Port Hedland disappeared because the time between northbound and southbound arrivals increased to fourteen days. That was half of the lunar cycle, and perfect for managing the tide: Koombana could leave Hedland on the full moon and return for the new moon, or vice versa, gliding into port with ease on both occasions. But as one problem faded away, another rose to prominence. From Fremantle, the 4,000-mile round trip to Wyndham could not be completed in the 28 days of the lunar cycle. If Koombana were to visit the last outpost on every trip, she would soon be hopelessly out of phase. The company’s schedulers arrived at a simple solution. The Derby trips would average 23 days, they calculated, and the Wyndham trips 30. If Koombana were to visit Wyndham on alternate months, time lost on the longer run could be made up on the next. From a purely logistical standpoint this solved the problem, but the regime placed absurd demands on the crew. After four weeks at sea in tropical heat, members of the crew were often permitted only two or three days of shore leave before Koombana was northbound again.
After hitting the Hedland bar on his first two Nor’-West runs, Tom Allen was determined that the third would be different. And different it was. Of the protracted firemen’s strike which tied Koombana up at Fremantle for three weeks, much is elsewhere written. What is important here is that the delay was not 14 days or 28 days, which would have left Koombana in harmony with the tides, but 20 days. In a single stroke, all synchronicity was lost.
Koombana’s Trip No. 34 of December 1911 was her worst ever. On her way into Shark Bay on December 4th, she scraped a sandy ridge at Heirisson Flat, less than a mile from where Captain Rees had run her hard aground three years earlier.[37] Just twelve hours after that scrape, Koombana was aground again, near the Carnarvon jetty. She floated off on the high p179 tide.[38] Port Hedland was reached on December 9th, three days after the full moon. There was barely enough water for the ship to gain admission, and because the tides were becoming less generous with each passing day there was a distinct possibility that she would be trapped inside for several days. By pumping out most ballast tanks, Captain Allen made his exit the following day, but his difficulties continued. The extension of the run to Wyndham meant that Koombana would face similar conditions when she returned to Port Hedland on the run south. At any other time, he might have cut Wyndham from the itinerary, but the strike had left all Nor’-West ports short of food. Although Wyndham had received some supplies from Singapore, the town was desparate for fresh produce from the south. To call there was imperative.
Koombana scraped back into Port Hedland at ‘dead neaps’ on Christmas Day 1911. The following day, all ballast tanks were emptied to give her the best chance of escape. She left the port riding so high that the top of her propeller was fully eighteen inches clear of the water.[39]
Tom Allen had been at sea for almost forty years but had never experienced such enslavement to the rise and fall of the sea. Koombana and the Nor’-West, it seemed, were partners in adversity. It is likely that he now saw his exchange with John Rees in a different light. He had come to Koombana wondering why a senior colleague had been so willing to give her up. Now he was aggravated by the Nor’-West: its heat, its dangers, and the extraordinary demands its so-called ports placed upon Koombana in particular.
After six months of pumping out ballast tanks and pressing them up again he also knew that Koombana, so well-behaved when deeply laden, was far from reassuring when riding high. He must have wondered how she would fare in a storm like that which had swallowed Yongala and her complement a year earlier. In a letter dated March 8th, 1912, he told an east-coast colleague that the worst of the Nor’-West cyclone season was over. “I just kept clear of a blow last trip,” he wrote, “but as soon as I got round the North-West Cape it started, so my luck was in that time.”[40]
After several days of oppressive heat, Wednesday, March 20th, 1912 dawned grey and windy. Port Hedland was unusually busy. For the first time ever, Koombana shared the jetty with Bullarra, the vessel she had replaced in 1909. The Adelaide Steamship Company had decided to introduce a fortnightly service and ‘the old Bull’ was back in town.[41] She had been scheduled to leave for Fremantle on Tuesday, but her shipment of cattle had arrived late and she had missed the tide. Bullarra would now follow Koombana out of port.
No one was quite sure what to make of the weather. For three days the barometer had been falling, but not sharply. The wind had come in hard for a couple of hours overnight, but by daylight had eased to a moderate p180 nor’-easter. Some of the locals were preparing their houses for a possible blow, but that was something they did more than once in an average summer, to be safe rather than sorry. At the harbour entrance the sea seemed a little flustered, with white-caps riding along the crests of a low swell from the north-west.[42]
As the passengers of the two ships mingled with townsfolk on the jetty, a few noticed that Captain Allen seemed ill-at-ease; indeed, he gave some inquirers the impression that he did not want to leave port. “Twenty-four hours here will not hurt,” he told local newspaper man Walter Barker, “I might bump the outer bar going out on a sea like this.”[43]
Allen’s concern about the sea at the entrance was well founded. After a few scrapes and bumps it had become his practice to study the tide charts, predict the depth of water for departure, and adjust the ship’s draft as soon as the discharge of cargo was complete. It is likely that he had trimmed Koombana on Tuesday, anticipating the tide but making no allowance for a rough sea at the entrance. This was a difficult situation: Koombana would certainly pitch and roll when she felt the wind and the sea on her starboard side, but if time were taken to reduce her draft, the peak of the tide would be missed. By delay, the problem could easily be made worse. p181
There was a second strong argument for remaining in port. With a top speed of fifteen knots, Koombana was a fast ship; in fair weather she could make Broome easily between tides. But on this day the wind was east-north-east; after rounding Bedout Island, Koombana would be punching into a short, sharp sea. For the comfort of passengers, speed would have to be reduced, and the noon high tide in Broome would almost certainly be missed. There was another high tide around midnight, but he had never brought the ship to the Broome jetty in darkness, and was not keen to attempt it in rough weather. By his reckoning, a full day would be lost regardless of whether he left port, and regardless of any further deterioration of the weather.
To Tom Allen’s consternation, there were also good reasons for leaving. Koombana was running late. She had entered Port Hedland two days after the new moon; she now had to reach Derby and be southbound before the neap tides made the Broome jetty unapproachable. If Koombana were forced to remain outside at Broome, southbound consignments would be delayed by a full month.
It is difficult to know if the possibility of a cyclone influenced Tom Allen’s thinking. Every shipmaster would prefer to face a storm on the open sea rather than among reefs and islands, but a choice between Port Hedland and the open sea was not nearly so clear-cut. The harbour was little more than a mangrove-fringed tidal estuary with a jetty projecting into a deep pool. If Koombana were caught there in a cyclone, she would almost certainly end up in the mangroves, perhaps permanently. In this scenario, the interests of passengers were clearly at odds with the interests of the shipping company. The passengers would be safer upon dry land—or wet land, flooded land, any land—than at sea in a tropical storm.
According to Walter Barker, Captain Allen appeared to change his mind after a conversation with Captain Upjohn of the Bullarra. “I am going out,” he then told the newsman. “The Broome passengers, who think they will get to Broome to-morrow, will be lucky if they get there on Saturday—I’m going straight out to sea, and will fill my tanks when I get outside.”[44]
Tom Allen remained uneasy. During the morning about forty luggers had come in from the pearling grounds. When some of the boats blocked the channel, he asked the Harbourmaster to have them cleared away, and when one remained, he declared bluntly that he would not leave unless it was removed.[45]
Port Hedland’s method of indicating the depth of water over the bar was simple but effective. Large wicker spheres were lowered one by one from a yardarm at the top of a steel tower on the foreshore near the Port Hotel. On March 20th, 1912, it was nineteen-year-old Bert Clarke who climbed the tower to deliver the signals.[46] At about 10.20 a.m., when the tower indicated 19 feet, Koombana began her run to the entrance. Twenty p182 minutes later, Bullarra followed her out. It is difficult to judge whether it was Bert Clarke or Bullarra’s officers who kept Koombana in sight for the longest, but Bert certainly had the better view. “Normally,” he recalled, “ships going northbound were out of sight within 30 or 45 minutes, but this day as the storm was getting stronger I stayed up there in the tower watching the Koombana pitching and rolling for nearly two hours.”[47]
After crossing the bar without contact, Tom Allen may have permitted himself a sigh of relief. But that indulgence can only have been momentary. There were important decisions to be made, and made quickly. The master of another steamer may have considered leaving the ballast tanks empty, but if this thought entered Tom Allens’s head, it can only have flickered. Koombana partly ballasted was difficult to control, even in port. p183 Without question, the tanks had to be filled. And once the pressing-up was commenced, it had to be completed, because a sloshing, half-full tank could be more detrimental to the ship’s handling than an empty one.
The next question was how to accomplish the refilling. In calm conditions it was a simple if time-consuming operation, but this day seemed determined to be different. Because the usual course to round Bedout Island was due north at first, the wind would be ‘on the beam’ while the tanks were being filled. That would certainly be uncomfortable; if conditions worsened, it could be dangerous. The captain’s preference would have been to put Koombana’s head to the wind and steam slowly until the re-ballasting was complete. But all eastward progress was blocked by reef and shoal water. He may even have considered dropping anchor, but to take that option was to lose at least three hours without making any progress at all. If the weather were to deteriorate, that decision would be difficult to defend.
It appears that Captain Allen and his officers reached an intelligent compromise. Firstly, by steering a little east of north, the ship’s roll was limited by keeping the wind as much on the bow as the beam. Secondly, by reducing speed and allowing the ship to ‘sag away’ on the wind, an approximate northerly course was maintained. To Bert Clarke, atop the Hedland tower, Koombana appeared to be struggling. She was not. Her slow progress and rolling motion were merely symptoms of the necessary work in which she was engaged.
p184 Tom Allen may have permitted himself a second sigh of relief when the reballasting was completed. But this relief must also have been short-lived. For Bullarra, conditions changed alarmingly in the middle of the afternoon.[48] Koombana would have encountered something similar. By 4 p.m. Captain Allen must have suspected that he was feeling the influence of a cyclone to the north-west. An hour later, with a rising north-easterly sea crossing a long north-westerly swell, he must have known it. Although he may have regretted the time lost in pressing up the tanks, he cannot have regretted his determination to accomplish it.
On Monday evening and through the early hours of Tuesday the storm had tracked southward over Rowley Shoals. Had it continued on this course it might have crossed the coast near Cape Keraudren at the western end of the Eighty Mile Beach, but under some unknown atmospheric influence its southward progress was thwarted. Across the daylight hours of Tuesday it made a broad right-hand turn, to sweep westward past Bedout Island in the late evening. In the early hours of Wednesday morning the wind blew hard in Port Hedland, but by the time Koombana and Bullarra left the port it had eased to what Captain Upjohn of the Bullarra would later describe as a “very nice fresh breeze.”
If the storm had continue to track westward across open water, the winds at Port Hedland would have gradually shifted anticlockwise, from east-north-east to north-east to north. They did not; over 24 hours the wind strengthened steadily but shifted little. And the same was true at Wallal and Whim Creek and Cossack, although the direction of the wind was different at each place. The explanation was unusual but simple: by 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the westward advance had ended. At about S 18º 20' E 117º 40', the storm eased back a little to the east and then simply hovered.[49]
It is dangerous to think that a storm which fails to advance also fails to thrive. Often, the atmospheric influences that steer a cyclone are antagonistic to its development. By contrast, a storm unguided may intensify rapidly, at least for a few hours until the upwelling of cool seawater begins to suck the life force from it. So it was for this monster-in-the-making: throughout Wednesday, it drifted a little this way and that, gathering its resources, as if pausing to decide where the greatest damage might be done.
Mariners may prefer a storm that moves slowly enough to be outrun, but the cyclone that hovers and intensifies creates two distinct problems. Firstly, it cannot be told apart from the storm that approaches the vessel directly. In each case, the shipboard observations are the same: a falling barometer, a rising wind, and a wind that shows little sign of swinging. Secondly, the wind by its stubborn consistency may produce a truly phenomenal sea.
The eye of the storm was to the north-west; that he knew. How far to the north-west, he could not say. With most points of the compass foreclosed by islands and shoal water, Tom Allen was left to decide between three courses of action, all difficult and all dangerous.
He could turn Koombana to port and steam due west, with the wind on his starboard quarter. He would enjoy deep water and navigational freedom but would steam directly into disaster if the storm should recurve toward the land.
Alternatively, he could gain sea room very quickly by steaming nor’-nor’-west. But by so doing, he would move closer to the storm’s centre and, moreover, place the ship in ‘the dangerous quadrant’: that area to the front and left of an advancing storm, where wind speeds are greatest and where the wind tends to sweep a vessel directly into the storm’s path. Worse still, progress in that direction could only be made with the wind and the sea fully on Koombana’s beam.
Finally, he could continue on his track to Broome, taking the shortest safe path around Bedout Island before steaming east-nor’-east out of harm’s way. Here too, the complications were daunting. Two hours at least had been lost in pressing up the tanks; Koombana would be abeam of Bedout at low tide and in failing light. Sighting the island’s unattended beacon would be more important than usual because the ship’s slow, crabbing track had made it difficult for his officers to establish the ship’s p186 position by what is called “dead reckoning.” Tide would be critical too, especially if Koombana had strayed a little to the east. Along the intended deep-water track, the state of the tide was of little consequence, but closer to the reef the rising seabed could mould and magnify the deep-ocean swell. On this day, no master could predict what sea and land might together contrive.
What anguish must there have been for the conservative commander whose every contemplation sought the safe way. Suddenly that principle—nay, that vocation—found no outlet. There was no safe way. All the ships of a long career had carried him to this place, but nothing in his résumé could contain the present danger or light the way. And therein lay the essence of Tom Allen’s dilemma: the sum of all decisions had led him here, yet none nor all could guide him hence.
It is not difficult to imagine that the dominant emotion was not fear but profound exasperation. Locked in a game of chess he had never sought to play, he was pinned, in check, on a board left sparse by the sacrifices of the day, and with an invisible opponent awaiting his next move.

This is soooooo much fun. For those of you who don't know I am working on a book about - what else- digital printing alternative surfaces.
My team and I are going to be doing a small test book of a couple chapters, so I am busily finishing several parts of chapters for us to use. Today I am working on pairing images to surfaces for the second section of the Recycled Chapter. This section of the chapter is about melting plastics and this afternoon I will be precoating the surfaces and sizing images for printing tomorrow.
I won't be sharing any of the pictures from the book here - you'll have to wait for a copy when my book comes out in the spring of 2013.
If you want to get my latest posts on digital alternative surfaces make sure you visit my Digital Alternative Surfaces site.
I will be publishing an updated version of my "Wrap it Up: Journals with Style" The updated version will contain videos interspersed through the book. It will be available shortly as an iPad version. Stay tuned on the release!

My art is intuitive, expressed directly through the materials I choose. Sketching and drawing is not natural to me, but gathering elements and using them to dream up my ideas is. Working with tangible materials; moment by moment, allows me to achieve the form and flow of artwork. I create a vision that expresses color, texture, layers, shapes and structure. My inclination is to use materials other than what they are intended for. This keeps me from following a preconceived path and creates a sense of tension and surprise as I work and in the finished piece.
Experience my studio. Here will evolve the artwork that is being created from day to day, what I'm thinking, what moves me- what I do within the walls of my creative world as art evolves.

Aquis Farm’s decision to buy into Domesday colt Extra Brut earlier this week paid immediate dividends when the 3YO won today’s Group 1 Victoria Derby at Flemington.
After settling close to last in a fast-run Derby, jockey John Allen pulled Extra Brut the widest around the Flemington home straight before unleashing a powerful sprint to win the blue-riband event.
In doing so he led in a First 4 of Inglis graduates in the Derby as Extra Brut (Domesday x Dom Perion) beat Stars of Carrum, Chapada and Sikorsky.
Aquis boss Tony Fung, who is based in Hong Kong, and his son Justin were both at Flemington to watch today’s race.
“We identified him as always being Domesday’s best son, he’s Tony Fung’s favourite stallion up north,’’ McGrath said.
“Having the boss [Tony Fung] here, having Justin [Fung] here, it’s what dreams are made of, winning Derbies. It couldn’t have gone any better for us.
“Winning a Derby, it’s one of the treasured races worldwide. It’s such a privilege to be here with the Fung family and everyone involved with the team.’’
Bred by Andrew McDonald, Extra Brut (pictured) was a pinhook success story for Gary Mudgway and Grange Thoroughbreds through Inglis sales.
Mudgway bought Extra Brut as a weanling for $52,000 from Stonehouse Thoroughbreds at the 2016 Great Southern Sale.
He then onsold the colt for $100,000 to Spicer Thoroughbreds at the Classic Yearling Sale seven months later.
“We had a lunch up at Weiry’s 12 months ago and I said ‘he looks like a Derby horse’ but you say that about a lot of these horses who are bred to stay that look like they’re stayers,’’ Spicer said.
“To have Aquis involved, Mr Fung is a big investor in racing so it’s really great for them. It will keep them very interested going forward in our industry.’’
Meanwhile Aristia will back up in Thursday’s Group 1 Kennedy Oaks at Flemington following her strong win in today’s key lead-up, the Group 2 Wakeful Stakes.
Aristia was an $80,000 buy for First Light Racing, Ellerton Zahra Racing and Paul Willetts at the 2017 Australian Easter Yearling Sale, where she was offered by Vinery Stud.

Tomorrow morning an order of compost is being delivered to the garden for those Gardeners who have paid Linda for compost. If you are interested in adding on to this order at the last minute there is still time. The compost is $35 per cubic yard, approximately 2 wheelbarrows worth.
To add to the order please send a PayPal payment for the amount you want to lindakubit@gmail.com by 9am tomorrow. The compost will be delivered by 11am near the picnic tables.
If you did not pay for compost please leave it alone. If you take some you are stealing from those who paid. Please respect your fellow gardeners.
We are welcoming new gardeners to the Napili Community Garden this month. If you see someone new say hello and please help with any questions they may have. We ask that everyone take the time to read the Rules and By-Laws, on this website, to refresh themselves with the rules.
Organic Management of Plots ONLY this means seeds too! You can purchase organic seeds from many locations on Maui, just about anywhere seeds are sold there are organic options:
Additionally, you can order seeds online. I encourage gardeners to organize themselves to save on shipping costs, please keep in mind some items cannot ship to Hawaii:
Sometimes getting started in the garden can be difficult especially with the soil we have. We recommend making some amendments to the soil to balance the PH our soil is rather acidic. You can help this with planting nitrogen rich plants (like peanuts or beans), or by adding Dolomite (natural lime) available at Hawaii Growers in Kahalui http://www.hawaiigrowerproducts.com/ . They also have other great organic management options.
If you are interested in ordering compost that will be delivered to the garden via dump truck for $35 per cubic yard please send an email to lindakubit@gmail.com. If you have already given your money for this there is an order placed which will be filled this week the farmer’s loading equipment broke (so this morning’s delivery is delayed). A second order will be placed once Linda has the money in hand for at least 7 cubic -yards. Compost is very helpful in making your food grow, it balances the soil and helps to make your existing soil even better.
One of our gardeners is renting a tiller to dig up that hard red dirt clay. If you are interested in joining her on this rental please give Ute a call at 808-280-6464.
I hope you’ve all had a wonderful Easter and not overindulged on chockies. I’m pretty proud of myself as I’ve just had my first one and it’s Easter Monday here in Australia – I don’t even think I’ll need to eat anymore. The challenges I’m entering today are colourQ Challenge and The Paper Players. Here are their inspiration pics:
It was a quick card for me for once as I was trying really hard for a clean and simple style. The Stampin’ Up! stamp sets I’ve used are Flower Shop, Petite Petals, Summer Silhouettes and Tape It. As I’m just looking at my card I’m seeing a bluey tinge in the background, but my card base is definitely Whisper White – not sure what happened with my photo.
Beautiful, Narelle! I just HAD to have Tape It and I haven’t used for a while, I love what you did with it. Lovely way to use the challenge colors too! Thanks for sharing this with us at the Paper Players and the CQC this week!
What a sweet card, Narelle, your background is perfectly white, I am not sure what blue you are seeing! Thanks for joining in the fun at the colourQ.
Lovely card, Narelle–the colors are so soft and pretty! I love how you’ve used the Tape it stamp Iset and the little pop of blue tape is perfect! Thanks for joining in the washi fun at The Paper Players!
This is a lovely creation as always, Narelle! I like how you stamped your faux washi tape and your floral bouquet, and you kept it CAS with plenty of white space. Thanks so much for joining us this week at The Paper Players!
Stunning Narelle! I love the dimension from the flowers. Thanks so much for joining us this week at the Paper Players! 🙂

ok so i know a few people have civics with the h22 swap in them and have bee looking all over and have come across a few threds that said h22 have a few issues going into civics like the unibody bending because of power are thies things true or just thinfs that happened because of poor builds i am also curious on the h2b would i still have to weld new mounts or can i sue the stock mount and curious on some good sugestions of aftermarket parts such as cams maybe some opinions on how to get the most power out of a h22 n/a also turbo or sprayed i would also like to see pictures of others that have h22 swaps so pleas feel free to poast i have not started mine but will poast pics after i start my build
I believe and I've heard that you need to get a good firm front suspension.. H22 are heavier and good HP so the suspension needs be tightened up.. Again not sure so someone correct me if I'm wrong.. And I would personally boost
that is what i am leaning tword i have seen on youtube good numbers for boosted h22s what are good set ups for boost! and all opinions are welcome again
As far as an H22 in another chassis, the biggest problem I have with them is the axle angles are all wrong. That was one of the purposes behind the H2B setup. Use the B series transmission in its original location along with a standard B series mount and attach it to an H22. Keep the stock B shift linkage, basically, everything you need to do a B series in your chassis, but with an H22 powerplant.
As far as boosting an H22, if you want anything more than moderate power, you are either going to build a sleeved block or look at using Mahle Gold Series pistons in it. The H22 sleeves are made of a material called FRM. It is not really compatible with forged piston setups.
thanks foy your input but i herd with the h2b set up like some of the greas are not long enough to get max power out of
No, actually, going to the B-Series transmission has given greater flexibility to putting power to the ground between both all motor and turbocharged setups. There is also the aftermarket availability of gearcases and gearsets to hold substantial amounts of power. I personally was going to run a gsr trans for my boosted H2B setup that I abandoned. They also tend to put more power to the wheels through a B transmission than an H transmission. The H2B is just a proven setup. Current fastest is Reid Lund from Kaizenspeed having run into the 8.7x's at over 170 mph in an Outlaw class car.
i am sorry i guess that i am confused because i herd the gsr trans put out more tq but has shorter grears witch in turn isnt good for boost because you dont get to hit full boost because you have to shift to soon? is that not corect what is the highest rpm you can go with stock gsr trany
I have turned my completely stock GSR transmission to 9200 RPM and have been able to change gears without a problem. You can make it turn 140+mph at the top of 4th depending on tire size and engine RPM. Whatever you are reading or hearing is incorrect. Stock GSR transmissions have run mid 9 second passes with many of them topping 150mph...in 4th gear. Neither Eric nor myself have reached the limit of the stock transmissions yet. I have almost 20mph I can go in 4th gear before I hit the limiter, and I trapped at 130mph.
ok thanks any other input on this topic picking up motor soon would like as many peoples input as possible befor i perches motor
Just so you know, there is a ton of work that needs to be done for an H2B setup. It is about as far from a drop and go swap as a K-series is, and maybe even further. I personally went with the QSD (QuarterSportsDrag) kit, and would purchase it again in a heartbeat. I do not like the EVO/Bisimoto kit. I don't like that you can't use standard B-series mounts, that you have to use theirs. I also don't like that they sacrificed axle angle to get the hood to close like stock. That is the whole point of doing the H2B, keeping the stock axle angle. If you do decide to go H2B and you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. I have done it (albeit for a short time), but I did all the hard work, and I know my way around pretty much anything Honda.
thanks for the imput i am pritty firm on the swap so i will be intouch do you know how to do the wireing
The wiring is pretty straight forward for your setup. Extend the alternator wiring and add VTEC wiring. Also have to do some work with the external ignition coil depending on your distributor. Other than that, not much comes to mind.

As some of you may know, I have been dealing with some health issues that have kept me from doing what I love, Crafting!! I have been feeling a bit better and have made it to my craft room to do some organizing and decluttering. While I was in there I had the urge to make a card! I hope that means I am ready to get back to it! I sure have missed creating and sharing with you all! So enough about all that! Who wants to see my card!? :)
Please put it on sale, as well as other vehicles. I think we're all tired of rocking only infernuses, pcjs and hydras
Problems or successes, they all are the results of our own actions. Karma. The philosophy of action is that no one else is the giver of peace or happiness. One's own karma, one's own actions are responsible to come to bring either happiness or success or whatever.

HighClouds, your fresh and fun source of serious music, is proud to announce its very first contest. We will twice bring into play one ticket for Teen Daze‘s concert at the lovely concert venue that is the Botanique in Brussels. To participate, just head over our Facebook page and follow the steps. The two winners will be announced on Christmas day.
For his new musical project, the follow-up of 2013’s LP “Glacier”, one-mand band Teen Daze, whose real name is Jamison, knew it would been done out of his room and comfort zone. Bearing over 30 demos, Jamison joined one of his musical heroes John Vanderslice at Tiny Telephone, his all-analog studio in San Francisco and for one of the first time he decided to work with a collaborator and to lose a bit a control on his own tracks.
The result is “Morning World”, an 11-track album full of vulnerability and truth. In order to promote this new album, the Vancouver-based artist will be touring through Europe in 2016 and will be playing in Brussels on January 22, at Le Botanique.
If you are excited like a child and if you are, like us, not able to wait until Christmas to open your gifts, then you can directly buy your tickets here!

22. Advertising – This is definitely the most old-school way of earning money with a blog. It’s also starting to become the least common way. You can sell advertising spots directly on your site or you can sign up with a company like Google AdSense or Media.net. Either way, you won’t see a whole lot of money from ads until your views are well into the thousands each day.
This website contains recommendations for products and services. This means, if you click on the link and purchase the item, I will receive a commission. The majority of reviews does not contain affiliate links but some do. I also receive compensation for the banner ads on this website. I DO NOT receive any compensation for reviewing a product or service! I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will add value to my readers.
Jason – so happy to hear the tutorial is helping! Affiliate marketing was a huge break for me and I’m sure it can be for your son too. Whatever products/services he ends up selling, just make sure he is excited about the industry he is – it takes a long of time creating content and it will keep him motivated especially when he gets his first sales.
Having several affiliates is not a guarantee of making money online. Studies show that a successful affiliate marketing campaign requires you to gte the right collaborations that would drive traffic to your site. Whether these associates are big or small sites or even a combination of both, you must create and maintain strong relationships with the affiliates.
If you try to sell a product that is in low demand then chances are that you are not going to get many sales no matter how hard you try. So it is a good idea to spend a bit of time researching and finding out if a product that you are thinking of promoting is a product that your audience needs. If your site gets decent traffic then you can conduct an online survey and easily get input from your visitors.
If you have an eye for design and some experience of creating websites, then you could offer your services as a freelance web designer. You will need to create your own stylish website, and have a few other projects that you can show potential clients to demonstrate your skills. You will also need to initially spend time emailing businesses to promote your services and find work.
Save money on food. I recently joined $5 Meal Plan in order to help me eat at home more and cut my food spending. It’s only $5 a month and you get meal plans sent straight to you along with the exact shopping list you need in order to create the meals. Each meal costs around $2 per person or less. This allows you to save time because you won’t have to meal plan anymore, and it will save you money as well!
In August of 2011, I started my personal finance blog with the hopes of teaching people how to save money after reading a magazine that featured a personal finance website in one of their articles. Due to that website, I became extremely interested in personal finance blogs, and my interest in blogging just grew from there. Before August of 2011, I didn’t even know that blogs existed. I didn’t know what they were, I didn’t know that they could make money, or anything like that.
Your life situation might dictate that $200/day is the pinnacle of financial motivation. You can drive yourself to attain this goal, but any further and the motivation begins to slip. That’s a point of diminishing returns. Call it your comfort zone. Any work to advance beyond this point comes with the additional burden of pushing you out of that comfort zone. And so procrastination sets in, along with the dual crippling fears of failure and success.
You can sell your ebooks through Amazon's Kindle program or Apple's iTunes Connect, which gives you access to a large majority of the digital-book reading market and the barriers for entry are incredibly low. You don't need to invest lots of money to make this happen, but you do need to invest lots of time, not only in writing the ebooks, but in marketing them as well.
Create custom alerts on your phone for affiliate sales – if you use GMail, go to your settings and create a filter so all emails with “SiteGround Affiliate Sale Generated” in the subject line go into their own folder (tweak the subject line to match whatever email notification your affiliate sends you). Then setup a custom alert on your phone using the GMail app so anytime you generate a sale, you get a custom alert (here’s a tutorial for Android and here’s one for Apple). I have different notifications for SiteGround, StudioPress Themes, etc. Makes your day better :)
Invite readers back to your blog. Roughly 4% of my readers click through to my blogs. On average, I make $1–2 per visitor. Not only are these visits an opportunity to introduce readers to value-adding services, but you can also get their e-mails, re-target with ads later, build credibility, have your content shared, etc. Here’s a walkthrough video for building your blog.

Our head Chef Adam was recently featured in a great article by Phoenix Bites. They dive into his busy schedule as well as what he likes to do with his free time (when he actually has some). Read more here.
In 1692, 20 women were burned at the stake in Salem Massachusetts having been found guilty of witchcraft for, among other things, causing the crops to fail. On Wednesday night at the Democratic convention, Sigourney Weaver went a long way toward recapturing her Hollywood fame of yesteryear by narrating a scary movie depicting a dangerous warming world for our children to inherit unless we act to intervene. I felt like I was back in Salem 300 years ago listening to the insanity presented against those women, in those trying times.
She pulled out numerous weather related disasters to fire up the DNC attendees against Trump and the Republican National Committee. During the previous week, Trump and the RNC had laid plans to defeat the great global warming delusion with actual science. Their goal is to stop undermining the economy with fruitless efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions by eliminating the use of natural gas, oil and coal. Transferring protection of our environment from the federal government to the states, which already do the lion’s share of the work, is the backbone of their platform.
Weaver attempted to blame droughts, floods, heat and particularly wild fires on man caused global warming, without a shred of scientific evidence, because none exists. Fires have been occurring regularly in the West long before man began pumping excessive amounts of carbon dioxide into the air — a result of the second industrial revolution that began with World War II. Of course, in those days, their were fewer homes built on the edge of fire-prone areas in a position to be destroyed.
She quoted a number of global warming alarmists, from Pope Francis to George H.W. Bush — two men not known for their scientific acumen. True to the best of alarmist scenarios, she showed cars carried away in floods and homes in flames. Then she talked to distraught home owners who are only too glad to blame the loss of their homes on man-caused global warming
Most of us have become aware through late-night comedy shows that politicians enjoy blaming anything and everything on global warming that will advance their causes and careers. That did not stop Weaver from doing the same. She is certainly a fine actress, and can now add unsubstantiated fearmonger to her resume.

It’s a sure bet that among the throngs of fans watching North Dakota State play South Dakota State in basketball this weekend, at least one Bison fan was thinking: “This rivalry is nothing like the one with the Sioux.”

I loved David’s talk on Sunday. Genesis 1:1-2. “In the beginning God…” That’s it. He’s the only Necessary thing. Every good thing falls in place AFTER him. Colossians 1:17 says, “He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.” He doesn’t find his purpose and fulfillment in me... I find my purpose and fulfillment in Him. We don’t ask Him into our lives, we ask to be a part of His. What a relief! It certainly takes the pressure off to try and be perfect. Which is stupid anyway, cause we’re never going to be.
I think that’s important to our (?) generation these days. Sometimes I wonder, ‘where did the humility go?’ We get so wrapped up in asking him for more and more, which is great and all, because he always has more for us, but we forget that he has ALREADY given us the greatest gift. His only Son. So next time I catch myself asking for more, or whining because things aren’t going my own stupid way, I just remember to be thankful for the greatest love story ever…
“I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.”
What a fantabulous week I spent with 25,000 (!!!) 18-25 year olds in Atlanta at the Passion Conference. I don't even know where to BEGIN! Maybe with the first day?
Ok, so Monday, registration and the first "main session" at Phillips Arena. They couldn't even fit us all in so they also streamed the talk to the Georgia World Congress Center where the remaining 6,000 were. Each venue had their own live worship leader. Among them... Chris Tomlin, David Crowder, Steve Fee, Charlie Hall, Kristian Stanfill, Matt Redman, Tim Hughes. Not a bad line-up, huh?
Well the first night Louie Giglio spoke. Great message. To sum up - A price was paid (Isa 53:10) and a rescue was made (Col. 1:10-14). Then we went to our "Community groups". Each community group was made of about 1,000 kids so there were quite a few groups... bout 20. Each with their OWN speaker and worship leader. I was in the "orange community group" and our speaker was John McGowan (thegatheringonline.blogspot.com) and our worship leader was Matt Maher (www.mattmahermusic.com). They were really great. We then split up into groups of eight and that was our "family group" for the week. All made up of people from all around the US. Well, the world, really. We would come together a few times a day and discuss what God was specifically working at in us. Then, at about 11:15 there was "late nite" and you could pick from about 12 different concerts around the Congress Center and Phillips. I, of course, made a B-line to Dave Barnes and Matt Wertz. LOVE LOVE them...
Ok, day two. Beth Moore did the morning main session. She spoke on humility. KICKED MY BUTT. This was my focus the rest of the week. A whole separate blog in itself. Then in the afternoon after lunch we could choose from about 15 "breakout groups" we could attend. I went to one with Charlie Hall (whom I ADORE) and Tim Hughes (who has written more songs than I prob even know... he's 29). They talked about their ministries and how they came to be worship leaders and song writers. It was really a session for people that want to become those things, but I went anyways. :) It was awesome.
Ok, then at the night session this guy named Francis Chan spoke. He was unbelievable. I was so busy listening to his message that I didn't take a one note. All I did was title my page, "Tuesday Night - main session (some guy I've never heard of)". I will have to buy a copy of that and re-listen cause it was awesome. He's a pastor in California. Anyway, then I came home and played guitar hero with Marie and Ashley and Emily. What a day!
Day Three, Wednesday. I woke up and didn't feel good and couldn't make myself get out of bed. But I eventually did and made it for the last half of John Piper's message. He has some great things to say. So wise and straight-forward. I already purchased his message so I could go back and listen to the part I missed. The breakout group I went to Wednesday was Beth Moore's. It was a 'girls only' thing. Teaching women is her passion. And she's so good at it! I absolutely love her. Her two daughters were there and they participated with her during question and answer time. She spoke about insecurity since that's the problem that pretty much all girls struggle with. Though, her talks could apply to anyone. She has such a great perspective on things. So refreshing. Really good.
That night Louie spoke again. He talked about God's calling on our life. The whole week was kind of centered around the book of Colossians. I don't know if that was planned or not, I'm sure it was, but each speaker kind of reiterated what the prior speaker said and added so much to it. Several thousand people were called to some kind of long-term missions work.
Well, after community groups that night we were asked to leave in silence and head outside. They gave us all a little white candle. When we got outside there was this huge stage set up on the lawn. All 25,000 of us outside in the streets of Atlanta with a lit candle worshiping. An amazing sight and time of corporate worship. In fact, all week was. There is nothing like worshipping with thousands and thousands of people. It's overwhelming. What a blessing to be a part of it. Charlie Hall said corporate worship is like adding a big fat exclamation point to then end of your own personal shout of truth and worship. Worship is realizing what God has done for you, even though he is still so mysterious, but you sense redemption and help and closeness to Him. We can rejoice in the fact that he is closer than our troubles. Hallelujah!
I am anxiously awaiting my 'audio cd set' that I pre-ordered today that has all the sermons on it so I can go through them more slowly and digest all that was taught. My head is spinning right now. I feel like I didn't do the week justice in my lamo blog, but it was awesome for me. God knows that and that's all that matters.
Well, for me at least... and only until January 3rd. This Accounting thing is kickin' my butt! But I'm honestly enjoying school (?) and that's the first time in my life I've ever said that... ask moma! Hopefully by June I will have all my credit hours done for my Associates Degree in Accounting and I can start an internship somewhere in the summer or maybe the fall? That's the plan...
My brain is so full of stuff right now that I'm looking forward to the holidays to sort it though and file away the things that need to be remembered and send the rest to the recycle bin.
When people asked me a few months ago, how are you and Brett? I would say, "Oh we're great... still like eachother and having fun". While that is still true, I would add to it, "It's HARD!" You find out so much about yourself and how you argue and how you handle situations with grace and be careful about what you say because you realize your words have so much weight to another person... even more than your best friend. Maybe not more than your mom, but close. Suddenly I realize the power of words and their ability to lift up or tear down. Yikes... I'm a name caller, that's for sure. Something to work on in the new year. But not til then?
I'm watching the Little kids right now... they're pretty darn cute. Especially around bedtime if you can imagine that.
That's when the slap-happy kicks in and the re-donkulous silliness comes out... the best kind of laughter.
I'm a name caller too!!! I never knew i was until I met John Mark, bless his heart! Woo Hoo! I'll see you soon! Happy vacationing, I mean literally, its so hot, its like you're in Florida.
Great update. Hang in there. It gets easier. Wait, no it doesn't. It is rewarding though -- to persevere, to grow.
Phil Marshall, popularly known to club members as "Phil the Flute", sadly, passed away at the age of 79 on August 17th 2010.
After a courageous fight against prostate cancer in 2007 and given the "all clear" the illness recently returned in a more aggressive form and spread to his gastrointestinal tract. Despite this Phil remained resolute and optimistic of recovery until the end came at the Royal Gwent hospital just two weeks after his 79th birthday.
Philip William Malcolm Marshall was born on August 4th 1931. He was brought up in his early years by foster parents and worked much of his adult life as a motor mechanic. He joined the diving club in 1975 after which diving came to play a large part in his life.
During his 35 years within the club, Phil was a very active member and held several positions on the club committee and dived all over the world in locations as far away as the Great Barrier Reef off Australia and Cocos Island off Costa Rica. Other far flung locations that Phil visited included; Malta, the Red Sea, the Florida Keys, the Maldives and the Andaman Sea off Thailand and Burma.
Phil was also active in UK waters. He was regularly seen in diving in Pembrokeshire with the club throughout his long membership. He also organised several diving trips to other parts of the UK, notably to Plymouth, a favourite of Phil's due to its maritime history and the wrecks that are to be found there. He also dived off the west coast of Ireland, The Scottish Isles including Mull and Skye and he also visited the world famous Scapa Flow in Orkney. He was also involved in the "Mary Rose" project which resulted in the recovery of that famous historic shipwreck.
Phil's knowledge of maritime history and shipwrecks especially military vessels was encyclopaedic. Diving on wrecks was his first love and he always expressed a desire to visit the wartime wrecks of Truk Lagoon in the Pacific.
Phil was also known for his dry sense of humour coming out with comments like; "if it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any f****ing luck". In 2007 after diving on Richelieu Rock off the coast of Thailand where Phil had just encounted an enormous Whale Shark he was heard to say "I can die happy now because I've seen a whale shark and I've always wanted to see one".
Phil's popularity was without question and his presence within the club will be sadly missed by us all.
The funeral was held at the Cwmbran Crematorium on Thursday 2nd September at 4.00pm. Club members were invited for refreshments after the funeral at the Greenmeadow Golf and Country Club in Cwmbran.
Dad did not have an auspicious start in life. Soon after he was born his mother decided not to keep him and instead gave him away.
He grew up with foster parents and regarded them as his mother and father. Dad was not the only child they fostered and here he found the family he had been denied.
He developed some strong convictions from an early age, perhaps because of his circumstances, the most notable being a rejection of religion in all its forms. He was sent to Sunday school just like all the other children, but the teachers found the arguments that he put forward hard to deal with in someone so young. He remained an Atheist all his life.
World War II broke out when he was 8 and continued throughout his formative years. Like most boys of his age, he became interested in the machinery of war and built models of the ships, planes and tanks of the period.
At a personal level, things changed when, at 13 he discovered his foster mother dead in the outside toilet. His foster family had lost its heart and slowly began to disperse. Although he eventually went his own way, as did the others, he never lost contact with them and they always remained part of his life.
He was called up to do his National Service during the time of the Korean War, but fortunately was never called on to fight. Instead, he went from camp to camp working on the artillery there. Perhaps the seeds of his later deafness were sown at this time.
In 1952 he married our mother and for the first 5 years of their marriage they lived with his in-laws. Dad never got on with his mother-in-law; or rather she never got on with him. She had not wanted him to marry her daughter, and was always on to him about something. One day, he had had enough. He picked her up and dumped her head first into the coal bunker. She lay there with her feet waving in the air screaming for her husband to rescue her. Once he and Dad had stopped laughing, they dragged her out. What happened next is not a matter of record.
In the early sixties, word came to him that his real mother had died. Armed with her address, he determined to find out more. We all travelled to Marshfield, where having found the house, he knocked on the door. Once he had convinced the occupants who he was, he found that he was the youngest of four children, with two brothers and a sister. The woman who had answered the door was his sister-in-law. He was finally reunited with his blood family.
By now he was working as a Crane Driver at the Port Talbot Steelworks, another noisy environment that must have also contributed to his deafness.
Dad had always enjoyed driving (perhaps the earliest of his passions) and was able to combine this with his interest in machinery when he left the Steelworks and started his own car repair business; first in partnership with others and then on his own.
Dad took up scuba diving, something that would become a major feature in his life. He joined a local sub-aqua club in 1975 and took every opportunity to go diving, both in this country and abroad.
He was part of the diving groups that helped salvage the Mary Rose in 1982. He became heavily involved in the diving club's activities and was its secretary for a number of years during the 1980's.
By now his deafness was becoming evident. The television had to be on louder when he was watching, than it was for the rest of us. This was, of course, something he always strongly denied.
Dad was divorced in 1989. This started another itinerant phase in his life, and one where he was out of contact with the rest of his immediate family for many years.
He continued with his car repair business, now working solely on his own. His diving also continued, with more trips all around the world.
On the advice of his dying brother, he underwent tests for Prostate Cancer and these proved positive. He was to fight this illness for the last 11 years of his life.
As retirement came and went, he was able to spend more time on another of his pursuits - dancing. His life now became an exhausting round of the three D's - driving, diving and dancing. Although these were certainly not his only activities, as holidays and card-playing also seem to have figured strongly in his punishing social schedule.
It was through dancing that he met Jean. She became his partner and, for his remaining years, became the focus of his life and love.
In early June 2010, he was diagnosed with Stomach Cancer. This was in addition to his existing condition and proved to be a far more aggressive opponent.

The Freshman LP from Chicago band Vintage Blue finds the band seemlessly blending rock, folk and more contemporary synth sounds into a timeless album that is sure to satisfy even the most fickle musical tastes.
A tune that pays tribute to the original masters of rock n' roll like Elvis and Haley. This song incorporates horns, a swinging rhythmic guitar and a catchy chorus that is sure to get you dancing!
This song came about when we looked at ways to finish the record. We had this song sitting on the table, but couldn't really find a place to fit it. We liked using it at shows because of it's Saturday Night Live kind of ending and strong energy, so we decided to include it on the record.
Beginning as a guitar only song, it grew to include several string layers to add to the mystical and touching message.
Great Divide is about undying love for those people that come into your life and effect you so deeply even though they might not know.
A Vintage Blue take on a classic Rock Ballad with themes ranging from pressure to decide whether love can exist from two truly different people and views.
This song was originally written as a quicker, faster-paced, up-beat tune until our producer suggested this record needed a "rock ballad." We slowed the tempo down, changed the lyrics slightly towards a more pressing, imminent decision on whether lover can happen or not between two different people.
This tune uses the refrain of you Help Me See to explain that in love, the singer finds significance in all things in his life.
This song was originally written in 1997 and played on a creek-side picnic blanket for a first girlfriend. The song is a simple recording about what was, at the time, a simple concept: love. So much for that theory. ha!
This song takes the listener on a mournful journey with guitar and saxophone that are intended to sound melancholy over the loss of love that the song envisions.
This song was written while in Costa Rica after meeting a beautiful woman and having few moments to share before you both are forced to return to "real life." Those fleeting moments of love.
An open and airy tune with most acoustic guitar intended to be uplifting and inspiring, while also acknowledging the struggle within.
This song was written when I was feeling overwhelmed with everything in life. Love, money and work were all in disarray and it was hard to find solace in anything, even friends and family. The message is that if you relax and breathe, perhaps you can find comfort within.
A dropped D guitar heavy tune about the impending start of problems in life with a guitar solo that is big and booming and meant to imitate the hitting of the storm and the last verse sums up the issue with "it won't be okay, just leave me here alone."
This song was written during a huge storm in Chicago while I was in a huge storm in a relationship. In a twist of fate, I of course wrote about both of them. I saw the two as entirely synonymous and as you can see storm clouds gather, so could I see the trouble brewing in my own relationship.
This song intends to convey a light airy feeling but with a serious message, much like the subject matter.
This song was actually written about our bassist and a previous relationship that he was in. All of us could see that girl he was dating was basically using him and stringing him along. This song is about his inability to see what was happening and about how the girl could not just make a decision to end it.
This song was written about a prior relationship where everyone had warned me about the person I got involved with. I kept seeing the good in her, but finally little things began to happen and it was revealed to me just how bad it was.
A funk driven guitar riff, with some saw synth on top to create a classic rock / ska type of vibe with a contemporary synth / indie sound in one unit.
This song was written about an engaged girl that I fell in love with at work. There was so much passion between us, but since she was engaged it was as if it was just "too late." Turns out she is married with a kid now. Oh well.
A catchy tune that builds on an acoustic guitar eventually to a layered mixed vocal and saxophone piece.
This song is about an old dusty road in downstate Illinois and the comparison between all that you find on that road and all that you come across in living life. Love, crashes, death, mistakes, etc.
Using a quick and catchy guitar riff, the scream at the intro lets you know there is some pain in this tune. Modern blues rock at its finest in talking about freeing oneself from love.
This was the first song I had written in some 10 years. I wrote it in about 15 minutes when the subject matter was fresh, which was unfortunate for me. I was in the midst of trying to figure out how to get out of a relationship I was in. I felt trapped or "chained," so the song naturally was called "Unchained."
A modified blues riff with guitar and horns with a story-telling vocal. A pop tune at its core, this song also wants to tell more with the group vocal / sing along.
This song was written about a past relationship where the other person was willing to do everything to make it last. They were nurturing, giving and would bend over backwards for me. Unfortunately you cannot convince yourself to love someone. Sometimes the best thing you can do is let them go. It is best that they learn to hold true to themselves and not try to give everything away to another person, you never know if they are giving everything back.

As the most complete Native American Gift Shop in Wyoming, Tukadeka Traders aims to bring the history and culture of these tribes to life through the artifacts and gifts that we sell. From the intricate quilts of the Sioux to the beaded jewelry of the Shoshone, Arapahoe and Cheyenne, we connect the past with the present in each item that we sell.
Unlike other gift shops or trading posts, Tukadeka Traders does not limit our selection of beautiful Native American gifts in Wyoming to one tribe or culture—instead, we bring together items from every native nation to showcase a bevy of tremendously unique items. And, because we encompass every indigenous tribe’s beliefs, concepts, tokens and artifacts, we’re able to showcase alluring items that are unique for a tremendous number of reasons. Take a look at just some of the exceptional offerings that are defined by the Indian Nations that create and exemplify them:

Make-A-Wish Foundation of Michigan is a Michigan nonprofit corporation exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Governor Snyder is in the vanguard of elected officials and business leaders who are pushing for more Michigan students to pursue occupational certificates and associate degrees with an occupational major rather than a four-year degree, particularly in non STEM fields. Supposedly we have too many of the latter and too few of the former to meet the needs of employers.
Lets leave aside for the moment the belief, by too many of our political and business leaders, that higher education is designed to meet the needs of today’s employers. At least for other people’s children. Rather in this post I want to focus on whether having lots of adults with certificates and fewer with four year degrees is a path to prosperity.
A soon to be released report pushing for higher post-secondary completion in Michigan provides the data. The report adopts the Lumina Foundation goal of sixty percent of adults with a “meaningful” post secondary credential. The proportion Lumina and many others believe is needed to fill the jobs of the future. The sixty percent, of course, includes those with associate degrees as well a bachelors degrees or more. The meaningful becomes relevant in calculating which occupational certificates to include.
The report lists the top ten states in 25-64 year olds with post-secondary educational credentials. At the top of the list is Georgia. Fourth is Massachusetts. Georgia has sixty percent of its adults with a post secondary credential, Massachusetts more than fifty eight percent. But there the similarity ends. Of the top ten states Georgia has by far the most with credentials (23.0 percent) and the second fewest with four year degrees of more (29.6%). Massachusetts the most with four year degrees or more (42.4 percent) and the third fewest with credentials (8.0 percent).
So if conventional wisdom is right Georgia should have a high proportion of its residents working and in high wage jobs. Massachusetts not so much. Conventional wisdom would have it that Massachusetts has too few adults with the skills employers are looking for in high wage mid skill/skilled trades jobs and too many with four year degrees that employers don’t want consigning degree holders to low wage/low skill jobs largely hospitality and retail jobs. Think again!
The July unemployment rate in Georgia is 6.0 percent, in Massachusetts its 4.7 percent. The proportion of those 16 and older in 2014 working in Georgia was 57.6 percent, in Massachusetts it was 61.6 percent. Even greater is the difference between the two states in wages and income. Massachusetts in 2013 was second in per capita income ($57,200), Georgia 40th ($37,800). In terms of net employment earnings (employer paid wages and benefits) per capita Massachusetts ranked second, Georgia 34th. Average wages in 2014 in Georgia were $44,700, in Massachusetts $57,600. Median wages: Massachusetts $44,700, Georgia $32,800.
So across the board in terms of employment, wages and income residents of Massachusetts are far better off than residents of Georgia. One of the major reasons is that Massachusetts residents are far better educated than Georgians. At both the state and metropolitan area level the most prosperous places––except those benefiting from high commodity prices––are those with the highest proportion of adults with a four year degree or more.
Clearly Michiganders would be better off having an economy like Massachusetts rather than Georgia. But we can’t get there unless we have more, not fewer, adults with four year degrees. Do we need more adults with mid skill/skilled trades occupational credentials? Of course. But not instead of more adults with four year degrees. We need even more of them. Michigan in 2013 was 33rd in the proportion of adults with a four year degree which is a major factor in our being 37th in per capita income. Unless the state improves on its ranking of 33rd Michigan is almost certain to remain one of the nation’s poorest states.

Often an strategy was spurred by an image or maybe a memory. A woman came in the Alinea kitchen to thank him for your food she had just eaten. She wore dangling silver earrings with purple beads. That night time, Achatz decided that he want to provide edible string with something crimson in it. “Cranberries might have been too apparent,” he claims. He went into his kitchen area with his chef de cuisine
” She despatched him to some periodontist. Achatz remembers the go to: “At this stage, I am able to hardly discuss. I’m losing fat, ’result in I can’t genuinely chew. Simply because when I rub my tongue on my enamel it hurts. I open my mouth and he or she looks at me and goes ‘
At the outset, He'll flavor nothing at all, just inhale the odor in the violet. Subsequent arrives the sweetness in the chocolate, then the brininess on the olive, after which a return to sweetness: the strawberries.
One day in early Oct, he picked up information look at a Diet plan Coke and thought it tasted amusing. He spat it out. Seeking down with the can, he was relieved to determine that he were holding a Food plan Dr. Pepper. “It absolutely was the clue to the approaching doom,” he claims. Shortly afterward, Achatz was feeding on the afternoon meal which the cooks make to the team, when he discovered that he couldn’t taste the sweetness from the basil from the tomato sauce, and that the sauce not tasted acidic.
This put on can demonstrate up in collars, hems, and any area that is definitely iron creased all through laundering. Linen has very poor elasticity and would not spring again quickly, explaining why it wrinkles so effortlessly.
In July, 2007, Achatz went for the University of Chicago, from the hope of joining a medical demo that handled advanced head-and-neck most cancers people with chemotherapy and radiation. The protocol had been instructed by a surgeon at Northwestern, who realized that Achatz would never ever settle for medical procedures.
That thirty day period, Achatz commenced Arranging a group of backers to invest in his personal restaurant.

He located a associate, Nick Kokonas, a previous derivatives trader who was a admirer on the foodstuff at Trio, plus they wrote up a company approach and began looking for dollars.

BLAST can be very time consuming to run and I needed to get people to use the HPC resources in the best possible way. So I did some experiments.
This is a brief description of a couple of experiments that I (mjv08) have tried out using blast in order to determine the best way in which to run it.
NOTE: It is worth mentioning that other jobs from other people were running at the same time, so there may be odd things happening that would average out if I ran more tests.
Okay, so you have a fasta file you wish to blast. The file I had was supplied by Russ (rom) and contained 18788 sequences in a fasta file. He wanted to run the default settings for blast using blast2go. These settings using blast+ on the command line are;
The first thing I have done is to take a single sequence (length=998) and used blastx against the ncbi nr database. This was run on a 32core AMD node and increased the number of threads that blast uses. The graph below shows the results of this, with the time taken and vmem used to complete the job.
This shows that increasing the number of threads adds around 2-3GB vmem per thread after the initial ~10GB vmem used for 1 thread. There is an oddity when using 2 and 3 threads where the vmem usage seems to decrease.
The time taken to complete the blast does not decrease once the maximum number of cores available on the node is reached, in this case it is 32 cores and the time taken is 20seconds.
As you can see, the time taken drops to around ~60 seconds after reaching 8 threads. The increase in threads does nothing to improve performance, only increasing the amount of memory required.
In this next graph I test the time taken to run various sequences of different sizes using the 32core AMD node with 32 threads.
This does show that the sequence size effects the time take to complete, however has very little impact on the amount of vmem required to complete the job.

Another important element of our business is to make sure that we can fully support the products we sell…
Please do not assume that because it’s new (or even secondhand) that it’s perfect and ready to go…….
Ask most customers what inspires them to buy a particular guitar and if they’re honest they’ll admit that the look plays a huge part in their decision.
Be it a guitar played by a particular guitar hero of theirs or simply the colour of the instrument that sparks their interest. In many cases the look is just as important as the sound and feel of the instrument.
In reality of course the sound and feel should be the much more important deciding factors. So far so what?
Well, if you pay your hard earned money for your dream guitar but discover it plays like a real dog due to a high action (the action refers to the distance of the strings from the frets) or suffers from a general lack of adjustment, is it still the right guitar for you?
The truth is that it could still be a perfectly good guitar but lacks the attention to detail that a final ‘set-up’ can offer.
For those of you not in the know, a ‘set-up’ consists of the sometimes minor, sometimes extensive tweaks and adjustments that influence the overall playability and feel of an instrument.
Since the advent of online retailing, the consumer has been given two options in how to make their purchase – ‘In Store’ or ‘Online’.
The temptation to buy a guitar unseen because of a discounted price tag is huge and for many the end result is disappointment.
At Martin Phelps Music, EVERY guitar we sell in store AND online comes complete with our own unique set-up and maintenance guarantee (featuring all the adjustments as mentioned above) in addition to any warranties offered by the manufacturer.
We offer this service completely FREE of charge for a minimum 12 month period when purchased online, and for in store purchases up to 2 years* (*2 year warranty applies to in-store ONLY purchases of guitar/string instrument purchases made above £100.00 in value). Without a warranty such as ours, you could expect to pay up to £100 to have a guitar set-up to your requirements after purchase. Instruments purchased through our online store are fully inspected either by us or our supplier partners prior to despatch and feature the same warranty as if purchased in store. Our In-Store Luthiers take care of all post-sale warranty setups, repairs and maintenance at our on site workshop and do not farm out this work to third parties. This ensures tighter quality control. We acknowledge that online purchasers may think they will not be able to take full advantage of this aspect of our warranty, but if the item is returned to us and collected at the purchasers own cost, (we can arrange this) we will be happy to attend to any set-up work and maintenance completely free of charge and with a fast turnaround. Of course, you are most welcome to bring in your instrument in person for this service to be carried out. If you are travelling a distance to see us for this work, it can be done (by prior arrangement) whilst you wait. Otherwise, warranty setup work can take a few days depending in our current workshop commitments.
Our unique warranty covers parts and labour in all cases where defects in manufacturers components have occurred through normal usage. Claims cannot be made using this warranty where accidental damage,modifications (customising) or mistreatment has resulted in a fault occurring.

Individuals of the scale-eating cichlid fish, Perissodus microlepis, from Lake Tanganyika tend to have remarkably asymmetric heads that are either left-bending or right-bending. The ‘left’ morph opens its mouth markedly towards the left and preferentially feeds on the scales from the right-hand side of its victim fish, and the ‘right’ morph bites scales from the victims’ left-hand side. This striking dimorphism made these fish a textbook example of their astonishing degree of ecological specialization and as one of the few known incidences of negative frequency-dependent selection acting on an asymmetric morphological trait, where left and right forms are equally frequent within a species. We investigated the degree and the shape of the frequency distribution of head asymmetry in P. microlepis to test whether the variation conforms to a discrete dimorphism, as generally assumed. In both adult and juvenile fish, mouth asymmetry appeared to be continuously and unimodally distributed with no clear evidence for a discrete dimorphism. Mixture analyses did not reveal evidence of a discrete or even strong dimorphism. These results raise doubts about previous claims, as reported in textbooks, that head variation in P. microlepis represents a discrete dimorphism of left- and right-bending forms. Based on extensive field sampling that excluded ambiguous (i.e. symmetric or weakly asymmetric) individual adults, we found that left and right morphs occur in equal abundance in five populations. Moreover, mate pairing for 51 wild-caught pairs was random with regard to head laterality, calling into question reports that this laterality is maintained through disassortative mating.
I've long been of the opinion that the distinctive feature of the great hard-boiled private eye story is the hero's vulnerability. He's physically vulnerable because both the crooks and the cops distrust him. As a result of which, he frequently ends up being beaten and battered. He's emotionally vulnerable because he's alone and prey to falling in love with clients or other women he meets in the course of the case, or at least caring too much about the people whose lives he finds himself involved in. As a result of which, he frequently ends up heart broken. Such are the Quixote-like characteristics that have defined the genre.
Unfortunately, in recent years there's been a tendency on the part of authors to give their detectives permanent girlfriends and overeager allies in law enforcement, which serves to allay both vulnerabilities. Call it the Robert Parker effect. This trend has been so pervasive that only a very few really good writers have been able to buck it : Loren Estleman, Jonathan Valin, and a few others. Meanwhile, the most interesting new detective fiction has featured investigators in authoritarian countries, where their vulnerability is greatly magnified : Martin Cruz Smith's Arkady Renko series and Philip Kerr's Bernie Gunther series spring to mind, the one set in the USSR, the other in Nazi Germany.
Which brings us to what I think is one of the best, and most unusual, private eye series of the modern era. Robert Irvine managed to create a fairly traditional private eye, an ex-football player, ex-soldier, with the unlikely name of Moroni Traveler, and only gussy him up with a few emotional ties : a father who may not be his biological dad, and a couple of street characters for friends. Then he borrowed a page from Smith and Kerr and set the stories in Salt Lake City, where Moroni's investigations often run afoul of the Mormon Church, which essentially controls the state. In addition to providing dramatic tension, this setting in the land of the Latter Day Saints offers Irvine, himself of Mormon descent, an opportunity to work Mormon history and beliefs into the narrative.
The resulting books are really fascinating, though I find them a tad too anti-Mormon, and Moroni and his cronies are immensely likable. They aren't all still in print and, though I couldn't find much information online, I believe I recall reading that Irvine died a few years ago, but if you can find the books, they are terrific.

The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear two pieces of legislation on same-sex marriage today, including the referendum resolution.
A joint resolution that could legalize same-sex marriage but allow religious organizations and small business owners to refuse marriage services to same-sex couples is scheduled for a hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee today.
Sen. Frank Ciccone, D-Providence, proposed the resolution Wednesday to place the measure on the 2014 ballot.
If the General Assembly passes the resolution and voters pass the amendment, the state’s constitution will be altered to “recognize and define marriage in the state of Rhode Island as a legally recognized union of two people,” according to the resolution.
The issue of same-sex marriage should be settled by the public, Ciccone said. “One hundred and thirty legislators should not rule on the matter.”
Though he is personally opposed to same-sex marriage legalization, he said, “If the voters are in favor of it, then that’s fine.”
The resolution includes measures that would allow religious leaders, religious organizations and small businesses to refuse marriage-related services to same-sex couples. Under this amendment, religious leaders who oppose same-sex marriage would not be required to solemnize such marriages, and small business owners in the wedding industry, such as florists and bakers, would be protected from lawsuits if they refuse to serve same-sex couples “based on (their) stringent religious beliefs,” Ciccone said.
Gov. Lincoln Chafee ’75 P’14 previously announced he would veto any legislation attempting to put same-sex marriage on the ballot for a public vote.
But a resolution prompting a referendum for a constitutional amendment “is not an act that can be vetoed” under the Rhode Island constitution, Ciccone said. “Unless (Chafee) plans to rewrite the R.I. constitution, I have no knowledge on how he plans to (veto the resolution).”
The resolution has drawn criticism from supporters of same-sex marriage legislation who say the public should not be voting on the civil rights of other citizens and the resolution’s religious protections leave room for discrimination.
Ciccone’s resolution is not “an appropriate compromise. We don’t see it as being a viable solution,” said Ray Sullivan, campaign director of Marriage Equality Rhode Island. He added that he does not think the resolution will garner enough support to pass in the House of Representatives, especially since openly gay Speaker of the House Gordon Fox opposes the legislation.
The text of the resolution also “includes some harmful exemption language that allows small businesses and individuals to proactively discriminate against gay and lesbian individuals and couples,” Sullivan said.
Many of the state’s religious leaders oppose Ciccone’s referendum resolution, including the Board of Rabbis of Greater Rhode Island, the Rhode Island State Council of Churches and Nicholas Knisely, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island, he said.
Same-sex marriage opponent Bishop Thomas Tobin of the Catholic Diocese of Providence lauded the resolution for advancing “the discussion in a positive and democratic way, while at the same time safeguarding the rights of all parties,” according to a statement.
Though the Rhode Island Roman Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage, Ciccone’s resolution “presents an eminently reasonable approach to this divisive issue,” Tobin said in the statement. “The citizens of Rhode Island have a right to vote on this crucial issue,” he added.
When the Senate Judiciary Committee convenes today, legislators will also hear a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state, introduced by Sen. Nesselbush ’84, D-Pawtucket. The House version of the bill passed in January.
Why would a state spend money on a referendum on gay marriage when the Supreme Court is about to hear a case that could make obsolete or nullify that referendum. It makes no sense. Sounds more like Sen. Ciccone is trying to win points with same-sex marriage opponents, and little more.
This would actually be worse than waiting for the SCOTUS to affirm same sex marriage rights. If passed, this bill would allow discrimination by businesses based on sexual orientation. Can you imagine a business being allowed to discriminate against any other minority other than us? If the SCOTUS affirms the rights of LGBT people to marry, and this measure is on the ballot in 2014, LGBT groups need to work to defeat it.

McDonald’s’ latest creation has nothing to do with burgers or nuggets. They held an entire tech-conference type event to introduce the world to… a straw.
The Suction Tube for Reverse Axial Withdrawal is the new kid in Ronald McDonald’s neighbourhood – intended to be presented with the company’s seasonal Chocolate Shamrock Shakes.
It was created by a team of robotic and aerospace engineers from companies like JACE and NK Labs who mainly focus on products ranging from mobile phones to medical devices. [via Creativity]
“It was a puzzling assignment but one with an ambitious goal,” said Seth Newburg, principal engineer and managing partner at NK Labs in a statement on the McDonald’s website.
These engineers worked in conjunction with the McDonald’s innovation team to come up with the sleek, charcoal-coloured suction device. It’s meant to provide ‘optimal flavour flow dynamics,’ or as the fast food juggernaut explains, “the ideal flavour ratio of 50% chocolate and 50% mint in each sip.”
Right now there are only 2000 made, and they will soon be distributed throughout the United States. We think they’ve misjudged their demographic. Ireland is next door to England! When will we get to suck on it?
If you are lucky enough to be in the US when the straw makes its debut, then check out the website for where you can snag one in its fancy little box.

Natural Resources Wales is asking people to continue to take care as more heavy rain is expected to affect the country throughout this week.
A band of rain will move across the country from the south west on Monday evening followed by further heavy showers on Tuesday and into Wednesday.
The rain could cause some localised flooding from streams and small watercourses and surface water will make driving conditions difficult.
Meanwhile along the coast from Anglesey to south west Wales, strong winds and large waves could lead to further localised flooding on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning.
Natural Resources Wales officers continue to monitor and repair defences along the coast following last weekend’s storm.
At Fairbourne in Gwynedd emergency repair work is underway after the sea wall was damaged. Contractors are today (3 February, 2014) building an access road to reach the site so that up to 500 tonnes of quarried rock can be carried in to shore up the defences.
The temporary flood defences at Llanbedr proved a success by reducing the level of flooding to farmland and four properties which were affected by last month’s storm.
At Crindau near Newport, water pumps were deployed which prevented Alderney Street from flooding and at Newgale officers have been clearing a tidal flap valve which became covered by shingle.
Flood alerts and flood warnings are updated on the Natural Resources Wales website every 15 minutes and are available to view on this page.

“I thought you would like to know that Mia was given permission to start an accelerated ballet program at the new dance school we have chosen here after we moved away. She went in yesterday to meet with the owner and dance for her. She remembered all the positions she learned last year and impressed the owner. I had not even planned on putting her in the accelerated program, but the owner thought she was more than ready. 🙂 She clearly learned a lot last year at Kick It Out!”
Evie LOVES her dance studio and her teacher Miss Molly. She looks forward to seeing her friends in class every week and would really like it if she had MORE friends to dance with in her ballet and tap classes. Come check it out…
Your dance studio is always very informative of current and upcoming events. It is wonderful to see how much a dance studio owner cares about each and every student and how involved you are with the classes themselves. With the way that your studio operates I just know it will continue to grow and prosper!!
Our 3-year old daughter Ezra tends to be very shy in group settings. She has been that way ever since we adopted her from Ethiopia at 8 months. I took her to a two-day tiny tumblers dance class at Kick It Out and by the second day she really started to come around. She’s dancing and tumbling all around the house now. Thanks so much Kick It Out for helping our daughter start to come out of her shell.
I’ve been going there for three years for Zumba, Zumba Toning and also Pound fitness classes. My daughter has taken ballet classes there and loved it! She had her first recital in 2014. Such a great and comfortable place to work out and take my daughter to dance. Highly recommend it!
KIO welcomed my son and has challenged him in ways I have not seen. The instructors work well with him and the other dancers accept him. I would gladly recommend KIO to anyone and am proud to be a part of this studio.
“Excellent place to dance or to have your kids dance!!!!!!” My daughter has learned so much in the 3 years she has been dancing. I’m so grateful to the owner and instructors. She’s made a lot of friends and has learned great dance and team work skills.

I'm loving blue nail polish once again. Blue is my weakness for the last couple of weeks when it comes to nails and it seems like it's only growing. You all know I love me a bit of NAILS INC and I was super excited when the new formula launched here in the Czech Republic. I own a few of them and today we'll take a look at Baker Street.
This is what I would call an electric blue and I'm loving it. The formula of these Gel Effect polishes is super creamy and opaque in one coat yet I usually go with two. The finish is nice and glossy and really seems like a gel polish. But let's talk about the longevity. Now I'm that kind of person who's nail polish lasts for maybe a day. Max. Everything chips on me and I really mean that. This one is not an exception but it's better than majority of regular nail polishes. I'm currently on a hunt for the perfect top coat so if you have any recommendations leave them in the comments below! But I can say that NAILS INC polishes stay on my nails way longer than anything else. And that's something for me. Plus this beaut blue color = winwin for me.
First and foremost, I want it to be clear that I, Floyd Mayweather, never agreed to an official bout with Tenshin Nasukawa.
The book is a compilation of winning essays and stories of Let’s Read Children’s Writing Competition conducted by Dar al Atta’a. Children aged between 9-18 years took part in the competition. Winners were chosen out of the 235 entries submitted by students from 34 schools.
Jane Jaffer, organiser of the competition, said, “The theme of this year’s competition involved researching and recording factual details about one of the student’s ancestors.”
She added, “The entries, written in either Arabic or English, were graded into three different age groups. The judges awarded points according to the following criteria: Detailed research and historical backdrop, character description and dramatisation of life story. Points were also given for the quality of writing, including vocabulary, grammar and presentation, and for providing photographs, and archival material.”
While some of the stories in the book narrate tales of war, poverty and separation, others have spoken about family issues and courage.
Every grandparent faced severe challenges and their hardships and patience are the subjects of the stories. All the stories are inspirational and remind the many heroic measures that the past generation took.

MASEV, the organizers of the annual Nokia Snowboard FIS World Cup taking place this December, are looking for a fresh, new design for the awards and trophies presented to the top three finishers in each event.
For the past seven years, athletes have been receiving beautiful soapstone carvings designed by former long-time Whistler resident, Chris Rose. This year, Masev would like to showcase a new local artist.
The trophy should represent snowboarding, Canada and Whistler and will be given as a keepsake to the winners from around the world.
Artists are asked to submit a single prototype of their award trophy design by Sunday, Aug. 31. The event team will then select the winner no later than Sept. 3.
The winner will then have almost three months and up to $100 per award to design the allocated number of trophies by Dec. 8, 2003. Masev extends this contest to all artists from the Sea to Sky corridor.

It seems like one can’t take a stroll these days without bumping into something that has Battle Royale written on it. Due to the immense popularity of the genre, we now see publisher giants like EA and Activision adapt BR to their flagship franchises like Battlefield and Call of Duty.
While a Battle Royale is the last thing fans would want from a series like Doom, doesn’t mean it wouldn’t be fun. Thanks to DSOG, we now know that modder ‘Bambamalicious’ has launched a small test server for Doom Royale with Cheese. This server is live for the next couple of days and players can join in on this upcoming battle royale mode.
Like all the other Battle Royales out there, players will scavenge for weapons and power-ups, and try to be the last man standing to win the Royale with Cheese. The server will be running 8 bots to keep the game going, although the modder warns that aren’t the most clever things. Bambamalicious will be offering a custom huge map that is based on Doom’s original levels from Episode One. The modder is still working on the map in order to further tweak it and squash any bugs.
If you feel like it’s worth playing, Bamablicious has set up a donation button to help him run the servers and fully develop the mod.

Could an individualistic pursuit like writing of a story be made a group activity?We have done it on http://in.groups.yahoo.com/group/indiansciencefiction/ with great fun and frolicking,the partcipant starrings being Air Vice Marshal [retd] Viswa Mohan Tiwari ji,a geochronologist Dr.C.M.Nautiyal,an English litterateur and reserach fellow Ms.Reema Sarwal,Mr.Zeashan Haider Zaidy and Mr.Manish Mohan Gore being young and talented science communiators and of course me as a moderator and participant .Initially I was hesitant to put the story on this blog simply beause these are long pieces of writings and we people on net do not have that leisure and liberty to enjoy such long creativities.Now the story is here for your reading/perusal and comments.
Kim was dazed. He tried to look hard- deep into the space. Nothing was visible. He turned his eyes to look at his control watch on his left hand. Everything looked normal, the BP, heart beat, temperature. . Then why was he feeling uneasy? May be it was not functioning properly. Rita was sitting in the chair in front with her eyes closed.
'Why don't you drop more hints, kindly?', Rita said somewhat sarcastically. There was no answer from Kim. This seemed to irritate Rita even more, 'I am addressing you, Kim. When you say something is amiss, why do you say so? We can not abort the whole mission just because of your god damn gut feeling. Do you know how much has been invested in this mission?'
Kim raised his face to look into her eyes straight, 'Rita, I told you. It's my gut feeling. I can' explain it. If I could explain it, I wouldn't have termed it so.'
'Stop being vague. It's a serious issue. You seem to be imagining too much. May be you should take a break. That will do you good.'
Hot discussions were nothing new between the two. But they made a perfect team, these frequent exchanges notwithstanding. The two were as much apart in temperament as one can imagine. But they complimented each other. Kim with his astonishing intuitive capability which he referred to his gut feeling and Rita with her extraordinary logical power, photographic memory, and capability of thinking on toes.
"You know the distance? You know they are advanced. You know they hate us and then deuterium is not the only way to fusion'.
Rita remained silent. They had been asked to approach a far- away planet. The mission had a noble sounding mission to make friends with the inhabitants of the planets. Somehow convince them to agree to share natural resources with them. The motive being extracting deuterium to fuel the fusion reactors. But now there was no need to use deuterium for fusion. Much heavier elements had been found which would suit better. There must be some other motive, the hidden agenda. Why travel all the way to Earth for this? (CMN)
Why do they treat us like those damn robots ? In any case robots are doing everything, then why have they chosen us for this mission? Obviously they estimate that risks are far greater than we would take. This chicanery is what is bothering me. I love taking risks, but I want to know is it worth it". Kim suddenly burst.
Suddenly, the Intergalactic phone rang, the screen became alive and both looked at it keenly, Rita was relieved for she didn't have to answer the awkward question. (VMT)
The monitor illuminated and the message, which followed, was very conspicuous and both were instantly glued to the screen. ''We can understand the apprehensions of Kim. It's true that aliens have sometimes behaved like barbarians but such behavior is not expected from earthlings. You have to change your negative attitude towards earth dwellers and behave like a sensible creature. Humans are no more like barbarians who once definitely exhibited strange and disgusting customs with ridiculous beliefs and yes their manners were also very appalling. But this is a description of forgone days. Now there is a breed of friendly people inhabiting the earth and rest assure this time our voyage awaits a grand reception on earth....''
Kim took a sigh of relief and glanced over to Rita who had some queer expression on her face. (Arvind Mishra)
Kim always thought whether there was any solution of the existing problems on the planet Earth. Rita also being like minded always echoed the feelings of Kim. They always conjectured that space on the Earth was limited but the human need was growing in leaps and bounds. Population growth, extinction of valuable plant species, ozone layer depletion, global warming etc.., were like great challenges before the planet Earth, birth place of all human civilizations in their galaxy.
Rita was serious on the issue and sincere enough to search out the solutions through the referendum among the scientists of the planet earth. (MANISH MOHAN GORE)
Rita looked worried, she had to, for she had a daughter back home though twenty years now, independent of her, but her own biological daughter, in these days of custom made test tube babies, her daughter, her flesh and blood.
Kim said, "We have nothing to worry now. Our mission is straight, to meet the friendly people on earth, get the material and return fast. OK Rita." (VMT)
Rita took a deep breath and decided to go over the official instructions once again as stored in her mind. They had been told that the earthlings had divided their living space into what they termed "nations" but were referred to as Slots for convenience. The mission was to go to Slot No. 91 at a place called "larkspur" in a high altitude area known as the " Himalayas " (she often wondered how the earthlings pronounced these difficult words). Contact had already been established with a group of friendly earthlings at this place whom they would meet. According to general policy, they were not to do anything as foolhardy as to step out of their vessel on an alien planet. Two earthlings had been selected to come aboard their vessel. Rita and Kim were to provide them with the suitable containers and machinery for collecting samples of the materials that they needed from Earth to study it in full detail. Instruction manuals to operate these had already been prepared in the earthling form of communication. And this is where the cause for worry came in. How far could these two Earthlings be trusted? Kim was right about having his reservations after all. (Reema)
As specially designed fully automated space shuttle hurtled towards earth the frightening possibility of some foul game by earthlings still stirred the minds of Rita and Kim. What if they don't behave in the manner they are supposed to do? In that case what and how they could do to protect themselves? As the mission control has categorically denied any such eventuality there is no foolproof defense system inbuilt in the spaceship or a defined strategy to cope up with any such event. Both were silent as such thoughts kept on piercing their minds.
Kim looked pale and glanced shyly at Rita and lowered his eyes. The spaceship was gathering speed as it moved away further from their home land in the galaxy Nalco. Kimb and Rita both stared at the planet beneath and were stupefied to behold the beauty of the planet earth. The lush green plains, snow White Mountains and turbulent seas all kept them mesmerized for the moment.
The time of landing was approaching fast. They positioned their ship towards the site of landing, the non nondescript larkspur area of the valleys of Himalaya . (ARVIND)
After the few tense moments during touchdown, Kim and Rita were too relieved to notice the alarming message on their screen for a minute. Then they both saw it together and stared at each other, motionless.
"ATTENTION: No earthlings detected at their designated centre. No earthlings around the shuttle within a diameter of 10 kilometers." Before they could react, the phone monitor lit up brightly and they listened carefully, "Do not panic. We know that this is unexpected. However, we have already established the cause -- the earthlings were prevented from arriving due to a landslide which blocked their land route. We are sure they will arrive shortly. Please be patient."
Kim and Rita had no choice but to resign themselves to this suspense of indefinite waiting. The enormity of the dangers involved made them both silent and thoughtful. Kim's original suspicion of a hidden agenda behind this trip to Earth resurfaced with double the conviction. Would they even know if some robot from the shuttle
Meanwhile, Rita's thoughts were back on her daughter. Would they ever meet again? Obtaining deuterium from this planet seemed more and more impossibility with each passing moment.
"What are you doing here?" a sound echoed suddenly in the environment, and they were astonished. They both turned up to the source of voice. There was a very old man who stood up in front of the spacecraft. But the miraculous thing was that he was wearing only a piece of cloth. Kim and Rita wondered that being a very cold area, how the old man was alive without warm clothes?
An SOS traveling through the huge vastness of the Nalco Galaxy flashed on the monitor of 'voyage earth' control unit on the planet Maya and read as follows- Hello! this is an update from earth...base/ slot no.91... Our first attempt to lure your astronauts to step out is aborted. They seem genuinely suspicious and you know we were skeptical about this to happen and already warned you about this.. .we even beamed the false message to mislead them about our presence through our synergy communication system and then we even used human bait, an aboriginal to lure them come out of the ship. You know we are helpless to do anything so far they are inside the secured environs of the spaceship. Our success depends only on their exit from the closet and for that we are working out at some other strategies.
Rita though got scared a little, said," Look here Kim, I am totally confused, Nothing is making sense. It is all illogical. Why are the earthlings warning us if they want to harm us? Are we suffering from hallucination or something?
Kim said," I have no logical explanation, but I think it is our own control at Galaxy Nalco which is trying to traumatize us, at least confuse us."
" Or warn us?", said Rita. "May be our bosses have now realized that Earthlings may harm us, and may be earthlings are monitoring our communication, so .....
Message was loud and clear and in both audible and visual forms. While liquid crystal display put the words shining on the Visio phone screen, its speaker played the same message aloud.
''You shall be approached shortly by a group of human delegation who shall take you both to their local base camp to hand over the required bonanza i.e. the first consignment of deuterium as friendly gesture...PLEASE accept it... come back and your job is finished. And for galactic sake don't be argumentative with the delegation. They may not like to answer your all impatient queries. And it may be just that you may put some silly questions which may affect our newly hatched diplomatic relations... be cautious and careful... all and over. THE MISSION CONTROL..." Message ended abruptly...
"We are cautious and careful you goons, now I can sense something odd is definitely going on and we must resist it...do you follow me Rita?"
Kim uttered in a whispering sound which could barely be heard by Rita. "Cool down Kim, don't be panic and exaggerate the things...let' s solve it carefully ...'Rita also whispered...
Soon they were engrossed in making some secret plan and of course a little bit of love which they were deprived of since they left Maya... [arvind]
."Of course I will be calm if you would remain calm when I tell you what is going to happen. Rita they have found out our secret Societies. One that I have formed viz, The Society of Intuitive Humans' and the one that you have formed The Society of Naturo- Humans'. And they are going to punish us. 'How to punish' is the question."
" Kim you are illogical. They have just informed us that a delegation is expected any time, and we return after taking the deuterium. And of course I am calm," said Rita as calmly as a radio announcer.
Kim argued," This calm of yours is deceptive, don't you see! Where was the need to tell us that we have to wait? I have not seen any human habitation in a radius of 30 - 40 kilometers. We are at an altitude of 18000 feet. Is such an area suitable for reception of a galactic delegation from a powerful galaxy? Are Earthlings so uncivilized? "
Rita was now upset not with Kim but with herself. She is proud of her logical prowess, and she has missed the point totally. She said," But Kim then let me repeat your question to you. 'Where was the need to
" Because your own natural daughter is there in the hands of our enemies" Kim burst out impatiently. (-VMT)
A secret meeting was underway at a location inaccessible to humans of Maya planet in the Nalco galaxy;
''Just see how shamelessly these creatures are indulged in the kind of activity they call love....oh shit...a totally foolish and an unproductive activity ...this should be brought to the notice of our Boss supreme...we must take some concrete step to throw away them out of the ship immediately lest they may produce their own kind on earth too....''
''The incidence has already been brought to the notice of Boss supreme... and we are expecting his commands any time now.. ''
The communication system operated by AI's[artificial intelligence] of Maya was silenced for a moment.....
Kim paused to think before replying. The orders to rush to Earth came so fast and he had been so unwilling that he took it all too casually. Space travel was very common- a very routine drill. But to travel Earth was a different thing. They had never been to a planet like that before. Would there be atmosphere? It would mean their ship would have to considerably slow down before landing. All other places they had visited had no atmosphere or very thin atmosphere. Would there also be ammonia there- as on some other body he had read about. Like on Titan. They had never been to Titan, a satellite of Saturn another planet of the Solar system in another Galaxy. He was not sure if
'Is Earth bigger than Saturn and Titan?' he suddenly asked Rita. 'It's bigger than Titan but much smaller than Saturn'; she seemed sure.'Those on Saturn must be lucky guys, we are so cramped on our planet, and it's so small.'
'Why I am thinking about ammonia is, after all why should there be water so essential to life? May be on Earth life is not carbon based at all. Ammonia can dissolve chemicals for reactions like water. So I am worried how we shall survive on Earth?'
Rita gazed at Kim," You can't be serious. Don't tell me you have really not looked at the planet data', even as she played with the touch board feeding some key words for details on Earth.
Kim just kept mum. He couldn't explain but he had not been normal. Never before he felt so withdrawn before any mission. It was routine to check up galactic, stellar or planetary data before the mission. Of course it only took a few seconds and everything was literally at finger tips. It could be done before the boarding or during the journey. But why did he not do it this time? May he have missed on some of the doses in the previous week leading to behavioral change, he was not sure. But he always had his medic- belt strapped which continuously monitored all parameters and injected appropriate biochemicals. It is so crude, he muttered to himself. Robots don't need it. Of course, occasionally, while going to unfamiliar places, he would usually switch off the auto mode. He was proud of his instincts and would depend on them to face the sudden developments. This had saved him several times.
Rita found this unusual politeness surprising. But she quietly thumped on the touch board and directed her mind. Normally she didn't have to touch the board physically but this time she did it as if to will it to function better. She didn't want to take any chances. What would be Earth like? Kim could well be right. May be there would be air on
Earth so the ship would slow down on sensing the friction- caused heating. May be there would be lot of dust or minor bodies around earth though the info bank indicated otherwise. What if Earth had no hydrogen needed to run their energy units? This last thought was frightening. Robots used much more advanced energy systems for themselves but to others they only gave primitive units. Without hydrogen, they would have to use their chemical reserves which couldn't last them enough. She faintly remembered that the carbon on earth was also very small in concentration in the atmosphere. They couldn't use it to produce energy. 'Why not check it', she thought.
Within a second the screen flashed "2 percent'! Kim had been intently looking at the screen. he looked questioningly at Rita, 'Check again.
It was supposed to be a few hundred micro mole per mole, a few hundred parts per million. Isn't that so?'. Rita nodded still gaping at the screen.
"Kim sounded as if he had not heard what Rita had said. You know Rita," Kim began softly, " I had taken for granted that the Earth would have atmosphere, would have people like us, along with robots but not being ruled by robots. That is why the Boss took a long time to decide on this mission."
Rita looked perplexed. She didn't understand the logic of Kim's statement. And she always became more attentive when Kim would talk softly. She didn't want to disturb him.
Kim continued," They call us earthlings, for we are the descendants of great earthlings who were brought here as pathfinders, the glamorous name given to 'adventure laborures', for earth at that time was teeming with billions of humans. So the Earth was glad to send an adventure team to discover places that no humans had seen till then. They
were, however mistaken. Our forefathers were actually used as cheap labour in a 'foreign' land, foreign in every respect. They had no 'human rights. We survived and progressed and made this land of robots a prosperous and advanced country. But we do not yet have 'human rights' on planet Maya And you know that I have started a 'Society for intuitives'. I only hope in our absence these robots or even before our departure, have not 'unearthed' it. And so is the case for your 'Society of Biohumans'. They abhor both these terms. Reetaa was amazed at this knowledge, for the history that she was thought was entirely different. She, like every other earthling, was taught that our forefathers were saved by the Robots from a catastrophe like a 'Pralaya' or Deluge on earth. And therefore we ought to be grateful to the Robotzens. She suddenly realized that the mission is more complex than she had been imagining, no not imagining, but logically thinking it to be. Suddenly she realized how logic though wonderful as a tool, is so miserably dependent upon the 'data in' .
There on the planet Maya another secret meeting of the commanders had been called. The Boss had admonished the Commanders," You fellows have not yet learned to understand the priorities. To you the stupid act of these slaves is more important rather than what they are planning right now on the mission. I am afraid you all have to undergo a 'Cleansing Operation'.
Obviously a human bug has entered in your system." There was pin drop silence in the hall and a haze of gloom had suddenly spread. No robot liked the act of 'Cleansing' (-VMT)
Robots indeed hated cleansing; it would remove their pet memories saved with caution. New instructions would be planted in. They would have learned again many a thing. But the boss had ordered and had to be obeyed. Yet they clarified to Him that they had not been negligent in dealing with earthlings. They have detailed a woman who believes in logical thinking and the man believes in intuitive thinking, and the two would not agree on another matter except the JOB given to them. Therefore there was nothing to fear, no chance of rebellion.
Kim continued with his soft voice on the subject that was bothering him. His aim in the mission is to find a way to get Human Rights in the planet Maya. Rita immediately added and instead of having custom made babies, natural biological babies.
Kim said," Of course it is one important right under Human rights.’ But the problem is what helps can the earth men give to us."
Suddenly they realized that the anti boosters had fired and the spacecraft was entering the earth's atmosphere. There was very little time to think.
"You seem now too much obsessed with Maya only and not thinking what shall be our fate on earth in a case the earthlings get hostile against us... and if your apprehensions are right we can't take things for granted and we don't know what has transpired in between AIs'[artificial intelligent people]of our planet and earthlings and the possibility of any hidden agenda of this mission could also not be completely ruled out..." Rita uttered in a whispering tone though the outgoing message delivery system was inactivated by Kim long ago.
"Now you seem to be on right track and we should immediately work on the strategy to deal with earthlings if in any case we are forced to step out of the ship" Kim looked nervous. Even before Rita could say anything the special astronaut's cabin got ejected with a bang and landed on planet earth safely though with a jerk which suddenly caused both the astronauts to loose their balance and stunned for a while. As if this was not enough the doors of the cabin also opened consequently leaving the poor duo further dismayed and stupefied. And before the duo could recover from the sudden trauma two earthlings entered their cabin.
The unexpected development was too much for Rita and Kim. Suddenly they felt very vulnerable. They were now completely at the mercy of Earthlings! It was quite a scene where gentry of four persons from different cultures and star systems gazed at each other, speechless and stunned.
Kim broke the ice. He brought a smile on his face with an effort with a view that it might carry the same meaning of welcome in both cultures which they represented. Rita was intelligent enough to copy the gesture and smiled in pursuance and wished that this could ease the tension which prevailed in the atmosphere. Representatives of both the cultures instantly realized that they were just humanoid having the similar anatomical features - two arms, two legs, two eyes, one nose, and just one head…… so on and so forth.
But still there prevailed a long and an eerie silence. Kim sniffed the air and found it very refreshing which in turn boasted his morale immensely but before he could muster the courage to speak something he heard something in a very pleasing tone.
"Welcome! Welcome to earth, trust you understand our language….thanks to our computer generated language programmer…." One of the earth man, the tall one uttered with a professional tone in his voice and without a pause he introduced him and his companion, "I am Guru and he is Rudra." walked a few steps, "I Kim and she is Rita" words flew spontaneously from Kim.
"Please follow us and hurry up… your ship is poised to take off now at any moment" there was an urgency in the voice of Guru. Rita and Kim followed them like obedient servants without uttering a word of protest and showing of any resistance. They felt as if they were hijacked and there was hardly any alternative left but to follow those earth men without protest. No sooner did they all step out of the ship it just took off with a thunderous bang and was engulfed by the vastness of the sky overhead.
Rudra began in a very serious tone, "We are not surprised as to why your space ship has taken off. As per your computer, which we have studied in depth, you were not planned to get out of the ship. We thought it to be weird, indeed highly or shall I say embarrassingly weird, for a visitor to come to us and not even come out and feel the 'Earth', I had a suspicion on the purpose of your mission." Guru then asked me to study more of the contents of your computer, and then he decided to give you a bad landing, bad enough to break open the door, so that you could come out, but safely." The computers were translating their languages almost instantaneously.
Kim looking at Guru, said in a pleasant voice, "Thank you Sirs, Guru and Rudra, for bailing us out. Our decision to return will now depend upon your hospitality. "
"May I ask as to how do you understand our plight?, asked Rita who was getting more and more puzzled, as her logic was failing her.
"Oh, everything is there in your data, though not explicitly or clearly, but we can add two and two as four, even when hidden ai a haystack. However this is not to say that the problems you are facing have a simple solution, indeed it is very difficult."
At the planet 'Maya' a very important meeting was convened and words were coming directly from the horse mouth -the supreme of artificial intelligence network of the planet.
"So far our mission earth is progressing the way we desired and now our astronauts are in custody of the earthlings and let's see what comes next."
"We have not understood instead of anyone of us why those humanoids were selected to visit earth. The opportunity should have given to anyone of us or a group of ai's. A voice came in protest. "I can very well understand your concern X 326, but I could not risks ending anyone of you to the earth and endangering your life. Is that clear or you gonna ask more questions ... “The voice of Supremo was crisp and loud. There was a pin drop silence..... ......... ...
"OK...Let us begin from beginning! Only decade ago we got first definite signal that life existed elsewhere also in our galaxy and the message was from the Earth, a planet in the sun-star system as you all know very well now….the message of life was beamed by them only …they showed their location in the galaxy and our curiosity about this `out of our star' planet grew immensely" Maya supremo took a brief pause and began again…"Our initial surveys reveal that both the civilizations were almost identical! Might be just a coincidence only!
Evolution at earth and at our planet progressed in almost the identical manner. We had our first aquatic creatures exactly as on the earth, then amphibians, reptiles and mammals and an off shoot of avian fauna off course all in the same manner as on earth. And the biological evolution culminated ultimately into the emergence of humanoid first on earth and then at our planet though much later. Humanoids being very intelligent and imaginative flourished at earth and later at Maya too. But they had as you know very well their own weaknesses and were supplanted by a breed of more intelligent and superior people at both the planets and we are the descendants of the same great people though much evolved and progressed now ….though ours is a civilization much younger than earthling androids but we are no less in any achievements than theirs..
Yet we can't take any chances…We can't trust them blindly…" "It’s all very interesting like some fairy tale ...please go ahead' a voice echoed suddenly from no where and silence mounted again.
"To cut a long story short we both I mean the earth men and we androids of MAYA decided to establish some sort of diplomatic relations between us and we took the initiative …We invited a delegation from Earth though hastily accepted but not finalized as yet and meanwhile we took the lead …as you know we have sent our two humanoids –RITA and KIM on earth and thus a new era of diplomatic relations in between both the civilizations have now begun…'the statement was followed by a commotion and a voice emerged again from the audience- "Why not any one from amongst us why those humanoids?"
"Have patience! I am going to tell you every details point by point don't panic and no nuisance please we are civilized people! Yes we were initially skeptical! Suppose they do some harm to our astronauts then. And we can't risk even a single android of our planet and why should we for seemingly no big return…so we finally decided to send our two humanoids first just to see how the earthlings really behave with our people …"
"Let us see how they treat with our representatives and that will decide the fate of our further relations…and if they are treated in bad way it would be the end of our relations ..." " But is it proper to risk the lives of our humanoids like that?
After all they belong to our earlier civilization of humans and possess an antique value…"the pun in the statement was more than obvious…"We could withstand the loss of humanoids and their lot but not a single android of our clan….You know it very well…"Supremo' s voice was suddenly very emphatic.
They were walking through a very narrow corridor. There were escalator but they were still. Rita couldn't miss the smile on Kim's face. Kim looked questioningly.
Rita whispered, 'What's the matter? I am, anyway, happy to find you smiling in these circumstances. '
"Oh nothing. But did you notice that these people don't part their hair in the middle? Isn't it strange? Then look at the hair length, there seems to be more or less two well defined groups. The male have very short hair like us while female have only shoulder- length hair.Look at those lower rung females, most of them have much longer hair. Do they wear some kind of wing?"
Rita also couldn't help smiling at the observation. Symmetry should be the choice by default. So unless there is some special reason, why should anybody part hair on the side? In fact at Maya, they kept little no hair at all. They had to wear head gear outside, and there was radiation protection indoor so there was no need for any protective wig or anything. In any case , the growth rate was so small. Kim's amusement seemed justified.
Before Rita could answer, one of the accompanists beckoned them to the left. Rita, turning sharply to the left and pulling Kim by hand along, said ,'Something to do with evolution? May be they require hair, as you hinted, for protection from UV? May be this parting of hair has something to do with hierarchy. See, one of them has parted on the other side of head?" She was happy that she had found a flaw in Kim's observation.
Kim's forehead furrowed. Rita wasn't sure if it had something to do with her statement but she caught Kim's line of sight. He was looking at the hall in front.
It was a huge conference hall, oval in shape. The back panels were actually continuously running screen. They projected the whole hall in every alternate segment so that anybody could see everybody. There were already some people sitting। All looked grave.
The whole day was just terrific for the aliens and even descending night could not favour them to have even a moment of rest. Now a big party was in full swings and choicest intergalactic dishes were served
Rita couldn't control her ecstasy when she enjoyed the food. There was a large gathering at the party hosted in their honour. Rudra introduced Kim and Rita to two bright maidens Kalpanaa Kiran and Usha Williams.
:"Kalpanaa Kiran is a very imaginative name", exclaimed Rita. "Perhaps it has something to do with imagination and rays" she politely extended the conversation, for she very much wanted to talk to them. Kalpanaa almost blushed as she wanted to be known in this sense of the word, and which her real personality was, and not what others implied, and to her dismay Rudra explained the popularly understood meaning.
Rudra trying to help making a bridge, said, " This name has a history and biology behind it .Long ago There was Kalpanaa Chaawalaa, the first Indian born astronaut, and Kiran Bedi, the first Indian woman police officer. KK with chosen characteristics of these two great women is one of the few successful custom produced human beings. And Usha Williams is another. She has the best traits of P. T. Usha, the first Indian woman to win gold in world Olympics, and Suneetaa Williams, the Indian born cosmonaut who held three world record for woman astronauts, viz. longest space flight, and maximum number and hours of 'space walks'. Usha Williams also blushed although both were thirty plus, but somehow had this trait of childlike simplicity in them.
"Oh how lucky I am", said Rita enthusiastically. "How fortunate are you both to have inherited the wonderful characteristics of the Two great women, but both of you are biological humans, and you are respected for what you are here. I believe you have what is known as Human Rights. How envious I am of you both. Great moment in my life."
Kalpana said sharing the enthusiasm, "How lucky are we to be the first woman on earth to meet astronauts from a far off star. Please tell me about your planet."
'Then she noticed Kim who was watching and listening quietly, a trait she appreciated and which she herself had inherited from Kiran Bedi.'
Kim asked both of them their specialties in their work. It was Rudra who answered, "They are the best program creators on Earth. They can enter in to the machine language and the digital language of the machine and create programs or modify them as deemed fit." Before Kim could ask another question, Rudra continued," They are also the best security builder, what we call 'zafing' the entire software, and so the best hackers".
"How wonderful, our Rita does the same on planet Maya", enthused Kim.Guru also came searching for them. Guru, looking at Rudra, said let us all meet the next morning, no I do not mean to spoil the party. Enjoy yourselves. But I have to leave."
Guru announced that Rita, KK and Usha should learn from each other. And he took Kim away into his office. Kim explained to him how they were being ill treated by the Robots as they controlled all the resources through the programming. On Maya they , the humans, had committed the blunder of developing robots so much that the robots had started programming themselves. And humans had started enjoying life, as per the adage,’ eat, drink and be merry', leaving all the work to robots Then suddenly one day when humans awoke late morning, they found that the
control of Maya was taken over by the robots. And since then humans were treated as slaves, and Robots as masters.
Guru offered "Here is the most fundamental code of conduct for robots. Go through it in your sweet time."
Guru said seriously, "We on earth here were to fall in the same pit, when an Indian Guru, my direct ancestor, warned us. He explained the purpose of life, and he first gave us a code of conduct which we are following religiously. "
Guru smiled as he pronounced the word ‘religiously’. Guru continued, "Our religion is very secular. He, the original Guru, predicted that' eat, drink and be merry' cannot give us lasting happiness. The font of happiness is inside us and that is what we have to discover or rather realize. Then the old history suffered 'death', and a new history of earth has dawned, environment, both human and natural, has improved. You can see for yourself where do we stand today.
Kim was puzzled," This is the code of conduct, given by the original Guru, our robots are following, and they let us 'eat, drink and be merry'.
Guru said softly, "So you are slaves, not because of the programming but because of your philosophy. So you observe us and see our lives, as to how happy we are living with our motto of life -- 'Enjoy, remaining detached'. Decide to continue with your way of life or follow ours."
"No, no, I have no doubt in my mind, I wish to follow what you call 'detached', though I have not understood what it means. I want humans not to be any type of slaves. But the question is not 'Why' but 'how'."
Guru continued, "Once you are free from your chosen slavery of your way of life, you will be able to control the Robots as you would be able to control your own senses."
"But how about the programs already in our computers and in Robots themselves?" , Kim sounded desperate.
'Well, sweet is what sweet does. 'Rit' in Sanskrit, the oldest living language, rit means 'eternal laws of cosmos. 'Rita is actually short form of 'Ritambharaa' , meaning follower of those cosmic laws. But you all have forgotten all that. Now live here as long as you feel necessary, and then we will organize a spaceship for you."
The global space travels headquarters in New Delhi was teeming with activities of its base staff who were concerned with voyage, "Mission Earth" of planet Maya. Minute to minute details of the mission were being transmitted to impatient public who were watching the high pitched drama. Public Relation Officer Ms. Mina was on the screen presenting the live coverage entitled, "Encounter with the aliens".
She was in midst of her maiden speech,” Thank God… Planets Maya's representatives appear to be harmless and our team members Rudra, Guru, Kalpana and Williams look very pleased with them. Alien representatives are named Rita and Kim and are humanoids like us…. Just see Maya's people do not trust on us and that is why they have restrained sending their any one of androids on the Earth... they perhaps don't want to take any risk. They perhaps don't understand that Humanity at Earth is still not overtaken and overridden by the overtures of our androids and great human values still abound on the Earth. Maya's people perhaps don't understand this and that is why they have sent two poor souls in their Mission Earth…. Aliens seem to be husband and wife who have been mercilessly thrust upon us but by all means they are our guests ….Atithi devo bhav thus goes an oft repeated saying of Sanskrit language …. …"
There was sudden pause and appearance of some advertisements on the screen. Live coverage was being watched by millions across the globe. Seconds later Ms. Mina appeared again on the screen and camera focused the place where aliens were receiving the grand hospitality. Mina continued speaking in full enthusiasm, "See, the Mayans did not trust us and tried to trick us in having not sent their so called best brains…. I mean androids but see our greatness…. the way we are treating our alien friends...its courtesy of our people and the protocol department! Let Maya people appreciate this and learn a lesson from this great humanitarian gesture..... We are summing up right now... But please stand by for our next bulletin." The screen went off again with showing of certain advertisements.
The "Mission Earth" Control at Maya was perhaps unaware of the happenings which were currently in vogue at Earth and was quite oblivious of the fact that something very hectic was going on earth.

It’s hard to imagine Middleton without the Lumani family. They’ve been here for nearly a quarter century, and their eateries have been the scene of so many local conversations, get-togethers and, obviously, delicious meals.
It was in 2006, with 16 years in the restaurant business already under their respective belts, that they decided to open a contemporary Italian café. A place where diners could take their time and lounge in stylish comfort, all while enjoying authentic pizzas, fresh gelato, and delectable dishes from across the Mediterranean. It was a surprising marriage of sophistication and casual dining.
They chose a historic building, located at 1828 Parmenter Street – right in the heart of downtown Middleton. They filled it with color, cozy seating, and class. And the rest, as they say, is history.
Tony Lumani says they initially came to Middleton, years earlier, for a business opportunity offered here. (Members of the family opened Bavaria Family Restaurant, since renamed Sofra Family Bistro, just around the corner.)
At Villa Dolce, Lumani said the menu and ambiance are intended to “bring little bit of Europe [to] downtown Middleton.”
It is rather sad that at a time when peoples are toppling dictators and changing regimes, we are still stuck talking about women driving, underage marriage and the right of prisoners to get a speedy, fair trial. I’m not saying these issues are unimportant, but let’s face it: their importance pales quickly when compared to other countries’ struggles to change their reality.
The latest Saudi story to make international headlines was about a proposed anti-terror law that the interior ministry has been aggressively pushing through the Shoura Council. Amnesty International somehow obtained a copy of the draft and published it on their website.
Amnesty said the proposed law would strangle peaceful protest, and asked the King to “reconsider this law and ensure that his people’s legitimate right to freedom of expression is not curtailed in the name of fighting terrorism.”
The draft, probably leaked by a member of the Shoura Council, contained comments made by the Council’s security committee. Based on the copy, they seem to have made very few and minimal changes on the text prepared by the ministry. These changes, however, do not touch on the articles that caused concern to Amnesty and activists in the country like Article 29, which says: “Anyone who doubts the king or crown prince’s integrity will face punishment of at least 10 years in jail.”
The Saudi embassy in London responded to Amnesty’s leak by saying the concerns of the human rights organization were “baseless and mere assumptions.”
Local media did not report much on the news, but newspaper columnists made a point of attacking Amnesty and activists who raised their concerns about the proposed law on social media sites. “Amnesty have committed a crime by interfering [in a domestic matter] and publishing confidential documents,” wrote Ahmed al-Towayan in Okaz daily. “They proved that they are an organization that includes a group of ignorants, rebels and people who have interests; an organization morally and financially bankrupt seeking money any way they can.”
But the most severe and sinister attacks were saved for local rights activists, who have gotten increasingly vocal in their criticism of some government practices lately. In the same week, the Saudi edition of Al-Hayat daily carried two columns calling activists “erotic dancers” and outlaws.
“There is no doubt that the new activism has become a dangerous phenomenon,” Saud al-Rayes wrote, “because it aims to challenge the state and its organizations.” Al-Rayes linked local activism to the Iranian influence in the region, a bold statement for which he did not bother to provide any evidence, then called activists to support the National Society of Human Rights instead of questioning government policies.
The article understandably angered activists who turned to Twitter (where else?) to release their fury. Al-Rayes, as we now say in Saudi Arabia, has been hashtagged.
His fellow columnist in the same paper Hani al-Dhaheri could not just stand their while his colleague gets ripped up by the kids in social media. Few days later, he penned this column in which he called rights activists khawarij who use social media to incite people against the government.
After getting a slap on the wrist for signing one of the reform petitions earlier this year, al-Dhaheri has learned his lesson and conformed.
“How could a whiner in Twitter, Facebook or YouTube assert that someone is innocent or oppressed unless they have an ulterior motive beyond this cause which they use to cover their agenda,” al-Dhaheri wrote today. He kept repeating a line about targeting the “legitimate leaders” of the country, despite the fact that none of the local activists actually question the legitimacy of the royal family.
After writing 457 words, al-Dhaheri concludes in the last paragraph that this “suspicious project run by activists ‘from their homes’ is not new,” and that those activists will either end up distracted by fame and money or leave the country to join the opposition in London. Again, al-Dhaheri does not bother to tell us how he reached that definitive conclusion. Maybe he has a magic ball?
Mohammed Fahad al-Qahtani, co-founder and president of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, noted what he called an “attack campaign” on human rights activists.
“My message to all #saudi columnists who ridicule and humiliate people that one day you will be held accountable in people’s court,” he tweeted.

You will have to excuse the state of my face prior to the makeup application as it was the time of the month (maybe TMI but it's cool) and I wasn't feeling great at all.
I have decided to do a step by step on my makeup application and the finished look, which evidently (the title gives it away) is my current every day look.
I love a smoky eye as it really gives off a sultry look. And nothing makes your eyes stand out more than by having a nude lip. I have mentioned some of the products I will be using previously as I tend to reach for them more.
Please ignore the fact that I look like a thumb ha ha, and a very pale one at that. I have always been naturally pale, I can't work out if that's a good thing or not though?!
Anyway, I had run out of my primer, which has now be discontinued so I have resorted to using a moisturiser as my base. This actually works pretty darn well. I really like Simple skin care products because I have sensitive skin and their products in no way irritate me.
As you can see, I have very light eyebrows, so it actually looks like I don't have any. The same goes for my lashes. I am a natural blonde baby!!
I always put my concealer on before my foundation because I find it's a lot easy to disguise blemishes and circles. I tend to find dabbing it on works better for me as if you rub the product in I feel you lose the cover. It provides a nicer base, I have been doing this since... Gosh, high school I think. I have ALWAYS put concealer on my lips too since then. So NO Kylie Jenner you DID NOT invent this beauty hack I am afraid to say, a lot of us girls have been doing it for years!! :)
I currently use a mixture of foundations just to warm it up a little. One has reflecting qualities and the other is pure matte. I find mixing the two creates a nicer finish and outcome.
I blend and buff the foundation in with my Real Techniques 'Expert Face Brush'. It leaves me with a perfected base that can sometimes look slightly airbrushed and I love that.
To set my base in place I use a matte powder. As you can clearly see mine has been used to death, hit pan and has now frickin broken. Ha.
I use my Real Techniques 'Powder Brush' to lightly dust the powder over my face to ensure there are no shiny bits and everything consistently stays matte.
Yep, as being a pale face like I am, I will use a bit on powder bronzer and cream bronzer to give myself a subtle glow.
I will lightly contour where my cheekbones are with the powder and soften the edges into my face to create a shadow. I will then run some more down the sides of my nose, across my jawline, on my temples and forehead. This is to create flattering shadowing and natural tints.
Eyebrows are what frame your face and give you character. As mentioned, mine are pretty light so they end up making me look like a walking egg. Ha.
I therefore have to draw mine on which is a pain in the ass if truth be told... "I watch way too much Gavin & Stacey".
I will brush the hairs into shape and place, I will then draw on with a pencil the bottom line as to where the brow will sit and then the top line to meet and make sure they are as even as they can be. (See pictures)
I will then fill in with the powder kit and angled brush. I am just using a Barry M one here. I do have new and better brushes but I cannot bring myself to use them yet as they are too pretty. Phaha.
Eyeliner wise, I will first do a cat flick on my upper lid with a liquid liner and then I will then go around my waterline and tight line with a Kohl liner. Obviously, I will be using the blackest of black shade. You know it's me... it's to match my dark soul. Ha. Only joking.
I tend to start the flicks off pretty short until I do the finishing touches where I will elongate them.
Yup, mascara is now needed to sort out my little blonde babies because lets face it, they look really odd against the black. I only put the mascara on the top lashes to start off with.
This seems like a mighty fine process when it is broken down like this but it actually doesn't take hardly any time at all. Hence why I will wear this look every time that I am wearing makeup.
I love doing this part the most as this is where I can experiment. I have currently been applying my shadow with a Barry M brush, which lets be honest isn't the best. I will be moving on to my Real Techniques and Nanshy brushes soon!! I really want the Rose Gold Zoeva brush set, but I will get them once I have found a job.
As you can see from the pictures, I apply the lighter shade in the crease of my eye socket and blend outwards to my brow line. I will then go in with the 2nd darker shade and just add that to the socket to add some more depth and blend that out slightly. And then the same with the darker brown but only in the outer corners.
I will then dab on some of the Kiko 'Copper' shadow to add some more dimension and to deepen the crease.
The final step to my eyes is adding to the lower lash line. I will go in with the Rimmel 'Copper Bling' Exaggerate eyeliner along my lower eye and smudge along to my tear duct area. In the outer corner, I will bring in my black Kohl and blend into the copper eyeliner to show some gradient tones.
And last but not least the mascara will be applied to the lower lashes and I will go over my top lid eyeliner and elongate the flick.
To complete my face I will add some Makeup Revolution highlighter on the apples of my cheeks, down the centre of my forehead and slightly on my chin and cupids bow.
I will blend out with my Real Techniques 'Powder Brush' and do the following steps with my blusher. The blush will be applied to my cheeks and tip of nose only with the Real Techniques 'Blush Brush'. Then blend.
At this stage, I will wipe off any excess foundation off my lips and then with my Real Techniques 'Expert Face Brush' I will just dab it across my lips to create that concealer/foundation base for my lipstick again.
My lips are pretty rough at the moment. I have a habit of picking my lips if I am nervous so they aren't in the best of states.
I am currently loving the Primark 'nude' liner in their range as it matches perfectly with MAC's 'Honeylove' matte lipstick. I will line my lips and fill the lip in with the liner to create the perfect base and then go over with 'Honeylove'.
I absolutely love this look, it's understated but draws the eye in. With the eyes being warm toned it makes blue eyes pop.
This has been quite a mammoth post, so I apologise if it has taken you an age to get through it. You know me. I love to talk.
I am a fashion, beauty & life blogger, who is a makeup addict and creative experimentalist. Be yourself because everyone else is taken.
The tray is made from EVA, the same material used for the umbrellas sold at convience stores. It feels a lot like silicone.
This Snow Miku comes with a load of extras that really make it worth your money… the only reason it’s so cheap is that we really pushed to make it as cheap as possible for the event. (Even if the ice tray wasn’t included, it would have been the same price :P)
I tried a lot of other things, but these two made the resulting ice much clearer. If you display the product with Nendoroid Petites it looks like they were making their very own ice sculptures!
It seems like if there are too many impurities in the liquid then it freezes much more jagged and falls apart much more easily… so in the end I recommend using tea and coffee!
When you want to get the ice out pour some tap water on the reverse side of the ice tray to loosen it!
You can find gelatin in the sweets section of most shops! Just be sure to put in quite a lot of gelatin, otherwise it won’t harden!
Getting her out now is a little more difficult – but I found that poking the gelatin with a toothpick to let some air in while pushing on the bottom helped to get them out quite easily.
If you really want to impress that guy you’ve had your eye on then be sure to give him some Miku chocolate! I’ll go over how to make some quickly!
If you add some cream it might end up even tastier… but I was worried it wouldn’t harden as well, so I decided not to add any this time.
You can turn off the heat of the stove completely and just use the heat from the water to melt it down… but be careful not to burn yourself!
It’s quite hard to get the chocolate to fit neatly into some parts like the hair – just find something to spread out the chocolate so that it gets into all the nooks of the mold.
You need to get them out of the tray quite quickly – if you take too long trying to get them out then they start melting from the heat of your hands… ^^;
Miku came out broken up into little pieces… plus the jelly got stuck onto the tray and getting it off was a mission…
The tray will become distorted from the heat and lose it’s shape… I should know… because I did it once… orz.

I HAD to learn guitar. I don’t mean “had to“, the way Santana “had to“. I wasn’t predestined to channel the mysticism of a Greater Power like Carlos. When I play guitar, there is nothing smooth and transcendent about it. God is definitely not speaking through me when I play…or if He is, He’s cursing and mumbling. Me playing guitar is a war between a crafted machine and an uncertain body. Always has been. You might say “that is a pretty bleak outlook”, and then you might wonder why I play guitar at all if it’s such a struggle.
Well, when we started our first band I desperately needed to be involved. It was the only thing I had going for me (though it was pretty much nothing), and I knew if it went away I’d never get a chance to be a musician again. My problem was, I didn’t play an instrument. I was the lead singer (the term “singer” being used very loosely) of our God awful punk band, and we were very much into writing songs. Songwriting had value with this bunch. But we were a fickle lot, prone to ejecting people who couldn’t make an adequate contribution. I was desperate to be able to write words AND music…like, write a whole song by myself. I figured that could cement my position in the band. Well, my efforts must have made a bit of difference as I didn’t get sacked from The Malibu Kens till years later.
My Mom got me a cheap acoustic guitar for Christmas in 1978 or thereabouts. A beater. What everyone should start on. Years before, I had tried guitar lessons but they didn’t stick. I don’t learn things that way. However, I did remember the G chord and the D chord from those lost days.
At home there was a music book with a thousand popular songs. The sheet music also had pictures of the guitar chords right above the staff (that liney thing they put the dots and curlicues on). I noticed the song American Pie had a lot of G and D in it. The other chords didn’t look too difficult, I liked the song pretty well and knew it to sing along to, so I thought it would be a good one to start with. It took months to get through the whole song once. That was likely because I was teaching myself to sing it at the same time I was teaching myself to play guitar on it.
I remember getting outraged at the alien ways I was expected to contort my fingers to make these chords. It fucking hurt. It seemed impossible. My performance of American Pie was like a road full of potholes…constant hesitation as I struggled to remember the chords, how to do them, the strumming, and what the next words were. Thank God I did this when I was alone.
One day, I did the whole song without stopping. I did it again. I figured I had it all sussed out, and the next time Ed Dobek was over I played it to him. I wish I could tell you he was supportive and encouraging, but he wasn’t. After I had finished he told me it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard. That was humiliating, and it turned out I had to get used to it. Throughout the years my bandmate’s attitudes towards my “acoustic shenanigans” (as Steve Loree refers to my solo performances) has always been a variation of that sort of thing. Jr Gone Wild drummer Larry Shelast always asks me what time my set ends (implying he’ll show up when my set is over)….stuff like that.
Anyhow, back to the guitar. After awhile I was playing good enough The Malibu Kens got an Ovation 12 string acoustic,and I started doing some rhythm guitar on some of our more “Beatle-esque” numbers. Besides playing a bit in the band, I spent about 3 hours a day playing guitar at home instead of going to school. My training regimen was American Pie, the 5 song nonstop Ramones live set from Rock n Roll High School soundtrack(I’d play along to the record…thats how I learned Barre chords), and trying to come up with riffs and inspirations of my own. At any rate, The Malibu Kens went on and did what they did and eventually faded away. By this time I had developed enough confidence and met enough people that I knew I could carry on without the guys in the ‘Kens.
I knew in my next band I was going to write songs and play electric guitar. I was also aware my budget demanded I get the cheapest guitar available, but that didn’t stop me from fantasizing about what I would get if I could get whatever I wanted. I saw a couple movies in 1979 that made that decision easy.
In May of 1979 I saw The Kids Are Alright, a sort of film clip history of The Who. It spanned their whole career, so you got to see Pete Townshend playing Stratocasters and Rickenbackers when they started out, the Gibson SG phase during the Tommy days, and finally the Gibson Les Paul he played on Won’t Get Fooled Again and Baba O’Riley. I loved the whole thing, but there was something about the sound, and the look in Pete’s eye, wielding the Les Paul as he did, that made a big impression on me. I started equating sonic power with the Les Paul. When the movie ended I stayed in my seat and watched it again.
Then in July Neil Young’s Rust Never Sleeps came out. This was a concert film that started small and acoustic, and gradually built into a loud, distorted, beautiful mess. His band was Crazy Horse, and it seemed as if even the drums had distortion. Neil, of course, played his ancient black Les Paul with the Bigsby wammy bar. When the movie ended I stayed in my seat and watched it again.
I suppose it was a combination of seeing two heroes of mine in action doing some of my favourite songs with Les Pauls that put the notion in my head, but from that point on I associated THAT particular make of guitar with the power of rock, and convinced myself it was the rock guitar of choice for songwriting masters. Thus began a few years of yearning.
I can’t remember who I got it from or for how much, but I somehow ended up with a piece of junk Les Paul copy. I think it was a Mann. This piece of shit couldn’t hold it’s tuning and sounded like elephant farts, but it looked like a black Les Paul and at that point in my life that was good enough for me. However, it was not good enough for Jr Gone Wild.
One of the first incarnations of Jr Gone Wild included me and three guys from St Albert (Graham Brown, Kim Upright, and Mark Brostrom). They liked me and my songs well enough, but they simply DESPISED my junk guitar. Seriously, it’s intonation was so bad tone deaf people complained about its tuning. I believe they pitched in and used some band cash and got me one of these:
This is a Les Paul Standard Desert Burst. The one we are talking about is a 1976 model. A very generous gift, and a scathing indictment against Mann guitars. What the boys in the band couldn’t know is, they didn’t get me just any Les Paul Standard. The guitar they chose already had an interesting and trippy connection to me that kind of blows my mind to this day.
This story hops around. Back in time to my first band. Joey Did and the Necrophiliacs played our first and nearly last show (see my first blog) at our high school. Our guitarist, Scott Juskiw,, had an older brother named Frank Juskiw who was a few years older and was at the time trying to make his mark on the world with his band Pretty Rough (and years later, Famous Blue Raincoat). He was a good guy, and being a supportive big brother lent Scott his Les Paul for the Necrophiliacs first gig. It was a Les Paul Standard Desert Burst like the one pictured above.
Jump ahead in time. For reasons unknown, Frank Juskiw put his Les Paul up for sale at Long and McQuade. That is the guitar the Jr Gone Wild boys bought me. When I learned the details I was blown away. It seemed so cosmic that the guitar my first band used at our very first gig ever ends up being my own years later. Frank’s relationship with the guitar did not end there either. Frank was also the guitar tech at Long and McQuade and he was the only guy to work on the guitar until he passed away a few years back. Sometimes he’d have a look of horror when I would bring it in for a setup after JGW tours (He took much better care of the instrument than I did…I also undid all the “mod” work he had done, I swear I saw a tear in his eye a time or two).
I’m sure Frank was horrified when I brought the guitar in after Tim Folkman and Barry Laibida painted it. I was living an artists lifestyle hanging with artists of all stripes. I was totally in to having
my guitar personalized. As it stands, the guitar’s appearance went on to become one of JGW’s iconic signature images, and it even inspired some of the ideas for the Too DumbTo Quit album cover.
By now I was playing guitar all the time. My days as a lead singer with nothing in my hands but a microphone were becoming a distant memory. My repertoire of chords and chops was small. I basically learned whatever I needed to know to get the songs done. I found I quite enjoyed bashing the chords out in lockstep with the rhythm section. Doing leads was fun, everybody tries it, but I was no good at it. Never will
be. When I DO lead guitar work, I always look at my “solo” as a melodic component of the song as opposed to a demonstration of my skill. Jr Gone Wild seems to benefit from the differences in approach that clash in our “two guitar attack”.
It’s been a lot of years now. Jr Gone Wild eventually called it a day, and my guitar ended up in storage for over a decade. When the band got back together in 2013, I literally had to dust the guitar off. I’ve broken a million guitar strings, and either myself or the band has spent a couple grand on repairs, setups, and replacement parts over those years (although I never did put new volume and tone knobs back on….those were always the first to go and I got tired of always buying new ones). My hands know and love this guitar. I’ve had it since 1985 or so. It’s been on every tour I’ve done.
I’ve kicked the shit out of it and treated it bad, but it’s still here, saying the things I have no words for.
How important is a page-one listing on Google and should a top SERP-position always be digital marketers main priority?
Recent data from the US-leading SEO consulting firm Ignite Visibility (2017) (Fig 1, below) report that a number one position on Google will result in a 20.5% click-through rate (CTR) which then falls steadily down to a 7.95% for SERP-one position ten, and according to this report the total CTR for first-page organic listing receive in total 99,88% of all clicks.
While CTR-studies often report widely different stats (Fig 2, below) and with a “universal” CTR applicable to every search query made in Google and other search engines simply is not achievable as the CTR always will depend on factors such as if the query is broad, exact or long-tail (Anderson, 2014); considering available data, though, one firmly can conclude that first-page organic search listing will generate the majority of clicks:
Whereas data like this at first glance might indicate that a top SERP-position always should be digital marketers main-priority; before jumping to any conclusion, let’s first look at some facts related to SERP-positioning and CTR-estimations:
A study by Moz reports that more than 34% of all searches will result in a “zero CTR” (2017) and in a similar study by Wordstream (2017) in which 17 queries and 24 related keywords searches were tracked for two years; a 39% decrease in first-page-CTR is reported when comparing 2015 to 2017. According to these and similar studies, the decline in first-page CTR can partly be attributed to the fact that search engines have begun answer search queries directly in the SERP through features including ‘Featured snippets’, ‘Local Pack’, ‘Reviews’, ‘Knowledge panel’, ‘Instant answers’ and ‘Related Questions’ (Fig.3,4,5,6,78, following pages).
As noted by Enge, Spencer and Stricchiola (2015), Kingsnorth (2016) and Clarke (2016); top SERP-positions depends on many factors including domain authority, content quality, backlinks and technical factors such as page-loading-speed. While arguably it is possible for an organization with unlimited resources to obtain a top organic positions for most keywords and phrases; many domains have fierce SEO-competition (Hackney, 2017; Sharma, 2017) in which top SERP-positions often are occupied by organisations whom have built their position through years of SEO-work, and consequently the cost, efforts, and resulting ROI of trying to compete for a first-page SERP in such segments might simply not be worth the efforts.
As pointed out by Google (ThinkWithGoogle, 2017); peoples search patterns, habits, and phrases have changed from broad phrases such as “shoes online,” too complex questions and phrases such as “buying brown leather boots similar to Angeline Julie on Oscars 2017.” Google has answered to this by adapting its latest search algorithms including the Hummingbird, Pigeon and Possum updates, to focusing on semantics and to build an understanding of the indirect meaning of explicit search queries; and also to comprise metrics such as the user location and type-of-device when delivering search results (SearchEngineLand, 2017). Optimizing for broad queries, consequently, has become less important and Google recommend that SEO-work should be focused on answering long-tail questions such as Want-to-know…, Want-to-go…, Want-to-do… and Want-to-buy… (Google, 2017).
What always should matter in SEO-work is that the words- and phrases with a top position in the SERP are grounded in organizational revenue- and/or business goals and that SERP-results also have corresponding and directly related SEO-optimized marketing assets such as product pages, videos and/or map-directions.
Page-one listings receives a great majority of clicks. With modern search algorithms focusing on understanding the indirect meaning of explicit search queries; ranking for broad phrases, though, has become less important and as an example Google recommends that SEO-work should focus on answering explicit long-tail queries. Consequently; the key to building a strong SEO-strategy is to understand the customer journey, what problems your product or brand are solving and anticipate how people currently find answers to these questions. SEO efforts then should be grounded in organisational business goals (including economic factors) and on the production of SEO-optimized content with a page-one objective that answers these questions.
This is my rebuttal to the CPUC's letter of 10-28-99, and the answers they relayed to me therein. Perhaps this is the start of a dialog, at last. I hope so. It has taken me years, literally, and a large invesment in my web site, to get even this far.
The new down payment rules are in full effect. Those purchasing homes above $500,000 will be required to put 10% down on any additional amount above $500,000. Home buyers who purchase homes below $500,000 will see no change. Homes above $1,000,000 require 20% down payment. This is a much better solution than the minimum 10% down payment to $1,000,000 that was under consideration.
While this might sound like a significant change, less than 1 in 10 first time homebuyers in Canada purchase a home valued at more than $500,000 and a substantial amount of those buyers put more than 5% down.
So who does it affect? It’s targeted at buyers in larger Canadian cities like Toronto and Vancouver. Our government appears to be trying to slow down the real estate market in larger cities and manage their risk regarding CMHC insured mortgages. The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) confirmed that real estate prices across the country have risen 18% year over year but if Vancouver and Toronto were removed, the increase is at a more sustainable rate of 5.4%.
Lenders are gearing up for the spring market with competitive rates and real estate inventory is beginning to grow in most markets. Whether you are looking for your first home, your dream home or an investment, now is the time to get a mortgage pre-approval and lock in your rate.
While the Mike and Will team will guide you through the transaction, you will also need the services of other qualified professionals. We pride ourselves on having the best industry connections and established relationships in place to make your Real Estate transactions as comfortable as possible.

Last year, after the initial fuss of our engagement had settled down, Lori and I decided to buy a house. As house prices are high, the price tag of a wedding and a house purchase seemed prohibitive, so we thought we might buy a house and throw the wedding there. It didn't take long for our optimism to fade, and we quickly became very discouraged. Discouraged doesn't come close to describing how messed up buying a house in the city actually is. So the dilemma is: do you buy a house in the city and pay through the nose; or do you save your money and buy a house outside of the city and spend all your free time commuting. Personally, I enjoy sleep too much to have to get up early to take commuter trains, and I love the fact that TTC allows me to come and go from work to home as I please. Buying a house in the downtown area borders on madness. The houses you can afford either have three kitchens in them and require major renovation to make the space livable, or they are so small that it would be a complete change in lifestyle. Finding a balance between them is difficult, and often is a matter of timing more than anything. The problem Lori and I currently have, is that the neighbourhood and apartment we're currently in is amazing. Well, at least we think it's amazing -- we may look back years from now and have a good laugh at it. In short though, we're in an $800K home in a $800K neighbourhood. Anything that we move to will be a step down: two bedrooms, two dens, two bathrooms, large spacious kitchen, large master bedroom, patio, backyard, private parking, all utilities included and about 100 feet from transit. We really wanted to buy a home in our neighbourhood, so postponing the purchase allowed us to save a bit more for a down payment. So, a few weeks ago we started up the house hunt again. This time, we spent a couple weekends driving around, trying to get a feel for the surrounding neighbourhoods. We saw lots of listings in our area, and we looked them up on MLS, but quickly discovered that even the smallest dumps in our area were beyond our price range, and if we could afford it, we'd be burying ourselves so far under that our lifestyle would exist to support the house. We made a trip out to the east end of the city, which is popular for first time home buyers. The east end of the city is completely foreign to us, and to make matters worse we were driving around the east-end on a weekend that the Don Valley Parkway was closed for maintenance. We spent nearly an hour on Queen St East, and got a really good whiff of the garbage processing plant. Unfortunately for the east end, we resolved that we were not east end people, despite how pleasant everyone makes it sound. We decided to focus our search in the west end of the city, just outside of the downtown core. We expanded our search area to our surrounding neighbourhoods, compromising on the location for price. .....
When I learned that Google had an Outlook Sync feature for Google Calendar, I was quick to download and experiment with it. While I was able to sync successfully between both Google and Outlook, I did notice some quirks that others have also reported:
Of course, the forums have some nasty comments in them, my favorite draws the analogy between Google Calendar Sync and Windows ME. I'm going to hold off on this version (0.9.3) until some of these issues are resolved.
While cleaning up a code monster, a colleague and I were looking for ways to dynamically rebuild all of our web-services as part of build script or utility as we have dozens of them and they change somewhat frequently. In the end, we decided that we didn't necessarily need support for modifying them within the IDE and we could just generate them using the WSDL tool.
However, while I was researching the problem I stumbled upon an easy method to drive Visual Studio without having to write an addin or macro; useful for one-off utilities and hair-brain schemes.
Note that Visual Studio doesn't allow you to manipulate projects directly; you must load your project into a solution. If you don't want to mess with your existing solution file, you can create a temporary solution and add your existing project to it. And if you don't want to clutter up your disk with temporary solution files, just don't call the the Save method on the Solution object.
Stumbled upon this post about how to catch server errors for your WatiN tests. The approach outlined provides a decent mechanism for detecting server errors by sub-classing the WatiN IE object. While I do appreciate the ability to subclass, it bothers me a bit that I have to write the logic in my subclass to detect server errors. After poking around a bit, I think there's a more generic approach that can be achieved by tapping into the NavigateError event of the native browser:
While I wouldn't consider COM Interop to be a "clean" solution, it is more bit more portable between solutions. And if it was this easy, why isn't it part of WatiN anyway?
Following up on the series of posts on Legacy Projects, my legacy project with no tests now has a build server with empty coverage data. At this point, it's really quite tempting to start refactoring my code, adding in tests as I go, but that approach is slightly ahead of the cart.
Although Tests for the backend code would help, they can't necessarily guarantee that everything will work correctly. To be fair, the only real guarantee for the backend code would be to write Tests for the existing code and then begin to refactor both Tests and code. This turns out to be a very time consuming endeavour as you'll end up writing the Tests twice. In addition, I'm working with the assumption that my code is filled with static methods with tight-coupling which doesn't lend itself well to testing. I'm going to need a crowbar to fix that, and that'll come later.
It helps to approach the problem by looking at the current manual process as a form of unit testing. It's worked well up to this point, but because it's done by hand it's a very time consuming process that is prone to error and subjective of the user performing the tests. The biggest downfall of the current process is that when the going get's tough, we are more likely to miss details. In his book, Test Driven Development by Example, Kent Beck refers to manual testing as "test as a verb", where we test by evaluating aspects of the system. What we need to do is turn this into "test as a noun" where the test is a "procedure to evaluate" in an automated fashion. By automating the process, we eliminate most of the human related problems and save a bundle of time.
For legacy projects, the best place automation starting point is to test the user interface, which isn't the norm for TDD projects. In a typical TDD project, user interface testing tends to appear casually late in the project (if it appears at all), often because the site is incomplete and the user interface is a very volatile place; UI tests are often seen as too brittle. However, for a legacy project the opposite is true: the site is already up and running and the user interface is relatively stable; it's more likely that any change we make to the backend systems will break the user interface.
There is some debate on the topic of where this testing should take place. Some organizations, especially those where the Quality Assurance team is separated from the development teams, rely on automated testing suites such as Empirix (recently acquired by Oracle) to perform functional and performance tests. These are powerful (and expensive) tools, but in my opinion are too late in the development cycle -- you want to catch minor bugs before they are released to QA, otherwise you'll incur an additional bug-fix development cycle. Ideally, you should integrate UI testing into your build cycle using tools that your development team is familiar with. And if you can incorporate your QA team into the development cycle to help write the tests, you're more likely to have a successful automated UI testing practice.
Of the user interface testing frameworks that integrate nicely with our build scripts, two favourites come to mind: Selenium and WaitN.
Selenium is a java-based powerhouse whose key strengths are platform and browser diversity, and it's extremely scalable. Like most java-based solutions, it's a hodge-podge of individual components that you cobble together to suit your needs; it may seem really complex, but it's a really smart design. At its core, Selenium Core is a set of JavaScript files that manipulate the DOM. The most common element is known as Selenium Remote-Control, which is a server-component that can act as a message-broker/proxy-server/browser-hook that can magically insert the Selenium JavaScript into any site -- it's an insanely-wicked-evil-genius solution to overcoming cross-domain scripting issues. Because Selenium RC is written in Java, it can live on any machine, which allows you to target Linux, Mac and PC browsers. The scalability feature is accomplished using Selenium Grid, which is a server-component that can proxy requests to multiple Selenium RC machines -- you simply change your tests to target the URL of the grid server. Selenium's only Achilles' heel is that SSL support requires some additional effort.
The above code instantiates a new session against the Selenium RC service running on port 4444. You'll have to launch the service from a command prompt, or configure it to run as a service. There are lots of options. The best way to get up to speed is to simply follow their tutorial...
Selenium has a FireFox extension, Selenium IDE, that can be used to record browser actions into Selenese.
WatiN is a .NET port of the java equivalent WatiR. Although it's currently limited to Internet Explorer on Windows (version 2.0 will target FireFox), it has an easy entry-path and a simple API.
The following WatiN sample is a rehash of the Selenium example. Confession: both samples are directly from the provided documentation...
As WatiN is a browser hook, its API contains exposes the option to tap directly into the browser through Interop. You may find it considerably more responsive than Selenium because the requests are marshaled via windows calls instead of HTTP commands. Though there is a caveat to performance: WatiN expects a Single Threaded Apartment model in order to operate, so you may have to adjust your runtime configuration.
WatiN also has a standalone application, WatiN Recorder, that can capture browser activity in C# code.
Start Small: Begin by writing coarse UI tests that demonstrate simple functionality. For example, a test that hits the homepage and validates that there aren't any 500 errors. Writing complex tests that validate specific HTML markup take longer to produce and often tend to be brittle and less maintainable in the long run.
Map out and test functional areas: Identify the key functional elements of the site that QA would normally regression test for a build: login, update a profile, add items to a shopping cart, checkout, search, etc. Some of these will be definite road-blockers that you'll have to work around -- you'll quickly realize you can't guarantee profile-ids and passwords between environments, or maybe your product catalog changes too frequently. Some will require creative thinking, others may inspire custom testing tools that can perform test-specific queries or functions. You may even find a missing need in the backend systems that you could build and leverage as part of your tests.
Write tests for functional changes: You don't need to sit down an write an exhaustive site wide regression fixture -- focus on the areas that you touch. If you write tests before you make any changes you can use these tests to help automate the debugging process. The development effort is relatively small -- you have to test it anyway a dozen times by hand.
Write tests for testing bugs!!!: What better motivation could you have? This is what regression testing is all about!
Design for different environments: The code examples above have URLs hard-coded. Consider using a tool that uses configuration settings to retrieve or help construct URLs so that you can run your UI tests against your local instance, dev, build-server, QA, integration, etc. UI Tests make great build-validation utilities!
Up to this point, I've crafted the HTML markup for my posts this year using Notepad++. While working with a local editor is far superior to using Blogger's editor window, I've found stylizing elements and adding hyperlinks to be somewhat time consuming, not to mention difficult to read/review/write content with all the HTML markup in the way. Despite having better control over the markup, the largest problem with this approach is you really can't see what your post will look like until you publish, and even then, I usually follow a nervous publish/review/tweak/publish dance number to sort out all the display issues.
Recently, I downloaded LiveWriter and w.bloggar to test drive alternatives. (Actually, I was interested in w.blogger's ability to edit Blogger Templates -- but it turns out that they don't work on blogger's new layout templates. Drat.) So far, I'm pleasantly surprised with LiveWriter.
Although I'm pretty excited that the tool is written in .NET with support for managed addins, I am most impressed with the feature that can simulate a live preview of your post. LiveWriter is able to pull this off by creating a temporary post against your blog and analyzing it to extract your CSS and HTML Layout. You can toggle between editing (F11), preview (F12) and HTML (Shift + F11) really easily.
The biggest snag I've encountered thus far is that the HTML markup produced by LiveWriter is cleaned up with lots of extra line-feeds for readability. While this makes reading the HTML a simple pleasure, it wreaks havoc with my current Blogger settings.
Blogger's default setting converts carriage-returns into <br /> tags. So all the extra line breaks inserted by LiveWriter are transformed into ugly whitespace in your posts. This feature is configurable within Blogger: Posts -> Formatting -> Convert line breaks.
Unfortunately for me, this is a breaking change for most of my posts (dating back to 2004). To fix, I have to add the appropriate <p></p> tags around my content -- fortunately, LiveWriter will automatically correct markup for paragraphs that I touch with additional whitespace. So while the good news is my posts will have proper markup in the editor, the bad news is I have to manually edit each one.
From my previous post, Get Statistics from your Build Server, I spoke about getting meaningful data into your log output as soon as possible so that you can begin to generate reports about the state of your application.
I'm using NCover to provide code coverage analysis, but I can also get important metrics like Non-Comment Lines Of Code, number of classes, members, etc. Unfortunately, I have no unit tests so my coverage report contains no data. Since NCover will only profile assemblies that are loaded into the profiler's memory space, referencing my target assembly into my Test assembly isn't enough. To compensate, i added this simple test to load the assembly into memory:
This is obviously a dirty hack, and I'll remove it the second I write some tests. Although I only have 0% coverage, I now have a detailed report that shows over 40,000 lines of untested code. The stage is now set to remove duplication and introduce code coverage.
As I mentioned in my post, Working with Legacy .NET Projects, my latest project is a legacy application with no tests. We're migrating from .NET 1.1 to .NET 2.0, and this is the first entry in the series of dealing with legacy projects. Click here to see the starting point.
On the majority of legacy projects that I've worked on, there is often a common thread within the development team that believes the entire code base is outdated, filled with bugs and should be thrown away and rewritten from scratch. Such a proposal is a very tough sell for management, who will no doubt see zero value in spending a staggering amount only to receive exactly what they currently have, plus a handful of fresh bugs. Rewrites might make sense when accompanied with new features or platform shifts, but in large they are a very long and costly endeavour. Refactoring the code using small steps in order to get out of Design Debt is a much more suitable approach, but cannot be done without a plan that management can get behind. Typically, management will support projects that can quantify results, such as improving server performance or page load times. However, in the context of a sprawling application without separation of concerns, estimating effort for these types of projects can be extremely difficult, and further compounded when there is no automated testing in place. It's a difficult stalemate between simple requirements and a full rewrite.
Assuming that your legacy project at least has source control, the next logical step to improve your landscape is to introduce a continous integration server or build server. And as there are countless other posts out there describing how to setup a continuous integration server, I'm not going to repeat those good fellows.
While the benefits of a build server are immediately visible for developers, who are all too familiar with dumb-dumb errors like compilation issues due to missing files in source control, the build server can also be an important reporting tool that can be used to sell management on the state of the application. As a technology consultant who has played the part between the development team and management, I think it's fair to say that most management teams would love to claim that they understand what their development teams do, but they'd rather be spared the finer details. So if you could provide management a summary of all your application's problems graphed against a timeline, you'd be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of their investment over time. That's a pretty easy sell.
The great news is, very little is required on your part to produce the graphs: CruiseControl 1.3 has a built in Statistics Feature that uses XPath statements to extract values from your build log. Statistics are written to an xml file and csv file for easy exporting, and third party graphing tools can be plugged into the CruiseControl dashboard to produce slick looking graphs. The challenge lies in mapping the key pain points in your application to a set of quantifiable metrics and then establishing a plan that will help you improve those metrics.
Here's a common set of pain points and metrics that I want to improve/measure for my legacy project:
Complexity / Duplication (Code Size) Cyclomatic complexity, number of lines of code, classes and members NCover, NDepend, SourceMonitor or VIL
Ideally, before I start any refactoring or code clean-up, I want my reports to reflect the current state of the application (flawed, tightly coupled and un-testable). To do this, I need to start capturing this data as soon as possible by adding the appropriate tools to my build script. While it's possible to add new metrics to your build configuration at any time, there is no way to go back and generate log data for previous builds. (You could manually check out previous builds and run the tools directly, but would take an insane amount of time.) The CruiseControl.NET extension CCStatistics also has a tool that can reprocess your log files, which is handy if you add new metrics for data sources that have already been added to your build output.
Since adding all these tools into your build script requires some tinkering, i'll be gradually adding these tools into my build script. To minimize changes to my cruise control configuration, I can use a wildcard filter to match all files that follow a set naming convention. I'm using a "*-Results.xml" naming convention.
Configuring the Statistics Publisher is really quite easy, and the great news is that the default configuration captures most of the metrics above. The out of box configuration captures the following:
Here's a snippet from my ccnet.config file that shows NCover lines of code, files, classes and members. Note that I'm also using Grant Drake's NCoverExplorer extras to generate an xml summary instead of the full coverage xml output for performance reasons.
I've omitted the metrics for NDepend/SourceMonitor/VIL, as I haven't fully integrated these tools into my build reports. I may revisit this later.
If you've found this useful or have other cool tools or metrics you want to share, please leave a note.
The Most Reverend Malcolm McMahon OP, Archbishop of Liverpool, will inaugurate the Holy Year of Mercy called by Pope Francis with Mass in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King on Sunday 6 December at 3pm.
The Jubilee Year of Mercy begins on the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, 8 December 2015, and concludes on Sunday 20 November 2016, the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, King of the Universe. Jubilee years are special years called by the Church and the last one, The Great Jubilee, was held in 2000 during the papacy of Pope John Paul II.
Pope Francis will open a Holy Door of Mercy in Rome through which those who enter can experience the love of God who consoles, pardons and instills hope. During Sunday's Mass Archbishop Malcolm will bless and open the Metropolitan Cathedral's own Door of Mercy. In the coming year the Cathedral will be a place of pilgrimage with 'Stations of Mercy' for pilgrims to visit, focusing on the forgiveness and mercy of God; moreover, deanery groups are scheduled to make pilgrimages to the Cathedral on Saturdays throughout the year.
In a Pastoral Letter to the people of the Archdiocese, Archbishop Malcolm says, "I sometimes meet people who feel light years away from God. There are many reasons why. Some of them imagine God is so remote that He could not possibly be interested in us. Like most of your priests, I have been really sad to hear people say that God has no room for them because of something bad they have done. So many people are thoroughly convinced they are beyond redemption.
"Christmas says that is not true. Saint Anselm asked, 'Why did God become man?' My answer is simple – it is because we matter. And that means all of us, each and every one of us. Pope Francis has given us a fantastic Christmas present by asking us to focus on how merciful God is. He wants every sinner to feel at home in God's house."
Two other churches in the Archdiocese will be open as Jubilee Churches for individual pilgrimages: Holy Cross in St Helens and St Mary’s in Leyland, and they are available for those who cannot travel to the Cathedral but who would still like to make a pilgrimage. They will have their own Doors of Mercy and Archbishop Malcolm will bless and open them on Tuesday 8 December, with Mass at 12.15pm in St Helens and 7.30pm in Leyland.

An old adage exists that the best place to hide things is in plain sight. People mindlessly walk by them every day and never notice them. The same may be applied for food dyes. If all food products with food dyes had a flashing neon signs stating “Buy 1 Get 1 Free: Get cancer and behavioral abnormalities today!” that would likely stop people in their tracks. Alas, these signs don’t exist.
The onus falls on consumers to exercise discernment and vigilance as to what they bring into their household. Big Food is to eager to go as cheap and easily mass-produced as possible and mid-level employees at our quasi-protective agencies, the FDA and USDA, are too underfunded or preoccupied to chase down every new chemical and additive the former push to add to our ingredients lists. Also, the “revolving door” between the high-level associates of Big Food and the agencies many times undermine the whistleblowers who work hard to expose the harmful additives.
Before we delve into food dyes per se let’s cover why Big Food uses them in the first place. In short, without them our food looks like crap! In the process of turning tomatoes into ketchup, potatoes into frozen French fries (or whatever other natural food to a processed item), valuable nutrients (e.g. like bran or the grain part of wheat) are stripped. Or in the case of sodas which are just carbonated water, addled with sugar, and other additives they would look listless. These “pseudo-Frankenfoods,” if not enhanced by food dyes would look unappealing and unpalatable, especially to children. Extracted originally from coal tar and now petroleum, dyes accomplish other roles as well like:
Today’s installment on Items You Must Purge From Your House Now features food dyes. Prior to the mass production of our processed foods we used natural products to alter the color of our tasty dishes (e.g. turmeric and
paprika). But it was cutting into the bottom-line of Big Food companies to do that so they concocted additives that mimicked these colors.
As with so many of these additives laced into our foods (High Fructose Corn Syrup, artificial sweeteners, soy lecithin, “natural flowers,” MSGs, Sodium Benzoate et al), food dyes pose a significant health risk to those who consume them. You are likely familiar with the names of these dyes since they are simplistically named: a color and a number. Here’s a few: Red #40, Blue #1, Citrus #2 Yellow #5 Orange #6. Caramel Color, found in all sodas and most processed snacks, is a cleverly named food dye evoking the nostalgic kid favorite from the 1960’s and not the chemical it is.
Naturopathic Earth we strive to bring awareness to additives in our food supply that might pose health risks. Here are some potential dangers with food dyes:
The European Union in 2010 added a warning on all food dye foods stating the food “may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.” (As with so many additives Europe is way ahead of America in warnings. Perhaps the Big Food lobby is much stronger here.) Perhaps the most famous of food dyes (Red #40) has been linked to hyperactivity in children. As well as Blue #2
The Center for Science in the Public Interest expose (Cspinet.org) “Food Dyes: A Rainbow of Risks” states unequivocally “The three most widely used dyes, Red 40, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 are contaminated with known carcinogens. Another dye, Red 3, has been acknowledged by the FDA to be a
Tumors in rats consuming high amounts of food dyes have been reported for decades. Specifically, Blue #2 linked to brain tumors; Blue #1 kidney tumors; Green #3 bladder and testes tumors; and Red #40 immune system tumors.
Yellow #6 and Red #40 have been linked to both increases in respiratory allergies, food sensitivities, hives (uticaria) and migraines.
In essence if it is in a box expect it to boast food dyes. We here at Naturopathic Earth have a saying “If God didn’t make it; don’t eat it!” If you use that motto when purchasing your food, it will largely keep you away from these injurious
Parental backlash and greater consumer awareness has been effective. There was such a parent backlash on food
eplaced it with natural ones. (Too bad they didn’t remove the MSGs in them as well.) Food companies, such as Nestle, General Mills, and Kellogg’s, announced they would phase them out of their products in a few years.
Though a victory it raises a larger question. Big Food has known for decades that food dyes are toxic yet they continue to add them to our foods. It evinces their duplicitous behavior that only when pressured by consumer rights groups do they bow.
As always read the labels. Opt for companies that use natural food dyes. The burden falls on you. If you have a child with ADD or ADHD symptoms first try to remove all food dyes from their diets before placing them on psychotropic medications. A simple move like that might make all the difference in their future.

We all want our health span to equal our life span, and we certainly want our pets to live a happy, healthy and long life. Unfortunately we cannot make this an “eternal” or forever life – but we can try to help them bypass the poor quality events–arthritis, dermatoses, otitis externae (ear infections) and cancer caused by poor diets, and toxins.
We know that readers of this magazine already know that the world is full of pollutants! Poisonous chemicals cumulate over time in our pet’s, and our own bodies usually stored in fat tissue which might become a nidus for tumour growth. Taking the “Rubbish out” is a life long/daily/weekly event – leading to a longer life (ask my husband!)
Harmful waste products are either flushed out –down the urine pathway filtered out via our kidneys, or through our entero-hepatic cycle and out the other “hole”. Some are sweated out via skin/ears which may be represented as dermatitis and otitis
The simple answer to detox is to feed fresh, organic balanced foods that are species appropriate, and to provide ample sources of pure clean water. www.catinfo.org gives great information about feeding cats, and our clinic www.animalwellness.com.au can help with soecific diets. Adding a good quality Spirulina or chlorella and Zeolite can help to bind out toxins that have accumulated in one’s body. If there is heavy metals- such as Lead -eg. in Mt Isa or Broken HIll mining towns, Zeolite given as small amounts weekly can help remove some of the toxicity. Each patient is an individual, and the amount and type of detox will vary accordingly. Some animals- such as man, primates and guinea pigs require exceptional levels of vitamin C to prevent scurvy during the clearing process, and small amounts of vitamin B and Selenium are also necessary. A complete blood count and serum analysis prior to embarking on a diet change or “detox” helpful to customize a particular organ system recovery. For example, renal problems are helped to detoxify with the herb Rehmannia, and liver toxins are cleared with s-AME, milk thistle, dandelion root and vitamin B’s. All require thorough rehydration therapy.
Where are these pollutants? Our pets, and us, drink them in our water (fluoride, oestrogens “the birth control pills”, agricultural chemicals), and eat them in our food- insecticides, herbicides (GMO produce are glyphosate friendly-meaning you will get a big dose of BT toxins and Round up ready gut problems if you ingest corn, maize, wheat! We also absorb them from our skin- which is a carrier NOT a barrier. Avoid putting unnecessary toxins onto your, or your pet’s skin: Did you know that your skin is a carrier, NOT a barrier- as was previously thought. That means whatever you put On your skin is carried INTO your body and absorbed until it is eliminated. This has implications for nanoparticles in sunscreen (linked to cancer) and phthalates and parabens in soaps, shampoos and cosmetics.
Bodies also produce endogenous toxins- that is stress and its dependent hormones- adrenaline, cortisol etc cause some wear and tear on internal tissues and produce some waste that also needs to be cleared out. Think your dog is chilled out and not stressed? Think again. Most little white fluffies (maltese, poodles, shitzu) just love and miss their owners so much that they can burn out their adrenals the same as their humans. Talk to an animal behaviourist to improve their attitude, and work on “Calm and mindful” pet therapy.
It is commonly a marketing tool- it means “can taste like a natural food” or smells like a “Nature derived smell” when in fact it can be entirely synthetic and made from plastics and coal tar- a by product of the petrochemical industry. Its a lot cheaper and therefore more profitable for the company to , and make Liver, or chicken flavor and Red erythrosine dyes onto plastic “food” chews that so many dogs go Whacko from. (you know the TV commercial!)
Its the same for us- Vanilla, an orchid seed pod is very expensive to grow and then bottle. That’s why most of your chocolate (which of course you do NOT feed to your pets) and cookies use ethyl vanillin- its cheap, but WHAT is THAT doing to your body and organ systems- especially if your body has no way of breaking it down? Where is it stored (think fat, liver etc! ) and how is it removed from your body? Much of it must pass through into urine and faeces- because it is found in our seawater, which means both the liver and the kidneys had a “go” at filtering it. What does it do the the environmental food chain then?
Some contaminants in our food chain bioaccumulate. This means that if it is in the soil or seawater (via sewerage) the smaller organisms eat it, incorporate this into their bodies, and as the larger organisms consume them in turn, there is a greater toxic dose per gram ingested. As Man and his pet charges are “Apex” predators we all end up with the stuff back in our bodies at a higher dose. This is true for everything that is NOT food that is ingested and cannot get removed with the waste. Food gets broken down by your digestive system or by your liver to its primary components: Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen plus some sulphur micro and macro minerals calcium, magnesium etc. Every cell gets washed in the serum that carries these molecules and each cell tries to figure out if it is food or foul—If you can’t build cells or run enzymes with the molecules there, then the chemicals are either stored in fat or liver–or put away in between muscle layers if it cannot be flushed out. Its vitally important that you feed your pet’s and your body daily with the building blocks for your cells to regenerate and that you avoid putting bad stuff into the system.
Don’t be fooled! If a substance has “not yet been found” to cause cancer it might just mean that the correlation has not been documented in enough places- and that possibly too many doctors /research scientists are on the receiving end of a pay back! (Conspiracy theorist? nah, its just business as usual! If your research funding pays your mortgage who/what ya gunna call??) . You can check pubmed entrez – the scientific research site– for information about the anthropogenic (ie synthetic man made substances) found in the atmosphere that DO NOT BREAK DOWN in the ocean’s waters. Type in any number of “food” preservatives and see what comes up.

I had an interesting weekend attending a surgery conference. On the whole it was most enjoyable, but it did raise my awareness that there is still an ignorance about what the term holistic entails. Holistic practitioners embrace a “heal the wholeness” of the individual.
There are many therapeutic models that are employed by the Naturopath, some would say this type of para-professional medical team member uses functional pathology, analysis of physical features and dietary/lifestyle/developmental history in a thorough way.
Often I am approached by clients and requested to “get to the bottom” of why they are experiencing different signs and symptoms. This means that I require a whole history and also review of their previous test results. (There is no point in spending extra dollars retesting eg. intestinal biopsies, recent blood work etc if they have recently been done!).
What I find fascinating is that some GP doctors or even specialists completely discredit the word “Holistic” as they simply have no idea about the meaning of the word. These doctors are simply confused about the terminology.
Although I have clients that tell me incredible stories about their, or their relatives healing at the hands of a Homeopathic practitioner, (ie this is a Homeopath- using a diluted water based therapy orally) many doctors assume that the word Holistic equals Homoeopathy=water=nothing in it (equates to quackery in their mind). They then further confuse the word Holistic with Naturopath and rudely disregard an entire profession of Natural healers!
I do wonder why these otherwise intelligent people (Doctors, Specialists) have no understanding of the functional pathology and mind-body medicine that Naturopaths practice. It seems that there is a separation of body parts in the minds of the standard western medical paradigm. That is the process by which emotions, and the hormones released by certain thinking processes (anxiety, worry, anger) leading to a cortisol stress response and physical body breakdown, is simply not recognised. Naturopaths like to delve down and get to the bottom of WHY this is happening, correcting the gut biome and changing diet, attitudes, and lifestyle while doing so.
It is for this reason that multiple supplements and lifestyle/nutritional changes are recommended. This may take several visits to the Naturopath while the client undergoes paradigm changes and baby steps forward. Its not too different to “going on a diet” and “getting more exercise” which is REALLY what the medical profession should be recommending anyway- instead of drug therapies!
In my Animal work I find that many of my veterinary patients reflect lifestyle concerns of the owner- that is the stresses of the home are also impinging on the health of their pet. Diet is also implicated as a factor, or cause of some of the dis-ease.
A Holistic practitioner recognises this, and although some Naturopaths also use Homoeopathy, most of us do all the above, and include diet recommendations, some form of body work, exercise, Herbal therapies and macro and micronutrient changes.
So please, inform your doctors and let them know that Naturopaths CAN and DO work with the medical profession as allied health care professionals. We ARE covered by most health care funds.
Let’s face it, life is becoming increasingly busy with work, family, social media, and things that go beep all around us. All this stimulation sets off our internal alarm buttons, and gives our physical bodies unnecessary alerts. The messages we receive tell us that it’s hard to stay afloat of all the events and time commitments around us. It can make you feel like you are drowning in paper work, or going under with financial burdens. Many feel overwhelmed with commitments or unfinished projects.
It’s a killer. It’s the NUMBER ONE cause of all illnesses! I must admit that I didn’t believe it until I felt the effects. Its A sneaky– under the radar– black cloud that just niggles at your adrenal glands until you have nothing more to put out, and find yourself struggling to get out of bed in the morning, or tossing and turning unable to fall asleep at night — without popping a pill. Curiously most of us just don’t recognise that we have this monkey on our back, until we actually do fall apart with some physical signs, such as autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, allergic skin disorders, back aches, disc diseases, Digestive problems, Cancer (through lowering your immune vigilance) heart palpitations and fibrillation or Thyroid conditions.
Stress from too much emotional, physical, or mental stimulation needs to be calmed. Stress causes your adrenals to push out the hormones of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol. This can lead to inflammation and wear and tear on your body, it also pushes up your blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to that middle belly fat store and liver diseases.
Some stress is ok, but when we continually burn our adrenals and force them to pump out stress hormones, our bodies go to ground. PTSD or post traumatic stress disorder is a longer term effect.
Nurture and nourish your body and soul. You are here for the long haul, not just for a couple of exams or a University course, a stressful job, parenting a child with autism, or a difficult marriage, or a speeding ticket. There options and ways to handle your stress levels, even if you cannot completely control your environment/relationship/job.
Organize- Clutter control is the key to staying organized. Keep a wastebasket close by and throw away things that you no longer need. Dedicate at least 15 minutes of your time to organizing your study area so you do not have to waste time sorting through rubbles of books and papers when looking for something. Remove and give away excess clothing, pottery, kitchen ware, magazines, newspapers.
Learn how to say “No”- Don’t get over-involved. You don’t have to join every activity, every club, and every community project. You do not have to accept all invitations to socialize with friends. Evaluate your schedule and check your to-do list to see what tasks are important and accomplish them first.
Exercise- Regular exercise releases muscle tension and will rev up your energy. Join a yoga class, Qi Gong, Tai Chi, Swim, go for a walk with a friend, or get up and dance in your living room. You don’t need fancy exercise machines to get regular exercise. Any type of exercise is good for your body and mind. Take a break daily to smell the grass, roses and exercise at the same time.
Eat nutritiously- Students, nurses, doctors and busy housewives, executives and police officers are notorious for not eating right. A healthy diet can enhance your body and mental functions. A poor diet can zap you of brainpower. So grab a fruit, a veggie plate, or nutrition bar when you are hungry or have no time to prepare a healthy meal.
Get enough sleep- Students, shift workers, and Medical professionals are among the most sleep-deprived group of people due to over-commitment. Getting enough sleep will rebuild your energy and will make you feel better.
Herbal Helpers- The gardening principle comes into play when nourishing your body- to last a lifetime, you will need to spend a lifetime looking after your adrenals, “weed out” the stress by removing yourself from stressful situations, and feed them well replenish them with some of the following herbs at periods of stress with these adaptogens: Withania somnifera= Ashwaganda, Rehmannia glutinosa, Rhodiola, American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), Astragalus membranaceus, Bacopa monnieri, Eleutherococcus senticosus (Siberian Ginseng). See a Naturopath for a consultation to tweak your own personal herbal formula.
Essential oils- Good quality oils and aromatherapy massages can help your brain and adrenals recover. The oils must be of a therapeutic non contaminated blend and individualised for the person’s requirements, preferably by seeing a qualified aromatherapist. Some useful blends might include some of the following: Bergamot, Patchouli, Blood Orange, Ylang Ylang, Chamomile, Jasmine, Lavender, Rose, Sandlewood, and Grapefruit essential oils.
Hug your dog, neighbour’s dog, friends dog…..or get a nice well behaved and friendly dog- they make you smile!

Pantherace and Suntrellis products have been pressure treated with a Canadian registered preservative to protect them from termite attach and decay. The chemicals penetrate deeply into and remain in the treated wood. However, the following recommendations should be adhered to when using and handling treated or untreated wood.
Pantherace and Suntrellis products are suitable for exterior, weather exposed applications where resistance to termites and decay is desired. They are also suitable for interior applications such as beams, framing, flooring, trusses, foundations and sills where there is a threat of termites and decay damage.
When painting or staining, follow the paint and stain manufacturer’s recommendations. As with untreated lumber, the wood should be clean and dry, both on the surface and internally.
When nailing close to the end of the board, whether using treated or untreated lumber, predrill the nail holes; this helps to avoid splitting. Use galvanized or stainless steel hardware only. Do not use in contact with aluminum.
Screws take longer to drive than nails, but hold boards more securely and will allow for easier removal if necessary.
Do not use treated wood under circumstances where the preservative may become a component of food or animal feed. Examples are mulch from recycled treated wood, cutting boards, counter tops, animal bedding, and structures or containers for storing animal feed or human food.
Do not use treated wood for construction of those portions of beehives which may come into contact with honey.
Treated wood should not be used where it may come into direct or indirect contact with drinking water, except for uses involving incidental contact such as docks or bridges.
Dispose of treated wood by ordinary trash collection. TREATED WOOD SHOULD NOT BE BURNED in open fires or in stoves, fireplaces or residential boilers because toxic substances may be produced as part of the smoke and ashes.
Avoid frequent or prolonged inhalation of sawdust from wood, treated or untreated. When sawing, sanding, and machining wood, wear a dust mask. Whenever possible, these operations should be performed outdoors to avoid indoor accumulations or airborne sawdust.
Wear gloves when working with wood. Use proper techniques when lifting. After working with wood, and before eating, drinking, toileting, and use of tobacco products, wash exposed areas thoroughly.
Because preservatives or sawdust may accumulate on clothes, they should be laundered before reuse. Wash work clothes separately from other household clothing.
Liberally coat all cut ends, holes, or other intrusions into the wood with a suitable wood preservative end cut product.
I'm getting into Christmas mood more and more these days and it's mainly because of all of these stunning holiday collections that are coming out! I recently showed you the NARS' offering and today we'll take a look at some of the stuff Bobbi Brown recently brought out! It's all about those smoky eyes and glowing skin. Are you excited?
Apart from the stunning Stirling Nights Eye Palette which I already reviewed here there is a new eyeshadow formula in this collection. It's called Sequin and as you can see it has this beautiful marble design to it. They're super intense and shimmery, layers well and blends out really nicely which I was quite surprised by as you usually have to work harder with these darker shades. I personally love the blue one - Moon Rock the most, but there are three more shades if you're not into blue: Star Beam (black with a hint of purple), Comet (black with a hint of green) and Constallation (bronze-y brown). By far my favourite product from the collection is the Face Highlighter which is also a new product brought to us by Bobbi Brown. It's a liquid highlighter which comes in the most beautiful sleek packaging and a pump (!!!). It comes in three shades - Pink, Seashell and Sunlight Bronze. I own the shade Seashell which is a golden champagne shade. It looks super natural on the skin while adds that healthy glow and blends into the skin so well! If you have dryier skin I would get your hands on this ASAP! All of these items are limited edition an you probably know how this works!

A new dawn. Volume 12 of "Indie Top 20" launched with a new sleeve design, a new compiler (Tim Millington, not Chet and Bee) and no individual sleeve notes for each track but beyond that, not the sense that much had changed. Despite having the mysterious Millington on editorial duties, any number of the acts on "Volume 12" would have slotted neatly on to a previous volume, so very little seemed to be afoot.
"Volume 12" is occasionally referred to as the LP with an overload of shoegazing acts, but in reality there's a broad enough mix here. A few baggy bands get to have their final moments in the sun too, and it's a fair reflection of what was going on during the strange summer of late period baggy and high water mark shoegazing. Grunge had yet to break through in any meaningful sense, and while that would in time go on to become "the enemy" of all self-respecting British indie bands - if you were Damon Albarn, anyway - most of the early 1991 outrage was directed at those blasted middle-class shoegazing bands, so much so that Nicky Wire was moved to comment that Slowdive were "worse than Hitler". Tsk. We didn't know we were born, I tell you.
While a one-sided promotional copy of "Happen To Die" does exist, in reality this was best known to the public as track four off their "Over-Rising" EP - an effort which had the altogether jauntier and bouncier title track as the first sound off the grooves, which would have made a much more convincing opening track here too.
"Happen To Die" begins with mournful organ chords, the usual distinctive, high ended Charlatans bass playing sound, and an unlikely announcement from Tim Burgess: "Don't give me that disease/ I can't find my way out". Oho. Like "Then", then, it's another example of the band at their darkest and moodiest, showing a sensitive and woebegone side that casual listeners of the group are probably barely aware exists.
There's a slightly weak production here, though, and the whole thing sounds as if it could have done with more time in the studio oven - while the bass runs and the rhythm patterns are enticing, the song itself never seems to quite scale the heights it should and almost feels like a live run-through in places. The ending in particular seems uncertain, awkward and as if the loose threads hadn't quite been tied up yet.
After this, the "Indie Top 20" series takes the confusing and inconvenient step of ignoring The Charlatans for some time, meaning we miss out on "Weirdo", the fantastic and largely forgotten "Me In Time", and "Tremelo Song", all of which knock "Happen To Die" into a cocked hat. So it goes.
The Wendys were probably some of the most unfortunate bastards ever to grace the back-end of the baggy scene. Not only did these Edinburgh boys move to Manchester just as the scene started to fade, they also signed to Factory Records, who were in serious financial trouble at the time. I'm tempted to say that they might as well have recorded their debut LP "Gobbledygook" and left most of their copies on a garden wall somewhere - it probably would have had more exposure that way (to the elements if nothing else).
They've often been highlighted as Madchester failures since, but in fact a lot of their work has a very intricate atmosphere, a moody, chiming soundscape somewhere between The Roses and The Bunnymen. "Pulling My Fingers Off" is a great example, combining a jingle jangle melody with dark rhythm patterns and morbid, absurdist lyrics. It doesn't make an immediate impression, but over subsequent listens slowly worms its way into your brain, nagging away with its warm, intricate sound. The single that preceded it, "The Sun Is Going To Shine For Me Soon" is equally rich and rewarding.
Inevitably their goose was cooked when Factory died a death, and they've found themselves relegated to the footnotes of the era since - but they still had enough respect and enough of a following to reform in 1999 to release the "Sixfootwingspan" LP.
I've been waiting a long time to write this entry. Way back in August, when I published the first ever proper entry on this blog, I wrote about Sheffield's One Thousand Violins. Guitarist Colin Gregory of that group joined The Dylans, who we are only just talking about now - six months later in blog time, but over four years in real time.
Like The Wendys, The Dylans frequently found themselves ducking critical flak for being a vaguely Madchestery band existing outside of a socially acceptable time period for that kind of noise, in much the same manner that provincial psychedelic pop groups releasing singles in late '68 and 1969 were often greeted with music press sneers. Now that such considerations of what's a hot sound and what's not have faded away as we take a backwards view from our rear view mirrors, it's possible to have a more enlightened view of their work, and "Lemon Afternoon" is genuinely beautiful. Utterly Byrds inspired, unbelievably derivative, and very simple, naturally, but wonderful nonetheless. Taking a droning, repetitive riff, and layering innocent, luscious folk-rock vocals on top, it sucks you into its dreamworld instantly, the shimmering guitars and hypnotic rhythms causing you to jump on the nearest lilo and float downstream.
This is one of those tracks I still play at least a few times a year, and still enjoy hugely whenever the mood takes me. Had it been released a mere year or two before, there's a strong possibility it would have received a much more enthusiastic audience.
The Dylans abandoned their psychedelic sound in 1994 for a harder-edged rock sound, and promptly sounded more relevant but less welcoming. Elements of their 1991 noise, though, including this, "Godlike", "Planet Love" and "Mary Quant In Blue" are all well worth tracking down, and have a warmth and innocence that's immediately compelling.
Jim Beattie quit Primal Scream in 1988, and two years later Spirea X (named after a Primal Scream B-side he himself penned) were born, with the open ambition to completely outscore and out-perform Gillespie and company. But titter ye not, dear readers, for Primal Scream in 1988 were leather-trousered no-hopers putting out records which could only be fairly described as "quite nice in places, rather dreary in others". Anyone bailing from the group at that point in their careers clearly had fair reasons.
While Alan McGee was allegedly hurt that Beattie jumped to 4AD for Spirea X's material, in terms of success the group's performance didn't match their confidence and he probably saved himself some money. "Chlorine Dream" was an easy Indie Top 10 hit, though, and slots next to "Lemon Afternoon" fantastically well in terms of arrangement - it's another psychedelic, Byrdsian drone which drips atmosphere and warms the heart. Sadly, though, it's not quite as good and doesn't quite stand up to its nearest neighbour - which makes it a slightly cruel, if entirely logical, piece of track sequencing.
Spirea X would release one more single, then the LP "Fireblade Skies" which was critically well received, but didn't sell convincingly. 4AD dropped them in 1992, and they split up in response, leaving Jim Beattie to re-emerge in Adventures In Stereo.
By this point, Spacemen 3 were barely a functioning unit. Their final album "Recurring" was essentially a split effort, with Peter Kember taking on one half of the LP while Jason Pierce dealt with the other, making it sound like a "White Album" for the early nineties, with the reverse magnetic force of two egos pushing away from each other while the rest of the group did their best to deal with the situation.
"Big City" was a Kember effort inspired by his visit to a "Rave", and is essentially a very, very Spacemen 3 take on that House party sound. Which means that it's hypnotic as well as squelchy, and riddled with scaling, spiritual church organ sounds as well as incantations (kind of) to get on the dancefloor. It really sounds more like an early nineties take on krautrock than Acid House as a result, and while that may not have been the intention, it does still stand up as a result, whereas a lot of the earliest Acid sounds don't. If there's a problem with "Big City" at all, it's that it's full ten minute version feels unnecessarily lengthy, and could do with at least a few minutes trimmed off its running time. The video edit below is perfect (and this compilation could certainly have crammed an extra track on to its CD version if that version had been used instead).
After this single saw the light of day, Spacemen 3 effectively ceased to be, and Kember and Pierce walked off in different directions to have two very different careers. Kember would continue his droning psychedelic ambitions in Spectrum, whereas Pierce would continue forward with Spiritualized, amassing greater critical and commercial success on the way.
The Indie Top 20 series ran from 1987 until the mid-nineties, and was - for a time, at least - one of the only places you could actually cheaply buy and discover the key indie artists of the era; the double LPs usually retailed at less than £10 and contained 20 bona-fide indie chart hits. This blog is my attempt to look back on every single track that ever featured on the series in order.

We went to the Flower Mound Pumpkin Patch yesterday. The kids were pretty grumpy so the pictures did not turn out as great as I was hoping for. I told Kyle that we were going there to pick out some pumpkins. As soon as he picked out his pumpkin, he was ready to leave. I guess he did not realize that he was going to take a million pictures so he was not thrilled. Kaden was mad because I decided to finally take him off his bottle cold turkey a couple of days ago. Needless to say it did not take much to make him upset. The good news is, today he seems to have given in to the fact that his bottle is gone and is finally drinking from his sippy!
Kyle driving the tractor. He did not mind this picture since he got to play with the steering wheel. One of his new favorite activities....going down a bouncy slide.
Kyle's preschool class was in the Homecoming Parade on Wednesday. This was the first time he has participated in a parade and he loved it.
The side view of their "float". Of course none of the kids would look at me for the picture. The back view. Once Kyle and his friend moved over I got to sit on the edge of the flatbed and hope they did not hit the brakes too hard.
Kaden and Daddy watching the parade go by. You can't tell in this picture but apparently Kaden loved the parade too.
Kyle in his new gigantic footsie pajamas. I did not realize they came in his size. They go all the way up to size 12. I could dress him in footsie pajamas until he is 10. :)
Kyle had his first field trip to the fire station with his preschool class. I took several pictures but most of them did not turn out well. Here are a couple that I thought were cute.

I have been obsessed with sunglasses for quite a while and always find myself lusting after Ray bans, after having a little browse online I have fallen head over heels for the 4171 Erika glasses I’ve always loved the typical aviator style ray Bans but the Erikas are just gorgeous.

Ray Bans really cater to all with a huge selection of styles and colours there’s something for everyone, I love the mirrored glasses they are so fabulous for Summer.

Today I have been given the opportunity to give away a pair of Erikas of your choice to one of my fabulous readers so get entering.. you could be the lucky one!

Chennai, Feb:13- Some treatments for cancer, including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, have the potential to decrease fertility in a variety of ways. Permanent infertility is sometimes a long-term side effect of cancer treatment. Hence, Mrs. Latha, a cancer survivor, aged 42, was apprehensive about wanting to be a mother. With her medical history, she and her husband (Mr. Sivakumar; they are married since 20 years) were contemplating such an important step. Mrs. Latha was diagnosed with carcinoma of breast and had undergone bilateral mastectomy along with chemo-radiation 5 years ago. At this juncture, the couple had approached Dr. Chandralekha, the chief of Iswarya hospital and Fertility Centre. The team of doctors headed by Dr. Chandralekha took this as a challenge and went ahead with investigations. Considering her �Cancer-Survivor� status, Dr. Chandralekha had discussed the patient�s stance with a senior oncologist in the city and was sure about putting a smile on the faces of the couple. Mrs Latha was subjected to a whole body PET scan for any evidence of metastasis and was found to be normal, and along with her Mr. Siva also underwent testing. In April 2014 Dr. Chandralekha developed an embryo with a donor egg, and sperms from Mr Siva, which were duly implanted in her. She successfully conceived a single baby, which was confirmed after 4 weeks by ultrasound. The doctors had given her high-risk pregnancy care during her antenatal period to avoid complications. The growth of the baby and the wellbeing of the mother were closely monitored throughout by a team of dedicated doctors. In January 2015 Mrs. Latha delivered a healthy male baby weighing 2.5kg. This delivery does not just serve as a testament to the expertise of the doctors of Iswarya Fertility Center, but also marks history in the field of fertility care in our country. Dr Chandralekha, Director, Iswarya Women's Hospital & Fertility Centre said," This is indeed a proud moment for us and we are elated that this significant medical breakthrough can go a long way in helping cancer surviving women to conceive and deliver healthy babies through IVF. We congratulate the entire medical team of Iswarya Hospital and also wish the couple and the new born a very healthy future". Dr. Chandralekha regards this achievement as a major scientific breakthrough in the field of Reproductive Medicine and believes this to be the first such reported case in our country. There are several options for having children that both men and women can consider if they are faced with fertility issues following cancer treatment, and success rate of IVF among such couples is less. The case can prove to be a ray of hope among millions of such cancer survivors.

The Love Twins, Lacey and Lyndsey Love are Pornstar Twins ... giving a whole new meaning to the phrase, double your pleasure, double the fun! PORN STAR TWINS! Who would ever thought that would be real? But it is and we have the infamous Love Twins for you right here! When you turn 21 most girls dream of heading to Las Vegas or having their first legal drink, but not these girls.
At 21 the Love Twins decided to do something unique ... Lyndsey and Lacey Love decided to do the same guy and do it on film! They are the Love Twins, Lacey and Lyndsey Love. In 2005 these identical twin goddesses signed and exclusive contract with adult video heavy weights, Vivid Video and now they are the pornstar twins. How could you not love that? We love The Love Twins and I'm sure you will too!
Unlike most porn stars who start out stripping in night clubs, Lacey and Lyndsey Love have never been exotic dancers. In fact, The Love Twins got their start in the world of adult entertainment through the Internet. They worked for one of those pay per minute type chat sites where you pay them a fee (charged by the minute) and the girls will get naked for you. I guess you can sort of call them Internet Strippers. The girls were extremely popular and in time the company offered them their own web site ... same service, just this site was dedicated solely to them.
It wasn't long before word of the twins got back to an executive at Vivid. They were offered a contract and at 21, they were on their way to becoming infamous. The Love Twins officially signed with Vivid in January of 2005 and their first movie came out just after their 22 birthday, that same year.
Their movie TWO HOT went on to be rated by AVN as AAAA 1/2 and was selected as the editor's choice. Within two years they would venture out on their own and that is when their stars would truly shine. The first year on their own (no longer working as Vivid girls) they had not one but three movies in the top 10! Although they got their start as Vivid girls, it was clear that without Vivid the girls would only continue to grow in popularity.
In 2007 the girls ventured out on their own, no longer working exclusively for Vivid they began working for a variety of companies including Diabolic, Zero Tolerance, Pure Play Media, Smash Pictures and even award winning director Jules Jordan.

Report 2017-030: The State Bar of California: It Needs Additional Revisions to Its Expense Policies to Ensure That It Uses Funds Prudently (Release Date: June 2017)
To better measure how well its attorney discipline program is meeting the State Bar's core mission to protect the public from attorney misconduct, the State Bar should, by December 2017, identify key goals and metrics for the attorney discipline system.
The State Bar has undertaken the following activities related to developing goals and metrics for the attorney discipline system:
-Pilot tested client satisfaction/procedural justice measures; working to improve response rate and develop similar measures for respondent attorneys;
-Identified metrics for Office of the Chief Trial Counsel, State Bar Court, Office of Probation, Lawyer Assistance Program, and Client Security Fund;
State Bar staff is working with the Board of Trustees' Committee on Regulation and Discipline to develop key goals and metrics for the attorney discipline system.
We look forward to the State Bar providing a more complete description of its actions to implement our recommendations, as well as evidence of those actions, at its one-year response in June 2018.

Fun and festivity actually happen to be such a core part of life and as a matter of fact, we all are in the habit and need for spending those happy times in life together and for this to be, there is a need for some medium of communication. Talking of communication, the secret to making it such an effective one, you need to add a spice it up with some bit of humor in the communication. Passing information without having laced it up with a bit of humor in it, then this just gets to be an effort of passing the same without any newness or excitement in them. There are a number of emotional experiences that we experience in life and these are such as anger, love and happiness, to mention but a few. One such kind of emotion that has so proved to be such a part of daily living that we experience as often is that of happiness or fun and is actually an important kind of emotion that we often face. And looking at fun as an emotion, the funny quotes come in and play such a major role. In actuality, be it that you are in a normal day to day conversation with friends and peers or in some other formal setting, when you have your communication so laced with a pinch of humor in it with the funny quotes, the entire setting for the communication will be transformed and will be made more interactive and friendly.
Funny quotes have seen such a widespread use in some of the recent developments and forums where we put lots of our random thoughts such as on the social networking sites. In real sense, thanks to the use of the funny quotes, many have had such an opportunity on the social networking sites to catch up with their acquaintances and friends more effectively, easily and frequently as well. In all the use of the funny quotes, the motive is often the same wherever they are used and that is the need to identify better and more easily with friends on the various sites that we share and as well just end the boredom. Funny quotes as well cut across all ages, races and cultures and as such happen to be applicable to all.
In actual sense, funny quotes can come from any topic in life, ranging from affairs such as issues of the daily living such as politics, love, the trivial ones such as classroom experiences and to the kitchen/cooking experiences. What matters is the ability of the person drawing out the funny quote to draw the fun in the quote from such experiences anyway. Humor is one element of communication that makes it os effective and as such, when used to relay information, it makes it so effective and the message will be received by all.

This solution was created during a quest for the ideal - both in terms of management and in terms of TRIZ. The wording of ideal (which corresponds to a spirit and intention which was formulated by Genrikh Altshuller, while creating TRIZ, and which promoted the development) is as follows:
1) Ideal program is program which can be maintained and even improved by a programmer with a lower qualification then the author, and even without author being involved.
2) Ideal program is program which does not require any changes and / or additions to the code if new functionality is added (in fact, for ideal program increasing functionality leads to redusing ammount of code); And all this without any harm to any of its characteristics (for example, perfomance, etc.).
And with programs written so fast and maintained so simply, their creation and maintenance could be entrusted to children. So the adults could spend their time doing great revelations.

This peaceful village along the Hudson is rightly proud of its rich history. From Washington Irving's tale that gives the town its name, to the Rockefellers and a host of buildings from the 17th and 18th Centuries, Sleepy Hollow's past is full of intrigue and notable events—yet today, it remains a quaint, verdant, welcoming community of about 9,000 residents.
Peak trains from Sleepy Hollow to Grand Central run about 35 minutes. On Off-Peak hours, expect the trip to be about 10 minutes longer.
The Sleepy Hollow Cemetery is the final resting place of many notable New Yorkers, including author Washington Irving, Andrew Carnegie and Brooke Astor.
I got a recommendation for Sarah from a couple of friends and she was just great! Also love the professional, friendly atmosphere of the salon itself……someone answers the phone and makes appointments and greets you when you enter. I’ll be back!
I get my hair cut by Sarah Jackson and I trusted her enough to cut my long locks short (10inchs shorter) and it is the first medium length/ short hair cut I have LOVED!!! I wear my hair down most days I love it. This Salon is amazing!!!
Indulge was my first spa experience. The moment I walked in the door I was so welcomed. I definitely had an awesome experience. Taylor Ford did my signature face and my manicure. Every one of the ladies at indulge was just simply AWESOME. I can’t wait till I go back.
At this time I would like to thank all the ladies at indulge for making today one of the best day’s in my life. Y’all are simply AWESOME.
I LOVE this salon! It feels so welcoming and the girls are down to earth and very friendly. Taylor does a great job with waxing and makes Brazilians much less awkward. She helps you feel very relaxed! She is dedicated to trying to make sure her clients are happy! Amanda…I can’t say enough about her! She is so kind and works hard to give her clients what they want and she so very talented! When I visit the salon it is my pamper day to indulge myself and the work they do plus the complimentary glass of wine they give me gives me the whole experience!
When it comes to online marking strategies, very few can beat search engine optimization (SEO). By optimizing your website for search engines, the amount of targeted, organic traffic it receives can increase significantly. Below you will find some SEO tips that will help you on your way to becoming a SEO guru.
When looking to ramp up your online profile, don't forget that image names count in search results - quite heavily, in fact. Be sure to give your images names that searchers will easily find. If you're writing about a particular product, be sure to include keywords for that product in the image name itself, so that the image will pop up in a Google image search result.
When trying to increase in search engine rankings, you should ensure that your Meta and title HTML tags are different on every page of your website. The more varying terms you have on different pages, the more search directories will store your pages and list them separately. A bigger web presence means a bigger web business.
How you present keywords is just as important as using them consistently. By adding over at this website or italic tags, you impart importance to your visitors and draw their attention to them. This also has an impact on the search engines. This simple addition brings weight to searches and drives visitors to act.
Today India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world and a hub for IT and business startups. Thus, in this article, we will discuss the best small business ideas for India with low investment. 20 New Small Business Ideas in India with Low Investment
One of the best ways to get your site ranked high with the search engines is to place your keyword phrase in the domain name. With search engine optimization, your keyword being placed in the domain name greatly increases your ranking. It may even have enough impact to place you in the first page.
Do you want to rank more highly with the search engines? An efficient search engine optimization strategy is to use the ALT text feature, with any image that you place on your site. This will allow you to place your keywords in as many positions as possible and one extra, can be the ALT text area of an image.
Keep the content as your base. The more content you have on your website, the more readers you will gain. No one likes to click on a site and be bombarded with links and advertisements. If you keep your own content front and center, readers will feel much more comfortable on your page and will likely keep coming back for more.
Using a specific keyword too often will actually count against you if you are trying to maximize the frequency of search hits. Search engines will be looking for keywords that are inserted in natural language. Therefore, you will have to not only use your keyword frequently, but the content must make sense.
When people subscribe to your emails, ask them for some basic information like their birthday. Then, http://oneseocompanydallas.blogspot.com/2015/06/google-analytics-tips-analyzing-visitor.html on their birthday send them a Happy Birthday email. This will create a personal connection and make your customers think you care. If customers think you care about them, they're more likely to come back for repeat business.
Let viral marketing do some of the dirty work for you. Allowing your readers to post reviews and comments is an easy way of bringing your search engine rating higher. Search engines have favorable views of sites that allow commenting and reviewing, so using this method can easily bump you up a few points.
When you write an article that is SEO friendly, make sure you do not forget to make it enjoyable to read, too. You never know who will come across your article and it will reflect poorly on you as a writer and marketer, if your piece reads like straight, SEO spam.
If you're building a website for your business from scratch and the perfect domain name has already been taken, consider some alternatives. Adding a hyphen or two sometimes allows you to keep the same term that you originally intended to use. If the name has been taken by a dot com website, see if it's available as a dot net domain. If possible, use a synonym for one or more of the words. As a last resort, consider purchasing an existing domain.
Use a static URL instead of a dynamic URL to improve your search engine optimization efforts. Dynamic URLs frequently are not indexed by common indexing tools, making it more difficult to gain ranking in search results with a dynamic address. Special characters frequently appear in dynamic addresses as well, which further reduces the likelihood your site will be indexed and ranked.
Find free tools to help you submit. Several websites offer automated submission tools, that help you submit to up to hundreds of article directory sites in a short amount of time. Search very hard to find the free tools that do this. Most sites charge a fee for this task, but if you are lucky you will find those that do not.
If there is one word that describes your business and product in a nutshell, then THAT is the keyword that you want to capitalize on. Use this information to develop a comprehensive website that is specifically designed to attract and inform visitors who were directed there by search engine results."
If you are not writing in English, include a meta tag that shows the language you are using. One benefit will be a rise in ranking due to searches that occur in that language.
Hopefully, this information has enlightened you and helped you get a better idea of what should constitute your business plan. There is a hard road ahead to get your company to the top of that search engine, but if you stay clear of the edges and continue to look ahead, you can get there much quicker and enjoy the rewards.
I know we’ve still got a little over a month of summer, but the cool mornings and football commercials can’t help but transcend an outdoorsman’s thoughts to fall.
Most of our favorite hunting seasons are right around the corner, and now’s a great time to get out all your shotguns, rifles, pistols, assault weapons, bows, and cannons, along with your accessories and ammunition, strew them across the living room floor, and give them a good cleaning.
I always enjoy digging the old hunting pack out for the first time each year, it’s like Christmas. I found a knife, a couple flashlights, face paint, some doe pee, a myriad of game calls, and a strawberry poptart, and that was just the first pocket! I spent a half hour separating my duck shells from my dove shells from my rabbit shells, and have determined at my projected DKPS (dove kill per shell) I should be alright for opening day!
Like a lot of hunters, my dove gun is also my duck gun, and I made the mistake of buying some cheap shells from Walmart last year, not only did they not chamber through my shotgun well, I was wounding more than I was killing. We saw this problem last year at Grizzly and began carrying the nsi 1 ¼ ounce long brass dove loads. It made all the difference in the world, not only do they chamber through guns that can hold 3 ½’s, they don’t wound, they kill.
Now we can only hope for a massive harvest leading up to opening day, otherwise there won’t be much to hunt for a few weeks. On a side note, just because Missouri’s opening day starts in the morning and Tennessee’s starts at noon, you cannot travel state to state for a double limit.
Doves, like all migratory birds, are federally regulated, and 15 is the limit per day, regardless of which side of the Mississippi you’re on!
Tennessee is still stuck at four, and that appears to be because they elect to include woodducks in their early season bag. Tennessee also did not get the extended season this year, and is again relegated to only a five day season.
He said that because the rest of the state doesn’t have the teal that west Tennessee has, they continue to push for including woodducks in their early season and that’s why they’re kept at a short season and a four-duck limit.
Ironically, I have always been miffed about Missouri not being able to shoot woody’s, especially since they seem to be the only thing flying in the southern zone the first week of the early season! Hopefully the teal will be here early this year!
I don’t care what the calendar says, September 1 is the start of fall for me! Although we have some hot days to deal with over the Holiday weekend, the extended forecast shows nights in the 50’s within the week. The crappie bite has been good at Reelfoot despite the hot days, and Billy Blakely from BlueBank told me today that he’s been catching good fish, and that although the heat pushed the fish deeper and made the bite lighter, the crappie are still hungry!
I haven’t been able to get a solid report from Kentucky Lake, because my number one source of information, Rich Bay of Kick’n Bass Guide Service, has been laid up in the hospital with a swollen leg! Fortunately he’s on his way home today and will be back on the water within the week! Get well soon buddy!
“Slabber” Dave Maddox and Jeff Riddle, representing Reelfoot Lake and Wappapello Lake, finished the “regular season” of the CrappieMaster’s tournament trail in second place in the points standing after a good finish at Truman this past weekend. It’s hard to express to folks that don’t fish against the best in the country in this trail how impressive that is, but these two guys are amazing fishermen and had a heck of a year.
Congratulations to them and I hope they put up another great showing at Grenada Lake at the National Championship!
That's the last page. The free form Cable chain stitch is an attempt to imitate the end papers in very old hard bound books which are marbled.
On to making more fiber books. The Take a Stitch Tuesday samples will be made into a sampler book as well. I need to start assembling the pages but there will be no extra embellishments like sugar beads along the edges of pages (what got into me to do that I wonder!).
There's The Bead Journal Project for 2010 which I shall join. Last year I had already committed to Take a Stitch Tuesday on Stitchin fingers.
There's a discussion on at the Fiber book group at Stitchin Fingers about a fiber book page swap. That could be interesting. A book compiled on a particular theme, with pages contributed by different people in the group. I think I must participate.

That is beautiful! I'm planning to make one, although not quite as beautiful and detailed, for my grandchild to use at church. I love fabric books. Thanks for the inspiration. You are so talented.
That is so amazing. I am trying to make a felt book and I have yet to get started. This is giving me the boost I needed

WOW. Just amazing. Saw this on Mr. X Stitch and had to take a deeper look. This is an incredible work of art!
This is a beautiful book. I admire your perseverance in making all the stitch samples. What a great idea to turn your stitcheries into a book. A great way to remember them all.
I am SO inspired and impressed by your fiber book. What a unique and beautiful way to capture the beauty of the art form. You did such a beautiful job, I think I might try one! And, no, you did not go overboard on the beads! You used the perfectly perfect amount!
That is truly spectacular. Would love to actually see it and will do some day. Little M saw it too and says you are so good at this sort of thing!
Bravo. I'm not sure which is more enticing, the process or the product. At the beginning you seemed rather tentative, but as the project grew and blossomed, you seemed more intent.
I saw your book on Craft Magazine Daily. It's amazing! I've been a group fiber art book project, which was great fun, but your book is very unique.
Saw a link to your blog on Liza Chowgule's facebook profile. I really love your work. Would love to talk to you about it one day - via email or otherwise.
It is so beautiful that it bought tears to my eyes. Please keep it carefully. It is a work of art. You are a genius.
Thank you Connie, If you are in Singapore anytime now until the end of February you can see The Take It Further fibre book which is on display at Madder Moon,16 Ann Siang Road, 01-01, Singapore, Singapore 069696.
Inspired by the fiber books you have created, I decided to try making one of my own. I just started the Take A Stitch Tuesday challenge last week (going back to #1) and liked the idea of having all my work bound in a little fabric book. I mentioned you in this post on my blog: http://madroka.blogspot.com/2013/03/take-stitch-tuesday-weeks-1-2.html
Wow! This is just wonderful! Inspires me to maybe try it! Beautiful work, and I thank you for sharing!

Asia Argento, Who Accused Harvey Weinstein of Sexual Assault, Shares Scene From Her Film Inspired by His Alleged Actions
Argento, an actress born in Rome, played the role of a glamorous thief named Beatrice in the crime drama “B. Monkey,” which was released in the U.S. in 1999. The distributor was Miramax. In a series of long and often emotional interviews, Argento told me that Weinstein assaulted her while they worked together.
At the time, Argento was twenty-one and a rising actress who had twice won the Italian equivalent of the Oscar. Argento said that, in 1997, one of Weinstein’s producers invited her to what she understood to be a party thrown by Miramax at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc, on the French Riviera. Argento felt professionally obliged to attend. When the producer led her upstairs that evening, she said, there was no party—only a hotel room, empty but for Weinstein: “I’m, like, ‘Where is the fucking party?’ ” She recalled the producer telling her, “Oh, we got here too early,” before he left her alone with Weinstein. (The producer denies bringing Argento to the room that night.) At first, Weinstein was solicitous, praising her work. Then he left the room. When he returned, he was wearing a bathrobe and holding a bottle of lotion. “He asks me to give a massage. I was, like, ‘Look, man, I am no fucking fool,’ ” Argento said. “But, looking back, I am a fucking fool. And I am still trying to come to grips with what happened.”
Argento said that, after she reluctantly agreed to give Weinstein a massage, he pulled her skirt up, forced her legs apart, and performed oral sex on her as she repeatedly told him to stop. Weinstein “terrified me, and he was so big,” she said. “It wouldn’t stop. It was a nightmare.”
At some point, Argento said, she stopped saying no and feigned enjoyment, because she thought it was the only way the assault would end. “I was not willing,” she told me. “I said, ‘No, no, no.’ . . . It’s twisted. A big fat man wanting to eat you. It’s a scary fairy tale.” Argento, who insisted that she wanted to tell her story in all its complexity, said that she didn’t physically fight him off, something that has prompted years of guilt.
“The thing with being a victim is I felt responsible,” she said. “Because, if I were a strong woman, I would have kicked him in the balls and run away. But I didn’t. And so I felt responsible.” She described the incident as a “horrible trauma.” Decades later, she said, oral sex is still ruined for her. “I’ve been damaged,” she told me. “Just talking to you about it, my whole body is shaking.”
Argento recalled sitting on the bed after the incident, her clothes “in shambles,” her makeup smeared. She said that she told Weinstein, “I am not a whore,” and that he began laughing. He said he’d put the phrase on a T-shirt. Afterward, Argento said, “He kept contacting me.” For a few months, Weinstein seemed obsessed, offering her expensive gifts.
What complicates the story, Argento readily allowed, is that she eventually yielded to Weinstein’s further advances and even grew close to him. Weinstein dined with her, and introduced her to his mother. Argento told me, “He made it sound like he was my friend and he really appreciated me.” She said that she had consensual sexual relations with him multiple times over the course of the next five years, though she described the encounters as one-sided and “onanistic.” The first occasion, several months after the alleged assault, came before the release of “B. Monkey.” “I felt I had to,” she said. “Because I had the movie coming out and I didn’t want to anger him.” She believed that Weinstein would ruin her career if she didn’t comply. Years later, when she was a single mother dealing with childcare, Weinstein offered to pay for a nanny. She said that she felt “obliged” to submit to his sexual advances.
Argento said that she knew this contact would be used to attack the credibility of her allegation. In part, she said, the initial assault made her feel overpowered each time she encountered Weinstein, even years later. “Just his body, his presence, his face, bring me back to the little girl that I was when I was twenty-one,” she told me. “When I see him, it makes me feel little and stupid and weak.” She broke down as she struggled to explain. “After the rape, he won,” she said.
In 2000, Argento released “Scarlet Diva,” a movie that she wrote and directed. In the film, a heavyset producer corners the character of Anna, who is played by Argento, in a hotel room, asks her for a massage, and tries to assault her. After the movie came out, women began approaching Argento, saying that they recognized Weinstein’s behavior in the portrayal. “People would ask me about him because of the scene in the movie,” she said. Some recounted similar details to her: meetings and professional events moved to hotel rooms, bathrobes and massage requests, and, in one other case, forced oral sex.
Weinstein, according to Argento, saw the film after it was released in the U.S., and apparently recognized himself. “Ha, ha, very funny,” Argento remembered him saying to her. But he also said that he was “sorry for whatever happened.” The movie’s most significant departure from the real-life incident, Argento told me, was how the hotel-room scene ended. “In the movie I wrote,” she said, “I ran away.”
In an assessment of damages for a taking by eminent domain, for a street widening, of a strip of a lawn of residential property which, near the street, sloped down abruptly several feet to the street level, where there was evidence that the lawn adjacent to the strip taken had become eroded after the widening and the loam had washed down, exposing gravel upon which grass would not grow, expert testimony to show the method and expense of a reasonably necessary and economical adaptation of the premises to the situation left by the taking, including the construction of a retaining wall, should have been admitted as bearing on the diminution in value caused by the taking.
George Fingold, Attorney General, & Floyd H. Gilbert, Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth, submitted a brief.
RONAN, J. This is a petition by a husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety, for the assessment of damages for a taking made of a part of their premises in December, 1953, in widening the corner of Brook Road and Adams Street in Milton. The jury returned a verdict of $1,250. The case is here on exceptions of the petitioners to the rulings of the trial judge in excluding evidence.
The house, a ten room structure designed for a doctor's office and a dwelling, is constructed of brick for the first story and of wood for the remaining one and one half stories. The house fronts on Brook Road. It is set back from both public ways. A lawn runs practically level from the house to within a foot or two of Brook Road and the corner where it slopes abruptly down about four feet to the level of the road. The property as shown by the photographs is attractively located. Besides the house the premises consist of a garage and land all having an assessed valuation of $10,100. There also was evidence that before the taking the premises were worth $26,500 and afterward $21,500.
The land taken comprised two hundred ninety square feet and was triangular in form, the base of this triangle running at a right angle to Brook Road into the lawn for nineteen feet, then the hypotenuse along Brook Road for thirty-six feet, and the third bound about thirty-one feet to the inner point of the base. The lawn had become eroded where it was adjacent to the taking. The top layer of loam had washed down exposing the under layer of gravel upon which grass would not grow.
The petitioners called one Hennessy whose qualifications as a civil engineer and a landscape contractor were undisputed. He testified that the bank is now steeper than appears in the photographs, the soil is eroded, the loam has been washed down and the subsoil exposed, and there is no growing grass on the area. He was not permitted to give
his opinion as to what would be reasonably necessary to restore the property to approximately its appearance before the taking. The judge observed that if the property was left in "a mess" the jury had taken a view, that there was no embankment wall before the taking, that there was no place for a landscape architect in a land damage case, and that this was the usual case where the damages were the difference in value before and after the taking. The petitioners offered to prove "that the area in the petitioners' property adjacent to the point taken and as left by the actual construction under the taking was such that the land would not bear vegetation of any kind; would constantly erode and gradually work back toward the petitioners' house; that to correct this condition it would be necessary to construct a retaining wall approximately four feet high which would prevent any further erosion; that the restoration would further involve the continuance of this wall across the front of the petitioners' property a distance of one hundred ten feet; that in connection with this wall considerable landscaping in the area adjacent to the wall would be necessary and that the fair cost of these items would be about $4,000."
If the evidence had been admitted, the jury could have disregarded it or they could have accepted the whole or any part of it in determining whether it was reasonably necessary and an economical method to make such a repair in adapting the premises to the new condition created by the taking. The evidence was competent as bearing upon the diminution in value caused by the taking and as corroborative of other testimony upon that issue. Hartshorn v. County of Worcester, 113 Mass. 111 , 114.

Our New Nursery is now open, we would like to thank all our parents and families for there patience, and especialy there support, which has been tremendous.
Our new location is a million times better than our last home, we have lots of open space for the kids to play and explore, on street parking in abundance, and very easy safe access.
Because of the space and location, we are planning to expand the services we provide, and will be announcing our exciting new programme, within the next few days.
We could not have built the new nursery without Dojo Community Project's support, however there are some special and unique people who gave their time, resources and support to the project without reservation, without there individual contributions none of this would of happened, we would like to give them a huge Thank You.
Catalyst for the whole project was Paul & Sammy at DARE Professional Audio, from the outset they were supported by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, who handled the Architectural work, Planning Application and Building Regulations throughout, keeping us on track - architect David Mackay, the support by everyone at LDS has been a revelation for a company of their stature, and a genuine inspiration.
Various trade people gave time to the project, either at reduced rates or free, Milan Ilic was always on hand to advise, and Kevin Roberts made sure that things will stay dry from a roofing point of view. Dave “The Digger” Grenfell did exactly that and Mark Mead made sure we have Water and Heating, and finally John Butler – Electrician who brought us power, security and safety.
The effort put in by every individual can not be underestimated, many of which are not from the area, but have a strong belief in actually doing something to help others rather than - just talking about it, because of this - the area will certainly be a better place to live and grow up.
We at Dojo, Jellybean and the wider community will go some way to repaying these altruistic efforts, by ensuring that the centre flourishes - a shining light of what can be achieved at a grass roots level.
Jellybean Nursery was founded in 2000, located in the Soho Hill area of Handsworth Birmingham, we are a long established, small family setting with approximately 30 children at any one time, we strive to achieve the highest standards for our children, and in 2012 we received the highest Quality Assurance award in Birmingham, when we were awarded the Effective Early Learning Quality Assurance Award, our nursery has also completed an Early Years Healthy Setting Program.
We employ a caring, nurturing environment to which all children feel happy and enjoy coming to nursery.

Grown at 1700 meter above sea level, in the pristine deep forest of Yunnan province, cloudy tea is prized for its rich and special aftertaste. Yet, tea is not just a drink, it holds a prominent position in Chinese culture. There is a long history, customs and economic activity revolving around the beloved beverages. Designer Shaobin exactly understands its cultural significance and reflect that on his design. On both sets of packaging, unfolding the scroll will reveal the poetic landscapes illustrations offset printed on white and yellow kraft paper. The paper strings holding the packaging together adds a sense of human touch to the design.

I am feeling decidedly sub-par today. The head cold that started as a scratchy throat on Sunday evening has now fully developed. I didn't sleep much last night because my congestion made it hard to find a comfortable position that allowed me to breathe. Ugh.
On the plus side. . . . my right piriformis muscle is doing much better. I swam laps on Sunday for exercise because I am still avoiding walking, jogging, and the elliptical trainer. I drove to Tucson and back yesterday for a deposition--five hours sitting for the drive alone, not including the 2+ hours in the deposition--and had only an occasional mild twinge. A far cry from the red hot poker of pain I'd been having. I am optimistic that by early next week I can resume the elliptical trainer and walking (I'll probably avoid jogging because I think that caused a big part of the problem in the first place).
I have a massage scheduled for this evening. I have the usual tightness in my neck and upper back and am going to also ask the therapist to work on my right piriformis and the surrounding area. Lying on my stomach for the massage with this head congestion should be a real joy--NOT.
We did have a nice weekend. Friday night we had dinner and drinks with some friends of MM's, and that was fun. Saturday night we had dinner at my in-laws because one of my MIL's cousins and her family were in town from North Dakota. After dinner, we went to a hockey game. Sunday we did nothing except the usual household chores, but it was actually kind of nice to have anything else going on.
MM sent me a dozen red roses for Valentine's Day and also bought me a sapphire necklace. What a good husband! He was happy with the CDs I got him and didn't feel bad that his gifts to me were much more expensive. ;-)
Oh - I love sapphires! What a toughtful idea! I hope you feel better - I send your book today (finally). Sorry it took so long!

Due to the events of the last week-plus, there will now be new rules and regulations for suspensions and bans on the forum. As approved by the majority of the forum community who voted on the proposal, these new rules will be implemented immediately:
-1a.After 2 warnings, the offender gets a suspension of 5-7 days. After 3, banned permanently. If offenses are severe enough, an auto-ban might be warranted.
2. Auto-bans are given out for making spam posts, akin to the kind we saw back in 2012-2013 with WoW Gold, boner pills, and the like.
3. If you are found to have a multiple account, that multiple account will get banned, and the original account (deemed as the earliest sign up date out of the accounts) will receive a warning.
-3a. If you are making a multiple account for legitimate reasons as deemed by the Community/Community Manager (i.e. forgetting a password to an old account), no warning will be given, but activity on the old account will be monitored closely.
--3a.1. If the old account comes back into fruition (as deemed by factors including, but not limited to, last user activity) with the new account, without proper explanation, the punishment from Rule 3 will be given immediately.
Please keep these rules in mind as you converse in the forum. We like people having friendly discussion about this classic game, but please do not get too out of hand.

Strolling up and down the aisles at Target has been a little challenging the last month. Picking up cute plastic eggs or bunny shaped candy only to put them back down and walk away. You see, I'm a holiday fanatic. Growing up my Mom made holidays very special for us and Easter baskets were always one of my favorite surprises. The last couple of Easters I've made Easter baskets for Tim and his response to them was shall we say...lack luster. Don't get me wrong, he appreciated the thought but c'mon, it's kind of a kid thing. I'm just so very eager to pass on traditions that I had growing up and to mold my traditions with his and make our own for our family (and that includes the Lopez Cheeseball that I still need to work on).
He's going for work and will be gone 12 days which is the longest and farthest we've ever been from each other.
Over the weekend we found these awesome cafe lights on sale at Target! I've wanted them since we first moved in and I can't believe how lovely our patio looks now.
There are so many amazing recipes to try from Pinterest and how many people bake like that just because? Saturday we had a family BBQ and I knew exactly what I had to make!
They turned out amazing and I've had a couple of people ask for the recipe so I thought I'd share it.
Oreos (I made 1/3 of the recipe and used 18 for an 8 x 8 pan, but if you are making a full recipe you’ll need a lot more)
1) Melt together the butter, 1 pound of chocolate chips, and the unsweetened chocolate in a medium bowl over simmering water. Allow to cool slightly. In a large bowl, stir (do not beat) together the eggs, coffee granules, vanilla, and sugar. Stir the warm chocolate mixture into the egg mixture and allow to cool to room temperature.
2) In a medium bowl, sift together 1 cup of flour, the baking powder, and salt. Add to the cooled chocolate mixture. Toss the walnuts and 12 ounces of chocolate chips in a medium bowl with 1/4 cup of flour, then add them to the chocolate batter. Pour half of the batter into the prepared baking sheet. Line the Oreos up evenly on top of the batter in the pan. Cover Oreos with remaining batter.
3) Bake for 20 minutes, then rap the baking sheet against the oven shelf to force the air to escape from between the pan and the brownie dough. Bake for about 15 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. (I did not take the brownies out in the middle – I made 1/3 recipe and baked them for 23 minutes exactly and they were PERFECT!) Allow to cool thoroughly, refrigerate, and cut into 20 large squares.
Growing up we always got a dress for Easter Sunday. On a few occasions the dress came with a hat and I thought it was the greatest thing ever. It's been quite awhile since I sported a Spring-y type frock on Easter Sunday, but if I did....
Yesterdays sermon really hit home with me. I could feel emotions stirring down in the deepest part of my body and mind. I can't recall a time that's ever happened before. It felt good. I really felt like God was speaking to me and I've always wondered what that would feel like.
There is so much I cling to in hopes of controlling it all. My health, my relationships, my wants and desires..
Why is it so difficult to let go when you truly believe that He has your life planned out for you already? He had it planned before I was even born. He put me here for a reason and I have no control over that. I just need to live my life the best way I can.

At the trial of a contract action, the judge properly received and considered extrinsic evidence of the context of the agreement's execution, the established business usage of the terms employed, and the performance of the parties in order to determine the meaning of a provision in the contract that was ambiguous, not on its face but in its application to the subject matter, where such evidence did not contradict or change the terms of the agreement. [249-252]
WARNER, J. The essential facts are not in dispute; the admissibility of evidence establishing them and their relevance are contested. From 1971 to 1973 the plaintiff had been employed as director of operations at Schaefer (now Sullivan) Stadium in Foxborough, a facility leased and operated by Stadium Realty Trust (Trust), the predecessor of the defendant. From 1975 to 1978, the plaintiff was likewise employed at the Meadowlands, a New Jersey complex then consisting of a stadium and a horse racing track. His responsibilities there included the procurement of commercial advertising within the stadium and the track. The plaintiff sold advertising space for Marlboro cigarettes (Marlboro) at the Meadowlands to Philip Morris U.S.A.
(Philip Morris), after negotiating the transaction with one Vin Winer, the representative of Philip Morris charged with advertising for Marlboro in stadia throughout the United States. While working at the Meadowlands, the plaintiff sold about $800,000 of advertising space.
After a communication from the Trust in early 1976, the plaintiff began negotiating with Winer for Marlboro advertisements at Schaefer Stadium. The plaintiff also had prepared a leasing representation agreement (Agreement) and submitted it to the Trust. The Trust returned the proposed Agreement to the plaintiff with the addition of a paragraph numbered 4 (which will be discussed below); the plaintiff executed the Agreement. Thereafter, on April 9, 1976, the plaintiff met with the trustees of the Trust and presented a proposal, including blueprints and schematics, for Marlboro advertising within Schaefer Stadium. The trustees accepted the proposal and subsequently entered into a contract with Philip Morris having essentially the terms and conditions proposed by the plaintiff; the advertising was put in place. After the plaintiff made his proposal at the April 9th meeting, the managing trustee signed the Agreement on behalf of the Trust.
The Agreement contained the following relevant provisions: (1) The plaintiff was retained as a nonexclusive representative to solicit leases for space for commercial advertising "in or about" Schaefer Stadium. (2) For the initial term of each such lease obtained by the plaintiff, he would be paid a commission of fifteen percent of rental payments received and for extensions or subsequent leases, the commission would be ten percent. (3) Either party could terminate the Agreement (otherwise selfextending) on thirty days' written notice prior to the expiration of a one-year term. The core of the dispute in this case lies in paragraph 4, which, as we have said, was added by the Trust to the proposed Agreement submitted by the plaintiff. That paragraph provides:
"Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Keating shall not be entitled to commissions on account of rentals received by the Trust from any business which
now leases, or has in the past leased, space at the Stadium for commercial advertising use or which has in the past purchased advertising space or time from any lessee of the Trust", (emphasis supplied).
The plaintiff was paid the proper commissions under the Agreement from 1976 through 1981. In late 1981, the defendant succeeded the Trust and assumed all the latter's rights and obligations under the Agreement. On March 6, 1982, the defendant gave the plaintiff timely notice of termination of the Agreement. The plaintiff's attorney responded on March 17, 1982, by acknowledging the propriety of the termination but insisting that the plaintiff would be entitled to future commissions under the terms of the Agreement so long as Philip Morris continued to display advertisements in and around Schaefer Stadium. On August 7, 1982, Charles W. Sullivan, president of the defendant, replied that the plaintiff would not be entitled to such commissions, by virtue of the terms of paragraph 4 of the Agreement, as Philip Morris, before the Agreement, had purchased advertising space in the team program from the New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., a sublessee of the Trust. Prior to April 9, 1976 (the date of the Agreement), the Patriots had engaged National Football League Properties, Inc., as its agent to sell advertising in PRO!, a football game program. There had been a full page advertisement for Marlboro in the August 15, 1971, program, the date of the first game played by the Patriots at Schaefer Stadium, and similar advertising in subsequent issues.
In November of 1982, the defendant entered into a new lease arrangement (ongoing at the time of trial) with Philip Morris for in-stadium advertising of Marlboro at the rate of $150,000 per year. The plaintiff has received no commissions under the Agreement since 1981. [Note 1]
The plaintiff's amended complaint sought damages for breach of contract and under G. L. c. 93A, Section 11, and a declaration (G. L. c. 231A, Section 1) that the defendant had a duty to pay the plaintiff a ten percent commission on rental payments under the 1982 lease for Marlboro advertising. The defendant counterclaimed for the commissions paid from 1976 through 1981. After a jury-waived hearing in the Superior Court, a judge made findings of fact and rulings of law, and a judgment was entered (1) dismissing the defendant's counterclaim, (2) awarding contract damages ($60,000) for commissions under the terms of the Agreement on the rental payments under the 1982 lease, [Note 2] and (3) declaring that the plaintiff is entitled under the Agreement to ten percent commissions on the 1982 lease payments and on payments pursuant to any extended or subsequent lease with Philip Morris. The defendant appealed.
On appeal the defendant argues, as it did at trial, that it was error for the judge to receive and consider extrinsic evidence as to the meaning of the Agreement, particularly the provisions of paragraph 4. This is so, the defendant contends, because the relevant language of the Agreement is clear and unambiguous; indeed, the parties stipulated (and the judge by remark at trial seemed to agree) to that conclusion. There was no error.
The judge's findings and rulings make clear that he construed the disputed language of paragraph 4 of the Agreement considering the context in which the Agreement was executed, the established business usage of terms employed and the performance of the parties. The judge did not stray from the application of correct legal principles.
Contrary to the defendant's argument, the language of a contract need not be ambiguous on its face in order that extrinsic evidence may be admitted. "When the written agreement, as applied to the subject matter, is in any respect uncertain or equivocal in meaning, all the circumstances of the parties leading to its execution may be shown for the purpose of elucidating, but not of contradicting or changing its terms. . . . Expressions
in our cases to the effect that evidence of circumstances can be admitted only after an ambiguity has been found on the face of the written instrument have reference to evidence offered to contradict the written terms" (citations omitted). Robert Indus., Inc. v. Spence, 362 Mass. 751, 753-754 (1973). See Computer Syss. of America, Inc. v. Western Reserve Life Assur. Co., 19 Mass. App. Ct. 430, 434 n.5 (1985); 3 Corbin, Contracts Section 572B (1960 & Supp. 1971); Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 212(1) and comment b, and Section 214 (1981). "[T]he facts and circumstances of the transaction, including the situation and relations of the parties, [may be admitted] for the purpose of applying the terms of the written contract to the subject matter and removing and explaining any uncertainty or ambiguity which arose from such application." Robert Indus., Inc. v. Spence, supra at 753. See Rosen v. A-H, Inc., 17 Mass. App. Ct. 126, 128-129 (1983). [Note 3]
We think that the controlling language of paragraph 4 of the Agreement -- "any business . . . which has in the past purchased advertising space or time from any lessee of the Trust" -- is, when applied to the subject matter of the Agreement, ambiguous. The language fails to give clear indication whether the exclusion of commissions related only to businesses which had purchased in-stadium advertising space or time at Schaefer Stadium prior to the date of the Agreement or whether the exclusion also applied to businesses which had purchased print media advertising. The judge properly resolved that ambiguity by resort to extrinsic evidence.
The evidence and fair inferences therefrom support the following. The Trust was seeking commercial in-stadium advertising for Schaefer Stadium. The plaintiff had experience in the specialized field in which few were engaged and had successfully attracted Philip Morris to the Meadowlands. It was
only after the trustees of the Trust had heard and accepted the plaintiff's detailed proposal for in-stadium Marlboro advertising that the trustees signed the Agreement. Marlboro advertisements had regularly appeared in PRO!. The Agreement had been prepared on behalf of the plaintiff and its provisions leave no doubt that the plaintiff's undertaking was only to secure commercial in-stadium advertising. Paragraph 4 of the Agreement had been drafted on behalf of the Trust. See Merrimack Valley Natl. Bank v. Baird, 372 Mass. 721, 724 (1977) ("As a general rule, a writing is construed against the author of the doubtful language . . . if the circumstances surrounding its use and the ordinary meaning of the words do not indicate the intended meaning of the language" [citations omitted]). A fair inference may be drawn that that paragraph also deals exclusively with in-stadium advertising.
There was uncontroverted testimony that established business usage of the term "space" advertising referred to advertising appearing on signs in the stadium and the term "time" advertising referred to advertising purchased by seconds or minutes on a message board (a message board was in place at Schaefer Stadium when the Agreement was executed). Neither term encompassed advertisements appearing in print media.
The judge could properly conclude from a reading of the entire Agreement, the circumstances attending its execution and the established business usage of terms that it was more probable than not that the intent of the parties, as expressed in paragraph 4, was to exclude commissions to the plaintiff only in the case of businesses which had leased or purchased in-stadium commercial advertising space or time at Schaefer Stadium prior to the date of the Agreement.
Any lingering doubt as to the proper construction of paragraph 4 is dispelled by consideration of the performance of the parties to the Agreement. "`There is no surer way to find out what parties meant, than to see what they have done.'" Martino v. First Natl. Bank, 361 Mass. 325, 332 (1972), quoting from Pittsfield & North Adams R.R. v. Boston & Albany R.R., 260 Mass. 390, 398 (1927). "To enable us to understand the subject matter of the agreement, to the extent it is doubtful or ambiguous, we resort to the conduct of the parties to determine `the
meaning that they themselves put upon any doubtful or ambiguous terms . . ..'" Lembo v. Waters, 1 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 233 (1973), quoting from Rizzo v. Cunningham, 303 Mass. 16, 21 (1939). See C.K. Smith & Co. v. Charest, 348 Mass. 314, 319 (1965); Restatement (Second) of Contracts Section 202(4) (1981). Here, commissions were paid by the Trust without reservation under the terms of the Agreement. It was only after the defendant assumed the rights and obligations of the Trust, and about the time (the summer of 1982), according to the testimony of the defendant's president, Charles W. Sullivan, that Sullivan was negotiating with Philip Morris for a new advertising arrangement for Marlboro, that there was asserted by Sullivan a sudden change in the interpretation of paragraph 4.
Finally, the construction which the judge adopted, and which we approve, "is the one which appears to be in accord with justice and common sense and the probable intention of the parties. It [interprets the Agreement] as a business transaction entered into by practical men to accomplish an honest and straightforward end. . . . [It recognizes that] [e]very contract implies good faith and fair dealing between the parties to it" (citations omitted). Clark v. State St. Trust Co., 270 Mass. 140, 153 (1930). See Shane v. Winter Hill Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn., 397 Mass. 479, 483 (1986), and cases cited; Fay, Spofford & Thorndike, Inc. v. Massachusetts Port Authy., 7 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 344 (1979).
[Note 1] It is undisputed that, if the plaintiff was entitled to commissions on payments under the original arrangement for Marlboro advertising, he is entitled to renewal commissions on payments under the 1982 lease.
[Note 3] The parties' stipulation and the judge's apparent acquiescence that the relevant language of the Agreement is clear and unambiguous are of no significance as the parties "appear to have agreed that the [Agreement] was not ambiguous only because each felt that it had a different clear meaning."

Earlier this summer, I drove down to the Southeast Linux Fest in Spartanburg, South Carolina. One of the talks that stood out to me was given by Heather Holl, bioinformaticist and Slackware Linux team member. She talked about the open source tools she uses most in her work in equine genomics. I was especially impressed at how she used standard, open source Linux command-line tools to get her job done.
A national patient ID is one of the more taboo subjects in United States law. As one writer for the College of American Pathologists reports, “In some federal government offices, all one has to do to stop a conversation cold is mention a national patient identifier. That’s how adamantly Congress, in a 1998 bill, outlawed any plans for, consideration of, and even research on a national system of assigning patient ID numbers.”
In fact, no government money can be spent even investigating the possibility of a national patient identifier, effectively making the law difficult to reverse without a large push from private industry.
If it were created, a national patient identifier would provide a unique number to identify an individual in health systems across the United States. It could be used to pull or push health data for a patient across the country on-demand without complication or fuss.
Without a national patient identifier, industries face the challenge of mapping patients in their internal systems to patients in systems outside of their operating networks. Typically, this involves sending patient names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and other identifying data across secure channels to ensure that the systems really are talking about the same person. Mistakes and match-refusals are common. Spelling mistakes and formatting inconsistencies while entering data can prevent systems from recognizing somebody as the same person (“Bob” vs “Robert,” or “Ft. Worth” vs “Fort Worth”). Policy differences also can prevent successful matching. Some health vendors will outright refuse, by policy, to make a patient correlation without having been sent the social security number of a patient. Other vendors will refuse to ever send a social security number over the Internet, even if the channel is secure. Systems like this will never be able to communicate with such limiting policies in place.
A national patient identifier cuts through all of this red tape. It replaces complex methods of patient matching that may or may not be successful, and reduces the likelihood of confusing people with similar information for one another. Overall, both the quantity and quality of information that can be gathered under a unique identifier is greater (and cheaper!) than a haphazard industry approach trying many different solutions.
Why is it important to enable systems to “match” patients? Imagine you’re lying unconscious in an emergency room, and the doctor can’t find a record to indicate your penicillin allergy. While the idea of a ER physician being able to conduct an instant search across the globe to find your records is itself still largely theoretical, realizing that theory is much, much more difficult without a simple way to identify patients.
The current government policy feels contradictory. On one hand, government initiatives such as the Nationwide Health Information Network (and implementation in CONNECT) suggest that moving health information into the electronic space, to be readily accessible by consumers of health data, is a national priority. On the other hand, policies preventing investigation into a national patient identifier stifle the ease of rolling out such systems nationwide and limit their accuracy.
Privacy is a major concern with a national patient identifier; however, both the concept of uniquely identifying numbers associated with people as well as the notions of ‘security breach’ are no different with a national patient identifier than with the systems that are currently in place. The information that could be gained from learning the national patient identifier would be little different from the information gained under the current approach of using names, social security numbers, and addresses. Once a person has this information, and somehow gains access to the health network, it will not matter if they have the NPI number or the separate bits of information. Also, the concept of a unique identifier exists nationally from birth in the US in the form of a social security number, and from the point of ID issuance at the state level. It is a little known fact that many states create drivers license numbers based off of the full name and date of birth of an individual. Maryland is one of those states, and based upon that number alone, anybody can tell who you are! You can try it yourself here. The real security is in maintaining the network and reducing fraud.
While in no way would the implementation of a national patient identifier be easy, it should at least be one of the possibilities that can be considered at the national level. It is in the interest of private industry to speak up and express their concern, since current government policy forbids any possible action internally.
The summer CONNECT code-a-thon wrapped up today. This two-day event brings together health IT leaders to share feedback and write code for CONNECT, the open-source software solution that supports health information exchange. CONNECT implements the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) standards to ensure the compatibility of secure health information exchange throughout the country. The CONNECT solution is used by state and regional health information exchange organizations; by private companies, practices, hospitals, and collaboratives; and in federal agency health information exchange initiatives, including those by the Department of Defense, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
As members of the CONNECT development team, we were happy to meet the community of CONNECT users and have a chance to hear first-hand how they use CONNECT, what improvements and new features they’d like to see, and how health information exchange fits in with their organizations’ missions. The CONNECT community is passionate and committed – more than 180 people attended this code-a-thon. Here are a couple of the topics the community discussed:
Understanding how organizations use CONNECT. Given that CONNECT enables standards-based, secure exchange of health information, the code-a-thon included participants who use CONNECT to support their own missions. Dr. Louis Rubenson from the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) participated in a panel of federal partners who shared how they use CONNECT today and what they'd like to be able to use CONNECT for in the future. NDMS assists in the state and local response to disasters. They use CONNECT to enable patient information to follow a patient throughout the disaster response, from emergency treatment centers to evacuation. Dr. Rubenson identified a need for a slimmed down version of CONNECT, able to operate efficiently over phone lines in a resource constrained environment, and encouraged the community to make it happen. In another code-a-thon session, Calvin Beebe from the Mayo Clinic Southeast Minnesota Beacon Community, which helps improve outcomes for adults with diabetes and children with asthma, shared how his organization uses CONNECT. Like many of the participants, he expressed a desire to see an increased focus on performance and scalability as CONNECT continues to mature. This was discussed in several other sessions, in fact....
Performance and scalability. This topic was one of the more active discussion groups during the code-a-thon, as many of the participants have started deploying CONNECT to their production servers. We see this is great news in the evolution of a product and the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) – so many exchanges are occurring that there’s an increased focus on performance and scalability. During one of the break out sessions, several ideas were thrown around to help CONNECT scale to handle the expected onslaught of requests as the NwHIN continues to grow. The easiest and probably the most obvious answer that one can apply to a system is to improve the hardware the gateway is installed on. CONNECT uses a significant amount of computing resources to handle the security checks and message orchestration, and it should be deployed on fairly strong hardware, but like any app, its performance can obviously be improved by beefing up the hardware to exceed minimum requirements. An out-of-the-box proposal was the idea of fronting a CONNECT server with a SSL accelerator and have that box handle the processor intensive SSL transactions, and allow the underlying layers underneath the accelerator could be switched to use only unsecured web services to communicate among components. Another approach that was talked about in detail is to simply load balance the workload to multiple instances of CONNECT by having a software or hardware switch in front of the server farm. Aside from optimizing resource allocation, this has the side benefit of increasing the reliability of the system. For a more software-oriented solution, the group agreed that the biggest performance improvement is to upgrade to the latest CONNECT release – recent refactoring improved the software’s performance. ONC and the FHA have requested that the CONNECT team focus on improving both scalability and performance, so the next scheduled releases will carry additional improvements.
Open source strategy. CONNECT is aiming to become one of the first truly open-source, community-driven products initially developed by the government. This is no small task, as the government is typically big on control and not so fond of unexpected changes. The good folks at Red Hat gave a fantastic talk about a vision for CONNECT's future that sparked discussion on community rights vs. control over a product. Especially when the product is in the health IT space, knowing that good people are working on the code is important. However, engaging the community in an open source product necessitates allowance for their contributions in any form. How do you resolve these differences? We talked at length about the distinctions, and consensus began to circle around the idea of having a group of vetted, core contributors (who are more than the contracted development team) with permissions to review and commit code, leaving all other registered users with the ability to submit issues, contribute code, attach files to issues, and comment where they feel they can contribute. The final path to a true open-source has yet to be finalized, but the discussion is open for community contributions!!!
The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory was a fabulous setting for the dynamic event, and we were inspired and challenged by those that we met. Please comment here if you have thoughts or other insights about the code-a-thon, CONNECT, and health information exchange in general.

Recently here on this blog, we discussed the issue of the growing racial divide in personalized medicine – and how it has the potential to leave non-whites behind as we move into a promising new age in medicine.
Since then, on a positive note, 23andMe has launched an initiative, called Roots Into the Future, giving away their service for free to 10,000 self-identified African-Americans. It’s a step in the right direction. Though with over 100,000 people already in their database, that’s still only 10% of their total. Of course there are already African-Americans in their customer base, but the fact that they feel the need to offer this initiative is indicative of the industry-wide divide and the general need for more diverse DNA in the study pool.
This week, the Washington Post published an article that adds yet another wrinkle. Federal patent examiners at the US Patent and Trademark office have been rejecting patents for molecular diagnostics (a mainstay of personalized medicine) that have not been validated across a variety of racial and ethnic groups. This is controversial partly because the ideas of “race” and “ethnicity” are not hard genetic concepts – a better breakdown would be along the lines of haplogroups, but even here we have the sticky problem of ancestry admixture and cultural identification. For instance, Latinos, a very large and diverse group, can come from a range of admixed ancestries, spanning Europe, Africa and native American haplogroups. The label “Latino” is not in and of itself particularly meaningful or specific enough when it comes to genetic markers. While the USPTO’s intentions are good (to make sure we don’t think that tests derived from genetic information heavily skewed to one population are necessarily valid for everyone) there is clearly more work to be done before we can claim to judge these tests fairly. And on the flipside, we’re going to need more initiatives like 23andMe’s to make sure the database we’re working from isn’t skewed in the first place.
It is important to note too that getting non-whites to participate in DNA testing is not always as simple as it sounds, especially outside of the developed world. The US Government’s use of DNA spying in the Osama Bin Laden case and some famously bungled efforts to work with the DNA of native populations have sown mistrust and bad blood that will be difficult to clear. But if we’re to bring the promise of personalized therapy to everyone, we will need to find ways to move past these differences and establish ethical guidelines that strike a balance between being open for constructive science while being respectful of heritage and tradition. We'll also need to get the regulators up to speed on what does and doesn't constitute race and ethnicity in a genomic world.
Chevrolet Aveo of the first generation was sold in many countries of the world under different names, and enjoyed immense popularity not only because of the low price. Modest and in many ways a serene and calm Aveo suddenly burst into the top ten most sold cars in the world. And as experience of exploitation has shown, such popularity is deserved as the car has all the necessary parameters, a small body in size, but at the same time a fairly spacious interior, and in the complete set has everything you need, the car goes well and has a sane fuel consumption.
Chevrolet Aveo is presented in two modifications hatchback and sedan. The first restyled body sedan occurred in 2006, and the hatchback was modernized in 2008. In 2011, the public presented the third generation of the Aveo model. As the experience of operation has shown, the paint and varnish coating of this car, compared to its competitors, keeps the impact of small stones quite well, the body elements are made of sufficiently thin metal and are poorly supplied to recovery, despite this, corrosion on it is rare. When choosing a Chevrolet Aveo with a mileage first, pay attention to the rear wheel arches, and the wings in the area of ​​the rear doors, here the metal begins to bloom first.
The car is equipped with one of three types of petrol engines of 1.2 (72 hp), 1.4 (94 hp) liters, there is less often a 1.6 liter engine (106 hp). The engine 1.4 that was installed on this car in 2008-2009 suffers from one factory sore, this is a breakdown of the camshaft gear, and if this happens, you will have to part with a fairly large sum of money. After 2009, the manufacturer eliminated this problem. Prior to restyling, engine 1.4 was 8 valve, and after it was converted to a 16 valve, as a result, the engine became quite demanding on the quality of fuel. If you fill the car with low octane gasoline, the valves can stick, as a result of this, the dynamics of acceleration is significantly reduced, and the engine is trodden on the idle ones. If, in the course of time, you notice that the motor has become noisier in operation, and its sound has become more like a diesel, then it is worthwhile to immediately contact the service, as the next step will be the failure of one of the cylinders. Machines with an engine 1.2 are quite numerous in the secondary market, initially this power unit was eight valves, and after 2008 became 16 valve and added 10 horsepower. Also, after restyling, there have also been pleasant changes in terms of reliability. Timing belt timing belt gave way to the chain, almost eternal in operation, thanks to this you can not think about replacing the timing drive to 250 - 300 thousand kilometers. On this type of engine you need to change butter every 10,000 km, motor 1.2 does not like rare replacements, and poor quality of oil. For all types of Chevrolet Aveo engines, prolonged warming in winter is characteristic, especially for motor 1.2, the main reason for this feature lies in a thermostat that lives up to 50,000 kilometers. On the pre-styling versions of the Aveo, due to the structural feature of attaching the fan to the radiator, very often a radiator breakdown occurs and a coolant leakage occurs.
On the mechanical gearboxes, many Chevrolet Aveo have problems with switching from the first to the second gear, and for mechanics, for reasons that have not been clarified, the gear oil in the box may be insufficient to check its level even before buying a used car. On vehicles with manual transmission, you can hear the ringing coming from the box area while driving, the reason for this sound is the gear shift mechanism, this sound is not a break, but a feature. Also, the release bearing, the wheel drive shafts and the shafts of the mechanical gearbox can be damaged. The clutch can deliver trouble early enough up to 100,000 km, so the cost of replacement is not great (you can keep within 100-150 USD). The ACPP with the weakest engine 1.2 is not installed and meets only in combination with the engines 1.4 and 1.6. The automatic transmission proved to be very good, only the solenoid is considered to be the weak point of the automatic transmission, because of which the box can hang in the "P" -parking position, otherwise the machine proved to be very reliable.
All without exception Chevrolet Aveo suffer from knocking and creaking in the suspension and steering mechanism, which absolutely all owners of cars are facing. Everything can be knocked in the suspension (brake suspension, suspension springs, shock absorbers, stabilizer bushings) while the sounding elements can be completely in good order. If the owners of this car are irritated by the constant foreign sounds of the suspension, then the problem is solved by replacing the native silentblocks of the levers with Opel or Ford.
The first, as well as on many cars fail the stabilizer struts, this happens with a run of 40-50 thousand km,
The rear suspension is almost eternal, except for the silentblock steel, which breaks down at 30-40 thousand kilometers of run. One of the weakest parts of the braking system is the ABS sensor, they fail, without any signals, and early enough with a run of 50,000 km. The rear pads are often not worn out, but are stratified and it would seem that they should not be changed by the run, but nevertheless they have to be changed along with the front ones because they lose their properties. The materials for finishing the Chevrolet Aveo are frankly budgetary, so there are a lot of crickets . The source of noise in the cabin is often the fan blower blowing system, also often the owners in their reviews complain about electrical equipment.
Chevrolet Aveo has a fairly modest price tag at the level of domestic cars 4000-8000 cu, and for this money the ideal car should not wait.If you are or have owned this car brand, please share your experience, indicating the strengths and weaknesses of the car. Perhaps your feedback will help others to choose the right one choose used car.
Personal loan apply malaysia purpose of shorter duration loans is to provide the borrower temporary financial relief. Such loans are not a long-term financial solution. Persons facing serious financial difficulties should consider other alternatives or should seek out professional financial advice. This website is not an offer to lend. icashloans.
…There are a number of organisations that will make you a verbal offer, but then insist you pay an inflated price for their surveyors valuation (anywhere from £200 £600) before theyll put an offer in writing.
They will usually phrase it as a refundable payment for valuation which sounds fine its refundable after all. However, because the money is only personal loan apply malaysia if you accept their offerthis system is wide open to abuse. Companies can pocket a quick £200 by making you a strong verbal offer and then lowering it after youve paid for the valuation. Do that a couple of times a day and you have a business that doesnt even need to buy any property to be profitable.
We highly recommend you steer clear of any home buying service that asks for an upfront payment of any kind.
As it turns out, default doesnt spell the end of paying the personal loan apply malaysia, or of taking out another payday loan: 66 percent of borrowers who defaulted still wound up repaying their entire debt. Nearly two in five (39 percent) of people who defaulted borrowed again later on. So even though a default is financially stressful for the borrower -- You dont have enough money to pay it back on your actual payday, Montezemolo says -- a default doesnt appear to pose as much risk to the lender.
Indeed, CFPB Director Richard Cordray, at field hearing last Thursday in Richmond, Virginia, said that many lenders rely on their "ability to collect" payments rather than on the customers' ability to repay loans, according to the bureau's research.
Looking at the repayment rate among defaulted borrowers in North Dakota, Montezemolo says, I would suspect it has to do with debt collection activities, not your ability to repay the loans. The CFPB, for example, levied a 10 million enforcement action last year against the large payday lender Personal loan apply malaysia Cash Express, citing, in part, illegal debt collection tactics -- including harassment and false threats of lawsuits or criminal prosecution -- to pressure overdue borrowers into taking out additional loans they could not afford.
" Overdrafts from borrowers bank accounts also insulate lenders from defaults, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. Using a separate dataset of 52 payday borrowers, the study found that 33 percent experienced an overdraft on the same day they made a payday loan payment.
Its what the researchers call an invisible default," since it never shows up on unsecured personal loans with no bank account payday lenders books.

Various studies have shown that only about 30% of the American workforce is engaged in their work. That means that many of us have lost our passion for what we do (if we ever had it in the first place). We lost our sense of accomplishment from our careers. And we often feel stagnant.
If you want to enjoy your work and have passion for what you do, no one is going to hand you your dream job. You need to make yourself the professional who deserves the big promotion. You need to gain the skills and know-how necessary for success. You need to take your career into your own hands by focusing on your personal development.
This is easier said than done. With all the demands of modern life, it can feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day for the work, family, and personal tasks already on your plate. How can you expect to make time for personal development? Where would you even begin?
Professionally administered assessments can help you get a clear, unbiased sense of your personal strengths, areas of weaknesses, and your passions and values. By better understanding what makes you tick and what has the potential to hold you back, you can take active steps toward targeted change that supports your work and life goals more efficiently and effectively.
Personal assessments are sometime just seen as a snapshot of who are you but in fact, they are powerful tools for change. They provide a metaphorical map of where you are in your career and where you could go with the right steps. They are much more effective than self-assessment, because we often see ourselves through rose-colored glasses or maybe we are much harder on ourselves than we really should be. We can also be ill-equipped to understand not just what we value but why we value it and how we can incorporate the things that are most important to us into our work lives.
With your personal assessment “map” in hand, you can start to choose your direction. You can figure out where to focus your attention, what goals to set first, and how to make the necessary changes to get from the job you have to the job you really want. It all starts with you.

It has been a while since we have had an update from the LEGO build at Durham Cathedral! This weekend the build is going mobile and will be taking part in the Northumbrian Brick Show at Bede Tower, Sunderland on Saturday 31 May from 10am – 4pm!
LEGO Batman returns this Autumn with a third installment in the series – LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham and Warner Bros. have released a teaser trailer for the forthcoming video game! While the official UK Facebook page of LEGO Batman has posted a few stills from the game!
The best-selling LEGO Batman videogame franchise returns in an out-of-this-world, action-packed adventure! In LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, the Caped Crusader joins forces with the super heroes of the DC Comics universe and blasts off to outer space to stop the evil Brainiac from destroying Earth. Using the power of the Lantern Rings, Brainiac shrinks worlds to add to his twisted collection of miniature cities from across the universe. Now the greatest super heroes and the most cunning villains must unite and journey to different Lantern Worlds to collect the Lantern Rings and stop Brainiac before it’s too late.
Everything is clearly not awesome for an unnamed man from Varbarg, Sweden who has been forced to sell his entire LEGO collection in a bid to save his marriage.
The disgruntled LEGO enthusiast put an ad on a local buy/sell website for his 300kg collection of LEGO worth around 75,000 kronor – approximately £11,500. With an additional 20kg of instructions!
A lot of the items listed included LEGO Technic sets and some previously unopened sets that had been hidden away in his basement!
In the ad the man called for interested parties to “Save my marriage”. For further details click here…
Nathan Sawaya‘s work has been inspirational to many AFOL’s. He is one of the pioneers in using LEGO bricks as a medium for art. His widely acclaimed, record breaking exhibition The Art of The Brick has visited the Far East, Australia as well as his home city of New York and is now touring Europe.
The first stop on the European tour is Dublin and The Ambassador Theatre. Due to the popular demand of the exhibit the show has been extended to 22nd June before making it’s way to London.
Built with over a million bricks, taking over 4,000 hours to build and comprising of 73 pieces of art, The Art of The Brick has been described as One of CNN’s Top 10 “Must see exhibitions”.
At the entrance to the exhibit, viewers are greeted by “Crowd” inspired by the “throngs of people walking the streets of New York City”. As you advance through the exhibit you can see how the subsequent works have progressed in a much larger scale culminating in “Dinosaur”.
Standing nearly 6m tall and built with over 80,000 bricks Dinosaur took an entire summer to build and was used as the centre piece for Nathan’s first solo exhibition in 2007.
There are some truly beautiful pieces along the journey.The influences of the former corporate lawyer turned LEGO Certified Professional are represented in the mosaics of Andy Warhol, Jimi Hendrix and Rembrandt. The LEGO built reproductions of such famous works of art the Venus de Milo (18,483 bricks) and Augustus (22,300 bricks) show Sawaya’s love for Hellenistic sculptures.
Sawaya is probably best known for his abstract protrayal of the human form. Yellow, being his most iconic piece, shows his subject “opening oneself up to the world”. The piece has had it’s own CUUSOO project and has even been used by Lady Gaga in promotional images.
To book tickets for the show, visit www.ticketmaster.ie. Tickets are priced €14 for Adults, €12 for Students & OAP’s, €8 for children up to 15 and €34 for a family of four for Mondays to Wednesdays and €17 for Adults, €14 for Students and OAP’s, €9 for children up to 15 and €42 for a family of four the rest of the week.
Last weekend saw MCM Expo return to the ExCel Centre in London. With over 100,000 attendees on the Saturday alone the event had numerous trade stands and dealers specialising in the latest merchandise for all things anime, video game and comic book!
There wasn’t much of a LEGO influence at the event, you will find the odd dealer with a few LEGO items for sale however I did come across a craft stall who used LEGO bricks to make jewellery.
Hand Made By Me run by Micheel Eve have a variety of jewellery using trinkets from Despicable Me to My Little Pony and LEGO. You can check out what else they have at their website.
I also had the chance to speak briefly with Arthur Parsons who worked on LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. Along with their stand, where visitors could try out the latest LEGO video games on offer, TT Games were hosting a panel discussing LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, LEGO Movie and LEGO The Hobbit video games.
We first reported that LEGO Ninjago would be coming to the big screen nearly a year ago! Now more details are starting to be revealed, with the film’s release date set for 23rd September 2016.
Following on from the success of The LEGO Movie, Warner Brothers will be aiming to cement their relationship with The LEGO Group with the Charlie Bean directed Ninjago film which has been written by brothers Dan and Kevin Hageman.
The Ninjago line of building sets made a welcome return in 2014 replacing the poorly received Legends of Chima.
Brett Waller’s previous Ghostbusters project won him the honour of the LEGO CUUSOO Fall 2013 review.
Now he has forwarded his idea for a Stay Puft Marshmallow Man set with three minifigures including Walter Peck, Gatekeeper and Keymaster!
The Stay Puft measures 34cm tall, consists of 1,800 bricks and is approximately half scale. If the Marshmallow Man was built to minifigure scale he would measure over 68cm tall! Nonetheless the design still looks impressive!
Peter forwarded his plans to LEGO Ideas for consideration. If the project gains 10,000 votes it will be reviewed by LEGO’s team of set designers and marketing representatives to evaluate the project according to review criteria.
The build is gaining plenty of interest although the official comments from the LEGO team do not fill you with any confidence that the project will see the light of day! Here is what LEGO had to say – “While we welcome projects based on current licenses like Star Wars in the LEGO Review, please keep in mind that a project based on an existing LEGO license has a smaller chance of passing the LEGO Review than other projects.”
Last week UTV News featured a spot on Warren Elsmore’s Brick City exhibit which is currently wowing audiences at Titanic Belfast!

Entrance is £5.00 per adult, £4.00 per child and £15.00 per family! Tickets for the show can be booked here…
LEGO have issued a press release announcing that Brittish explorer Ben Saunders is to become a brand ambassador for the new LEGO City Arctic line which is due in shops on 1st June 2014.
LEGO announces that world famous polar explorer Ben Saunders is to become the brand ambassador for LEGO CITY Arctic.
The LEGO Group have confirmed that Ben Saunders, polar explorer fresh from his expedition to the South Pole, has been named as the new ambassador for the new LEGO CITY Arctic campaign in 2014. As a self-confessed LEGO fan and one of the UK’s leading motivational speakers on polar exploration, Ben is the representative of the LEGO CITY Arctic engagement campaign due to his successful expedition retracing Captain Scott’s ill-fated Terra Nova route this February.
Ben will help bring to life LEGO CITY’s latest sub-theme, Arctic, through an integrated 360 degree campaign, involving LEGO ®, National Geographic Kids and other participating partners, such as Cartoon Network. The Arctic sub-theme will take CITY to the polar regions of the globe, where participants will engage with the natural wildlife, research the landscape and even hunt for ice crystals. The new range encourages children to explore natural environments as well as promoting personal growth and development through play.
A key facet of the LEGO CITY Arctic campaign is its call to arms for children to participate in its ‘Young Explorers’ Campaign in partnership with National Geographic Kids. The campaign features an exclusive competition hosted on LEGO.com, where children under the age of 16 can design a new piece of Arctic equipment that would help them to explore in the Polar Regions. The competition has a full 360 through the line marketing campaign, with the competition hub going live on both LEGO.com and NGKids.co.uk and promoted through print, digital, social, in-store as well as an on-air sponsorship deal with Cartoon Network.
On 22nd May 2014 the campaign will kick off with a PR launch at National Geographic’s flagship store in London. Following this LEGO will air a 30 second ad on Cartoon Network, Cartoon Network 2 and Boomerang channels, engaging kids and encouraging them to get on-line to find out more. To be in with a chance of winning, children are instructed to build or draw their entrees and submit on online via LEGO.com or by post to National Geographic Kids. All entrants will then be in with a chance of winning an all-expenses paid trip, provided by travel agent Activities Abroad, to Luosto Report in Lapland, Finland where the winner can experience their very own real-life Arctic adventure!
Using his personal experience as a polar explorer, Ben will be responsible for judging and selecting the winner and runners up of the Young Explorers Competition. He will also provide useful tips for children on how to become an explorer in an inspirational video hosted on the competition hubs and across social media.
In addition to the main campaign Ben will be participating in a LEGO sponsored research drive with 4sharedmedia to discover whether or not career decisions are influenced by playtime toy choices.
This move marks a key milestone for LEGO in the UK and will be supported with an extensive media relations drive, targeting mums with children who want their child to use their imagination for play and who also share a strong affinity with the long-standing LEGO CITY brand.
Ben Saunders commented: “I am honoured and excited to be named as the LEGO CITY Arctic ambassador for 2014. LEGO has played a huge part in my childhood and encouraged my own self exploration into other worlds, both real and imaginative. Being a part of their sponsored research into children’s play habits and how that influences their own careers is a great opportunity for me to speak to the families with children about how positive personal choices will affect their career choices in the future. I am over the moon in being asked to take part in this campaign!”
Harry Harrison, Brand Manager for LEGO CITY commented: “As LEGO CITY is currently the number one toy property in the UK* we are pleased to be able to offer children such a great competition of this scale, to engage them further in the world of play and imagination the product already provides. This is the most exciting collaborative marketing initiative I have been lucky enough to be involved in, bringing the multitude of LEGO media channels together with first class kids’ partners, to offer a fun, immersive experience across all touch points. I am also extremely honoured to have such an admirable ambassador on board to head it all up – I think Ben will be a real inspiration for both children and their parents alike.”
As the biggest property in the UK toy market*, LEGO CITY is the quintessential LEGO building experience, bringing everyday heroes and scenes to life. In 2014, LEGO CITY continues to deliver novelty and excitement to its loyal and growing fan base, extending its play universe into the polar regions, with the brand new Arctic theme.
The biggest item in the range is the Arctic Base Camp, which includes 4 Arctic explorers, pilot, scientist and a research assistant minifigures. The highly detailed research station features full laboratory, husky lead sled team, helicopter, tracked vehicle, snowmobile and even a polar bear to complete the Polar playtime experience! The Arctic range will be in all good toy stores from 1st June 2014.
Horror-movie heroes rarely exist in a vaccuum. There’s always some kind of supporting character who’s helping them (or goading them, or antagonizing them to the point of doing the right thing). And often, these supporting characters outshine the leads. Here are 10 horror movie second bananas who are way better than the hero.
Working in a comic book store was just their cover. They’re dedicated to a higher purpose: fighting for truth, justice, and the American way, all the while rocking Rambo-inspired fashion and schooling new kid in town Sam Emerson in the ways of vampire detection and eradication. Corey Haim and Jason Patric may have portrayed the two main brothers in The Lost Boys … but Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan (Jamison Newlander) Frog handily steal every scene they appear in.
Diminutive actress Zelda Rubenstein played Poltergeist‘s most enduring character, spiritual medium Tangina, who’s summoned to help the Freeling family when their daughter is sucked into paranormal limbo. High points of the performance include Tangina’s epic monologue explaining the “light” that’s so confusing to the film’s ghosts (“These souls, who for whatever reason are not at rest, are also not aware that they have passed on”), and of course her confident (if somewhat inaccurate) declaration that “This house is clean.”
Because anytime there’s an immortal talking cat that’s actually a 17th century teen rebel living under the curse of three witches … who steps up to help the 20th-century kids he befriends defeat said witches … fan-favorite status is pretty much assured.
Yeah, original scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis certainly leaves an impression as no-nonsense babysitter Laurie Strode. But her boy-crazy besties Lynda (“Totally!”) and Annie (whose reaction to spilling butter on her clothes is to strip down immediately) enliven the movie both as comic relief and artfully annihilated Michael Myers victims. If we didn’t care so much about this giggly twosome, the movie’s carnage would sting much less. Image via the Film Reel.
We hesitate to refer to Quint as a second banana, lest the ghost of Robert Shaw appear and menacingly scrape his fingernails down a chalkboard to announce his presence. Shaw got the role after Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden passed, and it’s impossible to imagine anyone else playing the grizzled, seen-it-all shark hunter. The below scene, in which Quint explains in gruesome detail the origins of his anti-shark vendetta, is among the most hypnotic in a film that otherwise trades more on suspense than atmospherics.
Neve Campbell’s stalker victim Sidney was a tough cookie, but her survival owed a debt to her geeky friend Randy, the audience stand-in for every kid who’d grown up devoted to the noble study of slasher flicks. When the high-school body count starts piling up, Randy steps forward to elucidate the well-defined rules of horror films: “The police are always off track with this shit! If they’d watch Prom Night, they’d save time! There’s a formula to it. A very simple formula! Everyone’s a suspect!” Though the self-reflexive slasher would become pretty played out in the wake of Scream‘s sequels and imitators, we have Randy to thank for bringing the genre to a new level.
Let us now sing the praises of character actor Eileen Heckart, whose every appearance as a sloppily drunk grieving mother … as unsteady on her feet as she is certain that little Rhoda (Patty McCormack) had something to do with the death of her son … elevates The Bad Seed from melodramatic chiller to surreal work of art. Her scenery-chomping work earned her a well-deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Image via And the Nominees Are.
When you unknowingly stumble into a biker bar that’s infested with vampires, you’re going to need all the help you can get. And if there’s a guy named Sex Machine (legendary make-up artist Tom Savini) — who’s handy with a whip and has a crotch gun at the ready — in your corner, all the better. In a movie that’s otherwise best-remembered for Salma Hayek’s snake dance and George Clooney’s haircut, Savini’s supporting man of action also leaves a lasting impression.
The second animal entry on this list is Inga, the heroic chimpanzee companion to Donald Pleasence’s kindly professor in what might be Dario Argento’s weirdest movie (which is saying a lot). No less an authority than Joss Whedon named Inga one of his favorite horror-movie characters, telling Entertainment Weekly:
”That movie is just so ridiculously chock-full of horror — there are terrible murders, Jennifer Connelly just happens to have control over insects, there’s a crazy person living nearby. By the time you get to monkey with a razor blade [which saves Connelly’s life], you’re just like, ‘Oh my god!‘ If you look at Cabin in the Woods, you can see the influence of, Oh, you mean you we can just never stop coming up with stuff? Now, there’s a monkey with a razor blade in [the 1988 horror film]Monkey Shines, too. But the one in Phenomena is more sympathetic.”
Dr. Frankenstein’s creepy mentor, memorably (and campily) played by Ernest Thesiger, is even more of a mad scientist than his protégée, with a sinister cackle to match. He also gets all the good lines in the film, including “To a new world of gods and monsters!”

It was lovely to meet Natalie and John and their two little girls Isla and Phoebe for their family portraits in Alton, Hamsphire. Such a beautiful family and a real pleasure to be able to capture this special time in their life. Natural light was used to create these beautiful portraits and a sepia tone added to create a timeless portrait.

Centre for peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI) has filed a petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan seeking free and compulsory education for children aged 5 to 16 as stipulated by Article 25 of constitution and has challenged fees collected by schools under different heads. The petition has been admitted by the honorable court today.
Mukhtar Ahmed Ali, Executive Director of CPDI explaining the reason of filing the petition said that the government schools across the country including those under the direct jurisdiction of the Federal Government continue to require students to pay fee and other education related charges of various types, which include, among others, admission fee, magazine fund, PTA fund, student leaving certificate fee, contribution for student fund and examination related fee or charges, despite the fact that Article 25-A of the Constitution specifically and explicitly says that the State shall provide free education and, therefore, no education related fee or charges can be levied upon the students.
He maintained that by charging students under various heads and by not providing free and compulsory education to all children of 5-16 years of age in the ICT and other Federal Areas, the Federal Government is committing a violation of Article 9, 14, 25-A and 37 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Petition further maintains that the right to education can also be inferred from several fundamental rights like the right to life (Article 9), Human dignity (Article 14), right to freedom of speech and expression (Article 19) and right to information (Article 19-A). Justice Riaz Ahmed of Islamabad High Court has ordered Federal Directorate of Federal Education and Capital Administration and Development to explain their respective positions on this matter.

As a child I developed an early interest in music and my history with music began. At this stage I never thought of singing. Playing cello at first, I joined piano classes. It is the moment when everyone was convinced, Joanna was going to be a virtuoso. Decision to take vocal classes was unexpected and shaped my entire life.
Looking back in time, I believe that was the right choice. Through singing I can express myself and fulfill entirely as an artist.
To me, there are two kinds of singers; those who rise through ranks of success by hard work, strenuous practicing and great determination, second group comprises of the 'lucky ones' - gifted so much, that even knowledge of scores is not required...
I fall into first category. Years of studying, hours of arduous exercises every day, listening to records of renowned artists, discovering the details of their craftsmanship - that was my day-to-day routine. Finishing my studies I knew my strengths as well as weaknesses. By that time I had been awarded first prize in the International Vocal Competition in London and second prize in Rio de Janeiro. My international career developed rapidly and led me to contract with Covent Garden in Liu' and long-term contract with The Grand Theatre (Teatr Wielki) in Poznan. I knew, however, I mustn't stop learning.
Still today, I cherish the knowledge of my tutors, and in spare moments I visit professor Irena Galuszko from Wroclaw, Poland. Together, we prepare for new performances and her constructive criticism is extremely precious to me.
Every opera singer should shape their career carefully. The art of theatre must be learnt; tricks of the trade must be discovered. One cannot underestimate the importance of minor parts, as they encompass vital elements of professional experience. I am convinced that many people in Poznan still recall my performance of Annina in La Traviata or Mi in "The Land of Smiles"...
Singing is vital. You sing to and for your audience wherever you perform. Power of will and respect for the audience - every audience, is indispensable. And remuneration is not of great magnitude for an artist with vocation for singing - passion and determination is.
Performing in renowned opera houses, however prestigious, is not always more rewarding than being part of less famous theatres, which are unfairly considered to be small-town, provincial establishments. The major hindrance in getting small theatres into big world of opera is money. Being a luxurious art in lavish surroundings, making performances inevitably requires vast amount of funds.
Nevertheless, financial situation is not the only factor that determines success of world-famous opera houses - it is their established ethos of how production takes place and the way rehearsals are organized and carried out. Prominent theatres allow as much as one month for rehearsals - time that is spent to the second for preparation to make this one, special piece of art.
At the beginning of your career vocal competitions play an important role. Winning prizes facilitates future success - finals always attract directors of theatres, agents and others that can 'spot' you. However, this is just a start - it is vital not to let emotions take over. Most importantly one should never take appraisals for granted. We all are well aware of one-night stars in a limelight, phenomena on opera scene that appear as quickly as they vanish.
It is essential to choose repertoire wisely. Interests of singers, directors and audiences are rarely in agreement. Can a middle-age lady be a convincing 15-year-old Butterfly? I guess it depends on the point of view. The ideal would be a young soprano capable of performing that part. That is nonetheless idealism. The reality is that this particular part is not only extremely demanding, but can also be disastrous for young voice.
I had to learn to say 'no'. Great majority of divas including my favorites, Mirella Freni and Leontyna Price always stressed the importance of it.
Relationship with your agent is of paramount importance. The ultimate cooperation is when your agent is prepared to 'invest' in their artist, understands them and protects from inappropriate parts, not insisting on taking on all offers.
We are captains of our own ships - we must know where we are heading for and how we are getting there.
“... not less praise but, on the contrary, more – should go to the delightful Tatiana by Joanna Kozlowska /.../ Her voice – broad, bright and uniform in every register, her excellent concentration on emission, her ability to shape the tone as needed, her fervent passion – all this makes her unbelievably convincing, both in her girlish joy at the beginning of the opera, in the 'slalom' of emotion during the letter writing scene and in the great final scene.“
"The gallery of female characters has its climax in the figure of Joanna Kozlowska, the Polish soprano who creates Dona Elvira with a magnificent voice capable of expressing all the wealth of this dramatically complex character..."

Bathroom furniture doesn’t just have to be functional. With the massive amounts of variety that are being offered in style and pricing, bathroom furniture can be fun, fantastic, or even formal. There is a piece that fits all tastes and all budgets.
Every bathroom must have a mirror. Some of the mirrors come with hidden cabinets inside. Some of the mirrors are ornate and make a strong statement. Some of the mirrors are just simply mirrors. All of them reflect light, give the room an open feeling, and serve a functional purpose in the room.
It is just as important to have some storage in the bathroom. A vanity fits this need nicely. It is almost an iconic piece of bathroom furniture – going back to the days when it housed the basin and pitcher. You can still get a vanity that has the look and feel of the antique, or you can go with a sleeker, modern cabinet. Installing a vanity can actually be a fun project for the average DIYer, and it can save a bundle on labor costs.
Another type of storage in the bathroom furniture is a cabinet. It’s great for hiding the extra rolls of paper, cleaning supplies, or spare towels. It is another piece of furniture that can make a bold statement in the small space. Some cabinets are designed to fit over the toilet (to save room) while others are stand alone units. All of them enlarge the space by making room for storage.
Bathroom furniture today comes in marble, wood, plastic, pressboard, and even metal. There is a strong look for every taste, and a reasonable price for every budget. By utilizing the varieties that are available, you can give your bathroom a whole new look with out a lot of time or expense.
Finding the right furniture to reflect your own personal tastes can be a daunting task, especially for the outdoors. To fully take advantage of your outdoor space, it is important to find and combine the proper outdoor furniture. There are a wide variety of materials and designs used in their manufacture, which may be confusing to some people. Enjoying the outdoors should be a comfortable and enjoyable experience. Once you have the right balance of looks and functionality, your outdoor space will become an amazing gathering place for dining, events, or just lounging. We will discuss some of the things to keep in mind when designing your furniture arrangements.
Outdoor furniture is best placed on a hard, level surface. Brick or concrete will do just fine. The most basic setup has a table and chairs. The size or your table will depend on the amount of company you expect to have and the room available. Measure the ground space you have before purchasing any furniture. Once you know exactly how much room you have, you can determine which table/chair combinations will fit.
If you expect to have company at some point, it is a good idea to buy more chairs than you would regularly use. Having ample chairs means that nobody will be stuck standing around, and will make conversation more comfortable. An excellent sitting arrangement is to have a couple comfortable benches around a central table or fire pit. This makes for a great conversational area to enjoy during day or night. When considering a table, you might want to get one with a built in patio umbrella mount. A patio umbrella lets you enjoy your front/backyard without glaring sun in your face. Also, at night you can use patio umbrella lights to light up the area for nighttime enjoyment.
Add a special flare to your outdoor space with path lights. Path lights help light the way in the dark and look great. Many models are solar powered are have built in batteries. Tiki torches are also a great way to spice up the area, and are a compelling addition to any outdoor arrangement. Pool parties and night time events will greatly benefit from any additional lighting you can provide.
If you enjoy lounging outdoors, consider a hammock or adjustable patio chair. Many types of comfortable seating arrangements are available, including swinging benches. Searching for outdoor furniture to suit your needs doesn’t have to be a daunting task. Follow some simple guidelines to get the most out of your outdoor space.
Designing a room means more than simply putting together things that fit. In choosing dining room furniture, it also pays to take into consideration form and function in relation to the space provided. For example, it wouldn’t be wise to put a large, rectangular dining table in a room too small for it. Nor would it help if a homeowner only expects a few people to make use of the table.
On the other hand, though, the same rectangular table could come in handy in a home that is ready to accommodate parties and a home full of friends. This is how design meets function. While different homes will probably need different recommendations on how to design the dining room, there are a few tips to keep in mind when it comes to furnishing.
Different table shapes are ideal for particular functions. A small, circular table for a small room offers a cozy atmosphere that is more intimate than a square table. It’s also flexible enough so homeowners can add a few more chairs when guests arrive. Too many, though, and the space can be cramped. But it can accommodate more than a square table of about the same size.
A circular table isn’t too wise for large dining spaces though, as the large empty space in the middle would be a deterrent to conversation. In this case, a rectangular table large enough to fill the space comfortably would be a better choice.
Choosing dining room furniture doesn’t need to be limited to the table and the chairs. Selecting ornate drawers and china cabinets will help to fill any blank spaces and pull a cozy look together.
Finding the right furniture arrangement for a room takes time. Just when you think you have found the right furniture arrangement you may realize it is wrong. How can you arrange furniture to fit your space?
MEASURE YOUR ROOMS. According to interior designer Mark McCauley, author of the article “The Art of Furniture Arrangement” on hgtv.com, “Most homes are filled with furniture arranging challenges.” Space is one of them. Before you start to arrange your furniture measure the room. Measure again to make sure the numbers are correct.
CHECK DOORS. Couches, sectionals, chairs, and tables are larger today than they were a decade ago. You may not be able to get large furniture into an older apartment, condo, or home. Measure your doorways and note which way they swing. Are there corners to turn? Will you be able to open drawers? Your furniture arrangement depends on the answers to these questions.
THINK ABOUT SCALE. Large pieces, such as a media cabinet, can dominate a small room and make it seem smaller. Similarly, a small area rug looks like a postage stamp in a large room. Making a room plan will help you match the scale of your furniture to the room. Planning kits are available from decorating stores and the Internet.
DIRECT TRAFFIC. “Arranging Furniture,” an article on the Lowe’s Web site, says you should allow a minimum of two feet for traffic routes. You should have 14″ to 18″ between a table and a couch. Do not block doors or egress windows with furniture.
PLAY UP FEATURES. Do you have a spectacular view? Position your dining table and chairs, or your couch, so you can enjoy this view. If you are fortunate enough to to have wood floors do not cover them up with a huge area rug. Instead, play them up with paint colors and furniture choices.
CREATE CONVERSATION AREAS. “How to Arrange Living Room Furniture,” an article on ehow.com, says living spaces should have cozy conversation areas. You may create a conversation area with two chairs and a low table. Separating modular furniture may also create conversation areas.
SEE THE BIG PICTURE. Mark McCauley, a member of the American Society of Interior Designers, thinks furniture arrangements should have totality or form. “Humans tend to feel more comfortable and less formal in square furniture arrangements vs. rectangular,” according to McCauley. Use a couch, bookcase, or table to divide a large space into small ones.
ADD COLOR WITH FURNITURE. Renters are often prohibited from painting their walls, but you may add color with furniture. A red side chair may be just the thing you need to liven up a room. You may add even more color with accessories.
An early morning reading with a cup of coffee is a wonderful idea to start a day. While watching the sun setting down to relax after a jam-packed day is also remarkable!
But there is no place to rest, sit and relax in a most comfortable way than in our own spot in the house. Generally, you can choose your bedroom as a comfortable spot in the house but you can’t watch the setting sun nor allure the moon much as going outside. That is why the outdoor parts of the house must give an outdoor cozy function like most part of the house. You can do that by doing some clean up, renovations and addition of furniture. Take note that not all furniture can suit your taste or the taste of your family. Better yet, you must know some tips in choosing those outdoor furniture that fit your taste before you regret in buying them.
Before adding any furnishings in your house, specifically for outdoor you should extend the theme of your interior design. It is for the reason that the exterior part of the house is like another part of the room, only that it is outside.
After you have determined the theme of your outdoor design, you can now proceed in looking out for the outdoor spaces of your house. You must study the practicality in adding furniture. Remember that the purpose of having furniture is not only to give beauty and functionality; it is also for filling up void spaces of the house. Therefore, outdoor furniture are good in wide, empty and odd outdoor spaces. On the other hand, perfect locations for an outdoor furniture comes next if you do have enough space for it.
Each furniture had its appropriate functionality and location. Like in the porch or in the garden, patio set is appropriate for this outdoor spot. Another is that, if you are looking for private and quiet spot, a French bistro set could is perfect for you. One set of it comes with French bistro chairs and a French bistro table. This is a wonderful set in the house where you can stay alone or enjoy a cup of coffee with a company. It serves as a private nook in your house where you can enjoy tranquility.

Previous year just before the time of Diwali, Ahmedabad-based Sun Builders had aligned two residential projects and both were enthralled in a second. And this year, the term is just about to reach and the crashes in the property markets have banned the real estate developers from bringing any upcoming launches.
Visiting a festive season that has usually focused the property investments --- particularly on the residential front --- the real-estate market, this year, is not even estimated to witness any high-spirited show of tradition-powered transactions. Real-estate specialists’ trust that there will 50% inclines in the new promotions that typically occur during the pre-Diwali era. "The market situation is very diverse to that which happened all at once previous year. There are no customers in the market.
We have ultimately finalized not to create any new launches anymore as we do not look at the circumstances increasing in the coming three months," told NK Patel, managing director of Sun Builders. The dropping sales dimensions attached to the reduction of liquidity in the market and the amassed debt has set substantial burden on the developers.
"We expect about 100 to 120 project introductions during Diwali this year. Each section we look around 200 projects hurled, and this time we assume a fall," adds real-estate professional Ashutosh Limaye who measures the descent to be as in elevation as 50% in some of the major property markets in the nation. "Mumbai and Kolkata will have the smallest amount novel launches, tracked by Hyderabad, Chennai, and Pune.
Various launches are anticipated in NCR (National Capital Region) and Bangalore," adds Limaye who is the head of the study and real-estate intelligence services, of Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), a property referring company that has an international existence.
Throughout the time between September 2010 and January 2011, the Mumbai city area got 50% jump in the number of real-estate promotions when compared to the similar period in 2009, as per to real-estate advisers Knight Frank (KF).
"The answer (to these launches) has been not been amazing and this unpleasantly knockout the list of the developers," adds Samantak Das, national head, KF. "Provided the economic situation and the listed pressure, as I believe the developers will be very careful and will take judicious verdicts on launches this year throughout the festive season. They will be motivated by economic sense than anything else, " he says.
For having three lodgings in a row, the sale speed in the real-estate segment has been dipping in Mumbai. The up-to-date monthly statement on Mumbai real-estate for the month of July by Prabhudas Lilladher exhibits a 31% year-on-year incline in sales registrations which is the bottom seen throughout the latter 24-months.
The short off-take has been a matter of apprehension for developers whose plans are under construction. The sales capacities of huge developers such as HDIL and Orbit Corporation have exposed a substantial incline, adds the report. Although 10% of HDIL’s novel project in Mulund got sold. Orbit saw sales capacities that were last gotten in September 2008.
A Mumbai-based developer UshaBreco Realty, which perceived a decent pre-Diwali season previous year has only one project planned to be hurled throughout September-October. "There is a quite likely in the high demand for housing properties as compared to previous year.
The unsold list, increase in interest rates on loans to real-estate developers, growing home loan rates and augmenting contribution costs are some of the major causes for the shortage of customer self-confidence in this division," adds UdayDharmadhikari, CEO, of the company.
"Developers who have not even initiated with their projects want to be assured of the optimistic sentiment of the market rather than hurling into new projects. In Mumbai, the project approvals are not occurring because of which the fresh launches are next to zero. Other metropolises the offtake is not poor, it is only that lavish housing is not shifting at all," Mr. Limaye of JLL commented.

In late November, I had the opportunity to participate in Student Leadership Trek, a new Peace Corps program in The Gambia. Three teams of six volunteers each taught leadership sessions to Grade 10 students over the course of two days. In total, we were able to reach six schools, biking from one village to the next to deliver our curriculum that focused on goal-writing and teamwork.
Since it’s not part of my primary job assignment, I don’t usually spend a lot of time working with high-schoolers although it’s something I really enjoy. The teenagers are more capable of discussing complex topics in a second language while they are still at an impressionable age.
Although working together with opposite genders and setting goals are things that come naturally to many Americans, people here are not generally exposed to those concepts. Many students had never deliberately written a goal with an action plan, for example. Here, they often think “I want to be a lawyer” but have no idea what steps to take to enter that career path. In some parts of the country, many students don’t even have the concept of “lawyer” to make that as a goal.
The best part of the trek for me was coordinating the role model speakers in my village. For that session, the boys and girls each listened to a leader from the community share his or her story of how they got where they are today. I think it’s so important for the high-schoolers to be exposed to positive role models since so much of what they see is instead poverty and unemployment.
I asked my best friend in the village to share her story since it is particularly inspiring. She shared her extremely personal story of escaping a forced marriage to fulfill her lifelong dream to become a nurse. She really connected with the girls, who asked many questions and didn’t want the day to end.
I love reading your blog!! Your voice comes through strong and clear in your writing. It sounds like you are having the adventure of a lifetime, and making all kinds of deep connections with the folks you are meeting in The Gambia.
Having my parents meet each other was a special occassion. They had all seen dozens of pictures and heard so much about each other but that is just not the same.

American people spending American dollars on American products equals American jobs. These jobs are the foundation of a thriving economy.
If every American spent an extra $3.33 on U.S.-made products, it would create almost 10,000 new jobs. And, if every builder used just 5 percent more U.S.-made products, it would create 220,000 jobs.
When you buy U.S.-made products, the proceeds remain in the U.S. economy. The money you spend then pays the workers that directly or indirectly created the product you purchased. When workers spend their money on U.S.-made products, the dollars continue to be recycled. Every American worker also pay taxes on wages earned in America.
American manufacturers abide by strict regulations to protect the environment. These regulations do not exist in most of the top countries manufacturing and importing their goods into the U.S. causing massive pollution and environmental abuse.
Importing countries shipping their materials overseas to the U.S. is an added toll on petroleum usage and increases unnecessary emissions in our atmosphere.
Importing countries have little or non-existent regulations or standards for working conditions. By keeping our dollars in the U.S., we are not supporting these horrible working conditions (long hours, exploitation of children, extremely low wages, etc.).

Madison Family Care and Wellness Center uses vitamin and mineral IV therapy to inject nutrients directly into your bloodstream. IV therapy allows your body to absorb more nutrients than oral consumption.
Nutrient stores can become reduced as a result of illness ranging from the common cold to cancer to other chronic conditions. This occurs because the presence of these illnesses creates an increase in the need for essential vitamins and minerals. The amount of vitamins and minerals absorbed by the intestines cannot sustain the increased need, and the stores of such nutrients are depleted. Vitamin C is one of the many vitamins used in this type of IV therapy. Vitamin C is required for the strength and repair of blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and bone. It is required for the synthesis of carnitine, which is responsible for transporting fat to mitochondria (the energy house) within cells.
Vitamin C is also a powerful antioxidant. It protects proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids from free radical damage. Vitamin C is also used by white blood cells to fight infection. Infections in the body can deplete Vitamin C levels. When our bodies suffer from illness, stores of essential nutrients such as Vitamin C are depleted. Vitamin C Mineral IV Therapy is the perfect way to replenish our systems.

Sound Transit is a regional transit agency serving King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties with light rail, commuter rail, and express-bus service. Officially called the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (RTA), it was created by the three participating county governments in 1993; residents approved funding in a 1996 vote. In 1999 Sound Transit began operating its first express-bus lines and commuter trains between Tacoma, Seattle, and Everett. The agency opened its first light-rail segment in Tacoma in 2003. After much delay, Seattle and King County got light rail in 2009, first between Tukwila and downtown Seattle, quickly followed by extension to Sea-Tac Airport later that year, with further extensions north to the University of Washington and south to Angle Lake in 2016. In 2008 a second phase was approved by voters that included planned stations south to Federal Way, north to Lynnwood, and east to Redmond. In 2016, voters approved a $54 billion third phase to extend light rail from 22 to 116 miles of track and increase bus and commuter-rail service.
Perhaps surprising for a regional transit agency in charge of a few bus and rail lines, Sound Transit's story is one of high drama, near failures, state supreme court cases, and federal inquisitions. The agency not only survived more than two decades of setbacks and near shutdowns, it won approval to continue expanding until at least 2041.
The Puget Sound region's complicated modern history with rail transit began with the rejection by King County voters of Forward Thrust bond measures in 1968 and 1970. Spearheaded by civic leader James Ellis (b. 1921), Forward Thrust was a package of bond measures to fund a robust subway system in Seattle and the surrounding suburbs, along with a variety of other infrastructure projects. Though voters approved many Forward Thrust projects, they twice rejected funding for rail transit. Federal funding initially earmarked for a Seattle subway went instead to Atlanta to build the MARTA rail system. The Forward Thrust setback cooled the region's rail appetite for nearly two decades. In effect it became political road-kill.
In 1988, Greg Nickels (b. 1955), then a King County councilmember (and later Seattle mayor), co-sponsored an advisory measure asking voters if they wanted light rail. Nearly 70 percent said yes, creating new political momentum for regional rail transit.
Two years later, the Washington State Legislature, led by Representative Ruth Fisher (1925-2005), took an essential step toward making light rail a reality by passing the High Capacity Transit Act. Doing so created a Joint Regional Policy Committee to coordinate efforts between King, Pierce, and Snohomish County transit agencies; funded the work; and gave the counties the local taxing authority necessary to fund high-capacity transit. The counties created a $13.2-billion plan for regional light rail, commuter trains, and express buses, and in 1993 the Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority was born.
The next step was to ask voters for funding. The RTA board decided to split the plan into two phases. In a March 1995 special election, the board ran a ballot measure asking voters to fund a $6.7 billion first phase. But again voters rejected transit. The board, led by Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel, went back to the drawing board, held hundreds of public meetings, and put together a scaled-back first phase.
Dubbed Sound Move, the $3.9-billion plan called for 22 miles of light rail from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport through Seattle to the University of Washington, and a separate 1.6-mile line from the Tacoma Dome to downtown Tacoma. The Central Link line from the airport to UW was projected to cost $1.7 billion and be completed by 2006. Sound Move would also create the Sounder commuter-train system running on existing track between Tacoma and Seattle and Everett and Seattle, as well as 18 new express-bus lines. On November 5, 1996, Puget Sound voters finally approved a rail-transit plan. With funding approved, the RTA board selected staffer Bob White as the agency's executive director.
Recognizing that "Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority" was a mouthful, the board adopted "Sound Transit" as the agency's "popular" name in August 1997. The Central Link alignment became the centerpiece of Sound Transit's efforts over the next few years. The agency worked to map the best potential route, procure land for construction staging and stations. It also planned Regional Express bus routes and Sounder commuter-train service.
Less than three years after voters approved Sound Move there were already signs of trouble. In February 1999 The Seattle Times reported that Sound Transit was unlikely to get as much federal funding as had been expected when a 1995 funding plan was developed. That meant it would take several years longer than planned to eventually get light rail all the way to Northgate, a second-phase goal.
By itself that might have been a relatively minor hiccup, but it was the first in a years-long series of financial and planning missteps that nearly derailed Sound Transit. People inside and outside the agency referred to that period from 1999 to about 2003 as the dark days.
Shortly after the funding shortfalls became apparent, the Sound Transit board adopted its preferred Central Link alignment. It was far from finalized -- the agency still needed to complete a final impact statement and get approval from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). But it was a key step toward making light rail real. The plan called for elevated rail from the airport to Rainier Beach, street-level rail through the Rainier Valley, a tunnel through Beacon Hill, street-level rail through SoDo, and a tunnel through the International District, downtown, First Hill, and Capitol Hill to the University of Washington.
The hits kept coming, though. In June 1999, the agency announced the estimated cost of building light rail would be hundreds of millions more than expected, admitting publicly for the first time that it might not be possible to build the full first phase as promised. Light-rail director Paul Bay explained "that new elements added to the plan in February, combined with unanticipated increases in land prices, have driven the estimated cost above the project's $1.8 billion budget" (Murakami).
Luckily for Sound Transit, 1999 wasn't just a parade of bad news. By September, the agency began service on nine of the planned 18 Regional Express bus routes. In November, the board unanimously approved the final alignment for Central Link from the airport to UW. With that decided, Seattle Mayor Paul Schell (1937-2014), King County Executive Ron Sims (b. 1948), and a coalition of environmental, labor, and business leaders headed to Washington, D.C., to lobby the FTA for hundreds of millions in funding for light rail.
But good news remained the exception for Sound Transit as the new decade began. Days before the board voted on the final light-rail alignment, voters approved Initiative 695, a ballot measure from anti-tax crusader Tim Eyman (b. 1965). Among other things, I-695 created a flat $30 car-tab fee, reducing the revenue the state collected from the motor-vehicle excise tax. Doing so blew a hole in Sound Transit's funding plan for Sound Move. A King County Superior Court judge overturned I-695 because it violated the single-subject rule for ballot measures. The state legislature passed a bill the following year reinstating flat $30 car tabs, with the caveat that Sound Transit could collect its higher tax from residents in its taxing district. Through 2017 Eyman would go after Sound Transit funding two more times with initiatives for a flat $30 car tab, without success.
Communities throughout the Sound Transit taxing district were voicing their dissatisfaction with the Central Link plan. Tukwila officials were upset that there wouldn't be a stop at the Southcenter mall. Residents in North King County complained they were paying for rail without receiving its benefits, since the line would end at UW for the time being. In south Seattle's Rainier Valley, residents angry that they were getting street-level trains while most track was elevated or underground formed the group Save Our Valley. They worried light rail would endanger pedestrians, interfere with automobile traffic, and be excessively loud. At the same time, a pro-light-rail group called the Rainier Valley Transit Advisory Council formed to advocate for light rail whether on street or underground. Save Our Valley filed a lawsuit against Sound Transit, arguing the rail alignment would disproportionately impact minorities. A U.S. District Court Judge dismissed the suit in 2001.
As 2000 rolled on, it became clear that Central Link was going to cost significantly more than expected. Sound Transit executive director of planning, environment, and project development Ric Ilgenfritz explained in 2017 that a combination of inexperience, optimism, and communication breakdown lead to the massive cost overruns:
"In an effort to be on time, [Sound Transit] wasn't very disciplined about scope. There was a lot of internal lack of functional communication. Nobody was putting all the pieces together" (Ilgenfritz interview).
Still, the FTA moved forward with a commitment of $500 million for Central Link and in September forwarded the funding proposal to Congress for a standard 60-day comment period. There was no mention of potential cost overruns at the time.
Sound Transit's hope was that the market would compensate for the expanded scope and contractor bids would reign in the budget. That did not happen. In November, news broke that the lowest bid for the tunnel from downtown to UW was nearly $200 million over budget. Ilgenfritz recalled, "The board was surprised, the legislature was surprised, the media was surprised. That's never a good thing" (Ilgenfritz interview)
Sound Transit's light-rail director Paul Bay resigned and board members put tunneling plans on hold while they scrambled to figure out a plan B. The FTA indicated that a revamped light rail plan might result in a change in funding.
In September 2000, the first Sounder service began between Seattle and Tacoma. In October, the agency hired former Snohomish County deputy executive Joni Earl (b. 1953) as chief operating officer. It was serendipitous -- Earl would soon become CEO and is largely credited with saving Sound Transit.
One of Earl's first tasks as COO was to figure out just what shape the budget was in. She found things were even worse than expected. As the year closed, news broke that Central Link was $1 billion over budget and would take three years longer to deliver than promised.
Despite the looming cloud of budget overruns, 2001 started off positively. On the final day of the Clinton administration, outgoing U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater signed a full funding grant agreement (FFGA) committing $500 million to Central Link. Congressional Republicans, led by Representative Hal Rogers of Kentucky, cried foul. Rogers, the House Appropriations transportation subcommittee chair, had requested that Slater not sign the FFGA to give the new administration time to evaluate Sound Transit's budget troubles.
Just days after Sound Transit received the FFGA, the board asked director Bob White to resign. He agreed, saying, according to a Sound Transit news release, "that new leadership, unencumbered by past issues and decisions, is needed to position the agency to restore public confidence to succeed with the Link light rail project" ("Sound Transit Executive Director ...").
Earl dove in head-first as acting CEO. She recalled, "I had five days that were 24-hour days ... There was so much at stake and it felt pretty precarious. I was fearful a lot. You just didn't know what shoe was going to drop next" (Earl interview).
It turned out the next shoe drop came from Rep. Rogers, who summoned Earl to Washington, D.C., to be grilled by the House Appropriations transportation subcommittee. Longtime U.S. Representative Norm Dicks (b. 1940), a Sound Transit supporter representing areas of Pierce and Kitsap counties, sat with Earl as she answered questions about the agency's plans to get back on track and why it deserved federal support. At the end of the session, it was unclear if federal support would continue. Rogers said his decision would be based on results of an investigation of Sound Transit by the Office of the Inspector General that winter.
The Inspector General report was not kind. Released in early April 2001, it admonished Sound Transit for lack of due diligence around budgeting and cost estimates and recommended that the FTA hold off on providing grant money. The report estimated the planned light rail would actually cost $4.1 billion. The following day, Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta (b. 1931) announced Sound Transit would not get federal funds for light rail. Thanks to behind-the-scenes work by U.S. Senator Patty Murray (b. 1950), however, the FTA agreed not to redistribute the $500 million earmarked for Sound Transit, giving the agency time to get its act together.
With the full airport-to-UW route now well out of financial reach, Sound Transit began working on a shorter version that would at least get something built. A popular choice would have been to build the segment from SoDo (south of downtown) to UW first. Serving downtown, First Hill, Capitol Hill, and the university, that would have the highest ridership of any segment. But because it required so much tunneling, some of it very deep underground and therefore risky, it also would cost the most. Instead, the Sound Transit board voted 14-2 to build south first, from Westlake Park downtown to the airport. The 14-mile line would cost $2.1 billion and be complete in 2009.
In addition to reshaping the project scope, Earl, now officially appointed by the Board as CEO instead of interim CEO, was working to reshape the organization to prevent a repeat of past mistakes. Working with the motto "optimism is not our friend," she said she always wanted to under-promise and over-deliver:
"I told staff, 'If you see a problem you have to flag it. Nobody's going to get fired for identifying a problem. But they're going to get fired if they hide a problem'" (Earl interview).
Earl also worked to fix the communication breakdowns that contributed to the massive cost overruns, and she instituted new systems for project controls and cost and risk estimates. Earl said the agency essentially took the Inspector General's list of problems and worked through it to correct each one.
In February 2002 an anti-rail group called Sane Transit sued Sound Transit, alleging that the massive reduction in project scope required the agency to put the issue to another public vote. The suit also sought an injunction against agency spending. Sane Transit leaders included former King County councilmember Maggi Fimia, Bellevue businessman Kemper Freeman Jr. (b. 1941), and former KING Broadcasting public-affairs director Emory Bundy, among others. The courts ultimately decided that Sound Transit had legal authority for the change in scope.
Despite the lawsuit, Sound Transit pushed forward on Central Link. In July 2002, it again applied to the FTA for the $500 million grant. The following month, the FTA gave Sound Transit permission to move to the final design stage for light rail. In September, auditors from the Office of the Inspector General returned to Seattle to again evaluate the agency. The auditors were no less skeptical than they had been the year prior. Ahmad Fazel, then Sound Transit's light-rail director (he would later become executive director of engineering, construction, and design) recalled of the auditors:
"Every day they came to work asking questions and looking at our documentation. They sent a dummy invoice through our system to make sure we could process it on time. That's how low their confidence level was at times" (Fazel interview).
As 2003 progressed, it became clear the auditors were happier with Sound Transit than they had been earlier. In May, during a congressional hearing, Transportation Secretary Mineta told Senator Murray that he no longer had reservations about Sound Transit. July brought the Inspector General's second report, which gave the agency a stamp of approval. A few days later, the FTA submitted the $500 million grant to Congress for the 60-day review period. Keeping the success streak alive, Sound Transit opened the 1.6-mile Tacoma Link light rail between downtown and the Tacoma Dome in August of that year.
Though there was some grumbling in Congress about the $500 million FTA grant, Sound Transit finally got its full funding grant agreement for Central Link in November 2003. After nearly nine years of hurdles, Sound Transit wasted no time getting to work on the project. Earl noted, "We broke ground within a week of getting the grant agreement" (Earl interview).
Capping off the mostly positive year, Sound Transit opened the Sounder commuter-train line between Everett and Seattle in December 2003.
With construction underway on light rail and something to focus on besides a sense of impending doom, employee morale improved significantly. The board was feeling confident as well. Just a few months after breaking ground on Central Link, the agency started work designing the second phase of light rail. Known as ST2, it would expand light rail north to Lynnwood, east to Bellevue, and south to Star Lake near Federal Way, as well as expand Sounder train and express bus service. The agency would once again have to ask voters for taxing authority to make the multi-billion package a reality.
The following years were consumed by construction and ST2 planning. Occasionally Sound Transit had to lift its head up to deal with hiccups ranging from minor to major. In February 2005, light-rail construction was briefly delayed when workers at a construction site in Tukwila unearthed 900 Native American artifacts, including rocks from a hearth and various tools.
In what would prove a fateful decision, the state legislature decided in the spring of 2006 that the $11 billion ST2 package would go to the ballot as part of a single measure along with more than $7 billion for highway construction. Known as the roads and transit measure, it was at the time the largest tax package in the state's history.
In February 2007, tragedy struck the Central Link project. A supply train carrying workers at the Beacon Hill Station job site crashed. A 49-year-old construction worker named Michael Bruce Merryman was killed. Another worker was injured. Earl counted it among the lowest moments of her time as CEO: "That was a sad, sad day" (Earl interview).
In May, the Sound Transit board unanimously approved the final ST2 package for the roads and transit vote. But opposition to the ballot measure was mounting from the left and the right. Kemper Freeman and Sane Transit opposed spending billions on transit. The Sierra Club opposed spending billions on highways. On November 6, 2007, Proposition 1 lost by a wide margin.
Earl remembered, "I didn't think it'd have a chance, but I didn't think we'd get our butts kicked so bad" (Earl interview). Still, there was a feeling shared by Earl and some board members that it was roads that brought ST2 down and that they could have won on their own. Testing that theory, the board, now chaired by Nickels, began planning for an ST2 stand-alone vote in 2008.
Voters proved them right. Though the country was sliding into economic turmoil, voters approved the $18 billion expansion package Sound Transit had put together. Had ST2 failed, it might have marked the end of Sound Transit. Earl said, "We would've had to lay off staff because so many of our other projects were wrapping up. ... I think we would've tried to at least get light rail to the airport" (Earl interview).
The excitement following ST2's passage was brief. Soon the impacts of the so-called Great Recession hit Sound Transit's budget. According to Ilgenfritz, the agency's long-range revenue forecast dropped by as much as 30 percent. As a result, it had to scale back, removing several park-and-rides, and planned rail extensions to Federal Way and Redmond.
Though voters had already given Sound Transit permission to look beyond the Sound Move plan, the agency was still focused on getting Central Link finished. Finally, on July 18, 2009, more than 40 years after county voters originally rejected Jim Ellis's Forward Thrust vision for rail transit, light rail opened between Westlake Center and International Boulevard in Tukwila. Opening day saw major celebrations, with more than 30,000 first-day riders trying the system and cheering from the platforms.
Excitement was tempered, however, by delays in completing the airport station. Funding shortfalls and prolonged negotiations with the Port of Seattle over station placement prevented Sound Transit having the airport station ready for the grand opening. In its absence, the press took to calling Central Link the train to nowhere. On December 19, six months after the grand opening, Sound Transit opened the airport station.
Once Central Link opened, the agency was consumed with ST2 planning, construction of the light-rail extension to Capitol Hill and University of Washington, and, of course, day-to-day operation of its two light-rail systems, two commuter train lines, and expanding bus system.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the history, there were problems along the way. In September 2010, Kemper Freeman and a pro-roads group in Bellevue sued the state to block light rail's expansion to the Eastside via the Interstate 90 bridge across Lake Washington. They argued that it was a violation of the state constitution to use the bridge for non-highway purposes because it was paid for with gas taxes. The state supreme court rejected the lawsuit in 2013.
One of the agency's worst moments came in April 2014. Earl was tripped, fell, and hit her head, leading to blood-vessel leakage in her brain. In June, she officially took a medical leave of absence from the agency. Deputy CEO Mike Harbour took over as acting CEO. Earl was never able to actively return to her role as head of Sound Transit.
In May 2015, Earl announced plans to retire once the University Link extension was complete the following year. Peter Rogoff, the FTA's transportation undersecretary, replaced her. He began in January 2016, in the midst of planning for a massive third expansion, ST3.
Two months later Sound Move, the first phase approved back in 1996, was finally completed as University Link opened, extending light rail north from Westlake to Husky Stadium at the University of Washington with a stop in Capitol Hill en route. The new stations were immediately popular, with ridership nearly doubling from the get-go. In September, the Angle Lake station opened south of the airport, further boosting ridership.
The ridership surge could not have come at a better time for Sound Transit. When the board unanimously approved the ST3 package in June, the estimated price tag was an eye-popping $54 billion. Once again, Sound Transit would be asking voters to pass the largest tax package in state history.
Because of its massive cost, ST3 drew plenty of opposition. Kemper Freeman helped fund a No on Prop 1 campaign with more than $200,000 in donations. The Seattle Times editorially encouraged people to vote no. Some state legislators voiced concern over the cost. But opponents did not sway enough voters. On November 8, 2016, ST3 passed with 54 percent of the vote.
The approved ST3 package, scheduled for completion in 2041, called for an additional 62 miles of light rail and 37 more stations, along with expanded Sounder commuter train and Regional Express bus service. If completed as planned over the next quarter-century, light rail will eventually stretch from Everett to Tacoma and east to Issaquah and Redmond; Seattle will get a second line from West Seattle to Ballard; and the region will finally have a mass transit system exceeding the dreams of Forward Thrust.

Teeming with silent-era affectation and ebullient editorial handiwork, Daisies conceals political allusions beneath slapstick and stylistic extravagance, transforming mischief and chaos into egalitarian protest. Weaponizing art and femininity against the constraints of a communist state, Věra Chytilová championed technique and aesthetic as personal catharsis, deriding the feigned unity of collectivism by revealing the pleasure in independent creation.
Eschewing the conformity of narrative, Chytilová constructed a quilt of images and symbols, tampering with the origins of sound by replacing its natural cadence with clanging gears of war. The opening credits are powered by militant bugle and churning mechanism, punctuated by abrupt silences that lend an eerie calm to footage of detonating bombs and airborne fire fights. Her human avatars (Jitka Cerhová and Ivana Karbanová) are just as robotic as her machines, creaking like unlubricated hinges with each gyrating limb or swiveling head. She allows the ticking of a clock pendulum to spur her puppets into motion, shifting between lens filter and setting to mirror their physicality.
Transitions are jarring and without precedent, employing the score as onomatopoeia in an experiment with tone and texture. Pigments shift from pink to orange to green as jump cuts dash through dining sequences, condensing the superficiality of small talk into forgotten moments between sips of coffee and cigarettes. A postprandial train ride even transforms into an impressionistic painting, as radiant tones trail behind the caboose like bleary neon lights on the tracks.
Chytilová finds freedom in this artistic frivolity, utilizing semantic games buried within her images to impart meaning, applying sharpened scissors as the literal and a flatbed film editor as the figurative. Anarchic visions of rapidly-diced eggs, bananas and sausages act as an affront to the biological necessity of sex organs, defacing the pragmatic restraints of the nuclear family and demanding autonomy by force. Shears even dissect bodies into pieces like a butcher’s cleaver, leaving superimposed limbs and heads to ghoulishly dance about the screen, calculating human value by the sum of its anatomical parts. The transgression of the content is even strong enough to alter the form, resulting in a dissection of the image, dissolving it into contorted, rectangular blocks within the camera eye.
In a final act of defiance, the director and her fictional peers find transcendence through gluttony and vandalism, shuffling off the plow lines and coaxing the image to polychromatic life by gorging on pheasant and ripping the chandelier from the ceiling. Through this host of recurring symbols and mutinous declarations, ranging from the captive beauty of the butterfly to the vulgarity of indulgence, Věra Chytilová inserts her interchangeable pranksters into the harnesses of radical socialism, marvelling as their indomitable spirit prevails in the face of an automated society.

A deceptively simple spoof of suburban eccentricity and corporate duplicity, Wayne’s World conceals its ingenuity and technique behind its emphatic, hockey-haired protagonists, inserting piece-to-camera narration and swift editorial work around each sarcastic quip and lecherous daydream. Though the genre requires little more than competency, the craftsmanship on display actually benefits the scenario, providing Wayne and Garth with an insular world to amplify their personalities and cinematic style to match the breadth of their cultural obsessions.
Utilizing montage and comic-strip surrealism borrowed from Saturday Night Live’s mixed-media sketches, Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) escort us on a subjective Chicago travelogue, curating a tour of their favorite donut shops, heavy-metal venues and airport landing strips, cataloging the outlandish locals along the way. Though their sense of humor leans towards the puerile and parlance borders on the esoteric (“Ex-squeeze me? Baking powder?”), adjusting to the pair’s lingo occurs in an instant, negotiated by an inclusive and immediate form of storytelling.
The communal vibe evoked by the leads yields honest and uproarious moments, sequences and asides that skewer the avarice of network television and channel nostalgia into era-defining visual art (see the “Bohemian Rhapsody” sing-along). Thankfully, this sentimentality never drifts into reverence, freeing the team to scoff at the same cinematic cliches they’re gleefully exploiting, transforming “extraneous” scenes, excessive subtitling and happy endings into self-reflexive film criticism.
Sadly, these formal triumphs don’t always overshadow the faults of the writing staff, revealing the jejune romances and pious posturing at the center of the script. Wayne’s dueling love interests, Tia Carrere and Lara Flynn Boyle, are only furnished with enough dialogue to reinforce their characters’ stereotypes, trapped as little more than an exotic chanteuse and self-loathing ditz at the beck and call of unrepentant male libido. Themes of artistic integrity are just as dubious, considering the compromises inherent in SNL’s composition and the prominent roles of the primary cast in a corporate entity. Biting the hand that feeds is noble, but each statement of defiance feels more like an easy story arc than rallying cry of artistic autonomy.
Aside from misguided agenda and chauvinistic state of mind, Wanye’s World constructs an authentic and inspired universe around it characters, mining laughs from their relatable struggle with the banalities of adult life. Though the trappings of their hair-metal subculture seem tacky in retrospect, a bond is shared through the religion of popular music and American ephemera, forging an alliance with teenagers unrestricted by generational cohort.

Most people are familiar with basic functions like \(y=x^2\), and recognize its graph as the standard parabola. One thing we often don't consider is that this function is also a geometric transformation. That is, it takes the straight line segment [-1,1], for instance, and turns it a particular curve in the plane (that "starts" at (-1,1), passes through (0,0), and "ends" at (1,1)). All functions do this, in fact, some making more interesting--looking curves than others, especially if one considers parametric or polar functions.
Ultimately, though, we take a one-dimensional object (an interval of the \(x\)-axis) and transform it into another one dimensional object, a curve in the plane. One dimensional objects are so ... one dimensional. To make things more interesting, we should consider two dimensional regions of the \(x\)-\(y\) plane, and think of ways to transform them.
There are infinitely many ways of doing this. One way is to pick two functions \(f\) and \(g\) and send the point \((x,y)\) to the point \((f(x),g(y))\). I thought of animating this for functions like \(f(x) = \sin x\) and \(g(x) = x^2\), but in general, this process makes a mess. (We'd love to see some people do this, though. If you do, share!)
A much, much better way of transforming the plane is through a linear transformation. It is pretty simple: pick 4 numbers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) and map the point \((x,y)\) to the point \((ax+by,cx+dy)\). This kind of transformation always sends straight lines to straight lines and circles go to ellipses. Relative distances are also preserved: if the point \(Q\) is 2/3 from \(P\) to \(R\), then \(Q\) gets mapped to a point 2/3 from where \(P\) and \(R\) get mapped to.
These linear transformations are the underpinnings of computer graphics. For instance, letting \(a=\cos\theta\), \(b=-\sin\theta\), \(c=\sin\theta\) and \(d=\cos \theta\), we can rotate the point \((x,y)\) around the origin counterclockwise by the angle \(\theta\). Below, we rotate the rectangle with corners (-1,0) and (1,1) around the orgin by 90\(^\circ\). On the left is the original rectangle, on the right is its transformation. Note how the shape and distances are all preserved.
Linear transformation on points \((x,y,z)\) in space allow one to rotate a 3D world, move through it, and show it all on a flat screen (Wolfenstein 3D, anyone?). The GPU's on computers are really, really, really good at performing these transformation fast.
Usually linear transformations do not preserve angles. That is, if two lines meet at a 15\(^\circ\) angle, the transformed lines probably do not meet at the same angle. This is ok for some applications, like projecting a 3D world onto your phone's screen. A map that does preserve angles is called a conformal map.
To perform such a transformation, we need to view the \(x\)-\(y\) plane in a different way. We start with imaginary numbers. We first learned that \(\sqrt{4} = 2\) and \(\sqrt{-4}\) didn't exist. Later, some of us learned to give the expression \(\sqrt{-1}\) the name \(i\) and call it an imaginary number, as though it only existed in our minds. That allows us to get numbers like \(\sqrt{-4} = 2i\). With the basic principle that \(i^2=-1\), we can create complex numbers like \(2+3i\) and multiply them:
A complex function acts on these complex numbers. For instance, \(f(z) = z^2\) (we often use \(z\) for complex numbers) does the following:
We can visualize complex numbers with the complex plane. Identify the complex number \(2+3i\) with the point (2,3) in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Each point in the plane represents a complex number. Tons of cool stuff comes out of this.
A great result is that we can now transform this complex plane by applying a complex function to every point (i.e., every complex number) in the plane.
We now reward to reader who has read this far with some more eye candy. In each of the following, we transform the same rectangle as before (now with vertices at \((-1,0)\sim -1\) and \((1,1) \sim 1+i\)) by a complex function. As you look at these, note how angles are preserved. In the rectangle, we have lots of right angles as the vertical and horizontal lines meet. In the transformed shapes, all the new curves intersect each other at right angles. (You should find that amazing. I do.)
A really cool thing is that rotations are just multiplications by complex numbers. To rotate and scale, multiply by any complex number; to just rotate, multiply by a complex number of the form \(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta\). A 90\(^\circ\) rotation is just a multiplication by \(i\), as seen before:
1. What good is this?!?! Are you kidding me? This is awesome. We just took a rectangle, deformed it in weird ways, but preserved angles. Who would have thought this was possible?!?
2. There are many problems in physics/engineering that depend on complex (no pun intended) geometry - for instance, fluid flow around corners or obstacles. The right conformal map can transform the complicated geometry into a simpler geometry, where the problem is "easy" to solve. This solution can be transformed back into a solution in the original geometry using the inverse conformal map.
A final note: this post was inspired by a reader comment. We probably misunderstood the comment, but we rotated a shape by moving points in a straight line and wondered if the reverse was possible - can we move a shape in a straight line by rotating its points? A comment suggested using an inversion (or see this), which got us thinking about conformal maps. So thanks for the comments - we like them and they give us ideas.
Oh - and someday, we'll post the code for our images. These .gif's were produced mostly on a Friday afternoon when we should have been grading papers or writing Chapter 13 of our Calc III book. Our code is generally ugly - we write stuff in whatever way seems easiest at the time, and only figure out how to make it look nice and readable much later. So ... later we'll post some code because we do want to share.
We used conformal maps on the Navier-Stokes equations to do some soap-film turbulence simulations in rough-walled geometries (http://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.1451.pdf). There are definite ups and downs of the method (its easy to get geometry roughly like what you want, but getting exactly the geometry you want is harder, though possible).
The point was to be able to use a solution trick that only worked on rectangular grids (pressure projection method).
The interesting thing is that although Navier-Stokes isn't invariant under a conformal map, the way it varies is very simple - you just get extra body forces that correspond to centripetal acceleration of the fluid going around the curves of the map.
Really loving this blog, by the way, and this post was particularly good because it was just on the cusp of what I remembered from college calculus a decade ago. I don't get to do math much anymore, so it's fun to make my brain hurt on purpose again every once in a while :-)
I think you should post the code even if it's ugly, as you may end up forgetting to publish it and even losing it, which would be a shame!

It was another brave effort by the home side at Parc OJ, with the visitors, still in the hunt for promotion, finally claiming their bonus point try with the last move of the match. Llanybydder were missing a number of regulars, and there was an opportunity to give young Josh Jones a first start at lock, while Rhys Morris continued his recent excellent performances at hooker. Half backs Jac Thomas and Steff Richards varied play well, with Bleddyn Jones showing his versatility with a sound match in the centre. The scrums were solid, but the visitors shaded the lineouts enabling experienced scrum half and captain Adrian Killa to control the play and crossed for 2 tries. There were further tries for Pontarddulais for threequarters Jared Williams, and Aled Richards, with Brandon Wood converting two.
Llanybydder’s only try came from Bleddyn Jones, as he supported an interception from ever present skipper Ricky Davies.

AltRider completely redesigned their existing crash bars for the new water cooled boxer model. A step up from years past, they utilize 1.25“ (31.75 mm) O.D. stainless steel tubing making them the largest diameter bars on the market. Real world testing yielded much insight on how much damage large heavy bikes can do during crashes and 1” bars (25.4 mm) allow a significant amount of flex during a crash, creating the need to space them farther from the bike. The more solid 1.25” bars they have developed allow a tighter profile while still providing real protection. We chose the black powder coat version. They came with all the necessary hardware and even a 55 Torx fitting bit to fit them with. At 5.5Kg they are VERY solid and although of course we hope never to put them to the test, they are rock solid when fitted.
The top of the bars are secured in a total of three locations per side. The front mount is the only one on the market designed to utilize 2 bolts per side to increase the ability to distribute the load of any impact. The rear is held with a custom machined through-bolt that replaces the OEM engine mount hardware — increasing strength of the bars up to 25%. AltRider offers one of only a few designs that utilize a custom machined through-bolt. There are no plastic spacers to break upon impact. This creates an incredibly strong design that distributes any impact evenly throughout the bars.

Parasha Toledot, with its painful account of the strife that characterizes Jacob and Esau’s childhood, calls to mind the film classic “Rashomon.” “Rashomon” is a film by the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa that tells the same story from the perspective of four different protagonists. All four storytellers were firsthand witnesses to a crime in which they were personally involved, leading to four wildly varying accounts of the same events. The film was an instant classic for the way that it captured something essential about human experience. “Rashomon” reminds us of how difficult it is to access an “objective truth” about events. So it is with parasha Toledot. The Torah provides us with one account, but depending on your sympathies, the portion tells widely varying stories.
A simplistic retelling of Toledot might go something like this. Isaac’s wife Rebecca is pregnant with twins who struggle greatly inutero. God tells her that she has two nations growing within her. “The older will serve the younger.” Esau is born first, ruddy and hairy. Esau grows into a skilled hunter, an outdoorsman. Jacob remains indoors; he “keeps to the tents.” One day Esau returns from the hunt so famished that he foolishly and impulsively sells his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of soup. Years later, when Isaac is dying and blind, Jacob makes good on the sale of the birthright. He dresses up as his brother and hoodwinks Isaac into giving him the birthright blessing.
The rabbis saw Esau as an evil figure, the father of some of the Jewish people’s greatest enemies. There is thus a strong tradition of the straightforward reading I have offered above, which vilifies Esau.
Starting from God’s message to Rebecca, “the older will serve the younger,” everything is up for debate. The Hebrew is vague, so that the words could mean the opposite. Even without this ambiguity, perhaps what we have is Rebecca’s interpretation of God’s message. Rebecca repeatedly tips the scales in Jacob’s favor. She might say that this is fulfilling God’s will. We might say that she is simply playing favorites. We may say that Jacob is justified in his trickery to receive a birthright he has legitimately purchased. Yes we may ask if Esau ever truly believed that in the moment of desperation he was truly selling his birthright. We might also ask if Isaac is truly tricked or if he knows exactly whom he is blessing, as he knows that Jacob is the one destined to be the true father of the People of Israel.
What do we gain from all of these interpretive options? First, we gain an appreciation for the complexity of the Torah narrative. In the multiplicity of readings we can more readily see stories that mirror our own lives. Second, and more importantly, we see the slippery nature of narratives, writ large. We are increasingly living under the burden of fragmented reality. Our ideologies guide us to interpret facts, or even pick and choose facts in order to construct narratives that reinforce our beliefs.
Rashomon, Toledot, these are cautionary tales, warning us against building hatred based on the stories we are told, when those stories are told from only one perspective. When stories without nuance fuel resentments, stories without actual relationships with the “other,” those stories become the sources of hatred, violence, terrorism, genocide. Stories alone have great power to inspire for good, but the only way to break through the fog of “Rashomon” is through true human relation, encountering the other firsthand. s
It was wholly a pleasure to receive your correction to my obituary tribute to the late Gerald Ford. You grant that young Ford was indeed a center on Michigan's two national-championship teams in 1932 and '33, but he was not the center. Oh, what a difference the use of the definite for the indefinite article can make. An All-American, Charles Bernard, was actually the starting center on those teams.
As wholly a pleasure as it was to hear from you, I wish you hadn't taken exception to the Southernisms I slip into from time to time in this column.
You refer to such colloquialisms as bad "grammar," rather than as bad spelling or pronunciation. There is a difference between those various categories, and it ill behooves as distinguished a citizen of Arkansas as yourself to confuse them.
Why, consider how your loose language might sound to educated people, or just rich folks visiting our state with money to invest. For it is they who seem to be the principal object of your concern  lest they pick up my work, confuse down-home language with illiteracy, and flee the state in horror, taking their money with them.
If I didn't know better, I'd suspect that this outbreak of correctitude on your part is just our old Southern inferiority complex acting up again.
As for the substance of your letter, if I were to follow your advice and avoid homespun language, much of the life would be drawn from my prose, which needs just about all it can get.
There is such a thing as over-correcting the language, until it becomes but a dull, pallid imitation of true Southern speech, which can go from aristocratic finesse to potlikker plain in a New York minute.
So, please, sir, a little more respect for colorful language. You are a distinguished citizen of our state, and should not disillusion your many admirers, me first among them, by blurring your language while trying to improve mine.
It long has been my belief that the first sign of decadence in a people is the impulse to rein in its native tongue in order to cut a better figure with outsiders.
A confession: As an editor of Arkansas' statewide newspaper, I'm less interested in impressing visitors, as welcome as each and every one of them is, bless 'em all, as in speaking candidly to our own folks in this small, wonderfully close-knit state. And there's no better language for that purpose than our own shared speech. If it's vivid enough, readers elsewhere will have no problem understanding it from the context. If they don't, well, it's better to mystify than bore.
I myself much prefer distinct American dialects  especially those of Maine, Brooklyn and New Orleans, as well as Tex-Mex  to standard, plodding, Dick-and-Jane American English.
I'd like to think readers can depend on me to tell it plain  with the bark off, if that informal phrase does not jar your sensibilities.
It is always a delight and honor, not to say a great entertainment, to hear from you on the subject of proper usage. And how 'bout them Razorbacks!
It was wholly a pleasure to get your e-mail and insight. Agreeing that the young children of immigrants readily pick up English, you write:
"Living on the ever-expanding edge of Chinatown, every day I see the truth of what you write. The second generation is generally fluent in standard American English and culture, and act as guides. � There's nothing quite as poignant as seeing a 7-year-old taking her grandmother to the store."
I can identify with those kids in Chinatown. I used to take my non-English-speaking grandma (Bubba) to the supermarket. She made me point out the U in a circle on any canned goods we bought, so she'd be sure they were kosher. That lady wanted proof.
I know. I had to show her the marks the phylacteries had left on my arm as evidence that I'd said my morning prayers. Only then did I get my breakfast.

JWR contributor Paul Greenberg, editorial page editor of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, has won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing. Send your comments by clicking here.
First, he preempted the annual, if fading, game of guessing who will be Time's "Man of the Year" by announcing on his website that the selection has been narrowed to two choices. One is Alan Greenspan, for propping up the economy when just two months ago the stock market was bobbing up and down faster than a London yo-yo and the specter of a worldwide depression in early '99 wasn't all that far-fetched.
The more popular choice, according to Drudge, is a split cover of Bill and Hillary Clinton because they "triumphed over the impeachment storm and engineered a remarkable comeback in the face of what seemed like mortal blows." Time's managing editor Walter Isaacson has the final word: The magazine's staff is reportedly preparing two different packages.
Okay. While Greenspan is a safe and prudent choice, it doesn't have the oomph that the cover at one time symbolized. As for the Bill and Hillary combo, what a joke! First, Clinton isn't out of the woods as far as impeachment goes; second, what the heck did Hillary do this year except write a saccharine, syndicated column and campaign for Democratic candidates, often using race-baiting tactics? Seems to me the most logical choice, if you use the historical basis for the cover, is a three-way montage: Clinton, Ken Starr and Monica Lewinsky.
Drudge also said that David Brock, the conservative Benedict Arnold who fell under Hillary's black magic a few years back, after being part of the vast right-wing conspiracy at The American Spectator, has a blockbuster article coming out in Esquire that will be his "biggest story since Troopergate." We now know it's a piece about Michael Huffington's homosexuality. Nuts! I was hoping for something juicier: Ken Starr and Michael Isikoff are secret lovers? Linda Tripp was a double agent for the White House, working under James Carville and Sidney Blumenthal? GQ editor Art Cooper has given up turtleneck sweaters forever?
Drudge also had fun poking fun at Dan Rather's Larry King Live interview last Thursday night, in which the daffy anchorman suggested that Hillary Clinton might be the strongest Democratic candidate for president in 2000. Rather also lobbied for Hillary being named Time's Man of the Year, and in a hypothetical Gore administration, becoming the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
If the Clinton/Starr/Lewinsky trio weren't such an obvious choice for Time's cover, I'd argue for Drudge himself for a couple of reasons. One, he's successfully cowed all the Beltway insiders who've ridiculed his reporting; two, he's the most obvious symbol of the next wave of journalism, a one-man shop who's caused newsrooms with hundreds of reporters to pay attention to his postings.
Kurt Andersen, who I'll confess is a friend of mine, was the author of the piece on Tom Hanks, and he did a fine job, considering that it was an assignment that I don't think is worthy of his estimable writing talent.
Then again, he did interview Hanks in Venice, so maybe that's the reason he took the job. Several sessions with Tombo, who seems like a pretty upright guy, then off to see the sights in that outstanding outdoor museum.
I watch Hanks' movies, and really liked his That Thing You Do!, although he sort of dismissed it in talking to Andersen, as well as Philadelphia and Sleepless in Seattle. Saving Private Ryan I couldn't stomach, given Steven (can I suck up to Bill Clinton more than David Geffen) Spielberg's involvement, but Hanks himself was terrific, although Ed Burns and Jeremy Davies stole the film.
Anyway, the Post and other newspapers leaped on a very minor part of the piece in which Hanks said that he "regretted" contributing to Clinton's legal defense fund.
It was refreshing to see a crack in the Hollywood-First Liar connection. But then, quick as Tina Brown snaps her fingers to get a lackey to fetch a few canapes and an Evian for lunch, a publicist got to America's good-guy actor and he retracted the statement. The same day The New Yorker was released, Hanks told reporters, "If I was asked to do it again, I would probably give twice as much... You couldn't get a bigger supporter of the president than I am."
Andersen told me on Tuesday: "[Hanks] told me when I interviewed him that he 'still supports the president,' which is not incompatible with regretting the defense fund donation. His take in our conversations seemed properly nuanced and full of grays, as I suggested in the piece.
I suppose the sudden black-and-white tabloid hoopla made him decide that if he's going to be forced now to declare himself on one side or the other of the pro- and anti-Clinton barricades, he's going to be on the pro- side. What choice did he have? He gave the guy a C or a C-, but suddenly everybody said to him on Monday, 'Sorry, only Pass-Fail grades allowed,' so he had to go back and give him a Pass."
Ellis Henican, in a Dec. 2 Newsday column, discussed the brouhaha, unfortunately continuing the self-flagellation that journalists find so satisfying today. He wrote: "Actually, it's kind of hard to blame Tom Hanks for most of this. He's just a likable movie actor. He never claimed to be William F. Buckley, for goodness sake. We're the ones who deserve most of the blame. We're the ones who put him in the paper, as if he had something to say. We're the ones who put him all over TV. And it wasn't like we could blame the tabloid snakes who slither around our feet. Wasn't it the august New Yorker who set this whole thing off?"
Uh, Ellis, isn't Newsday a tabloid? So I guess you're a snake, too, and can feel justified in bellying up to the bar with the likes of Ray Kerrison, Deborah Orin, John Podhoretz and Michael Daly.

With the New Year rapidly drawing nearer, Americans can hope to be barraged by telephone calls from obligation settlement organizations offering them an exit from obligation. Since chapter 11 documenting conveyed a pessimistic disgrace previously, a great many people attempt to quit and search for a contrasting option to insolvency. These people are prime focuses for the obligation settlement industry. A considerable measure of the negative press about those recording insolvency, originates from the credit business and the obligation settlement organizations. The lion’s share of what they call actualities are just halfway facts, best case scenario. Taking a gander at it from their viewpoint, they accept on the off chance that they can unnerve individuals into not recording insolvency that is all the more cash that they will get paid back. What they don’t need the person to know is whether they record Chapter 7 insolvency they will get nothing, nothing, zip. This is the reason numerous obligation accumulation organizations get aggressor when they realize that indebted person is on their last leg. The miserable thing is, they know this individual couldn’t bear to pay them anything but they would rather observe little Johnny abandon supper to make sure they can crush another dime out of this broke person.
Why obligation settlement is touted as being superior to anything a liquidation recording is on account of they say that they can settle every one of your obligations for pennies on the dollar without filing for insolvency. The issue is they can’t guarantee anything on the grounds that the loan bosses are holding every one of the cards. How obligation settlement functions is they have the borrower make installments to the organization to develop a pot of cash for them to consult with the person’s leasers. Since the loan bosses hold the cards and the borrower is giving the cash to the obligation settlement organization rather than the leasers they have the choice of suing the indebted person. Since the Visa is in default, the financing costs and late charges experience the rooftop. On the off chance that the lender sues the indebted person and gets a judgment, the leaser will have the capacity to decorate their wages and connect any property that the borrower possesses.
I don’t know how they trust this is a superior arrangement than petitioning for liquidation. As a matter of first importance, with an insolvency the account holder is ensured by the programmed stay once the appeal to is documented with the court. The loan boss will never again have the capacity to gather on the obligations. Truth be told, the programmed stay stops all telephone calls, dispossession, claims, judgments and wage garnishments. On the off chance that they need to contact the account holder about the chapter 11 recording, they should do it through the insolvency lawyer. This puts the power in the hands of the individual petitioning for chapter 11. Not exclusively will the indebted person have the capacity to quit making installments to the lenders, every past obligation and late expenses will be wiped out in the liquidation release. Something else that the obligation settlement organizations solid arm the account holder is by disclosing to them that chapter 11 recording will pulverize their credit. By and by, a halfway truth in light of the fact that the indebted person’s credit was at that point dirtied by all the late pays. Truth be told, when a man settles their obligations rather than insolvency, it will appear on their acknowledge report as a charge off, demonstrating that the borrower did not pony up all required funds. This dings the acknowledge pretty much as terrible as a chapter 11. Normally, in the wake of petitioning for chapter 11, most people revamp their credit rapidly in light of the fact that they’re obligation proportions are great and many leave liquidation being for all intents and purposes obligation free.
Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of occupational therapists concerning priorities in Occupational Therapy in municipal home care.Method: Data was collected through three focus groups where licensed occupational therapists discussed priorities based on a half-structured interview guide. A total of 11 participants from three municipalities took part in the study. The collected data was analyzed using content analysis.Result: Experiences of priorities for participants were numerous and will be presented in three different categories; namely Priority is to do the right things, Support or barriers in priorities and Lack of time and resources affect the priorities. The result includes that a priority list can help the participant to do the right thing, that it is important to have good support from the manager and that the participants, due to lack of resources, only have time to help patients who have the highest priority.Conclusion: It is clear that a lack of resources is a major cause of the problems that arise regarding priorities in municipal home care. The experience of participants, specifically that time is not sufficient and that the workload is greater than the available resources, is a contributing factor to the stress they feel.

Cyclin E1 is a member of the highly conserved cyclin family and belongs to the E-type cyclin that functions as a regulator of S phase entry and progression in mammalian cells. Cyclin E1 serves as regulatory subunits that bind, activate, and provide substrate for its associated cyclin-dependent kinase2 (CDK2), whose activity is essential for cell cycle G1 / S transition. Over expression of this encoding gene has been found in many tumors, which results in chromosome instability and by extension, induce tumorigenesis. This protein was also found to associate with, and be involved in, the phosphorylation of NPAT protein (nuclear protein mapped to the ATM locus), which participates in cell-cycle regulated histone gene expression and plays a critical role in promoting cell-cycle progression in the absence of pRB. In general, cyclin E1, as an activator of phospho-CDK2 (pCDK2), is important for cell cycle progression and is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells.

I drank quite a bit of vodka last night and am dragging ass this morning as a result. Didn’t get out of bed until a little after 11am and have been battling a hangover ever since. Due to my condition, I have only glanced over model data. I need to go clean up my car and get everything ready for chasing this week and then I have a mothers day dinner at 6, so I’m going to wait until later tonight to post a forecast. The NAM has trended a little closer towards the GFS, which is good news for Tuesday if you want tornados. The NAM now at least has some convection developing along the dryline and the high resolution NAM has storms developing all along the dryline. I honestly was never worried about getting storms though so that’s no big relief for me at least. I still think there is a pretty decent shot at a few tornadic supercells on Tuesday. It’s not a real good setup. The thermodynamics and shear profiles are pretty so so with this one, but they are good enough to support tornadic supercells, especially in the 6-9pm window as low level shear ramps up and hodographs enlarge. I’ll get into a little more detail with tonight’s forecast map and put the surface boundaries and area I intend to target on there. I still think the area around the KS/OK border looks the best for tornadoes. Anyway, sorry for not posting this morning but I’m in no shape for deep though and evaluating model data. I need to save that for later today after the liquor has worked it’s way through my system lol.

Ashford University’s Leader Development Grant (LDG) is designed to assist Ashford’s corporate partners in offering education options that can help them develop and retain their employees. The LDG program, when combined with a partner company’s tuition assistance program, allows eligible students to earn their degree without student loan debt. Students who are eligible for the grant will have their educational costs covered by their employer, in addition to tuition for all eligible courses, course materials, technology fees, prior learning assessment fees, and graduation fees paid for.
To date, Ashford’s LDG program student enrollments have increased more than 70 percent since 2016. In addition, upon review of all the credits completed by LDG students and estimating the average debt per credit for non-LDG students, it is estimated that the program has helped LDG students avoid more than $60 million in debt. The program helps corporate partner employees avoid debt, provides degrees associated with the Forbes brand, and gives students a quality, affordable, and accredited education that conveniently fits the work-life balance.
One of the corporate partners currently participating in Ashford’s LDG program is California-based Hunter Industries, a family-owned global company that manufactures irrigation, outdoor lighting, and dispensing solution products. Hunter Industries has been a corporate partner in Ashford’s LDG program since June 2015 and currently has 28 employees participating in the LDG program. Reyes Cabral, the 500th graduate of Ashford’s program, recently received his bachelor of arts degree in supply chain management through the LDG program while he was employed as a warehouse supervisor by Hunter Industries.
“Ashford’s LDG program is a great opportunity for companies to develop and better their employees,” said Cabral. “If it wasn’t for Ashford’s LDG program, I wouldn’t be here today. The program is a win-win for everyone and gives students the knowledge to use it and apply it. I plan on using my Ashford degree to its fullest.”
“We congratulate Reyes on having accomplished a great milestone in completing his degree from Ashford,” said Scotty Oliver Lombardi, Hunter Industries’ senior manager of talent management. “Hunter Industries is proud to partner with Ashford in a LDG program that allows working students to pursue their education and excel in their careers, the program has been very beneficial to talent engagement and retention. We’re equally proud of our employees who’ve also graduated and of those who are pursuing degrees, benefitting from this partnership.”
“Ashford’s Leader Development Grant is a truly innovative strategic partnership program within the higher education sector,” said Michael Rolnick, vice president of strategic partnerships at Bridgepoint Education. “LDG is a great benefit to both the corporate partner and employee, as it provides the opportunity for educational development and skill growth for the employee and retention for the employer.”
Where heritage meets innovation – that’s Ashford University. At Ashford, students discover relevant degree programs, innovative technology, and cherished tradition. Ashford offers associates, bachelor’s, and master’s degree programs online, allowing students to balance life by providing the flexibility to do school work anywhere, anytime.

Looking for a reliable online store where you can buy anabolic steroids? Don't know where it is safe to make a purchase of a sports pharmacology that would really work? Then You've come to the right place! Our online store not only offers a wide range of sports
Steroids, which are easy to purchase, are presented in all sorts of variations. These are various oral and injectable drugs. Also there is a choice of sports nutrition, fat burners, antiestrogens, gonadotropin, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor... And this is not a complete list, which, moreover, is constantly expanding.
In the conditions of actively developing market of sports pharmacology you will not face a shortage of offers for the goods of interest. The problem today is different – the abundance of fakes that filled online stores. And only with the help of a proven resource, like Hulk Body.
Deciding to buy steroids and pharmacology for sports in General, also do not forget about unscrupulous businessmen, owners of one-day websites. Such figures, having received an advance payment, just "throw" their customer. According to statistics, such "scammers" in the modern realities of the market – the vast majority.
Our online store offers reliable order of anabolic and androgenic steroids for athletes and compares favorably with all competitors. We work directly with manufacturers or their direct suppliers. Thus, all drugs on the shelves of the resource come almost from conveyors. Also, when ordering, customers are guaranteed security and anonymity, which is no less important!
For a long time the site of AthleticPharma has established itself as a reliable supplier of the best Pharma. Do not believe me – look for reviews about our work on any forum for bodybuilders.
Ignorant in medicine man or a beginner in sports is the word will say little. But You need exactly the best anabolics if you want to have a perfect muscular body, high endurance and strong muscles.
So, what is the use of anabolic steroids, and whether to buy them? In short, it is commonly called substance, which accumulates nitrogen in muscle protein
and support the direct growth of muscle tissue. In the normal state in the body are two mutually balancing each other process-anabolism and catabolism. Catabolism destroys old cells and anabolism creates new ones.
Anabolic steroids are used to gain muscle mass. They shift the internal balance in favor of anabolism, respectively, there is an increase in muscle volume. If you buy and use such drugs, progress is accelerated, and in a relatively short achieved results, simply impossible otherwise.
In the body there are natural anabolics, responsible for the processes of growth and development – is, in particular, testosterone, male sex hormone, which promotes just an increase in muscle mass, the formation of male secondary sexual characteristics, and performs many other important functions. On its basis and in its likeness, by the way, almost all modern AAS are created, which are in demand for medical or sports purposes.
Some time ago it was accepted such a division, however, in our days scientifically established and there is no doubt that all modern steroid products used for sports tasks (from muscle growth to increase endurance), have both anabolic and androgenic properties.
Often, when anabolic and androgenic steroids are developed, the androgenic activity is artificially understated because it is capable of
leading to the development of suitable (androgenic) side effects. For muscle growth, endurance and strength, steroid substances are not used
only professionals, but also Amateur level athletes. With proper preparation of the course and individual selection of dosages, the use of these drugs is accompanied by a minimum risk of side effects.
Many famous athletes admit that if they did not have the opportunity to purchase anabolic and androgenic steroids, their career achievements would be much lower. The range of existing sports drugs is very wide, and the diversity of their actions is great. Among such a wide range, everyone will surely find the most effective and safe means for themselves.
The site of anabolic and androgenic steroids HULKBODY gives such an opportunity. Whether you want to increase muscle or improve muscle relief-here for all purposes and sports – from athletics to bodybuilding, there is a drug.

Reclaiming the Loch Ness Monster from the current tide of debunking and scepticism. If you believe there is something strange in Loch Ness, read on.
I may be wrong, but I think the new six part ITV murder drama, "Loch Ness" will air its first episode on Sunday, 30th April. The brief blurb for the show is as follows.
On the beautiful, haunting shores of Scotland’s iconic Loch Ness, amid a community sustained by myth and bordered by untamed nature, the search for the truth becomes a matter of life and death in this gripping murder mystery.
I doubt the old girl herself will put in an appearance but it wouldn't surprise me if there is a scene where something perplexing is seen on the loch, but an "expert" pops out of the bushes to calmly reassure them it is only a group of distressed ducks being chased by a hungry seal.
Readers may recall the show's publicity stunt with butcher's offal and suitably arranged bones last summer. Anyway, I look forward to watching this show. I don't know if the show will be available outside the UK.
Disappointingly they moved a lot of the shoot south - Glencoe area - as Loch Ness-side villages didn't look sufficiently, erm, Loch Ness like. Go figure.
Definitely. They want an image of the loch as surrounded on all sides by high mountains with misty peaks. Which it mainly is, it's just the high mountains and misty peaks are more road-accessible in Glencoe and you don't have to get your boots so dirty to get to them.
I think they only did 1 day and 1 night filming the murrrrderrr scene on Dores beach, then they scarpered down south for the rest. I could be wrong though.

This spell permits the caster to hear all movement on the ground within 300 feet, even if that ground is separated from the caster by thick walls, etc. The caster knows the general direction of the footfalls, the size of what is moving and the general number (single creature, small group, large group, etc.)
This spell turns a fire or portion of fire (campfire size minimum) into a swarm of tiny fire elementals who run wild and cause as much havoc as they can before they're destroyed. The swarm has the following statistics:
The swarm moves and attacks as a single creature. It covers a 10' x 10' area, with all creatures in that area suffering an attack from the creature, and all inflammable items in the area forced to make an item saving throw or catch fire.
Any chance of Nod 30 being available in paperback in the next few days? I'd like to throw it in with the other books in my cart.

I am Matthias Koffeir. You can call me MattKoff (Yeah, like that popular Matt Koff with a space) for sure. A lot of people do, and it made their lives better. I do not have a wife, not even a girlfriend or a boyfriend but I have a dog. Don’t get me wrong, my dog is special. She doesn’t talk back to me when I go home later than usual and she’s all about supporting me in telling my stories to the world. In fact, she always almost does not pee on my couch whenever I go home with another award in my hand. (Most of the time, these are vouchers I’ve won ((stole)) by being a super here). She was also my life when at 28, I just moved out from home. (What? My parents love me!)
So what do I offer on this blog site? Basically all fun and excitement of my everyday life. This is an online journal I made just because I can. I don’t really provide any products and services. Instead, I share with you my amazing adventures every day. I give you a glimpse of the glitz and glamor of MattKoff. If you are gonna ask, that is not a typo. There is really no space between Matt and Koff. One word. (PS and I really have glamor)
What is so important about my life? I discovered that in the life we have now at present, we have become really career-driven. Men and women, alike. There is no problem with this. In fact, this helps them keep afloat in their daily lives. However, I think almost everyone cannot find that light anymore that alleviates the burden on one’s shoulder. So this site is basically made to give a smile on your faces. This may be an online journal, but I live on one mission – providing fun stories to the people.
So where do I start? Of course with my life. Many people could attest that my life is one big comedy. I never really had a day of serious trouble in my life – no if you are not going to consider the day my garage door broke down in the middle of the night. But even then, www.a1garage.com/houston-tx was immediately on my doorsteps to cover it. I don’t know if it was because I rarely take problems seriously or I’m just your typical weirdo with a positive outlook on life. Although it’s not always unicorns and rainbows for me, I also cry sometimes but nothing over something irreconcilable. It also helps a lot that I’m surrounded by people who take problems with a hint of levity.
This is what I hope to bring here in my website. I hope to inspire with my constant positive outlook in life. I’m going to show you how I maintain a good composure even through the worse stresses in my life.
Like what my mother always says, life is too good for you to be frustrated about. Take it one day at a time and enjoy even the worse times. It’s just part of growing up.
I’ve had a great time with my nieces today. I have twin nieces from my sister Brianna and they are always a bomb. But today, they detonated and just exploded with sweetness and sprinkles on their big day.
It was their recital day. To give you a short background, my nieces Tatyana and Aleksandra are studying ballet. At a young age, they have already the passion for it which was great because back in my days, my passion just lies in the movement of my ants in their glass box. Of course, my family took this day as a reunion day. Mama and Papa even went down from Texas to see the twins first performance. Honestly, it was a bit overwhelming to see many burly men in the little girls’ event. We even carried placards and banners which express our support. Overkill, right? But like any number one fan (in his case, fans) we went all out.
What did we see? Two little pink girls twirling like swirls of sundae. They look so sweet that it almost gave me a tooth decay. But every burly Koffeir men who are present were teary-eyed after the performance. Everybody was throwing out some form of an exclamation that ‘our girls have grown’. It was no doubt that they have. Our princesses whom we used to carry around in our trunk-like arms have grown up to be something else. It was one heck of realization to the family.
“That’s so sweet. This is perhaps the hardest part to any parents, guardians and even their support system.”
“Your family is so cute. I always come here to read the next thing you will upload. It was a breath of fresh air from all the hustle and bustle of this concrete jungle you call the city. Keep it up, Ma
There is nothing much to say about myself that I haven’t mentioned yet on the landing page. But just to make it clear, I am MattKoff but not really Matt Koff who is a good writer and a stand-up comedian. See the difference? Space, dude.

Due to trouble with Jeff's Mix Board, we'll be reshooting on January 7th at Noon at a new location for us: Grace Chapel out in Skaneatles New York. We'll post pictures of the new set up then!
The Give Us Jersey set is 2/3 of the way through production! We only have a few more shots left for their more intricate video, and Music Video # 2 (the names are confidential until the release of each) will be a breeze. Keep tabs for more updates.
As planned we were incapable of getting all of production done in a single day. However, our second day of production has been put on halt due to a surgery Mike must undergo, which will put him out of operation for quite a while. However, once he has fully recovered, we will approach this head on once again.
After receiving the approval of Kyle's family, we'll be uploading the video to the page shortly to show off what we are capable of doing highlight reel wise. For forewarning, we did not film this material ourselves, we just edited it so please do not judge the quality of the image. We would like to thank the Hastings for giving us this opportunity.
We're currently working on quite a few projects, and have a lot of news for everyone! Here's a picture of a Rough Draft of the Color Grade of the Give Us Jersey Music Video! We've done two days of production and hopefully our third day will go as well as the first two, both of which went as smoothly as imaginable.
We've been extremely busy on all of our projects. Check out our "What We're Up To" section for updates on Kyle Hastings, Mike Quercia, Give Us Jersey, and Jeff Bianchi's projects.
So, as break continues, so does our busy schedule. So far, we've gone through a day of shooting for Jeff Bianchi's Studio shoots, and will beginning day two soon, wrapping up production.
Here's a picture of our lighting set up on Jeff's shoot, we'll be releasing the videos soon. To here more about the shoot, check out our "What We're Up to Page", there's a more in-depth breakdown blog post there.
Give Us Jersey, an up and coming pop-punk band based out of Syracuse, NY, and I have agreed to shoot two music videos soon, just in time for the release of their new album!
We'll be touring for them for a little while, gathering some live footage, and we'll be shooting the music video in our hometown here in Syracuse! To find out more about this event, check out our "What We're Up To" page!
Breaking onto the rap scene, Mike Quercia signed us on to create his first music video for his single: Terrible Thoughts.
On the 28th, we have a meeting with an old friend about use of locations, and locations for this project is going to be a lot of fun.
We're going with classic Wes Craven themes so-- you'll just have to wait and see how the final project turns out!
Although it's not our most exciting project, this is a good opportunity for our little company: a family friend has asked us to edit together his high school football highlight reel.
When this project is complete, we'll be able to reach out to other athlete's using his reel as an example of what we can do for them as well.
As the year comes to an end, our busy season begins! With two projects about to go underway, we are planning on keeping ourselves busy! With an ever expansive crew, we're coming back with a few new faces, and a lot more talent.
Also, in the christmas spirit, we have a christmas present from us to you: A giveaway like none you've ever seen before!

With the launch of our new website, enough footage to sink a ship with for our new cooking show, (sneak peaks coming soon), "The Orientation" started and completed, the independent project "Shoot", (which the picture to the left is from) and the scheduling of another series of shoots with studio drummer Jeff Bianchi, we've kept ourselves quite busy. Hopefully Winter Break will be just as productive, if not more!

Being a modeller for quite a few years now, I decided to explore the endless possibilities that the world (through internet) offers, and come up with a series of ways of building, modelling and painting fast (but not hastily), to create the worlds I was seeing in history books since I was little. . .If you care to join me. . . This is the place to be! And, I promise you to find the way (or ways)!!
If you have read my previous post, you would have noticed the three terrain boards I made for a WW1 project we are preparing on our gaming club.
Today, I'm going to show you, some complementary terrain pieces, made from old cd's, some off-pieces of foam and some twigs.
Take some old cd's, glue some scraps of foam on them and then with a hot glue gun, place the twigs on the foam pieces (or the cd's surface if you want to).
Cover the cd's surface with kitchen paper, by using PVA glue, wall filler, and water - the consistency is up to you to decide (not too ''runny'' not too ''bulky''). After the materials application, you let the pieces dry for at least 24 hours, otherwise you risk of ruining your brushes whilst painting afterwards.
After drying, I used the same technique for painting them (Dark Brown, Brick Red drybrush, Brown drybrush and Medium Grey drybrush).
Below, you see how well they blend with the rest of the pieces. I am sure that the attacking forces, will think of them as a light cover, from the menace of the machine guns.
I will probably be stealing this. And I think I will be generally just basing my trees on CDs now, thanks to you.

The Colorado Avalanche drafted the Czech born David Svagrovsky in the 4th round, #131 overall in the 2003 entry draft.
He spent 2 years playing for the Seattle Thunderbirds of the WHL, and 1 year playing for the Colorado Eagles of the CHL.
2002-03: Svagrovsky came into the WHL and was met with immediate success. He finished his rookie year with 47 points (17 goals, 25 assists) which ranked 7th in the WHL in terms of rookie scoring. His +/- of 17 was 5th best for rookies, and his 4 game winning goals were 4th most for a rookie. Svagrovsky ‘s strong play helped lead Seattle to their first US Division title. His success continued in the playoffs. In 15 games he recorded 10 points (4 goals, 6 assists), which 6th most for a rookie.
2003-04: Unfortunately for Svagrovsky, he could not carry over the success from his rookie year to his sophomore season. He all but disappeared from the stat sheets, playing in 52 games, and recording 17 points (6 goals, 11 assists). Seattle was counting on a big season from Svagrovsky, but he let the team down and Seattle failed to make the playoffs.
2004-05: After being drafted in the 4th round by the Avalanche, Svagrovsky spent the season playing in the CHL for the Colorado Eagles. Svagrovsky failed to recover from his struggles the year before. He played 35 games and only compiled 1 goal and 3 assists. Colorado failed to make the playoffs.

If you have been close to the Bitcoin space, you may have heard of the so-called scaling debate that is going on at the moment. We referenced some of this discussion in one of our posts on the 2017 outlook on Bitcoin.
Bitcoin does numerous things, of which one is to serve primarily as a payment system. Bitcoin’s blockchain currently has a capacity limit of 1MB (of information) for each block that is created and added to the chain. In reality, 1MB on its own does not hold much information. As a result, transactions ready to move through the network become stuck waiting until the next block is created. That means at best, a 10 minute wait is expected for each new block to come along. Those who want Bitcoin to succeed as a payment system don’t like the idea of waiting 10 minutes for each block confirmation on a transaction, especially when on MasterCard and Visa transactions are nearly instantaneous.
In practise the limited block size creates a serious backup of transactions waiting for confirmations, to the extent that a bottleneck now exists on the network. If Bitcoin is to succeed in becoming a practical form of sending payments, then finding a way to increase traffic needs to be achieved through scaling of the network.
Various groups have proposed different methods of increasing the block size to enable more transactions to move through the network, and faster.
Segwit is the short name for Segregated Witness. The witness is the signature in the transaction as one of the main parties along with the sender and the receiver. More information can be included in the 1 MB block if the signature portion, the witness, is segmented from the rest of the transaction. The real net increase is expected to enable Bitcoin blocks to hold ~2MB of information or twice what they hold now. This is considered a ‘soft fork’ or minor change in the Bitcoin Core software.
Unlike Segwit, Bitcoin Unlimited is a hard fork, which means Bitcoin may end up having two blockchains. It’s a divergent change like picking which side of a fork in the road you will take in your car. The road untaken would be the current Bitcoin core software and the one taken, if approved, would be Bitcoin Unlimited. The argument Bitcoin Unlimited makes is that it can scale up the maximum block size as needed starting with a 2MB increase.
Earlier versions, however, report Bitcoin Unlimited client issues when reading some Segwit transactions. New code is constantly tested and will be fixed but one of the important pieces of the report is that network nodes and miners will have to choose as they will not be able to read transactions from both networks. It will be a true fork where a direction must be chosen.
Both have their advantages and disadvantages and both have their advocates and detractors. As a company, Magnr does not take an official stance other than our CEO Joe Lee’s post on what we will do in the event of a hard fork.
After record low volatility in 2016, we have seen huge increases in volatility during the first quarter of 2017; much of which has been attributed to the current scaling debate. Volatility based on this uncertainty, as well as decisions made by the development community, the miners, and users like you mean that there are plenty of opportunities to trade Bitcoin on your Magnr account.
At this time it would be difficult to know exactly what will happen to the price. What we can expect is for the volatility to continue for a while yet, especially if a hard fork were to take ever place. This will present long, short or even both long and shorting opportunities to trade on the moving price of Bitcoin.
Accessibility to multiple liquid exchanges, leverage, and the security of multi-signature wallet technology mean that you have choices and security when trading or investing your Bitcoin with us, regardless of which direction the price goes during this latest ongoing debate.

In To Build a Ship, Don Berry explores the extent to which a man can betray himself and his morality for a dream or obsession. It's the story of a handful of settlers who take up land on the beautiful Tillamook Bay in the early 1850s--defiant dreamers battling the wilderness. With forested mountains at their backs and the open sea as their sole road to trade, they are suddenly isolated from the outside world when the only captain who would enter their harbor dies. With the survival of their new settlement threatened, they decide to build their own schooner. At first the challenge brings out the best in the men, but the tension of their gigantic purpose overtakes them. Obstacles accumulate and complications mount: a death, a murder trial, trouble with restive Indians, and finally a travesty of justice. Excitement, shock, and gripping drama mark this story of men pushed to the point of madness as they see the Morning Star of Tillamook slowly take shape on the wild Pacific shore. Don Berry's novels about the Oregon Territory are as rich and compelling today as when they were first published more than forty years ago. These new editions of Trask, Moontrap, and To Build a Ship include an introduction by Jeff Baker, book critic for The Oregonian.
In the predawn hours, a woman's marriage crumbles with a single confession. Across town, an immigrant family struggles to get by in the land of opportunity. Three thousand miles away, a soldier wakes up in hospital with the vague feeling he's done something awful. In a single moment, these disparate lives intersect. Faced with seemingly insurmountable loss, each person must decide whether to give in to despair, or to find the courage and resilience to rise. We Are Called to Rise is a story about a child's fate. It is a story about families - the ones we have and the ones we make. It challenges us to think about our responsibilities to each other while reminding us that compassion and charity can rescue even our darkest moments.

This giclée print measures 15" x 30" in inches. This print is a limited edition print of only 3, signed and dated by Pegge Hopper. Created in Hawaii.
Shipping for items above 150 USD are complimentary for U.S. orders. International shipping is available, please visit the contact page for full policy details.
In 1963 Pegge Hopper had recently moved to Hawaii where she currently lives and began painting portraits of Hawaiian women after coming across archives of old photographs. Hawaiian women lying on the beach, playing their ukuleles, and greeting the boats inspired her art and forged her unique aesthetic as an artist. Originally done as an acrylic painting in the 1980s, these prints are a limited edition of 3. Signed and dated by the artist.
Pegge Hopper was born in Oakland, California. She studied painting at the Los Angeles Art Center College of Design. In 1956, she worked in New York for Raymond Loewy Associates. Living in Milan, Italy from 1961-1963, she was an illustrator for LaRinascente. Pegge came to Honolulu in 1963 and was an art director for a local agency. After visiting the State Archives and seeing old photographs of native Hawaiians, she was inspired to start painting again. Her gallery opened in 1983 in Honolulu's Historic Chinatown.

Data released today by Ofcom has revealed that nearly 40% of UK households now subscribe to Netflix, Amazon Prime or Now TV. The 15.4 million subscriptions have now passed the 15.1 million who pay for Sky, BT, Virgin and other satellite/cable providers.
The media regulator has said that British TV will now have to reflect on the way it operates should it want to compete with these giants in the future.
Sharon White, Ofcom’s chief executive, says: “We’d love to see broadcasters such as the BBC work collaboratively with ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 so that they have got that scale to compete globally, making shows together, co-producing great shows that all of us can watch.
Ofcom warns broadcasters could go the way of high street retailers, reports @ITVJoel https://t.co/8epnqWStCR pic.twitter.com/h5RCF7SLLT
The new data shows that the long growth of traditional pay TV services stopped last year with a revenue decline of 2.4%. Advertising revenue was also down by 7%.
However, Sky and other similar pay TV services made much more money than their new online rivals, with revenues of £6.4 billion versus £895 million for subscription video on demand services.
The number of hours spent watching traditional TV schedules also continued to drop. Teenagers and young people now watch around 40% less than they did seven years ago.
Viewing among five to 15-year-olds dropped by 15% in 2017 and by 12% for 16 to 24-year-olds. These figures also include TV that is recorded and watched within seven days after broadcast.

Last time, I told you how French could be an awful language to learn. But today I will show you why French is a very cool language.
I already told you about the similarities; the vocabulary is similar, there are more sounds in common in French and English than you may think, and finally, the sentences’ forms are quite the same, so it’s quite fast and easy to make some French basic conversations.
If you have read all my articles (I hope so) you already know that France is an intercontinental country (Check my article about French regions if you don’t know anything about DOM-TOM) But there are also very strong French speaking communities, especially in Africa (If you like history, you must know all the “Françafrique stuff), but also in North America (French is an official language in Canada as English) And even some parts in South Asia, where some South Eastern Asian countries still recognize French as a second or minor language (If you like history you must also know all the “Indochine” stuff) All those countries are part of the International Organization of Francophonie. This organization consists of all the countries with French as a foreign language but also those that use it as a second or minor language, but also some countries which link to French at some point in history and also observer members. And this is why French is learned as a second language almost everywhere.
Indeed, there is not just one French language, French can be spoken in a lot of different ways. And all languages have some literary, familiar, formal, vulgar ways to be spoken. French has one hundred faces. And there are many reasons for this, especially the fact that French has been and still is a language of literature.
The French literary speaking is very complex and complete; there is different word for so many concepts and so many ways to conjugate. By using formal French, you are using 8 different tenses (5 for the past), distributed in 7 modes, so the possibilities are huge. The lexica are so enormous, that I personally, use a dictionary when I read a book in my own language.
There is also the “Verlan”. If you didn’t know about it, this is basically a practice consisting to reverse the syllable of a word, and it is used a lot. By example: Louche/Chelou which can mean equivocal, seamy. Lour/ Relou, which mean heavy but that is used as “rubbish”. Matte/Tema, that is an unformal word for “look”, etc. For the funny tips, there is also a double “verlan” word: “Feumeu” which is the verlan of “Meuf” which is the verlan of “Femme” which means woman *mind blow*.
The last thing is the French habit to use words with a different meaning and to invent. If you are good in French, you can still be quite confused when you are listening French people. Indeed, we like to use words differently and many people have little language gimmicks, so some sentences will sound weird to you.
It might look very rubbish, but in fact it is very cool to be able to use so many ways to say something. French is a language with which you can compose!
In 2010, over 30 percent of the oil and 11 percent of the natural gas produced in the United States was produced in the Gulf of Mexico.
Louisiana’s offshore oil and natural gas industry is critical to the United States both from an energy supply perspective and due to its contribution to U.S. gross domestic product. Natural resource exploration and production operations off our state’s coast stimulate many sectors of the economy, creating jobs, contributing to GDP and generating significant tax revenue at every level of government.
The Gulf offshore oil and natural gas industry is a significant provider of employment in the U.S. Due to the economic downturn, the deepwater moratorium and slowdown in permitting for offshore activities in the Gulf, total employment (direct, indirect and induced jobs) associated with offshore Gulf oil and natural gas industry investments reached its lowest level in 2010.
Over 60,000 of these jobs were within the oil and natural gas industry and 180,000 were either indirect (providing equipment and services to the offshore Gulf oil and natural gas industry) or induced jobs.
An analysis by IHS Global Insight of the economic contribution to the Gulf States from offshore oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico shows that independent oil and gas companies account for about half of the nearly 400,000 jobs; $70 billion in economic values; and $20 billion in federal, state, and local revenue generated by the industry in 2009.
Experts estimate that by 2020 an exclusion of the independents from the Gulf of Mexico would eliminate 300,000 jobs and result in a loss of $147 billion in federal, state, and local taxes from the Gulf region over 10 years. If the independents are excluded just from the deepwater, the losses would be 265,000 jobs by 2020 and $106 billion in tax revenues over the 10-year period.

An experienced personal injury attorney Bucks County residents should know, can easily gather all the necessary evidence, file the paperwork and successful argue your case in court.
There are many situations that may lead to an injuries lawsuit. For instance, a dentist can extract the wrong tooth from a patient. A surgeon may also leave surgical equipment or supplies inside the body of a patient. A taxi driver can also cause an accident that causes serious injury to their passenger. In all these cases, the service provider owed the client a duty of care but was negligent or careless, thereby causing their client serious harm.
This type of lawsuit is meant to achieve a number of goals. For one, it aims to seek compensation for the loss or pain and suffering associated with the injuries. Secondly, it serves to recover funds to cover medical bills, therapy costs and rehabilitation expenses of the victim, if needed. Thirdly, the suit also aims to provide the victims with a sense of justice. After all, if you lost a leg or became paralyzed, no amount of money will be sufficient.
The beauty of hiring a personal injury lawyer is that you will not need to spend a single dime. This is because the best attorneys only take cases they are confident of winning. If the court rules in your favor at the end of the case, the attorney will simply deduct their fees and forward the remaining amount to you.
Experience is a key factor to consider when hiring a lawyer. Always check the number of years the lawyer has been handling this type of cases. Be sure to also check the number of cases the attorney has handled in the recent years.

For instance, there are lawyers who only handle car accident cases well as those who only handle slip and fall cases. To get the best legal representation, you should hire a lawyer who normally handles cases like yours.

After all, you might get sued by a patient, client or a victim of an auto accident that you are considered to be at fault. Whatever the case, the lawyer will ensure you do not pay a single cent, or that you pay the lowest amount possible.

This also means you be prepared for any arising legal issues. Advance preparation is key because any businesses can have legal issues at any given time. When considering business litigation New York City residents should have knowledge of what is expected.

This will enable any businesses to run smoothly and efficiently. Besides, it helps to know the best time to hire professionals. With some understanding of commercial litigation, even small businessmen are able to keep their companies protected from legal issues.
This form of litigation involves resolution of disputes that relate to companies. It is defined as the practice of law in dealing with legally arising issues from commercial and business relationships. When the issues arise, you have to hire professional attorneys to assist them. The attorney evaluates, handles and resolves the arising issues before state and federal courts.
It is a form of litigation which may involve dealing with issues between two different firms or between partners who might have transacted business previously. This kind of litigation is never between two consumers or clients and firms. Nevertheless, when you get attorneys with the right reputation and with vast experience, they can handle such cases too. People with companies should appreciate that success is dependent on relationships with different stakeholders.
In most cases, dealing with ugly disputes or contractual matters may tarnish quality reputation that has been built over the years. This may result in significant losses and damages. There are various litigation disputes which have an impact on small business owners. One of them involves franchise issues. When it comes to establishment of new franchises, professionals are required to handle the business on behalf of the client.
There also exist disputes between partners and shareholders. Business owners facing damages that are potentially damaging because of partnerships or shareholders can be helped when they contact the right attorneys. There also is fraud litigation in which one party knowingly lies in the contract documents. This is mostly done with the aim of enticing partners or companies into accepting misleading agreements or deals.
Litigators will also help with insurance cases whereby a firm has a dispute as concerns cover between insurers and the insured. There are also cases in which there is breach of contract in which business people are protected when one party fails to adhere to terms of a contract. The fortunate thing is that most such issues can be well handled by the average attorney.
It is important to be prepared for cases. Discussing some sensitive matters can make clients uncomfortable. It is important to take time to understand what litigation aspects the company is vulnerable to. For those considering growing or expanding their businesses, these kinds of services come into play.

This is a video that everyone needs to see. The message that it gives... it's just, well... Just watch it & you'll understand.
Hell was rather, ah... hellish. Heh. By the way, the Hell jokes were flying like mad and the church garage will forever be known as Hell. I think it'll be a little hard to forget since the smell of it is kinda soaked into the walls. We burned hair between each group to it nice & icky smelling & we had a heater going as well. It was usually between 100 - 110 degrees. The guys were so proud of themselves the night they got it up to 115. The source of the truly horrid smell. One night, we must've gotten a batch that had gel or hairspray in it, 'cause that one really made everyone tear up & start choking.
The fella in the red shirt is the guy who was in charge of Hell. He said his employees at work loved telling him to "go to Hell" at the end of the day.
A couple of the techie guys. They handled the sound effects, the Satans' voice changers, the strobe lights & the fog machines. By the way, don't breathe fog machine fog. Stuff's icky. Seriously.
One of the parts of Hell. There were two parts, first a conference between Satan & a couple of his demons, then they all went over to the section pictured above, where the "dead" kid from the story discovered where he was before being attacked & dragged out by the hooded demons.
The whole gang - Satans, demons, dead boys & techs. Well, most of the gang. Several of us were taking the pictures.
Our church did Judgement House this year. The Mothership & I were on the makeup team. I would help in the makeup room, then head over to Hell to be available for touch-ups. The last night though, I got to be one of the hooded demons. Most of my pictures are of Hell, demons & the makeup room. There are a few of the dead folks & the crash scene. Demonized me... there's a hood on the cloak that covers most of my head.
Two of the demons & one of the kids in the story who was sent to Hell. The two on the left are siblings.
Satan & his minions hanging out in Purgatory, the trailer that was available for us to chill out in. Football is apparently popular in Hell, as is America's Next Top Band ( or whatever it's called.)
The two Satans - the one on the left is our worship pastor & the other is a son of our associate pastor. They had voice changers, which are what the white cords belong to.
The last night, after the last group went through, we had the folks who were in charge of the whole shebang come over & we did an extra performance, with quite a few tweaks. Instead of saying "Silence" like the original line called for, Satan told his demons to "Shut yer pie-hole!" When the hooded demons were supposed to attack the "dead" kid, instead of dragging him out, we pulled him up & did a little song & chorus-line dance to... well, I can't for the life of me remember what we sang, but it was funny. There were a bunch more, but there was too much for me to a.) remember & b.) explain coherently.
Hello. Welcome to a small corner of my (slightly) twisted brain. Feel free to leave a comment if you so desire. However, be warned that those who lack the intelligence to speak without cussing, taking the Lord's name in vain, etc. will become my personal performing monkey. The last one joined the union and began demanding higher wages. No way was I going upgrade to chocolate-covered bananas! All the chocolate belongs to me! Ahahahaha Ahahaha Ahaha- umm... pardon me. Carry on.

I was doing some research for my next zombie project & I came across numerous incidents where natural or man-made disasters have led to disease outbreaks of various sorts – cholera is always a big one with infected water supplies etc.
Got me thinking, much of our emergency planning against ghouls has assumed a reasonable if ineffective level of governance. Suppose the framework of law & order was already damaged by say a flood, a quake etc. Once you start working it through your mind, it is a very sinister scenario…..
I am commissioning some research as we speak but I am convinced that the zombie virus will use ‘break out’ in areas which have suffered disasters – in addition, what impact will global warming have on the zombie menace?
Give what you can. These organisations can help get the people in places such as Haiti & Chile up & running. I & many others are ready with our cricket bats, guns & axes to help clear out any zombie outbreaks which follow.

We believe Life Groups are one of the best places to foster significant relationships and growth with each other. They provide a great way to connect with a smaller group of people that are brought together by topics/interests, activities, meals, and fellowship. Life Groups are a safe place to be known, encouraged, celebrated, and challenged. The format and atmosphere of each Life Group will be different depending on the leaders and the people in the group, but they all exist to help people connect with each other and with God.

Matthew 12:33-35 Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.

In this defect, one of these arteries (usually the left coronary artery) is abnormally formed. Rather than connecting with a coronary vein, as in the normal heart, it enters one of the heart chambers, usually on the right side. (Note the point of entry on the diagram below left, indicated by a circle.) In rare cases, the abnormal coronary artery may enter the aorta or pulmonary artery, or one of their branches, rather than a heart chamber.
A fistula is an abnormal connection between two hollow organs in the body - in this case, a coronary artery and a chamber of the heart, or another vessel.
ABG (arterial blood gas): a test that tells how much oxygen is in the blood and how well the child is breathing.
Angiocardiography: a specialized x-ray of the heart. A fluid that shows up on xray is injected in to a vessel or chamber of the heart to make a detailed picture.
Anticoagulant: medication used to prevent blood clots or stabilize existing blood clots. Also commonly called a blood thinner.
Aorta: the main artery that supplies the blood and oxygen to the body. It usually comes off the left ventricle (main pumping chamber).
Aortic valve: the valve between the aorta and the left ventricle (main pumping chamber). The aortic valve usually has three leaflets.
Atrial Septum: the muscular wall between the two collecting chambers of the heart (left atrium and right atrium).
Atrium: one of the two upper chambers of the heart. The right atrium collects unoxygenated blood (blue blood) from the body. The left atrium collects oxygenated blood from the lungs.
Bacterial Endocarditis: an infection of the inner layer and/or valves of the heart, caused by bacteria.
Blood Pressure: the pressure of the blood in the arteries. Systolic blood pressure is the top number when the heart is contracted. Diastolic blood pressure is the bottom number when the heart is relaxed.
Catheterization: a diagnostic test in which a catheter is inserted into the heart to measure pressure and oxygen, and to take pictures (angiography).
Congestive heart failure: a condition in which the heart cannot pump well enough, and there is backup of blood and congestion in the veins and lungs.
Cyanosis: blueness of the lips and fingernails, caused by a decreased amount of oxygen in the blood.
Hemodynamics: the study of the flow of blood and the pressures in the heart, usually measured during a catheterization.
Leads: the small wires connected to the child's chest by sticky pads which allow measurement of the electrocardiogram.
Murmur: an extra heart sound that may be heard between the normal heart sounds. Murmurs may be normal or abnormal. They are caused by increased turbulence of the blood as it moves through the heart, much like water flowing over rocks in a stream.
Myocardial Infarction: heart muscle which dies because of lack of oxygen, usually called a heart attack when it occurs in an adult.
Open Heart Surgery: surgery performed on the open heart while the blood flow is diverted through the heart lung machine.
Shunt: an abnormal passage of blood between two blood vessels or between the two sides of the heart.
Ventricle: one of the two lower chambers of the heart. The left ventricle pumps to the aorta and supplies blood to the body. The right ventricle pumps to the pulmonary artery and supplies blood to the lungs.

A strand of spider silk is five times stronger than a steel cable of the same weight, said Hannes Schniepp of the Department of Applied Science at William & Mary. His lab has been unraveling the secrets behind the strength of the brown recluse spider.
Their latest discovery is a surprise: The brown recluse does not spin a single strand of protein fiber.
“We were expecting to find that the fiber was a single mass,” Schniepp explained. “But what we found was that the silk was actually a kind of tiny cable.”
The discovery comes on top of a 2017 report from the same lab revealing that another factor in the strength of brown recluse silk comes from loops spun into the structure. The work is funded by the National Science Foundation. Spider silk is an important topic as its strength and toughness makes synthetic spider silk something of a “holy grail” of materials science and engineering.
“Understanding the reasons why spider silk has increased mechanical toughness compared to insect silks has been a primary motivator for a number of studies, as well as the desire to produce large quantities of spider silk synthetically in the laboratory. From this perspective, the results being reported provide an interesting clue to the ‘tricks of the trade’ that nature has in producing amazing materials,” says NSF program director Mohan Srinivasarao, who helped fund the research.
“Understanding the properties of brown recluse silk at the molecular level not only provides insights into one of nature’s toughest materials, it may also provide a pathway for the design of other synthetic materials,” he added.
Schniepp and Qijue Wang, a graduate student in applied science, described their findings in a paper, “Strength of Recluse Spider’s Silk Originates from Nanofibrils,” in ACS Macro Letters, a highly-cited journal of the American Chemical Society. They used an extremely sensitive technique known as atomic force microscopy to examine the structure of the spider silk at the molecular level.
“It turns out that the fiber is made of a number of nanostrands,” Schniepp said. “Each nanostrand is a thin thread made of protein, less than a millionth of an inch in diameter.”
The paper reports that a typical recluse-silk filament is made up of around 2,500 nanostrands. Schniepp and Wang developed a detailed structural model of the silk, revealing also other interesting characteristics of the recluse’s cable structure.
Scientists have long known that recluse silk is flat, rather than round, in cross section. Curiously, Schniepp and Wang report that the nanostrands, or nanofibrils, that make up the cable are not braided or twisted like rope, but rather are arranged in parallel.
It’s difficult to describe just how thin a recluse ribbon is. Even that old standby of thinness, the human hair, proves to be unsatisfactory.
“How do you compare thickness of a round hair to a flat ribbon?” Schniepp asked. “That’s a bit of a tricky one if you want to be accurate.”
He added that an accurate comparison takes into account not only the thickness of the recluse ribbon, which is a thousand times less than the thickness of a hair, but also the fact that the cross-section of the hair is ten times that of the silk strand. Consequently, Schniepp said, the silk cross-section is 1/10,000th that of a human hair.
Schniepp and Wang also found that the individual nanostrands are easily separated from one another, indicating that the bonds between the nanofibrils are relatively weak. But they also found that one key to the strength of the silk structure lies in the length of each individual nanostrand.
Scientists have proposed a number of models to explain spider silk’s organizational makeup and what that structure contributes to the desirable and important properties of toughness and strength. Schniepp says that the structure proposed in the paper is the simplest and most elegant of the major models.
“We believe that the secret of brown recluse spider silk essentially stems from the individual nanofibril,” he said.

Hi everybody, hope you've had a great weekend. Fox News is programming all Sunday night leading up to the crucial Iowa caucuses. Tomorrow is crunch time for the candidates, but none more than Senator Ted Cruz who has staked all on this unique state, heavily Evangelical and almost all white. If he can't stop an urban New York values sinner like Donald Trump here, then Cruz is toast.

Both right and left say they are angry with the direction of the country. In broad strokes the right says President Obama has over-reached and has done too much with Obamacare and executive orders on issues like immigration reform. The left says President Obama has under-reached and not done enough about climate change, income inequality and student loans.
It just shows how wide is the partisan divide. Watch Hannity tonight at 10pm ET to find my predictions on who wins Iowa tomorrow. Thx

“[Shinjitsu]…is a word that describes the Buddha’s Supreme Enlightenment (which is sometimes expressed as ‘True Suchness’). It is ‘true’ (shin) in the sense it is absolute and eternal, and ‘real’ (jitsu) because it is not merely conceptual or ideal but actually works to dispel illusion and realizes (makes real) Enlightenment…The Buddha appears in the world of birth-and-death to save all beings and ‘returns’ with them to the true world of Enlightenment. This movement goes from the absolute truth of the Buddha-dharma (the Dharma-in-itself) into the world where it actually works, causing others to realize Enlightenment.” (Collected works of Shinran, Part I, p. 213, nota 29)
New Delhi: Pope Francis on June 22 appointed an apostolic administrator to tackle the prevailing “grave and worrying ecclesiastical situation of divisions” existing in Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese in Kerala.
The Pope has replaced current administrator of the archdiocese, Bishop Sebastian Adayanthrath, with Bishop Jacob Manathodath of Palghat.
A terse note from the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI) says the information about the appointment came from the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and that it was announced at noon in Rome and its corresponding time in India.
Another press release from the Syro-Malabar Church headquarters says Bishop Manathodath will continue to head the Palghat diocese.
The press release says Cardinal George Alencherry, the head of the Syro-Malabar Church, will remain the metropolitan archbishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese.
Bishops Adayanthrath and Jose Puthenveettil will continue in their current post as the auxiliary of the archdiocese, says the press release issued by Father Jimmy Poochakkatt, the Syro-Malabar public relations officer.
The press note says the appointment was made in consideration of the “special circumstances” prevailing in the archdiocese.
Bishop Manathodath is taking over a diocese beset with internal problems. A section of priests had accused Cardinal Alencherry of incurring huge losses for the archdiocese through some questionable land deals. The controversy led to the formation of camps within the Syro-Malabar Church supporting and opposing the cardinal.
Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, notes a “grave and worrying ecclesiastical situation” in the archdiocese because of division between the clergy, auxiliary bishops and the major archbishop.
“It will be Your Excellency’s task to seek healing for these fractures and eventually to propose solutions that require the intervention of the Synod of Bishop,” says a letter from the prefect addressed to Bishop Manathodath.
Cardinal Sandri wants the new administrator to find those responsible for these divisions and proceed against them for wounding Church unity “with unfounded allegations” that lacked “the spirit of obedience and ecclesial sense” and led to public scandal damaging the Syro-Malabar Church, the larger of the two Oriental Catholic rites in India.
The Vatican official says the new administrator should consult and inform the major archbishop about his decisions, but should not involve him in the decisions regarding Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese. The Vatican congregation allows the administrator to form a synodal committee to assist him in these tasks. However, the committee will have only consultative role and its suggestions will not be decisive or binding on the administrator, Cardinal Sandri clarifies.
The administrator has to send a monthly report on the measures taken to the pontifical congregation. He could also seek counsel and assistance from the Apostolic Nuncio based in New Delhi, says the letter signed by Cardinal Sandri and Father Lorenzo Lorusso, undersecretary of the congregation.
With the appointment of the administrator, archdiocesan consultation group, finance committee, priests’ council, laity council and other group will remain suspended. The administrator could change them or revamp them, Father Poochakkatt’s press note says.
Bishop Manathodath, originally from Ernakulam, was appointed the Palghat bishop on November 11, 1996. The 71-year-old prelate is a member of the CBCI Office for Healthcare.
He was ordained a priest on November 4, 1972 after philosophical and theological studies in Papal Seminary, Pune. He has a doctorate in theology from Gregorian University, Rome. He was appointed the auxiliary bishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese in 1992.
There is no mention of taking names in the holy mass to be used canonically…in ernakulam diocese… Too many Rt.Revs are there… Any way the intercession of the people in everyday mas is a must for the new administrator.. Better to avoid two and use the one new for easiness.the new one is saintly person backbone behind many real renewal movement by diocesan priests in Kerala and through them to abroad and laymovements.. He is big promise for lay movements… He can use some people like Santhosh T of Christine, bennypunnathara of shalom etc.. (Though they are not ernakulam based accepted by all) In taking decision and decrement who are champions of new evangelization through Keralalites… It will help shut down the pride of the clerics…
The true power of the Church is Voluntary poverty or the self imposed poverty of the Priests and Religious in every sphere. Gandhi once said
“Complex problems have no easy solutions,” said one of the earliest church fathers, St.Benedict in the sixth century. He was a Church Father who wrote the rules for Religious, ‘Regula Benedicti’ which became the foundations of Religious life of all colors.
So is the case of the Oriental Church beset with complex problems. What we need is patience and charity to one another till things are amicably settled. There should not be any winners or losers, rather the We Spirit must prevail. Bishop Manathodath is known as a compassionate and understanding man, scholar and a man who can bring the warring factions into a settlement.
Evangelizing those in positions of humble service to the flock is an ongoing need worldwide. We need to pray for the conversion of those in uniforms and displaying other decorations.
This decision should be much earlier.We can pray to GOD almighty the Administrator can take good decisions to satisfy different groups with out LOOSING FAITH and MORE MONEY.This chance is for giving suggestions There will not happen such type of Financial corruptions NO MORE IN XERO MALABAR Church in any Bishops Regim.Now it is the Best chance to give suggestions and the wealth will be with the LAYMEN also.
We Wont Judge any body or Find will bring guilty any body. We can HOPE the Decision will bring PEACE in our Community

A little history, set your wayback machine all the way back to 1974, I went to the mall where my mom worked one weekend, and there was this guy, he had the coolest machine and he was making all this stuff with just that one machine! that’s my rough approximation of when I first learned about the Shopsmith. I bugged my parents for years following that, I just ‘knew’ that I could so so much really cool stuff if I had one. Forward to this past summer. My uncle decides he ...

I built the Guillemot, on the left in the photo, about six years ago, the Newfound explorer, on the right, five years ago. The Guillemot is all strips in Cedar, Spruce, and Mahagony. The Explorer is a Hybrid, Cedar strip deck and 1/8” Okume ply hull.
I’m always impressed with kayaks and canoes. They are truly functional art. Maybe someday I’ll try one. These are exceptional, Steve.
I’ve had plans for (and dreams of building) the Guillemot for a few years. Both these boats are just beautiful. Great work!
“I’ve had plans for (and dreams of building) the Guillemot for a few years. Both these boats are just beautiful. Great work!”
Those are stunning, Steve. Well done. That cedar strip is so cool looking. I once built a wooden canoe and it was one of the most enjoyable projects that I have done.
These are just as cool as your teardrops, Steve. Very, very impressive. Thanks for the tip on Nick Shade. Living in Minnesota, it’s only a matter of time before I get around to making one of these.

That’s a great looking boat. I started a Guillemot about three years ago and still haven’t finished it. The deck and the hull are still waiting to be joined. Maybe when it warms up again in the Spring. Good job.

Sorry I maybe should have put this in the coffee lounge haha!! We are living on a lake now with a million dollar view…but the house isnt worth that much and is old and has only one bathroom…soooo “for emergencies only” I decided to build an outhouse next to my shop. Anyone have any dimensions or ideas? I seen a couple posts on tuis topic. I’m thinking of using pallets and old hardware to make it look old:) Thanks!!
Glad you included that last bit about the portable toilet. I was seeing vision of you locked in your outhouse
A 2 X 4 nailed between two trees works well. If you want to get fancy a sheet of used roofing overhead is nice on rainy days.
Before you stick a portable toilet in there, you might want to consider who gets to clean it. You say for “emergency use only” but…. what’s that mean in terms of how frequently you think it will get used? We had a chemical toilet at a cottage we used to go to. Very old building, no indoor potty except for the chemical toilet. It got emptied DAILY… not weekly. It was also a very rudimentary toilet. Almost just a 5 gallon pail with a toilet seat.
Another place I went… because of proximity to water and all that, used a disposable bag type toilet. There was something in the bag that solidified liquid and deoderized solid waste. It all had to be packed out. But then went into trash I think…can’t remember that part exactly. VERY clean system, but the bags were about a buck apiece.
In a pinch you can make your own bagging toilet. Into each bag you put a scoop of kitty litter and a scoop of peat moss. After use, you cover whatever is in there with another scoop of peat moss. If you put a teasoon or maybe even a little less of something like RidX in the bag before closing it up for removal, you can basically get the stuff composting, but it needs air eventually or it become anaerobic instead of aerobic and then it gets stinky regardless of what you’re composting…. could be vegetables and lawn clippings. Same idea.
This is mine. Its simple and if the door is left open it has a sweet view of the lake. It was placed over a big deep crack in the limestone so every fall I throw a couple of cups of lime down the poop shoot and its empty every spring …….never has to be cleaned out : )). Its probably 15 years old now.
Check with the health department before you do anything! Many places have strict rules about placing such things near a river, stream or lake. We used to stay at a campground at the edge of the Great Smoky Mountain NP. There were portapotties in some areas instead of permanent restrooms/showers. I was told the ordinance prohibited septic tanks within a certain distance of water- stream, river, lake.
I needed to build a small rustic tool shed and I came up with the idea of building one the looked like an outhouse. I was able to find a plan on the Louisiana Agricultural Department’s website.
These plans are similar to what I built: http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/our_offices/departments/biological_ag_engineering/features/extension/building_plans/recreation/equipment/pittype+privy.htm
Would be easy to make a rack to hold it OR just put it on the rear of your truck and park it next to the shop :-)
I’d put in another bathroom. Seriously, what if a neighbor smells it or has to watch people coming and going from it? Unless you are the only one around for miles I wouldn’t bother. And do you really want to empty someone elses’ crap?
Just do not use camouflage toilet paper as on for my hunting buds did. He put it down to do his thing and then could not find the TP.

All of the espresso machines we tested only included a single boiler for heating. This means that there's only one mechanism for heating both the water for brewing and the steamer wand. Because of this, it'll take the steamer wand a while to heat up after pulling the espresso shot, since the steamer wand operates at a much higher temperature than the brewing temperature of around 195°F. It is possible to buy a home machine with a double boiler (Breville makes one) but this raises the price significantly (we didn't test the Breville because it's over $1,000), and the minor wait time wasn't a major concern for us. We figured it wouldn't be for home brewers either.
For the first time in the entire history of coffee, finally, in 1906, people could enjoy coffee made expressly for them: espresso. (I told you I would get back to this). And, while rumor has it the first espresso tasted pretty bad - watery and bitter, they say - the Italians stuck with it, perfecting it, marketing it, teaching people how to enjoy it.
That said, there is a true magic to having espresso at home, making yourself a cappuccino in your pajamas, and avoiding awkwardly waiting around the end of a bar with a cluster of strangers, all desperate to grab the first latte that hits the counter. Espresso is hard, but that doesn't mean it's impossible—especially if you're easy to please, ready to practice, and up for a good culinary challenge. There are lots of resources available online for learning how to make good espresso: Look up videos on YouTube, read articles and DIY books, and don't be too shy to ask your favorite barista for pointers—many of us love getting geeky on the technical stuff with our favorite customers.
“I like the Technivorm Moccamaster because, from a scientific standpoint, it creates the proper water temperature (and temperature consistency) for good extraction of flavor from the beans. That’s the problem with most cheap automatics — they’re inconsistent about temperature. It also has a shower-head design for good water dispersion and saturation of the grounds. It consistently tastes almost (almost, I stress) as good as a manual drip.” — Andrew Chou, engineer, General Motors
“On mornings when I don’t make a pour-over (weigh out the water, the beans, all that fun stuff), the Capresso drip machine yields the cleanest-tasting cup that brings out beans’ floral flavors, without burning the grinds or yielding an overly acidic cup. It’s also got a built-in, conical burr grinder, which saves you from having to buy a separate gadget, too.” — Kat Odell, author of Day Drinking
We opted to look only at “entry level” machines — those billed as semi-automatic and super-automatic — meaning they do some of the work for you. Manual machines, the third type, allow for more personalization but require a much longer learning curve and aren’t typically a good fit for first-time users. We also skipped models that couldn’t steam milk, ensuring that the best espresso maker is also the best cappuccino maker.
Tamp: To ensure the espresso is evenly packed, your machine comes with a tamp, which you’ll press into the basket against the grounds. This step is important: When you pull a shot, the water will go to the place of least resistance, avoiding densely packed areas. This denser espresso won’t be properly saturated, making it under-extracted and sour, while the looser espresso will be over-extracted and bitter.
These machines automatically grind the coffee, tamp it, and extract the espresso shot. The operator only has to fill the bean hopper and, if the machine is not connected to a water line, add water to a reservoir. Some models contain an automated milk frothing and dispensing device. Super-automatic machines take away the ability to manually tamp and grind the coffee, which may affect the quality of the espresso.
Whip up a quick cup of coffee for your breakfast with the sleek and stylish Cuisinart Classic Percolator. A must-have countertop appliance, this percolator makes sure that your morning coffee rituals are refreshing and energetic. Featuring immaculate lines and a fine finesse, it has a classic design that looks great with most kitchen decors. The Classic Percolator from Cuisinart is made from stainless steel and lexan plastic for optimum sturdiness and durability. It has a silver finished body...
A portafilter (or group handle) attaches to the grouphead of semi-automatic and piston-driven espresso machines, and carries a tamped puck of coffee grounds within its basket. It is usually made of brass for better heat retention, and is attached by a plastic or wooden handle. The portafilter forms a seal with the espresso machine's gasket, and directs high-pressure hot water through the coffee puck. After-market retailers also sell bottomless portafilters that minimize the espresso's contact with any metal. A bottomless portafilter is one tool baristas use to analyze the quality of the coffee grind and the evenness of the extraction and allows for a visual check of "channeling" or the condition in which water is able to pierce a hole in the espresso puck during the brew process leading to poor extraction. Often, baristas use knockboxes to store their spent espresso grounds after they have pulled a shot.
In recent years air-pump-driven espresso machines have emerged. These machines use compressed air to force the hot water through the coffee grounds. The hot water is typically added from a kettle or a thermo flask. The compressed air comes from either a hand-pump, N2 or CO2 cartridges or an electric compressor. One of the advantages of the air-pump-driven machines is that they are much smaller and lighter than electric machines. They are often handheld and portable. The first air-pump-driven machine was the AeroPress, which was invented by Alan Adler, an American inventor, and introduced in 2005. Handpresso Wild, invented by Nielsen Innovation SARL, a French innovation house, was introduced in 2007.
From there, it’s up to your personal preference. Arabica beans have a higher acidity, with notes of fruit and berries. Robusta beans are darker and richer, with more caffeine. Different levels of roasts — light, medium, dark — determine how much of the beans’ oils will break through the surface of the bean, which also affects acidity, flavor, and caffeine levels. “Get to know your local coffee expert,” recommends Awan. Nothing beats a conversation with a barista or local coffee roaster who can help you try different beans and roasts, and to experiment with those variables in real time. Finding your favorite is all part of the fun.
Maintenance is simple on any of our drip coffee makers, with full frontal access for cleaning, refilling water and changing the coffee filter. All our coffee machines are user-friendly, so that brewing perfect coffee is a convenient, stress-free experience. Keep your counters uncluttered with convenient cord storage, and bring a little elegance to your kitchen with our sleek and attractive designs.
The very first espresso machines worked on a steam-pressure basis, and they’re still in use today. With this type of machine, steam or steam pressure is used to force water through the coffee grounds and produce espresso. Some steam-driven machines can produce a measure of foam “crema.” But they can’t generate enough pressure or provide the precise temperature control necessary to produce true espresso: They simply make a very strong cup of coffee. However, they cost considerably less than pump-driven machines. Our verdict is that if you’re a true espresso lover and seeking to make a good shot at home, we recommend you steer clear of steam-driven machines. They’ll likely disappoint you.
The gist: This espresso maker by LavoHome comes with all the essentials: a glass carafe and cover, filter basket, and tamper. The little powerhouse boasts 800 watts of power and brews up to 20 ounces of rich espresso. In the mood for a latte or cappuccino instead? It also comes equipped with a powerful steamer to make all of your favorite coffeehouse beverages. The glass decanter comes with a cool-touch handle for safe and easy pouring once your brew is complete.
The machine is super easy to use: just choose either a single or double shot, select your coffee grounds, fill the milk and water reservoir and choose your brew. The water reservoir is removable, allowing for easy fill-up in the sink. The Café Barista also boasts the fastest preparation time when compared to other Mr. Coffee espresso makers. And at less than $200, this model is WAY less expensive than some of its competitors, giving you a great bang for your buck.
Water quality also plays a massive role in the way your coffee tastes. As we discovered in our review of the best water filters, water isn’t tasteless. Total dissolved solids (TDS) are what give “good tasting” water its sweetness — in fact, the SCAA recommends water with 150 milligrams per liter of TDS to brew coffee. (Want to check your water? A TDS reader is only about 15 bucks.)
What Amazon users have to say: It's a beast. In a good way. And by that we mean this thing is in it for the long haul. Aside from the astounding beverage quality and ease that the machine produces, one of the most consistent comments made is that the machine will last you a while. Several customer reviews go on to say how they've had the Magnifica for a long time and love it just as much as the day they bought it, even after using it multiple times a day for several years. The machine is obviously a bit pricier than the others on this list, but according to reviewers, the machine is so consistently good and efficient that it pays for itself several times over when you account for all the money you'll save by skipping out on the coffee shops.
Above all, good espresso requires precision. If you’re looking for phenomenal tasting notes, flavor balance, and texture, there is simply no room for error in the machine, the beans, the user, or even the weather. And even if you’re not holding out for the best coffee on the planet, the margin for error is still slim. To test the machines, we pulled shots following the Italian Espresso National Institute's measurement guidelines and paid attention to the following markers of success:
This is an ideal coffeemaker for an active This is an ideal coffeemaker for an active on-the-go lifestyle.

The Hamilton Beach 12 Cup BrewStation coffee maker offers convenient one-hand dispensing without a conventional glass carafe. There's no pouring or spills, and nothing fragile to break and replace. No matter how much you try, it’s impossible to get freshly brewed flavor from coffee that’s been sitting on a hot plate too long. That’s why ion was created, the only coffeemaker that keeps coffee tasting fresh for up to four hours. This best-selling coffee maker works just like a traditional...
Throughout the latter part of the 20th century, a number of inventors patented various coffeemaker designs using an automated form of the drip brew method. Subsequent designs have featured changes in heating elements, spray head, and brew-basket design, as well as the addition of timers and clocks for automatic-start, water filtration, filter and carafe design, and even built-in coffee grinding mechanisms.
“To me, a great drip-coffee machine is a reliable one with a timer (which is an awesome feature for large families). The Cuisinart DCC-3200 might not be the first choice of snobby coffee experts, but to me it does the trick. It’s cheap and works just fine (it’s actually the one I use myself at home). I love that I can program the timer and wake up to the smell of fresh coffee. Also, friends and family think you’re the best host when they stay with you (even though you’re still sleeping).” — Guillaume Guevara, founder of Miscelanea NY
We tested 12 models by making shots of espresso and lattes on each machine. We enlisted the help of an expert from Students of Coffee, a group of coffee educators and roasters at New York University, to judge for quality. The majority of the models we tested were semi-automatic, meaning brewers still have to grind the coffee and pack it in the portafilter (the little filter cup with a wand that you place in the front of the machine). Semi-automatic espresso machines heat the water for you, and then pump it through the grounds at varying levels of pressure, depending on the machine. The semi-automatic models we tester were:
Help yourself to cafe-quality coffee every morning. Whether you're brewing coffee for two or making enough coffee for family and friends, the Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker is the perfect size and offers many features to fit your brewing needs. This full-size coffee maker looks great on the counter with a stainless steel design that fits right in with any kitchen.
The gist: Okay, so in case any connoisseurs out there have been reading this section and thinking "a portable espresso machine takes the art away from espresso-making," this one's for you. Flair claims that this model was the answer to their question "What is the minimum needed to brew a professional-level shot of espresso?" The resulting product is this single-lever machine that doesn't need pods or electricity. It pulls a quality shot at 8-16 bars of pressure, has a 60ml water capacity, and brews a single cup in 25-45 seconds. You can get it in either black or chrome colors.

“My boyfriend is a gadget nerd, and he bought the Bonavita 1900TS drip for us — it’s turned out to be pretty great. We had been using Chemex, but it’s hard to be patient in the morning! If you take the time you’d spend waiting for a pour-over and actually weigh the beans, then this baby is unbeatable. It tastes almost the same as the Chemex.” — Sara Conklin, owner, Glasserie
CR’s take: If you need only one or two cups of coffee each morning and you don’t want a pod coffee maker, consider the Technivorm Moccamaster Cup-One Brewer. Compact and clean-lined, it has a profile that makes some sense of its high price (it retails for more than $200), and it’s a superstar when it comes to reliability. Technivorm was one of only three drip machine brands to earn an Excellent rating for predicted reliability in our member survey. Our testers also give this machine a strong score for brew performance. This model has only one simple feature (auto-shutoff) and it’s not the easiest machine to use, but you can count on it to last.

This coffee maker features a digital clock with a programmable brew start time. Heat N’ Brew...
That water is heated in a detachable reservoir that doubles as a kettle. This is a unique feature for a coffee maker, but one we ended up appreciating, especially for households with a mix of tea lovers and instant-oatmeal eaters alongside coffee drinkers. Fill the kettle up, lock it in place, and scroll the dial to the amount of coffee you want brewed. The machine is designed so that, even if you have more water in the kettle than you need, it will brew only the amount you specify. The one thing you actually have to measure with the OXO On 12-Cup is the grounds. Do that right, and it’s pretty much impossible to screw it up.
Semi-automatic espresso machines are just that—semi-automatic. Some of the steps are automated, but many are not. This allows the user to put their personal stamp on the final product but without doing some of the tedious steps that are involved in making an espresso on the stove top. Here’s a look at some of the features that make a semi-automatic espresso machine such a great pickup for the ultimate espresso lover:
The gist: This machine is clearly a fan favorite, as it’s raked in over 2,400 reviews on Amazon, giving it an average of 4 out of 5 stars — with over 60% of users awarding it a perfect 5 star rating. The machine comes with a lot of bragging rights. Not only is it “Amazon’s Choice” for super-automatic espresso machines, it’s also their #1 best seller.
If you don’t have the time or want to build a highly customized taste for your espresso mixes and just want a great tasting cup of espresso, super-automatic espresso makers are going to be your best bet. While you do give up some of the control you have over the final product, a super-automatic espresso maker automates almost all of the process for you, meaning that you can just get a great shot of espresso without having to do any extra work. This makes it perfect for people on the go or who prefer convenience over control.
This machine is extremely consistent and it brews an excellent espresso or cup of coffee. It also looks like Darth Vader manifested as a coffee machine: it's sleek and black and is definitely what our coffee makers will look like when we're all living on the moon. If your kitchen aesthetic is Space Chic, this machine is for you. It takes the joy and skill out of brewing your own espresso, but it works extremely well and is great for making an almost cafe-quality cup of coffee at home in no time and with very little effort.
Conceptually, MistoBox splits the difference between many other coffee subscriptions—and it's our best coffee subscription box because of it. The company doesn't roast its own beans, but instead sources them from top roasters all across America, who ship the fresh-roasted coffee direct to your door. It doesn't ask you to participate in blind tastings, and it doesn't give you a detailed quiz up front. It's all about balance.
"A rare example of the meeting of form and function. This machine is both beautiful to look at and makes wonderful delicious espresso and cappuccino. I was hesitant to spend this much on a "coffee maker", but took into consideration what it costs to get a decent cappuccino from a cafe or Starbucks and finally gave in. Boy am I glad I did. All it takes to get me out of bed in the morning is the happy thought of pulling yet another delicious shot from this wonderful machine."
Prior to the introduction of pre-measured self-contained ground coffee filter rings, fresh coffee grounds were measured out in scoopfuls and placed into the metal percolator basket. This process enabled small amounts of coffee grounds to leak into the fresh coffee. Additionally, the process left wet grounds in the percolator basket, which were very tedious to clean. The benefit of the Max Pax coffee filter rings was two-fold: First, because the amount of coffee contained in the rings was pre-measured, it negated the need to measure each scoop and then place it in the metal percolator basket. Second, the filter paper was strong enough to hold all the coffee grounds within the sealed paper. After use, the coffee filter ring could be easily removed from the basket and discarded. This saved the consumer from the tedious task of cleaning out the remaining wet coffee grounds from the percolator basket.
The gist: Okay, so although most of our list focuses on countertop espresso makers, if we're going by Amazon reviews, it'd be an injustice to ignore this Bialetti Stovertop Espresso Maker. As Amazon's best-selling stovetop espresso maker, this classy little thing is POP-U-LAR. As in 6,950 reviews (and counting) popular. Most impressively, those reviews give it an average of 4.3 stars, with 74% of them giving it a perfect 5-star rating. That's a hell of a lot of happy people. Now, disclaimer: we do have to mention straight away that the Bialetti doesn't *technically* make espresso, considering it's not able to build the amount of bars of pressure necessary to again, *technically* qualify it as espresso. However, Bialetti does give tips and guidelines for how to brew their "moka" coffee to your liking. (Moka is described as a mix between coffee and espresso.) Also, some reviewers (see below for example) claim they can't even tell the difference between the moka and a shot of espresso.

“We are a Cuisinart family. My mom still has the same food processor from the 1980s on the counter. When my co-host (and brother) Darin and I were looking for a coffee maker for our studio, that was the only choice for us. We loved this one because you set the time and forget it. We always work late, so this is a really nice end-of-day step, and then you get going without the bleariness of the morning. The thermal is a must as we drink throughout the day, and it’s great to just have it hot when we’re ready.” — Greg Bresnitz, co-host of Snacky Tunes
Made in Italy by a company that has been manufacturing coffee makers for over 80 years, this espresso maker takes less than five minutes to produce up to 3 demitasses (2 ounces) cups of espresso. It is made from polished aluminum in a classic octagon shape that will look good on your stove or table, while the shape also helps to diffuse heat perfectly. It has a patented safety valve for protection and is easy to disassemble for cleaning.
CR’s take: If you like the look of black stainless steel, you can add a hit of the trendy finish to your kitchen with the Bella Ultimate Elite Collection coffee maker. Appearance aside, this model brews a fresh pot in just 9 minutes and is graceful in action, earning strong ratings in our carafe handling tests. It offers programming, brew-strength control, a pause-and-serve feature, and auto-shutoff. Bella drip machines also received a Very Good rating for predicted reliability. At about $50, this affordable, attractive option won’t disappoint.

L-r The former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, presenting a cheque of N2 Million Naira to the Senior Prefect of Holy Name Secondary School, Umuchu, Chinecherem Umeojiako yesterday, while the manager of the School Fr. Elias Uzoigwe and Father Luke Anameze watch with satisfaction
The former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi has called on wealthy Anambrarians to support worthy causes that will elevate humanity. He said this yesterday at the presentation of the cheque of N2,000,000 Naira (Two Million Naira) to Holy Name Secondary School, Umuchu.
Obi, who earlier presented a cheque of N5,000,000 Naira( Five Million Naira) to the School, said it gave him special happiness to assist in building a better society through support to education, which he said was the most portent tool for competition in the world. Describing children as the future of the society, he said that the only way to make that future meaningful was by investing in what will help to nurture that future such as education.
On how he has been able to raise the money to support different schools and micro credit schemes through the Churches, he said it was through appeal to organizations and individuals of goodwill.
When asked to comment on the reaction that followed his joining of the PDP, Obi replied wryly: “God gave us eyes in front to look forward and not backwards.”

Discovering music on your own requires that you listen to a song for a period of time to see if you like it. Sure, if one of your friends tells you about a track you may “discover” it through them, but you will also spend some time listening to the song before you decide if it’s for you. This is the nature of the beast. Music is a time-based phenomenon.
Unlike with videos where you can “time compress” a video into a single frame image that you can easily visually scan, with music there is no alternative format that represents the song that can be easily scanned, except for the song name. This explains why most music interfaces display playlists, with song names as text not unlike in a spreadsheet, or list of song names. These can be easily scanned, but have no direct correlation to the sound or feeling of the song itself. I have always found it odd that in this era of digital music and highly designed interfaces, that most players default to a spreadsheet of song names to present music – true of iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, Rdio and many others. Spreadsheet music players.
Sure you can have a thumbnail of the album cover, but rarely do you see this on a song-by-song basis. Maybe in parts of Beatport or other DJ sites that are focused on tracks, but not generally on the web for the mass consumers of songs. And yes we have also seen many different visual interfaces like Sonorflow that let you visually traverse music genres or the linkage between bands, but these do not convey information about the songs themselves or the emotions that they convey.
What if we had a way to make a song come alive visually? This was the whole idea behind the original MTV and it was wildly successful for decades. What is the online equivalent, or even better, what can we do to push the whole boundary of music discovery and showcasing to new levels by embracing the time-based nature of music and coupling it with visual expression and a modern interface that lets you experience and interact with music in new and interesting ways. And no, I’m not talking about the waveform displays on Soundcloud.
I am working with a new company called Viinyl which is in the final testing stage for a whole new video-based version of their Music Showcasing platform that is very hot. I haven’t seen anything like Viinyl 2.0 and I think it represents a whole new way of presenting music. Viinyl amplifies the emotional content of songs visually, in a way that is enjoyable and super easy to use. This is a whole new way of showcasing music.
Viinyl is re-defining the way music and videos are experienced. In fact their video player is a new way to attract attention, engage an audience with the emotion of a song, and make money on singles and tracks. From a simple URL you can run a full screen video with interactive overlays and gather email, sell tracks and tickets, connect to your social networks and literally showcase music thru video. You can sell any digital file including music and movies, and provide relavent information directly in the context of the song including bios, links, credits, contacts, concert dates, lyrics, etc.
The new platform supports audio file sales with fixed or flexible album pricing (minimum price and Pay What You Want) along with various free distribution options. The software is lightning fast, with just a few clicks, musicians and labels will be able to share their work independently – and hold onto all revenue generated.

I have a hobby which is producing calendars using photographs of the turn of the last century. Due to disability, I cannot work, so enjoy doing this.
I make calendars of Southend, Campbeltown, and this year, I also produced one of Carradale, which proved to be extremely popular. However, I used every picture I had managed to get on Ebay, and they are extremely difficult to get hold of.
If anyone has any, would they please let me know and I will gladly pm you my email address so that we can exchange details on how I could get hold of them, either by attachment, or I'll scan them and return them in the same condition lent to me.
You could try here http://www.the-carradale-goat.co.uk/ if you click on Photo galleries there are a few oldish photos of Carradale and the surrounding area.
I think the photos may be copyrighted but the person who runs the website is a regular poster on here, jdcarra, I'm sure if you message him he will help you out.
I think this is the same person whom contacted me through the Goat online message.I have now replied to this person with the offer of photos or any help in aquiring ones.

Food allergies is an overreaction, see exaggerated response of our immune system in the presence of a food or food additive that is normally harmless to most of us.
In the case of food allergies, the immune system produces several substances that help protect our body. Among these may be mentioned antibodies, such as IgA, IgG, IgE, ... IgE antibodies are those involved in the'' immediate type of allergic reactions'' and potentially cause an anaphylactic shock (severe allergic reaction). When these antibodies come into contact with the food allergen, in some cases they cause excessive secretion of a substance called histamine, which leads to inflammation and other allergic symptoms. The symptoms experienced vary from one person to another and from one allergen to another and can be very dangerous or even fatal.
Food intolerance is one of the different types of food reaction and means that our body is unable to support a food taken ​​in an amount usually tolerated by other individuals. Intolerance is usually developed by a sugar found in food, such as lactose in dairy products. If well managed, it is far less serious than food allergies because it is unlikely that the affected person dies from its reaction. This does not mean that we should take food intolerance lightly.
** Warning! Celiac disease is not a food intolerance but an autoimmune disease and all traces of gluten should be avoided.

Welcome to the Lake District Holiday Guide helping you plan the perfect trip to the Lake District and surrounding areas, including where to stay and eat, days out and stunning walks.
The lake District is a place where people live and work. It is a region with an identifiable culture of its own, its own traditions, its own customs and folklore and its own heritage. One third of those employed are directly dependant on tourism.
The Lake District has a spectacular landscape with 16 major lakes and hundreds of tarns which were carved out of the landscape during the last ice age, all set amidst the highest mountains in England. The Lake District attracts some 14 million visitors each year, many from abroad in particular Japan and the USA. The park is cared for by the Lake District National Park Authority in partnership with other organisations. Tourism has now become the park's major industry, with Windermere Lake Steamers now the UK's second most popular charging tourist attraction and the local economy is dependent upon tourists. The negative impact of tourism has been seen, however. Soil erosion, caused by walking, is now a significant problem, with millions of pounds being spent to protect over-used paths.
The Lake District has become associated with many literary figures in particularly, William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter but more recently Alfred Wainwright, whose ' Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells ' has drawn many people to the area . First published between 1952 and 1965, these books provided detailed information on 214 peaks across the region, with carefully hand-drawn maps and panoramas, and also stories and asides which add to the colour of the area. They are still used by many visitors to the area as guides for walking excursions, with the ultimate goal of bagging the complete list of Wainwrights.
Though the greatest attractions in the Lake District are of course the lakes and the fells, there are plenty of other attractions or places to visit, from Country houses and gardens, boat rides, castles and museums to theme parks and shopping - Something for all Dove Cottage - Grasmere The Wordsworth Trust was founded in 1891, to secure Dove Cottage for eternal possessions of all those who loved English poetry all over the world. Today, visitors experience the tranquillity of a site of outstanding beauty in the heart of the Lake District. As well as Dove Cottage - home to Wordsworth when he wrote his greatest poetry - the Wordsworth Museum tells the fascinating story of the poet and his circle, their life and their work.
Hill Top is a 17th-century house in Near Sawrey near Hawkshead, in the English county of Cumbria. It is an example of Lakeland vernacular architecture with random stone walls and slate roof.[1] The house was once the home of children's author and illustrator Beatrix Potter who left it to The National Trust. It is open to the public and the house is shown as Beatrix Potter herself would have known it. This gallery has a display of original watercolours painted by Beatrix Potter for her children?s stories. Exhibits are changed annually. The 17th Century building was once the office of her husband William Heelis, a solicitor, and is substantially unaltered since his day. It is next door to the inspiration for Tabitha Twitchets shop.
Brantwood - Coniston, Cumbria Brantwood was the home of John Ruskin from 1872 until his death in 1900 and is regarded as one of the most beautifully situated houses in the Lake District. It enjoys the finest views over Coniston Lake and mountain views in England and there is no other house in the district with such a diversity of cultural associations. Brantwood became an intellectual powerhouse and one of the greatest literary and artistic centres in Europe. Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Marcel Proust and Frank Lloyd Wright can all be numbered amongst Ruskins disciples.
Brockhole - Windermere, Cumbria Brockhole is an Edwardian house beautifully situated on the shores of Windermere; enjoy extensive landscaped gardens, lake cruises, adventure playground, guided walks and activities. There are two floors of exciting interactive exhibitions; introducing the National Park, the story of how the National Park evolved; the people who have shaped the landscape and the special qualities which make the Lake District landscape such an important part of our national heritage. There is also a gift shop, information centre, film theatre and caf� with terrace seating.
Activities and things to do in the Lake District - Something for everyone from easy walking and golf to paragliding and rock climbing and which could include Abseiling, kayaking, ghyll scrambling, mountain biking, horse riding, orienteering,hillwalking, caving and potholing, archery, sailing, mountain navigation and map reading.

Theatre By The Lake at Lakeside, Keswick - Keswicks world-famous Theatre By The Lake has its origins in a mobile theatre that toured the country in the 60s and 70s. Its popularity declined everywhere except Keswick, and the mobile theatre became a permanent fixture. The theatre raised enough money to construct a purpose-built, permanent building, which now offers excellent facilities for performers and audience alike. Performances are as wide and varied as Shakespeare, Flamenco dancing, art film and jazz. There are regular matinees of family performances. Tel: 017687 74411

First Impressions: So the first thing I did was look at the nutrition information. Okay, let me start of by saying I AM NOT A LISCENSED DIETICIAN AND AS A RESULT, EVERYTHING FROM THIS POINT FORWARD IS UTTER BS AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS INFORMATION AS YOU KNOW IT IS FALSE. Waiver out of the way, the nutrition info caught my eye. Currently, I am taking the Gold Standard. In my eyes, it's very efficient. It has a lot of protein per scoop along with low fat, BCAAs, glutamine, and low carbs. This was a bit different. I has a higher calorie content, higher fat content, and more calories. Again, since I am not a dietician and I have no idea what I am talking about, this can be actually good for some people. I would love if we could have an ON rep come and clarify things.
Tomorrow is an off day just cardio and abs and chest and tris on thursday![CSVLB]The Power Clean/Military press is, when done properly called a Clean Jerk. This is an awesomely explosive left, but requires a lot of technique and understanding to reap its benefits. If it feels like a military press, you could be pushing a hell of a lot more weight with a few form adjustments.
I had a long conversation with my boss boss yesterday (the BIG Boss and I am feeling a bit better. Whenever I have a conversation with him I leave with a general sense that I need to do something but never a real specific idea of what the heck that something is. :)
Lol your red is because you often make silly posts, fare enough not all but there are a fair few. Rep points dont matter, but the truth is if your that deep in the red people tend to ignore what you say/dont take you seriously.
Hunger Control 10/10 I am a hungry guy.this was awesome for me. The flavor made it seem like a treat and the rest helped to keep my rumbling tummy from disturbing coworkers.
Performance: 10/10. For what ingredients are in this and for what the main purpose is, it blew me away. The main thing was the pump affect. Almost every other pump enhancer I have used I needed to use more than the 1 scoop recommended serving. This changed when using the new Pump-HD. One scoop did the job and did it extremely well. I honestly think it was even better than what I experienced with the 2 scoops of other products. In addition to the pump, there was an enhanced energy and endurance affect I experienced. Even though there was no caffeine in this, I did truly get a good amount of energy that I didn?t even expect to get coming straight off of using a high stim pre workout.
On another note: I read in another thread bout having a tapeworm, and that freaked me out as to why I have always been slim. Couldn't happen to me right? But, I do take after my grandfather and he has always been slim too, so hopefully I can get this to rest. ;)[CSVLB]I would suggest cutting out the cardio until then. That way you are not burning more calories than you are consuming and your weight training will benefit you in gaining size. Theres no point in just keeping your physique the way it is then dieting put some size on! I think you have a high metabolism and probably an active lifestyle not worms![CSVLB]Active lifestyle which contains lots of sex, and exercise I do have.
Float Collar and Float Shoe are used to guide the casing to be put into the hole. It can adjust the floating power of the casing when the casing been laid in. That can certify the qualification of the cementing. The Float Collars and Float Shoe manufactured by our company use the Spring Driving back-pressure valve type. It has a high reliability.
The structures are similar between Float Collar and Float Shoe. The lower end of the Float Collar is the pin connection which is connected with the casing. The upper end which is used for filling the cement has acinqfoil hole which can avoid the twist.
The material of the Float Shoe body is the alloy steel . The upper end of the Float Shoe is connected with casing and its lower end is connected with the semilunar cement head. You can use the guide casing to lead it into the drilling hole. There is a back-pressure valve in the Float Shoe. You can use the oil well cement to fill the area between the Float Shoe and the body. The back-pressure can be cut by back-pressure valve. The upper hole and the lower hole will be open when the products after done . After the pressure of the circulating mud press the Valve Head into the lower place, the three collar valve on the valve tail will fall down automatically. The valve will press the valve seat tightly at the function of spring after the cement injection. And it will as a one-way valve function in the working. At that time, you could inject the mud into the pump from the upper end to the lower end, but the liquid of the well won`t be back in the casing below the valve or the outside circulation area of the casing.

Here in the offices of the Lake Wales Area Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development Council, a lot a great things happen for the benefit of area visitors and potential visitors, and for the good of the local business community and general economy. Supported by the city, local businesses, our generous investor-partners, and many individuals, the fine Chamber-EDC staff stays busy answering phones, fielding inquiries, responding to requests for information and brochures, conducting marketing research, and so much more.
In addition to the office work, and extremely valuable and productive, is the Chamber-EDC’s work in the field – where the movers and shakers of business, industry, and commerce go or tend to go, where the rubber of economic development really hits the road. The field is a large one — really, it’s as large as we want to make it – and limited to us only in our ability to reach it for greater Lake Wales by modern travel and technology.
Just a few weeks ago, the field for the Lake Wales Chamber-EDC stretched all the way to Las Vegas, the site of RECon 2018 (May 20-23) – “the world’s largest global gathering of retail real estate professionals.” It’s an annual convention, presented by the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) and many co-sponsors. The Lake Wales Chamber-EDC has had a presence at RECon for a number of years; it’s too big and too important to miss. Joining me in representing our Chamber-EDC this year in a display and information booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center was Robbie Shields of Florida’s Natural, EDC board and Chamber board member.
The description of RECon as “the world’s largest global gathering of retail real estate professionals” really doesn’t do justice to this huge event (approximately 40,000 registered attendees and 1,256 exhibitors this year, with both numbers up from the 2017 show). Yes, retail real estate pros were there in big-time numbers, but so were thousands of other professionals — representing virtually any kind of enterprise that can touch a real estate, commercial construction, or economic development deal. From site-study and engineering firms to mall and shopping center developers and a company that sells specialty lighting for parking lots, we saw them there. The convention also featured a big presence by companies you would recognize locally –– companies like Dollar General, Wawa, and Aldi, each of which is doing very well and expanding quickly all across the nation.
To borrow a description from the world of sports, economic development is a full-contact enterprise, and from our Lake Wales marketing and economic development station, we were in full contact with hundreds of RECon visitors and delegates daily. Some of those contacts led to further discussions after normal show hours. Contacts lead to interest, interest leads to questions, answers lead to ideas, ideas lead to possibilities, and possibilities potentially lead to deals. If we’ve done our homework, pitched well the benefits of doing business in and around Lake Wales, and provided a good foundation and environment for new business — as we know we’ve done here — before we know it, we could be seeing giant cranes setting giant steel building frames and beams into place for the next new local shopping center, retail store, restaurant, or manufacturing center.
All told, only about 10 percent of the people we spoke with at RECon had heard about Lake Wales and knew something about our great community, but that was OK. That gave us the grand opportunity to be, collectively and for the remaining 90 percent of our booth visitors, a walking and talking billboard for Lake Wales and all the good things the community can offer a new commercial or industrial enterprise.
We won’t know for some time what kind of direct economic development results we’ll see locally from the Las Vegas convention, but we do know this: Fresh seeds for new exposure to Lake Wales and new development have been planted, and we here at the Lake Wales Chamber-EDC will work hard with all means possible to water and nurture them. Even now I can report that it was well worth our time and expense to be at RECon 2018. What follows the opportunity to be there will be many opportunities to follow up.

Last night I confessed that I can be lazy and this week is proof. I don’t want to go to the store, so we’re playing Pantry Raid. It’s certainly not as exciting as a panty raid, but if you aren’t in the mood to deal with the grocery store or need to check the cash outflow for a week or two, it can be a life saver.

Dietary intake of saturated fat by food source and incident cardiovascular disease: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
Background: Although dietary recommendations have focused on restricting saturated fat (SF) consumption to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, evidence from prospective studies has not supported a strong link between total SF intake and CVD events. An understanding of whether food sources of SF influence these relations may provide new insights. Objective: We investigated the association of SF consumption from different food sources and the incidence of CVD events in a multi-ethnic population. Design: Participants who were 45-84 y old at baseline (n = 5209) were followed from 2000 to 2010. Diet was assessed by using a 120-item food-frequency questionnaire. CVD incidence (316 cases) was assessed during follow-up visits. Results: After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle, and dietary confounders, a higher intake of dairy SF was associated with lower CVD risk [HR (95% CI) for +5 g/d and +5% of energy from dairy SF: 0.79 (0.68, 0.92) and 0.62 (0.47, 0.82), respectively]. In contrast, a higher intake of meat SF was associated with greater CVD risk [HR (95% CI) for +5 g/d and a +5% of energy from meat SF: 1.26 (1.02, 1.54) and 1.48 (0.98, 2.23), respectively]. The substitution of 2% of energy from meat SF with energy from dairy SF was associated with a 25% lower CVD risk [HR (95% CI): 0.75 (0.63, 0.91)]. No associations were observed between plant or butter SF and CVD risk, but ranges of intakes were narrow. Conclusion: Associations of SF with health may depend on food-specific fatty acids or other nutrient constituents in foods that contain SF, in addition to SF. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;96:397-404.
Aim: Apply a recently developed expert elicitation procedure to evaluate the state of the current knowledge of the two brominated flame retardants (BFRs) most commonly used today; decabromo-diphenyl ether (decaBDE) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and their potential impact on human health in order to support policy considerations. This expert elicitation was organized by the HENVINET (Health and Environment Network) Consortium. Method: The HENVINET expert elicitation procedure that was used in the evaluations of decaBDE and HBCD is a rapid assessment tool aimed at highlighting areas of agreement and areas of disagreement on knowledge-related key issues for environment and health policy decision making. Results: The outcome of the expert consultation on BFRs was concrete expert advice for policy makers with specific priorities for further action made clear for both stakeholders and policy makers. The experts were not in agreement whether or not the knowledge currently available on decaBDE or HBCD is sufficient to justify policy actions, but most experts considered that enough data already exists to support a ban or restriction on the use of these compounds. All experts agreed on the necessity of more research on the compounds. Priority issues for further research were, among others: more studies on the extent of human exposure to the compounds. more studies on the fate and concentration in the human body of the compounds.

Other factors that can affect the treatment include your budget. Some treatments are more expensive than others. Body sculpting treatments without surgery is much more cost effective than traditional surgeries. Your skin condition will also effect how the treatment is conducted. If you have skin allergies, the treatment method will vary accordingly. Your doctor’s recommendation will be a crucial factor on how the treatment sessions are carried out.

Body sculpting is pretty fresh on the scene. In 2008, two Harvard-affiliated scientists founded the idea of selective cryolosis—the process of freezing fat cells and killing them, eliminating stubborn body fat. The hypothesis that cold temperatures could kill fat came from one interesting observation. Children who sucked on popsicles often developed dimples, indicating that cold temperature could eliminate fat cells, leaving little “pockets.” Weirdly, body sculpting sort of mimics popsicle sucking.

Massive anti terrorism, protest demonstration tiranga rally was led by Sunil Dimple president Jammu west assembly movement, in support of the army, police, CRPF, BSF fighting war in the Jammu Kashmir state against the Pakistan sponsored Kashmir Unrest, failure of the state BJP-PDP government control the law and order situation in the state and for imposing the Governor rule in the state.
While addressing the protesters, Sunil Dimple extended full support to army, BSF, CRPF, police security jawans fighting war against the militancy in the state.
Dimple further said our all security forces Jawans officers are pride of the nation and the BJP-PDP government is registering the cases against the security forces that fighting battle for the nation.
He said the BJP and PDP ministers should voluntarily resign and open the way for the Governor rule other wise the nation will loose Kashmir BJP and PDP unholy alliance till today in the last two years governance have created law and order problem in the state. Dimple said all the security, funds, VIIP status and facilities of the huriyat leaders should be withdrawn. And they should keep in jails like the other prisoners.
But BJP still wants to continue alliance with PDP and playing double role to save its face and is still betraying Jammu region from the day one.
Dimple alleged still the Central BJP leaders are finding escape routs to save the BJP coalition govt in the state. May the whole state burn in to ashes and people may suffer but chair and power is the priority of the Prime Minister in the Jammu Kashmir state, for which he is protecting the BJP-PDP government.
Dr Sham Saroop, Rajinder Verma, Vijay Khjuria, B L Sahni, Harbans Todon, Kulwant Sharma, Sat pal Kohli, Ram Kapoor and several others were present at the occasion.
The Uttarakhand high court on Monday asked the Centre’s counsel to explain why President’s Rule was imposed on the state at a time when the Harish Rawat government was in its fifth year.
The court raised this question while hearing a petition filed by the deposed chief minister against the central government’s decision, taken barely one day before a scheduled trial of strength in the assembly.
Putting forth the Centre’s stand, attorney general Mukul Rohtagi said President Pranab Mukherjee signed the order only after going through the facts. He said that 35 MLAs (including nine Congress rebels) had sought a division of votes on the appropriation bill on March 18, but it was not accepted by speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal. While BJP MLA Ganesh Joshi was arrested the same day, another member – Bhim Lal Arya – was told to absent himself from the house. BSP MLA Sarwat Kareem Ansari was also not present in the house, he contended.
Rohtagi said that 35 of the 68 MLAs in the assembly were against the bill, but the speaker would not allow a division of the votes because he was aware that the government was in a minority.
Contending that the money bill itself was the floor test, the attorney general held that the government had fallen on the evening of March 18 itself. To drive home the Centre’s point, Rohtagi produced a video recording of that day’s proceedings before the court.
The systems enable these works to be completed with a greatly reduced impact on the local area and ground surface compared to traditional open cut methods of installation or replacement.
Following a closed Town Council meeting that followed its regularly scheduled Feb. 6 meeting, the town announced that Wilbrecht resigned his position, but offered no explanation as to the reasons why the former Mono County Administrative Officer and Mammoth Parks director quit.
Citing laws protecting personnel matters from public view, the new permanent Town Manager, Marianna Marysheva-Martinez, also declined to discuss the specifics of Wilbrecht’s departure.
However, off-the-record interviews with council members and town staff indicated that Wilbrecht himself might have brought the axe down, arguing health concerns usually associated with job burnout.
In leaving, Wilbrecht sought a severance package of up to $150,000, town officials said, leaving the members of the council not only surprised by the resignation, but also confused as to how to proceed in the situation.
Ultimately, the council voted 4-1 to accept Wilbrecht’s resignation and to give him the severance package.
The councilman who voted against the deal was attorney Rick Wood, who argued that severance compensation is due for employees who are laid off for non-disciplinary reasons (budget, for example), or other extraordinary factors.
Even among those who voted for the resignation/compensation package, however, every council member expressed surprise that it happened at all.
He recently signed a new contract with the Town of Mammoth Lakes, so when his email announcing his intention to look for another job reached the eyes of the town council members the week of Jan. 23, they said they were a little surprised.
After giving the council a heads-up on imminent departures such as town planner Ellen Clark, Wilbrecht wrote that he, too, was looking for a new job.
“Yeah, I’d say I was surprised by that,” said Mayor Matthew Lehman shortly after the meeting broke up. “I really can’t tell you why this happened. I wish I could. We’d just signed a big contract with him.
“But the bottom line is that he resigned. He just wanted to move on. He sent us a letter expressing some concerns. It was initiated by Dave.”
“Really, the only thing I can say about that is that public employees tend to value job security more than most people,” said one cryptic council member, who asked for anonymity out of concern for breaking the laws covering closed sessions.
Other council members said there was another factor in the mix, and that was what to do with two senior managers (Wilbrecht and Marysheva-Martinez) who were running a town with severe budget constraints and dwindling numbers of staff.
The final move by the council was to appoint Marysheva-Martinez as Town Manager, but offer her no raise above what she drew as assistant town manager.

Population projections are forecasts of the population in future time periods. Using a model that integrates recent historical data and standard demographic processes, estimates of future population are generated based on historic patterns. The most common population projection model used by demographers – the cohort component model – was used to generate the Vintage 2016 projections. This model captures the impact of the primary components of population change – births, deaths, and net migration – in order to forecast changes in future population.
These projections were made using a “bottom-up” approach, in which the county projections were generated first and then aggregated to create projections for the Area Development Districts and the state. Population counts by gender and 5-year age groups from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2015 Population Estimates served as the base population, and the most currently available fertility, mortality and migration rates were used to project the change in each age cohort moving forward.
Released in October 2016, the Vintage 2016 Projections of Population and Households forecast population change through 2040 in 5-year intervals for the State of Kentucky, Kentucky Counties, and Area Development Districts.

Total Population, Population in Households, Population in Group Quarters, Total Households, and Average Household Size
The household population and the group quarters population age 65 and above were projected using the cohort-component model. County-specific assumptions about future mortality, fertility, and migration were derived from the latest demographic patterns and trends from the 2000-2010 decade. The group quarters population under age 65 was projected to remain constant at their 2010 Census counts. Projections of the group quarters population above age 65 were based on their share of the 2010 Census total population. Forecasts of the number of households and household size were derived from the cohort-headship method.
Released in December 2011, these population projections forecast population change through 2050 in 5-year intervals for Kentucky, Area Development Districts, and Counties.

The mass of the [eta prime] meson is theoretically expected to be reduced at finite density, which indicates the existence of [eta prime]–nucleus bound states. To investigate these states, we perform missing-mass spectroscopy for the (p, d) reaction near the [eta prime] production threshold. The overview of the experimental situation is given and the current status is discussed.

Launch of T10KL programme under the project “National Virtual Library of India”, funded by the Ministry of Culture
(17 October 2018, Mumbai) The Ministry of Culture, Government of India set up the National Mission on Libraries in 2012 to ensure sustained attention to the development of Libraries and the Information Science Sector.
The National Mission on Libraries has, as one of its activities, created the National Virtual Library of India (NVLI), a project whose purpose is to facilitate creation of a searchable comprehensive database of digital resources on information pertaining to India. The effort is directed primarily to provide searchable access to digital assets, primarily related to Indian culture and knowledge. The NVLI project is coordinated by IIT Bombay, and executed by IIT Bombay, C-DAC Pune and IGNOU.
Also, an integral part of the NVLI project is the capacity building and training on Koha and other open source digital library software to all librarians across the country.
The Train 10 Thousand Librarians (T10KL) programme was launched from the Electronic Media Production Centre at IGNOU on 12th October 2018 by the Vice Chancellor of IGNOU, Prof Nageshwar Rao, in the presence of Prof Kannan Moudgalya of IIT Bombay, the Principal Investigator of NVLI, and Prof Uma Kanjilal, Professor in the Faculty of Library and Information Science, IGNOU.
In a first for the country, 2,500 Librarians across the nation participated through 98 Remote Centres of IIT Bombay, located in 19 states, and received Koha training. For the purposes of this workshop, the methodology created and proved in the Train 10 Thousand Teachers programme by IIT Bombay was used.

A prominent U.S. economist issued a prediction for average mortgage rates today. Frank Nothaft, chief economist for mortgage-buying giant Freddie Mac, recently stated that 30-year mortgage rates could average 4.6% next year. He also said the average rate will likely be higher at the end of 2015 than at the beginning, perhaps reaching 5.0% by year’s end. This was one of several predictions offered as part of the company’s monthly housing outlook.
The 10-year Treasury yield is expected to average 2.9 percentage points next year, up from 2.6 this year. Long-term mortgage rates tend to increase along with the 10-year Treasury yield. That is why Mr. Nothaft and company have predicted higher interest rates on home loans next year.
Freddie Mac’s economic team also expects to see a continued slow-down in annual home-price increases. In 2013, U.S. home prices rose by 9.3%. In 2014, the annual gain fell to 4.5%. Next year, prices are expected to rise by around 3.0% — a slower pace than what we have seen in recent months.
Housing affordability will decline in 2015, as a result of rising mortgage rates and home price appreciation. But the bigger picture is that housing is still very affordable. According to Freddie Mac’s recent news release: “Historically speaking [we are] moving from very high levels of affordability to high levels of affordability.”
We could see a significant increase in the number of new homes being built next year. Housing starts are expected to climb by 20% from 2014 to 2015, partly the result of a strengthening economy and job gains.
Home sales are also likely to rise next year. According to the housing report, the total number of home sales (including both new and existing homes) could rise 5% next year to reach its highest level in eight years. That would mark the best sales pace since before the housing crisis, another sign of the ongoing recovery.
Overall, mortgage loan originations are expected to fall next year. Freddie Mac’s economists anticipate a rise in purchase loan originations (i.e., home buyers), but it will not be enough to offset the expected decline in refinance originations. So total loan volume will likely fall next year.
With the predicted rise of home prices and average mortgage rates, it seems the best deals for home buyers might be in the rear-view mirror. Granted, these are national averages and trends we are talking about. Conditions vary widely at the local level. Home prices could hold steady, or even decline, in some U.S. cities next year. That’s why we encourage home buyers to conduct plenty of local research before purchasing a home.
This story focuses on average mortgage rates, which is the average interest cost assigned to home loans at a particular period of time. Actual rates, on the other hand, tend to vary from one borrower to the next. This is largely the result of differences in credit scores, down payment size, points paid at closing, and the type of loan being used.
In order to qualify for the best rates available, borrowers must have excellent credit and will likely have to pay points as well. A discount point is a form of prepaid interest — you pay a certain amount at closing in order to secure a lower interest rate over the long term. The discount-point strategy is best suited for long-term housing scenarios, as opposed to a short stay of only a few years (learn more). Bear this in mind when shopping for a home loan, and when researching average mortgage rates.

Western Bio- Terrorism: Struck off for “Islamic sectarian violence” but no action against doctors killing patients
Yesterday I reported on former British surgeon Tariq Ali who was struck off by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) and has now joined Pakistan Taliban, Tehreek-e-Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (TTP JA). This case of “extremism” was the first-ever successful prosecution for Islamic sectarian violence in Britain and was heard against Ali in his absence.
“Ali was charged with violent disorder following a demonstration calling for jihad in Syria organised by Walthamstow-based extremist preacher, Anjem Choudary.
On Wednesday, The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MTPS) panel heard how Tariq helped organise the protest in May 2013 which resulted in several Shi’ite Muslims being attacked in Edgware Road.
Ali used the flagpole of his wooden placard to repeatedly hit a man who already been punched to the ground”
What is concerning however is that whilst action was taken in Ali’s case, dozens of other cases of doctors involved in another form of “extremism” violent biological assault against their own patients which eventually led to many deaths did not result in these medical staff being removed from practicing in the UK.
“if you look up the word “extremist” in the dictionary, you will find it defined as ‘one who goes to extremes or advocates extreme doctrines or practices.’ If I were to ask you to name a group of extremists, who would come to mind?”
For many, Tariq Ali might come to mind as he fits the stereotypical image of an “extremist” dished up in the media… He is male, Asian and a Muslim and has spoken openly of his religious and political beliefs, advocating for sharia’ah law to be implemented. However there are far more dangerous cases of extreme behaviour carried out by white, male, British doctors of largely Christian faith that has been swept under the carpet by the medical establishment including the General Medical Council (GMC) where no punitive action was ever taken.
There are “Dr Deaths” roaming our hospital corridors even now. Not the horror story character as depicted by actor Vincent Price but something rather more mundane which makes it all the more frightening.
In what has come to be known as the “worst medical treatment disaster in the the history of the National Health Service (NHS)” the infection of patients with HIV and hepatitis viruses, “extremists” were free to break all ethical boundaries and indulge in the most horrific of experiments, practicing on live patients. They were the haematologists (blood doctors) employed in so called “centres of excellence” up and down the country to care for patients with haemophilia (a condition, largely affecting males, where the blood fails to clot).
Many of these doctors practiced a form of “political extremism”. They believed like the doctors of Nazi Germany, that in the politics of disability it was considered acceptable to use patients born with hereditary medical conditions for unethical experimentation against the Nuremberg Code. The “disabled” were treated as second class citizens with no rights, they were denied key information regarding their “treatment” were viewed as expendable and killed!
Haematologists knowingly injected contaminated plasma products into their patients sourced from US prisons such as Arkansas State Penitentiary. This blood was taken from the “highest risk” prisoners, drug addicts and gay men practising unsafe sex that sold their blood for a few dollars to pharmaceutical companies which ignored all the rules of safety. The prisons and pharmaceutical companies made millions putting “profit before safety”.
Inmates had themselves been subjected to unethical experimentation, injected with material considered a” bio-hazard” deadly viruses such as HIV, hepatitis viruses to be studied in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. This was none other than “bio-terrorism” as many prisoners had no idea what they were being injected with and patients on the receiving end of inmates’s plasma had no idea they were getting prison blood and were told the product was safe.
This evidence was presented at the Archer Private Inquiry held opposite the Houses of Parliament. The British government covered up their role in PROMOTING this treatment as “safe” knowing it to to be to “highly dangerous” as testified by Lord David Owen (former Health Minister). The government themselves REFUSED to hold a public inquiry into alleged wrongdoing and the unlawful killing of around 2,500 NHS patients with 2,300 more seriously injured through infection with HIV and hepatitis viruses.
The following letter from the sister of an Arkansas prisoner, who sold his blood to pharmaceutical companies was handed in to No 10 Downing Street in 2001, for the attention of then Prime Minister Tony Blair (no reply was ever received)
My name is Linda Tant Miller and I live in the state of Washington in the United States. The purpose of this letter is to provide you some of the information to which I am privy regarding the collection of HIV and hepatitis-tainted human blood plasma from the Cummins Unit of the Arkansas Department of Correction, (ADC) and its distribution throughout the world.
My brother, Bud Tant was a prisoner in the Cummins Unit from 1984 until his death from hepatitis C on March 14, 1999. Neither my brother nor his family was aware of the fact that he had this virus until approximately 1996, but according to John Byus, the current Medical Administrator of the ADC, Bud had the virus at the time he was first incarcerated there. During part of the time that my brother was donating plasma, Mr. Byus, a Registered Nurse worked in the Cummins Unit Infirmary, so he is in a position to know this fact. Bud was, nonetheless permitted to donate plasma at every collection session from 1984 until the program was terminated in 1992.
I first learned of the sickness in Canada as a result of the Cummins Unit plasma just prior to my brother’s death, but I didn’t have time to address the subject in depth until after he died. As I watched my brother die a death more gruesome and agonizing than I’d ever dreamed in my worst nightmares, I realized that millions of people all over the world would suffer his same horrendous fate and their families would stand helplessly by, suffering the same grief and agony we were enduring. I realized that most of them would never know the source of their infection, but I knew, and I vowed to my brother that I would see the atrocity exposed and those responsible for it brought to justice. I have devoted my life to this cause since that date.
Several years ago Sgt. McAlpine of the RCMP, indicated to me that they had little hope of bringing to justice the ADC administrators responsible for the knowing and deliberate harvesting and sale of tainted plasma, because by the time they got to Arkansas the paper trail was gone, so I promised him that I would find eye-witnesses and participants who would be willing to testify to what happened. I have since that time located many current and former inmates, former Cummins Unit Plasma Program staff members and a former ADC Compliance Officer who are anxious to testify to the facts of this crime.
Known homosexual prison prostitutes, even those in the final stages of AIDS were routinely permitted to donate plasma.
Men who were bloated and jaundiced from the final stage of hepatitis were routinely permitted to donate plasma.
Even when available, tests for HIV and hepatitis were seldom utilized, and when they were, results were often falsified.
Needles re-sharpened with sand paper and collection tubing were re-used from inmate to inmate, thereby cross-infecting virtually the entire donor base.
The collected plasma was stored in a freezer that was often out of order. Plasma rendered unfit by thawing was re-frozen and shipped out in regular shipments.
Plasma that was rejected by the plasma brokers as unfit was returned to the Cummins Unit for destruction. Out of each returned case of plasma, one or two units were destroyed and the rest was re-frozen and re-shipped.
During periods of time when the US Food and Drug Administration had shut down the Cummins Unit program due to their unsafe practices, the ADC administrators continued to collect and sell plasma, using names collected from the local telephone book and selling it through a community plasma center.
All of these charges and more can and will someday be proven in a court of law.As I’m sure you are aware, many thousands of innocent British citizens have been sickened and killed due to the deliberate crimes committed by the MEDICAL PERSONNEL who administered the Cummins Unit Plasma Center. I hope therefore that you will join your voice to those of us who are working to see justice served in this matter.
I urgently implore you to use the power of your office to spur the FBI and the US Department of Justice to implement a full-scale investigation of the people and institution that made the tainted plasma available to the pharmaceutical companies. Had it not been for the greed and corruption of the plasma collectors the people and governments of the world would not now be facing the tragedies and financial burdens with which we’re now forced to struggle I know all too well the effect my brother’s suffering and death has had on my family.
We will never be the same. I no longer work at a paying job because seeing justice done in this matter is far more important to me than my own personal comfort and finances. My parents have developed health problems due to the stress and grief of our tragedy that will soon see both of them in their graves. My sister and I have debilitating flashbacks to the time of our brother’s dying which haunt us day and night, turning our lives into nonstop nightmares of pain and grief. Multiply our suffering by BILLIONS, since the secondary infections from the Cummins Plasma Program will continue to the end of time unless science discovers cures or vaccines against the plague the Arkansas Department of Corrections and its employees have unleashed upon the world.
Sir, the people who are guilty of this atrocity are the worse criminals in history and I hope you will be as incensed and determined to see justice done as I am.
I also pray you will heed the pleas of my good and wise friend Carol Grayson and take the steps necessary to see to it that no other British subjects will be infected with deadly diseases during medical treatment and to assure that fair and equitable compensation is made to ALL the victims of this atrocity.For more information on the Cummins Unit Plasma Program please visit my web site at http://www.geocities.com/bloodcows .
In addition, a friend of mine is producing a documentary film about the Cummins Unit Plasma Program that contains yet more testimony and information. It will air in a few months and I will notify you of the date and time as soon as they are known.I will appreciate a response to this letter, apprising me of your thoughts and intentions regarding this atrocity and the plight of the victims.
Evidence from the monthly meetings of haematologists and thousands of other documents exchanged between the British government lawyers and lawyers for patients showed exactly what the doctors treating haemophiliacs knew at the time and how they behaved. They knew the risks, lied to their patients and a number were on the payroll of international plasma companies constituting a “conflict of interest”.
The doctors also documented their use of Previously Untreated Patients (PUPS, newborn haemophiliacs) and mild haemophiliacs in EXPERIMENTS at the British side to monitor progression of diseases. In other words their own records state doctors deliberately injected dirty blood into children and others because as they said “they were cheaper than chimpanzees”. They were used in experiments against the Nuremberg Code, a set of rules guiding ethical practice.
Patients submitted complaints to the General Medical Council (GMC) once they had the evidence. This body not only failed to act but allowed patients to continue to be treated for years by the very same doctors that had experimented on them and were implicated in unlawfully killing patients. This caused terrible fear and stress in patients who were often treated very badly by medical staff for speaking out. Some patients infected with HIV, hepatitis B and C and exposed to variant CJD said they were terrified to be left alone in hospital and begged relatives to remain with them 24 hours a day.
You only truly understand bio-terrorism when you open your door to a man in a bio- hazard suit and you realize no hospital has given you guidelines on how to safely nurse your loved one.
One of the complaints was that doctors had tested their patients for viral infection HIV and hepatitis viruses after giving them plasma products and then withheld positive test results sometimes for years putting their family members at risk also. This was evident from matching dates of tests to dates within medical records of when the patient was actually informed of their infection. Yet no doctor was ever held to account.
The biggest lie (proven by extensive and award winning research) was that this tragedy was an “unavoidable accident” as stated by government. In fact documents showed repeatedly that the government and other authorities suppressed key evidence, trashed important documents and threatened and tried to silence those that had evidence of deliberate unethical experimentation, gross negligence and unlawful killings.
The media that did try to expose were threatened with a D notice (Defence Advisory Notice) not to publish and penalized by press bodies with stories closed down. Again this evidence was presented at the Archer Inquiry.. One case involved a well known doctor who lied to protect himself, and made a complaint regarding journalist Susan Douglas to the Press Complaints Commission. She has still not received an apology despite evidence presented showing this doctor to have deceived the public.
“a doctor is not guilty of negligence if he has acted in accordance with a practice accepted as proper by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular art”
“The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd”
The problem was the vast MAJORITY of doctors nationwide had acted in a dangerous and unethical way so medical staff, hospital authorities, the GMC and British government who advocated the treatment and knew the practices involved all conspired to cover -up and are still doing so. The problem for the GMC was that had it acted properly it would have had to have struck off almost all haematologists treating haemophiliacs during a certain period of time.
Ken Baxter, painted blood red and holding a skeleton to represent the global haemophilia community that received US prison blood
“Behind each adverse event there is a patient, a doctor, and a doctor-patient relationship. A patient must be told when things have gone wrong. Every effort must be made to minimise the after effects, including financial compensation where necessary. Most patients wish to know in detail what happened and what is being done to reduce the possibility of a recurrence. And members of healthcare teams need mechanism to come to terms with their fallibility. It is hoped that clinical governance will make a difference (BMJ Letters Page 19-16 th August 2000)”
When we consider the actions of former doctor, Tariq Ali, although he was convicted of violence and extremism, it is important to consider who had the most extreme behaviour? Was it Ali or dozens of doctors whose behaviour unlawfully killed 2,500 patients and irreversibly damaged 2,300 more? There is no comparison in the way these cases were handled and that is both shocking and deeply disturbing.
BBC Newsnight highlighted this issue in 2007 and was nominated for best Newsnight of the Year by Royal Television Society (RTS) for factual reporting
These are the double standards of western so called “democracy” that are forever criticising the human rights violations of other countries but will not act on their own abuses. Ali’s case also highlights that as an Asian Muslim male he was always going to be held accountable. There is a popular narrative around extremism which is narrowly defined and does not seem to include looking at the extreme behaviour of white, Christian men.
Ali’s conduct outside the hospital environment during a protest came under close scrutiny and he was severely punished. Doctors who repeatedly biologically assaulted their patients for years on end by injecting them with deadly viruses went unchecked and they literally got away with killing their patients and breaking every ethical rule in the book!
Ironically someone who was punished was a prisoner named Rolf Kaestel in Arkansas State Penitentiary. Lawyers and human rights activists have argued that Kaestel would have been released long ago had he not given evidence on the prison plasma centre to a documentary maker Kelly Duda (Factor 8, The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal) to support infected haemophiliacs. See,
The contaminated blood “treatment” batch numbers given to UK patients were traced back to Arkansas and other prisons by both lawyers for haemophiliacs and Kelly Duda. The Archer Inquiry took evidence from Duda but the British government failed to carry out the recommendations of Lord Archer stating “the state of the economy” meant they were unable to compensate victims properly and a full and open public inquiry was “not in the interests of the public”. It was not in the Archer Inquiry remit to establish legal liability so sadly not all the evidence provided was even heard.
In France two doctors in high ranking positions plus a former health official were jailed for their part in a “contaminated blood scandal” but no such action was ever taken in Britain.
Alistair Burt MP has given a commitment to raising these issues with the government. How long are families to wait, decades? Many patients have long since died and “justice delayed is justice denied.” As no lessons have been learnt from the past, one can only imagine what experiments might be carried out on patients in the name of Ebola “treatment” the latest health scare to emerge around the world!

An all-around harness for any level of female climber, the Black Diamond Primrose SA features our Dual Core Construction to provide an expert balance of comfort, ventilation and durability. Dual Core Construction uses two slim bands of high-tensile webbing on the outer edges of the women’s-specific waistbelt and a venting OpenAir foam insert in the center to balance comfort and breathability without pressure points. Our trakFIT leg loop adjustment system uses a simple, secure slide adjuster to quickly and easily adjust the diameter of the leg loop and provide a wide range of fit.
Rythmic breathing leads to tranquillity of the mind which insures a control over the brain functions. Our brain action, when harmonious with the promptings of the soul, will express ideas which insure a better understanding in our relations toward manifestation and lead us into paths wholesome to our physical being. We then shall be able to listen to the still, small voice from out of the realms of conciousness, manifesting through the sense of intuition revealing to our being the requisites toward sustenance of a happy existence, as the foods partaken of denote the condition of our organic being, or the position of mind and soul.
It is well to note that whatever may be our bodily affliction, there is mainly but one disease, therefore, dis-ease. Mental depression can exist only when there is an organic derangement, the latter being possible only where there is insufficient intelligence for functional action. The normal action of the bodily organs depends for its supply upon the generation of electric fluids through the ganglionic vibrations of the nervous system, and that can be assured only by a normal circulation of the blood, of which the latter necessitates perfect breath capacity.
The abstinence from animal foods alone will not assure us of the enjoyments of perfect health. We are to learn that vegetation of the greatest concentrated elements would be the most appropriate for man's use. Wheat ranks the foremost in concentrated food values. One cupful of wheat soaked overnight, divided to make two meals, with double the quantity of fruit and two tablespoons of oil, will keep the average person in good health, strength and vitality. One day of fast out of a week will insure better action of the organic functions. To form greater salivary action conducive to digestion and assimilation, all one needs to do is to take a thorough breathing exercise before partaking of meals, and observe this rule when breathing: To keep head erect, mouth closed, teeth separated, tongue resting at lower part of mouth, chest high, shoulders drooping and spinal column erect.
The world is awakening to a better realization. Now that the spirit of the times demands greater brain action, it necessitates on our part the direction of the same into more diversified channels. To meet the requirements of time we find that the mind, although ever so active, must have a suitable instrument, otherwise all our achievements will result in failure. There has never been a doubt but that our ideas are the outcome of vibrations resulting from the kind of food we have partaken of, as well as our relation to the elements we breathe. It is important for us to learn that the food we eat is to furnish the necessary elements for the continuation of the material cell which is obtainable from the grains only, as they are a concentration of the dual forces in nature, soil substance and light vibration. In gaining health, as well as in retaining it by living upon grain, keeping up the eliminating action by additional use of fruits, with oils to encourage muscular activity, we would have little trouble in remaining harmonious with the conditions and requirements of time.
The less we cook our foods, the smaller is the quantity required. The less waste of the food, the less organic action in this particular direction would be required, and the continued action could be directed toward the concentration of energies that form the intelligence. Because there is plenty upon the earth does not necessitate wastefulness on our part, nor are we expected to use the things before us because of their presence. We sometimes hear people say that they are boarding, and for this reason they cannot follow a diet nor fast, as they have to pay for their board. We are not compelled to board where we cannot prepare foods ourselves; it will be best to learn to live on foods which need little preparation, and if we have a will to do so, we can find a way to live a better and more enjoyable life. We can make it a point not only to eat a little at a time, but to eat not more than twice a day. Fleshy people should not eat heavy breakfasts, and only drink as little as possible; while lean people will find it best to eat a late breakfast and an early dinner. All solids should be masticated thoroughly, until tasteless; all liquids should be drawn between the teeth and turned in the mouth several times before being swallowed. Keeping the mind upon the work before one, entertaining ideas of the highest possible nature pertaining to food values, mastication, and assimilation, we shall find that one-half of the regular ration to which we are accustomed, will satisfy us, gradually decreasing the quantity until the least morsel will furnish all the material required for soil substance by our organic system for the perpetuation of cell formation. Following a diet with rhythmic breathing for six, nine or more weeks, will bring a gradual change for the better, not only in our physical health, but also a clarity to the brain cells.

Oscar-nominated "Not My Life" lifts the veil on the prevalence of human trafficking on a global scale.
And a critical part of your public relations practice is protecting confidential information. This may surprise those who think of PR primarily in terms of communication, but it’s true all the same, and it’s even embedded in the Public Relations Society of America Code of Ethics: “A member shall: Safeguard the confidences and privacy rights of present, former, and prospective clients and employees.”
Your public relations counselor, whether an employee or a vendor, has to be someone you can trust with private information that is relevant to any information going out in public. This enables us to steer around any sensitive areas and avoid inadvertently revealing something private or proprietary. (For this reason, it’s a good practice to have a non-disclosure agreement in place if you have an external PR firm.)
For publicly held companies, the Securities and Exchange Commission has strict rules regarding what you must release, when you should release it, and even how you should do so. It might be helpful to review these, but ultimately, this is an area in which case the firm’s lawyers will call the shots.
For purposes of this post, I’ll focus on privately held companies with no reporting requirements. If you don’t have stockholders, it’s pretty much up to you to decide what to reveal. Here are some things I routinely advise clients to keep to themselves:
Sales figures. Frequently, a publication may decide to do a roundup of “the 10 biggest” firms in a given city or industry. Local business journals will often call for information for lists such as “the biggest real estate firms in [CITY].” While it might be good publicity to top a list, you should consider whether you want your competitors to know certain things, including sales, number of employees and other commonly requested data. You also run the risk that other firms may inflate their numbers, because there is no way for the publication to verify it. Often, it may be advisable to either offer something you’re willing to share (which they may or may not accept) or simply decline.
Prices and contract terms. When you execute a contract with a customer, nobody needs to know everything that’s in it. If you’re a retailer, of course, you’ll probably find it to your advantage to publish your prices. But in the wholesale and services arena, you may be better off keeping it private. In making these decisions, also keep in mind that your customers may not want you revealing what they pay, especially if they’re reselling goods and services they buy from you.
Salaries. What you pay yourself, your employees and your vendors is nobody’s business (except the IRS, of course).
Negotiations. Never reveal who you’re negotiating with, or what you’re talking about. It may be tempting to tease a major upcoming sale, but it’s always a terrible idea. Have someone confiscate your phone until the urge to do so passes.
Remember to consider the long term implications of information you may disclose. Let’s say you’re selling real estate and you had a great year. You want the world to know just how big and successful you are! But market conditions ebb and flow, and if you trumpet this year’s sales numbers, the press and others may expect you to the same thing next year, when things aren’t looking so great. Those who notice this will assume correctly that things aren’t going so well for you – rarely a good message point.
So what do you do when the press calls asking for information you’re not willing (or required) to disclose? The best practice is to simply tell them that’s private and you’re not willing to disclose it. But it’s important to do so in a way that preserves your relationship with them. You may find it best to respond by email to minimize the risk that the reporter will keep asking questions and trying to pump you for information you shouldn’t reveal.
Even if you don’t want to say anything, it’s important to respond. Otherwise, you may be reading in the local news that you declined to return calls, which in the wrong context can make you look dishonest. And no matter what you’ve seen in the movies, never say “no comment.” That always makes it look like you’re hiding something.

This report summarizes the design and development of an adaptive e-learning prototype for middle school mathematics for use with both sighted and visually disabled students. Adaptation refers to the system's ability to adjust itself to suit particular characteristics of the learner. The main parts of the report describe the system's theoretical foundation, architecture, models, and adaptive algorithm. We also review approaches for making assessment systems accessible to students with visual disabilities. Finally, we conclude with a summary of upcoming studies in relation to important research questions concerning micro- and macroadaptation. Using a design approach like the one described in this report may set a new precedent for environments that adapt to support student learning based on larger sets of incoming abilities and disabilities than have been considered previously.

In the past few years I have been trying to make better decisions about my lifestyle and nutrition. In this, I found out that I have some food allergies! I am allergic to a plethora of nuts, seeds and their oils.
This has made it particularly hard in finding healthy snacks to eat. A lot of dried fruits have added sunflower seed oils that trigger itching and swelling for me.
I decided that to fully know what is going into my body from the food I am eating I need to use fresh fruits and vegetables and always thoroughly read ingredient lists.
This led to the purchase of a dehydrator, that way I can purchase the organic fruit I like and make my snacks myself. I purchased a Nesco Dehydrator. (See La Mer's STORE for associate link to look at this model.) It had some good reviews on Amazon and wasn’t too expensive.
I make dried apples, strawberries, nectarines and more! My favorite snack I make in my dehydrator is Kiwi! Who knew it would be so delicious? I think it tastes like sour gummy candy. (Some say it’s too sour.)
Kiwifruit is an excellent source of vitamin C and vitamin K as well as a very good source of copper and dietary fiber. It is also a good source of vitamin E, potassium, folate, and manganese.
Every weekend, I take time to make my snacks for the week and it has really helped keep me in line with my food goals and decision making during my hectic work week.

At Crown House, this updated 2BR/2BA penthouse condo is all about the views. The 9 unit, pet-friendly enclave is across the street from the ocean and South Beach Park. View peeks at the ocean from several rooms.Newly painted apartment w/ new windows and roll down shutters overlooks Old Riomar. Kitchen features granite counters with black granite sinks,has a first-floor guest apartment.
so I did the timing and balance belt on my 99 accord 2.3L. At start up it's quiet and smooth. As it warms up it starts to get a whining noise and the idle roughens some. Ive done other timing belts before but never a honda. I didnt crank on the belts when I installed them. Any ideas or tips? Thanks.
Check (and probably replace) the tensioner. If you didn't replace that, as well as the water pump, when you did the belts, then you really should go back and do it. Those things are likely at the end of their lifespan by this point.
If those were replaced (by quality, OEM components), then check the tension on the belts and make sure they're not too tight. Too-tight belts can also make noise, and cause all sorts of expensive problems. You don't want to mess around with this stuff on an interference engine like the F23A.
i did replace all the items you mentioned with aisin or oem parts. Turned out that the balance belt was a little too tight. readjusted and all is good. thanks for the reply.
Whenever doing the timing belt service always hand crank engine with the spark plugs out, valve cover off , rotate crank counter clockwise 7 complete rotations constantly checking the tdc marks both on cams and crank , as well as checking the belt tention by using your thumb and pointer finger to turn the belt to 90 degrees it shouldn't go past that as well attended the 90 degree point should be fairly hard to go further , I belive the tentioner should be 40 pound ft, this is what I did on my 98 integra ls non vtec

Written On Water: Writings About the Allegheny River – Edited by Helen Ruggieri and Linda Underhill – (with bonus CD!) – Mayapple Press
Written On Water: Writings About the Allegheny River – Edited by Helen Ruggieri and Linda Underhill – (with bonus CD!)
The Allegheny River is the easternmost west flowing river in the United States and was a major thoroughfare for early settlers. This anthology looks at the Allegheny historically, and as both a recreation area and a spiritual area today. The poems and prose pieces detail the full flow of the river, beginning near Port Allegany, PA; crossing the state line into New York; dropping back into Pennsylvania through small towns and forests; and merging with the Monongahela at Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River. When it was dammed by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1960s, the Seneca Reservation lands (a mile on each side of the river) were flooded and the residents displaced. The land given by treaty to the Senecas by George Washington for as long as the grass is green and the sky is blue is now under mud and water. The Kinzua Dam protects Pittsburgh from flooding according to the Corps. You’ll read laments, you’ll read celebrations. You’ll hear chants, songs, and poems on the enclosed CD, performed by Pete Seeger, Peter LaFarge, Jerome Rothenberg, Maggie Anderson, the Senecas, and more. This print and audio anthology documents the river that was, the river that is, the river of the mind, and the river of the spirit.
A page linking to the lyrics (where known) of the pieces on the CD which are not in the book itself: Written On Water Bonus CD – Lyrics
If a river is a poem, and I think that it is, the Allegheny is a special one, for all the reasons captured in this collection of fine work. The writers here explore the kinds of life and sustenance a river provides, physical and spiritual. They capture the tensions and connections between the human and natural worlds where they meet in moving water. The range of voices here is wide, and surprising, like a river surprises—fast, slow, high, low, changing from day to day. Like a poem, a river sometimes seems random, but it takes us on a journey, as this book does. More than anything, these poems capture the magic, the mystery and beauty, the plain rightness of rivers. – Jim Daniels
Written on Water contains a Bonus CD. Some of the items on the CD are audio versions of texts in the book, others are studio and live recordings of performances related to the Allegheny.

I (again) haven't posted in literally forever, but I guess I was just feeling very unmotivated to write and was out of decently-interesting ideas. However, I was tagged by the lovely eternalleigh.blogspot.com to do the Liebster award! I really like the idea of this tag, so thank you so much for tagging me and finally giving me the inspiration to write something X.
Honestly, I love cities, so basically any capital of a country would do! However, if I had to list an ideal holiday destination for myself, I'd have to say Los Angeles. It's simply the perfect mix of city and beaches, which I personally think I'd really enjoy. Not gonna lie, I love the idea of being around so many celebrities as well, haha! Also, I absolutely adore Paris and London.
Definitely on an adventure holiday! Personally, I really hate the idea of just lying around in the sun all day and not doing anything. It makes me feel very unproductive and I'd rather spend that time out and about.
Personally, I am inspired by many of my favourite YouTube/Social media celebrities, especially by Cameron Dallas, Matthew Espinosa, Hunter Rowland, Tana Mongeau, Weston Koury and The Gabbie Show. I'm also a big fan (love them or hate them!) of Kylie Jenner and Nicki Minaj.
I feel extermely basic and unoriginal for saying this, but my favourite lipstick shade is Velvet Teddy by Mac! Overall, I just really like darker-toned beige lipsticks, preferably matte.
Sushi! Not much to say about it; I'm just completely addicted with Sushi! I also love Mac and Cheese. Yep, I'm (again) very basic and unoriginal when it comes to food!
I've never really had/discovered a certain 'talent' of my own, so I'm not particularly sure how to answer this question. Umm... does being overly talkative and able to ramble on for hours and hours on end about random stuff count? Just kidding:)
Perfume-wise, I'm slightly obsessed with the Victoria's Secret body sprays. My favourites are 'Pure Seduction' and 'Mango Temptation'. Literal scent-wise, I happen to really like the smell of new books, haha.
When I was a little kid, I always wanted to be a Vet, but as a got slightly older I changed my mind. Currently I really want to become either an editor-in-chief of a high magazine, a film director, or even a personal assistant to a celebrity, when I 'grow up'. However, I literally change my mind about this every week, so I'm not 100 percent sure these aspirations will last a long time!
Actually, yes I do! I'm finally going on holiday for 4 days to my dream destination, Los Angeles, as well as for 3 days to New York. I'm extremely excited, as I've wanted to visit both of these cities for years! It will also be the first time I have ever visited the USA/ left the continent of Europe, which is rather interesting, haha. I also plan to hopefully start broadcasting on YouNow and (maybe) even attempt starting a YouTube channel.
I've only ever posted a few blog posts, so I don't exactly have a lot of 'blogging experience' but I guess I'd say receiving all the lovely comments and being able to talk about my interests and experiences on the internet! I think blogging is a great creative outlet and I really wish I was more consistent with it.
I tag YOU reading this to attempt doing this tag ( unless you don't want to of course!) and answer these questions also!
Hey, I (again) haven't posted in literally forever, but I guess I was just feeling very unmotivated to write and was out of decently-i...
Hey, long time no speak... I haven't posted anything in ages (terrible, I know, but I was very busy!) , so I decided to get back int...
Unless you’ve been living under a roc you probably heard the news that Spotify is available on this side of the pond. And from all of the noise on the interwebs it sounds like something revolutionary has just been unleashed. But why? Let’s recap what Spotify offers:
Spotify Free – the unsurpassed free music service. With an invite, enjoy on-demand, buffer-free access to over 15 million songs on your computer, great social features, manage your own music files through Spotify, and sync with your cellphone or iPod. Features occasional advertising.
Spotify Unlimited – all the special features of our free service but with uninterrupted, ad-free access to Spotify on your computer. All for only $4.99 a month.
Spotify Premium – the all-singing, all-dancing, top-of-the-range Spotify experience. Premium gives you access to all the music, all the time. Listen online or offline, on your computer, your cellphone and a whole heap of other devices. Enjoy enhanced sound quality and access to exclusive content, competitions and special offers. Premium costs just $9.99 a month (that’s the equivalent of a few fancy coffees).
OK so it’s 15m songs and it’s free on a PC with ads, $5 for no ads on a PC or $10 for the ability to listen offline (for as long as you pay for the service), ad free and on your phone as well. Here it is in a more graphical form for those of you who prefer it that way:
OK and then there’s Microsoft. They’ve got their own music service you already know named Zune with access to 11m songs. It’s a single plan. For $15/month you get unlimited streaming to your PC, Windows Phone and Xbox (3 computers and 3 portable devices) but you get to keep 10 tracks each month and those are your to keep even if you stop paying for the service. There is a slight discount if you buy a year in advance which gives you two months free (so it’s $12.50/month effectively). And it comes with Smart DJ which is great if you’ve ever tried it…great music just keeps flowing.
Now I have no idea what the number of Zune Pass subscribers is but I don’t think I’m going out on a limb by suggesting that Spotify has them squarely outnumbered. Sure part of it is Microsoft’s entire lack of effective marketing. I mean, when I turn on my Windows Phone it should fire up with 30 days of Zune Pass to get me good and hooked without any effort…but it doesn’t. But that’s not the real problem.
You see all those fancy-ass tiers that I have to go through with Spotify? Microsoft is king of tiered pricing (I dare you to figure out Office 365’s pricing) yet here there’s only one option for Zune Pass and it’s paid. And it’s so simple – $15 and you get unlimited and get to keep tracks, then match Spotify down the tiers otherwise ($10 for offline while you’re a member and mobile, $5 on a PC and free with ads). Yes, Zune has to have a free version with ads. But that’s nothing for Microsoft. They are in the ad business. I mean, putting Google aside there’s no one better equipped to do this than them.
Microsoft, if you’re serious about creating an ecosystem then get serious and start fighting. This should be child’s play to you considering all of those Xbox users that you’re gaining each month and that’s a gateway drug to Zune on PC’, etc.
@markiz: Actually, the carriers have been doing this since launch. I tried Zune Pass with a free month from AT&T. Ended up keeping it. :)
@Mark Jonson: well yes it does come with the Phone if you know about it or sign up. But what should happen is when you turn on the phone and enter your Live ID you should authomatically get some free time and it should be super obvious what you just got and what it means to you. I know 5 people with Windows Phones – none of them signed up for Zune. Don’t make people sign up – make it happen and let them get used to the service with their shiny new phone…
@Davidk: I can get on-board with that. I’m sure Microsoft worked hard to keep as many steps out of the OOBE as possible, but that would help awareness. I really wonder how many Windows Phone 7 users without a Zune Pass actually use the music-playing capabilities of the phone… =/
@Mark Jonson: I’ll make a confession – I had the 3 month piece of paper with my phone and never signed up and now I’m way past that point in time. If it had just fired up I probably wouldhave taken it for a spin, done the math and thought that 10 tracks = $10 so it’s really just $5/month for streaming everything else and that’s a great deal…and as much of an MS whore as I am (yup, just signed up for a year of Xbox Gold) I haven’t had a Zune Pass but I do use Zune (PC software) and it works great.
@Davidk: I hear you. I love the Zune software and the Zune Pass. While the Zune software works well with music purchased from other services, the software really shines with Zune Pass, as one would expect of such a service. The only problem is that it’s easy to impress someone when you can show off the Zune Pass with a PC, Xbox 360, and Windows Phone. But it doesn’t have the same value when you’re trying to convince a friend (or stranger) that they should get it when they own a PS3 or Android phone. But on the other hand, that makes an excellent segway into demonstrating the Windows Phone and trying to convince them to make the leap from iPhone or Android when they become eligible for an upgrade.
To get back on topic, I’d say a limited free service, as is provided in Bing Music on the web would be a great starting place. For those of you who don’t know, if you don’t have a Zune Pass you can listen to a song in the Zune library full one time if you search for it through Zune. I believe after that it plays a 30-second sample. But perhaps a free tier with 10-20 hours per month would be good, to compete with Spotify and other internet radio. Maybe also a $10 tier that includes the subscription without the song credits?
You are aware that Microsoft is in a heavy partnership with Spotify? And that Spotify was one of the few developers that got very early access to the Mango beta so that they could have a working app ready for demonstration on MIX11?
Also, The Zune software is horrible compared to Spotify imo. I highly value that software is fluid, fast and doesn’t genrally lag and that’s one of the largest reasons I choose WP7 over android. Yet the Zune software is choppy, it takes 10 secounds to stream a song etc while Spotify is buttery smooth, very fast and starts streaming instantly.

Are you crazy? You aren’t uzing the same Zune I’ve been using. Zune and Zune Pass has always wiped the floor with iTunes as a platform. I’ve been a Zune Pass subscriber for the last 14 months. I also use iTunes. I’ve found it to be fast and smooth. It opens a lot faster than iTunes, and I’ve never taken 10 seconds to stream a song. The longest it’s ever taken me to stream a song is about 2 seconds.

A new Boise State University study funded by a grant of more than $700,000 from the National Science Foundation will look at the influence of changing soil structures on water resources in the United States.
Alejandro Flores, an associate professor in the Department of Geosciences, is a co-investigator on a team that includes researchers from the University of Kansas, the University of California, Riverside, and Pennsylvania State University.
Boise State’s role in the project, said Flores, will be to examine how rapid changes in soil properties might affect water availability and runoff across the continental U.S.
To do this, Boise State researchers will develop a series of experiments with a computational tool that will evaluate how much less water soils can take in as their characteristics change, then assess where that water ultimately will go.
“These potential changes in the physical properties of soil are an unanticipated consequence of a changing climate and they could have important ramifications for everything from crop productivity, wildland fire and flooding,” said Flores. “It’s important that we understand those ramifications and identify where we need to improve our fundamental understanding of soil systems.”

The New York Rangers looked to get back on track when the club took on the Florida Panthers on Tuesday, March 22, at Madison Square Garden.
While it wasn’t the Rangers’ best game, it more than likely served as a self-confidence booster going forward with the 2016 playoff stretch. New York played in its first home game since departing for a West Coast road trip last week, where the Rangers end the trip with consecutive losses.
RECAP: #NYR return home to beat Panthers 4-2 as Nash scores winner & Henrik makes 25 saves https://t.co/N2t34CBKyy pic.twitter.com/n9Z03hf6o7
The Rangers are now 4-4-2 over their last 10 games, but the recent win re-gained second place in the Metropolitan Division and helped the Blueshirts jump Florida in the Eastern Conference standings for second place as well (90 points).
The Rangers took a 2-0 lead after forward Mats Zuccarello’s power play goal at 3:33 of the second period. New York was 1-2 on the power play, while the club was 0-2 in the team’s last game and loss to the San Jose Sharks on Saturday night.
Zuccarello continues to be the little engine who could for the Rangers, and the club’s most consistent offensive player. The Norwegian’s sixth power play goal was a goal scorer’s goal by all means, and it should be interesting to see how opponents will look to shutdown No. 36 in the Stanley Cup Playoffs; plus how Zucc will change and adapt to the spring season’s style of play.
Goaltender Henrik Lundqvist looked sharp as usual at the World’s Most Famous Arena. The King is now 20-5-2 at Madison Square Garden, while posting a .920 save-percentage.
Rick Nash scored his 13th goal of the season and it was the first time Nash found the back of the net since December 30. No, it wasn’t the prettiest goal the six-foot-four forward has earned over the years, but for his own self-confidence reasons — it was worth getting excited about.
Overall, the defense’s play has been better than it once was earlier on in the season…Kevin Klein, Ryan McDonagh and Keith Yandle all finished with a plus rating, and the other three defensemen finished with an even plus/minus rating.
New York has nine games left to play and the biggest aspect to look out for — is how the offense will find more consistent production from here on out. Rick Nash and forward Eric Staal need to get going and pick up their play, as those two veterans will be key in leading the Rangers during the playoffs.
The Blueshirts next game is on Wednesday night at 8:00pm vs. the Boston Bruins. The game will be televised via NBC Sports Network and will be the featured Wednesday Night Rivalry game.

When this has been uploaded I will be standing in a field watching my partner and a few more girls playing football, how exciting eh! I would rather be in bed having a lie in but I've turned in to a little football photographer. I really hope I don't turn in to one of these mad supporters that scream at the players like I do when I'm at home watching Manchester City play. I can't cope, that's too embarrassing to think about! I wanted to keep my blogging streak going so thought I'll post this little post for a Sunday read. I've got some exciting post to do Monday so keep an eye out!
I received these lipsticks about a year ago but never got around to trying them out. These were my first Accessorize products I've tried and I'm really impressed. How beautiful is the packaging?! I love the floral design and the cute little owl (I've only just realised you can't see it on these pictures, sorry). A great size product for an amazing affordable prize; what more could you possible want.
When I received this lipstick I never ever thought of actually using it as I normally wear brighter pink/purply colours. My pictures really don't do any justice but the it's a gorgeous red-brown colour. With having dry lips this lipstick doesn't bother me that it's matte. If I was having a bad dry lip day I would just use the little pot to add abit of gloss to my lips, simple as that!
I've worn this lipstick none stop over the past couple of months, I absolutely love it! It's a gorgeous deep red-plum colour and is matte again. I've never really liked wearing this kind of colour but when I first tried it on I feel in love. The little pot colour is amazing to wear on it's own too. I normally top up on lipstick through out the day but it does have a lasting effect. If you are unsure you could always us Lipcote!
That colour is lovely, you really suit it. I've used the mascara in the past and it was not up to much but the packaging is so pretty.
I love these colours. Perfect for day to night! Never used Accessorize lippy before but will definitely try...

BTW, before I go on time to catch up again. I'm up in the Seattle area visiting my Grandma Specht for a week. Totally surprised her, she didn't know I was coming but she had no prob with a surprise guest. So I'll be here until Saturday. Fun fun.
So the funny, Grandma, my cousin, Awesome Aunt and I were watching Indiana Jones tonight and I was lounging in the La-Z-Boy chair during the whole movie. I had it leaned back and my feet up on When the movie was over I got up to pull the DVD out but I found I couldn't get out of the chair. My pump was stuck. I followed the line to the pump. It had slipped out of my pocket all the way down into the mechanism of the chair and my hands were too big to reach down in. I sat there for five minutes trying to reach it before I thought to disconnect and pry the cushions open while Awesome Aunt dug in there. It took us a couple of minutes but we got it out.
I hope you are exercising too. That is supposed to be a great way to improve your diabetes. Good luck!
