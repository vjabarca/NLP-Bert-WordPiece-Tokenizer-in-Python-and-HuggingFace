Studies suggest that veterinary acupuncture may be beneficial for a variety of animal species, including dogs, cats and horses. In fact, Chinese and Korean farmers have treated horses and cattle with acupuncture for centuries. In recent years, the applications for veterinary acupuncture have expanded to include zoo animals, small mammals, and pet birds.
Veterinary acupuncture treatments are generally well tolerated by pets as these treatments are gentle and safe. In fact, some pets even fall asleep during treatment because they enter such a peaceful, relaxed state! Treatment sessions typically last between 15 and 20 minutes; a series of five to 10 sessions may be necessary to address a pet’s health condition.
When a pet is suffering from pain, it can be a very frustrating experience for pet owners if they are unable to do anything directly to alleviate this pain. If a pet is not responding to conventional anti-inflammatory medication or other pain medications, then acupuncture may be able to help.
In addition to pain management, veterinary acupuncture is also beneficial for treating the following conditions: (1) disorders of the musculoskeletal system such as arthritis, (2) paralysis of the rear limbs, (3) seizures, (4) back pain, (5) facial nerve paralysis.

The theme (Monkeyland): the unifying subject was apocalyptic, which came across very well. The overall pace: Extremely good. I really wanted to get to the next page and find out what would happen next. An excellent pace. V. D.
AL...OH MY GOD MONKEYLAND IS AWESOME!!!!! Halfway done and still sucked into it!!! Great book! Your characterizations are incredible, your metaphors are unique and mental image producing, and the nuances of the plot are captivating. D. K.
I just started reading Monkeyland this morning...and I cannot put it down! This stuff is incredible. It has been a long time since I have been sucked into a book on PAGE ONE!!! D. C.
I read your book! Exciting pace and good action. Interesting premise and I look forward to the rest of the Monkeyland saga. Well done! J. D.
Unbelievable. I stayed up late on work nights, tired the next day because I couldn't put it (The Bomber's Story) down. When do I get to read 'The Lone Star Revolt?' DK
What a delightful surprise it is when you pick up a book and find you can't put it down until the very last page, and Path of the Snake is one of those books. It's been a long time since I have violated my 'no captivating reading material before bed' rule! CM
When I finished Path of the Snake I laughed out loud until I nearly cried, then I was speechless for a good long while. It's been a long time since I've read a book that good! DK
Having read at least a few thousand fiction books and series in my lifetime, I can testify that the Monkeyland series by Al Case is the best fiction series I've ever read. It's got everything. The characters are so well-written and real that it's just incredible. Even with the bit characters, you will find yourself caring and wondering what will happen to them. Al Case does an excellent job of transporting you to the locale and showing you around. The plot is gripping -- and fascinating -- and completely original. Everything from the attitude of the press, to the complacency of government and the reality and depth of people's thought and character, is remarkably true to life.
"The Bomber's Story truly is THE ULTIMATE CONSPIRACY SAGA, as advertised! When I read this, I just couldn't put it down! The ingenious blend of fact, fiction and rumor that is artfully mixed into the story proves to be excellent reading. You might even get interested in the history of some of the real events in here (I certainly did!), but even if you don't, the book has an excellent and engaging plot that will pull you right along from page one to the end. Original and thought-provoking.
Wow! I am reading part 1 of Machina. I never have time to read anymore, just too busy. But, I cannot put this book down! Your characters are believable and interesting and the plot is growing and capturing my attention like no book has in a long time! Can't wait to get a chance to pick up the book again later today! Thanks! Dee
If you could get passed the “raciness” of this book, it’s one helluva read. Extremely well written with an outrageous story with some outrageous characters. Whether good or bad characters – They’re all very likable. Mr. Case puts you right in the middle of the action/scene. He’s written this book so that you’re right in the middle. I’ve found a new favorite author to include with King, Koontz, Patterson, Grishom, Woods, etc………

The 9th grade Science & Sustainability curriculum focus was environmental science. Throughout the entire year the students continuously analyzed their role in climate change. By using the resources such as the "NOAA Climate Change Toolkit", the "Buy, Use, Toss" curriculum, and "Teaching Populations", the students were exposed to lots of hands on activities that expanded their learning.
Students transected various areas of the school grounds. They plotted areas and recorded what was found in each transection. They observed the biodiversity, trash, and temperature of each plot. They used this information to compile a school yard report.
Students used sponges to act as wetlands in their paint pan representations of coastal areas. The students enjoyed working with clay to create highways and animals. They poured colored water at the top of their pans to see where the polluted water would go. This helped them to see the impact pollution would have on the bodies of water at the bottom of their pans. They then placed sponges as barriers to the pollution. The students truly grasped the importance of wetlands after this activity.
Students were excited to dissect an oyster after learning about them during the climate change unit. The students had spent alot of time reading about what had happened to the oyster populations in the Bay. They found it hard to believe that the Bay used to be filled with giant oyster shoals, but now oyster populations have been drastically reduced due to pollution.
As students learned about the impact of carbon on the environment, they completed various activities to expand their learning such as the carbon cycle game.
Students were learning about the Port of Baltimore and the importance of dredging. This build a boat activity gave the students specifications that they had to adhere to for building their boats. The goal of this activity was to have the team with the best design fit the most golf balls in their boat without leaking water into the boat or sinking the boat. The class discussed how hard it is for boats to fit unless dredging occurs. The students then went on to take a field trip to a dredged material placement site to see how dredged material can be used to restore habitats that have been dissipated due to coastal erosion.
The students selected different islands of the Chesapeake Bay to research. They then created their own islands and described what they would do to prevent coastal erosion to the islands they created. The pictures above are several examples of their handmade creations.

Tiny homes are the rave in town now when homes are being mentioned. It’s a concept that is changing people’s lives in a big way and has therefore been garnering up a lot of interest. More and more people are downsizing and living in tiny homes now. You shall, however, need to hire a tiny home builder if you are considering taking one up. The market has a few of them that one can choose from. Therefore it is important to consider a few key elements first. See below some incredible tips of choosing a tiny home builder.
The first thing to do is to carry out some research. Find out if there are any tiny homes builders located near you that have a good reputation. Go through their online profiles and blogs to be able to understand more about their services. Check their work portfolios to understand even more about the tiny homes they have already done. So as to gain further insight on their work, read the reviews and feedback from others that have used their services before.
Consider the costs and set aside an amount to cover their fees and the cost of material. The set up time will be a lot less as everything the builder needs will be available once you do this.
The reputation of the builder is the other thing that must be considered. Find out more about his or her success rate when it comes to building tiny homes and also the success rate they have. You are in the market for a builder who is competent and who does not need constant reminders and follow ups for him or her to do the work. You also want to have one who understands your vision and can therefore meet your needs for the tiny home.
Confirm that the builder is licensed and that he or she is also certified. The builder must be licensed by the governing bodies to ensure the state knows of his work and he or she must also be certified as this is what assures one that they know what it is they are doing. It protects you the consumer from fraudsters and incompetent builders. Therefore, you need to ensure that the builder has the two of these things in place before hiring him or her.
The other thing that you must think of is the experience of the builder. You need a builder who does not cut corners as he or she understands the impact of doing so. Of course the market has some really experienced ones and those that are just breaking into the market and you don’t have to dismiss either based on the experience, thus looking at their previous work is key.
Alek Popov was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1966. He grew up in a family of scientists and translators from French and English. Alek Popov graduated from St. Constantine Cyril the Philosopher Lyceum for Ancient Languages and Cultures in Sofia and later received his master’s degree in Bulgarian language and literature from Sofia University St. Clement of Ohrid. In 1997, he attended the English Language Institute at Wayne State University, USA.
Alek Popov started his writing career very early with a number of short stories designated mainly to entertain his schoolmates at the Lyceum. His first professional steps are marked by the fall of communism and the ensuing period of the so called “Transition” to democracy. Popov’s first collection of short stories The Other Death was published in 1992. During the 90ies Popov produced several collection of short stories reflecting the grotesque and absurd post-communist reality. He made his living contributing to news-papers and magazines often under different pen names. His works varied within broad scope of genres: horror and crime, erotic sci-fi, political satire and adventure. His book Games of Magic won the National sci-fi prize Graviton. Popov’s short stories and essays have been translated into German, English, Hungarian, Polish, Croatian, Serbian, Czech, French, Turkish, Danish and etc. They are part of many anthologies of modern Bulgarian and European prose, among them Best European Fiction 2011 (Dalkey Press Archives) and Hotel Europe (Wunderhorn, 2012). Popov’s most well-known collections include: Nasty Dreams, For Advanced (Helikon Prize, 2002), The Skin Weed, Mythology of Transition, and The Radical Thinker’s Companion.
Popov’s first novel, Mission London, based on colourful impressions from his time as the cultural attaché at the Bulgarian Embassy in the United Kingdom, was published in 2001. It has been widely acclaimed as “the funniest contemporary Bulgarian book” for its sarcastic projection of the Bulgarian diplomatic elite. However in the beginning no mainstream publisher dared to publish the book fearing political consequences. To date, Mission London has been published into 16 languages and has 7 editions in Bulgarian. The film Mission London based on the novel was released in 2010 and according to Variety Magazine was “a breakthrough phenomenon,” leading the Bulgarian box office for weeks. It became the most frequented Bulgarian movie for the last 20 years. In 2011, it won the Unbribable Award of Transparency International Croatia’s program “Culture against Corruption”.
Popov’s second novel, The Black Box, was published in 2007. It appeared in German from Residenz Verlag under the title Die Hunde fliegen tief (Dogs Are Flying Low) and went through several editions. The book reflects Popov’s early loss of his father. A talented mathematician, he was regularly invited as a visiting professor in the USA during the 80ies. He unexpectedly passed away far from home while teaching at Philadelphia University in 89th. Back in Sofia arrived only a small box containing his ashes. Although inspired by a tragic incident the Popov’s story has little to do with any documentary projections. A darkly comic satire, the novel exposes human selfishness, greed and delusion that is found in every society – whether it be in the former Eastern Bloc or the West, a dog-walkers’ union or in the canyons of Wall Street, the rarefied air of academe or the Club of Successful Bulgarians. The Black Box won several awards including the Elias Canetti Prize and was further translated in Serbian, Turkish, Polish and Italian. However seven years later Popov decided to make a complete revision: in search for coherence and clarity, he rewrote several chapters and drew a new ending. In January 2014, The Black Box won the 2013 U.K. contemporary Bulgarian novel contest of the Elizabeth Kostova Foundation, organized in cooperation with Peter Owen Publishers. The book was published in English in April, 2015.
Popov’s third novel, The Palaveevi Sisters: in the storm of History, was published in 2013. The novel is set in turbulent times – World War II and the subsequent Cold War. Popov takes an unusual approach to the painful past and tries to see it through the lens of irony and humor challenging the clichés of history and propaganda. The book headed the Top10 list of best-selling titles in Bulgaria for weeks, won the Helicon Prize for new Bulgarian fiction and was shortlisted for Elias Canetti Prize. In 2014, the novel appeared in German (Residenz Verlag), under the title Schneeweißchen und Partisanenrot (Snow-white/Partisan Red). The book was adapted for theatre and put on stage by Plovdiv Drama Theatre in 2015. A film adaptation is under way. Currently Alek Popov works on the sequel of the novel.
Directors and producers have shown interest in Popov’s works ever since his first books started to appear, but his true affair with cinema begun with the film adaptation of Mission London. He was involved in the screenplay together with Delyana Maneva – a theatre director and researcher in the field of action analysis – and director Dimitar Mitovski. Working for cinema and theatre, Popov claims, helps him to better understand his characters and the nature of their actions and to develop his story lines further on. Alek Popov is author of six radio plays broadcast by the Bulgarian National Radio. In 2012, his play Blacksmiths was produced by the New Bulgarian University Theatre and was shortlisted for the Bulgarian Askreer Theatre Awards. The play was put on stage again by Burgas Drama Theatre in 2013.
For more than a decade Alek Popov was director of the House of Children’s Literature in Sofia and editor in chief of a literary magazine for young writers. Occasionally he teaches creative writing courses and consults movie projects.
Over the years Alek Popov has won many literary awards including the Elias Canetti Prize for his novel The Black Box, 2007; Helikon Award for best prose book of the year, 2002, 2013; Chudomir Award for satirical fiction (Snow-white/Partisan-red) 2013; The Reading Man Prize, 2012; The National Prize for Drama Ivan Radoev, 2004, and etc. In 2012, Alek Popov was elected corresponding fellow of the Bulgarian Academy of Science in the field of Arts. He serves in the board of the Bulgarian PEN and is part of the editorial body of the literary magazine Granta Bulgaria.

The morning after the Deerstalker I debriefed the Crew Chief. With her professional interest in medical provision at sports events I knew she’d be intrigued to hear how the organisers had managed to get first aiders and mountain rescue staff to accessible places on an entirely inaccessible course. We have pretty romantic conversations, the Crew Chief and I…
Anyway we got on to talking about the more extreme end of obstacle races, and the relatively high incidence of serious medical emergencies. This is almost inevitable as gung-ho but technically inept runners throw themselves off increasingly wild obstacles dreamt up by event organisers trying to innovate the next big thing in challenge runs. She mentioned with horror the sheer costs involved of getting ambulances and helicopters to these (often remote) events, calling out highly skilled medical professionals to airlift showboating mud runners to A&E because they’ve somehow got half a femur sticking out of their backsides. Her valid point is that this voluntary, reckless activity is a drain on resources, is unnecessarily dangerous and – crucially - is entirely preventable.
Then I mulled it over for a while. Who else is using the health service’s resources? Where might that ambulance be if not responding to the self-inflicted ailments of runners so desperate to prove themselves that they’ll happily leap through flames or take an electric shock to the face? And most crucially, how many users of our beloved NHS rely on it to treat preventable ailments?
Smokers are an obvious place to start. The latest research suggests that smoking is likely to be costing the NHS between £2.5 and £6 billion every year. Preventable. It’s a similar figure for alcohol-related treatment. Preventable. Obese and overweight patients are more or less a bargain at just £4 billion every year. In many cases, that’s preventable too.
And here’s the fundamental difference; whilst puffing away on a fag, drinking 100 pints of Carling a week or stuffing your face with McDonald’s has literally no discernible health benefit to weigh against the massive cost of related healthcare, those reckless fools launching their fragile bodies off some monkey bars and into a freezing pond are at least being active. To me that really is the crux of the issue; whilst the occasional accident might make obstacle racing seem like a pointless endeavour, it’s reaching a demographic who might otherwise not engage in physical activity. And surely anything that gets people off the sofa and momentarily away from packing their arteries with Greggs sausage rolls has to be a good thing? Take this thought a step further and surely the only conclusion is that any physical activity that raises your heartrate, strengthens your muscles and improves your mental wellbeing has to be a good thing.
And let’s not for a moment discount the health charities and Air Ambulance services who profit considerably from the fundraising efforts of thousands of runners every year. I’m pretty sure that no smoker has ever used their habit as a means of raising money for a cancer charity. It would be a pretty audacious pitch on justgiving, that’s for sure…
I concede that these events are dangerous, and whilst there have been deaths in Tough Mudder races in the USA, it's worth remembering that people also die running marathons, and skiing slightly off-piste, and crossing the street, and in industrial accidents, and from diseases contracted on exotic holidays. Nothing is entirely without risk. I concede also, of course, that rescuing a daft bloke in fancy dress who’s broken an ankle by leaping off a cargo net is a less worthy use of an air ambulance’s limited resources than, say, hastening to the aid of a road traffic accident or to uplift someone suffering a heart attack.
But if ever a Health Minister decides to definitively rank the order of precedence for using our National Health Service, I would petition for the stricken runners to get a decent spot in the queue, to my mind well ahead of people who are eating or smoking or drinking themselves to death. If it’s a race for spots, we’ll probably do alright anyway.

The most cost-effective way to avoid "downtime" and to maintain safety is through our regular Planned Maintenance Program. Accurate Overhead (Toronto) offers affordable service contracts for all Loading Dock Systems, High Speed Overhead Doors, Rapid roll doors and automatic gate Systems. Contact our service department today for more details on how to extend the life of your equipment.
With over 35 years of experience as a southern Ontario loading dock door distributor, Accurate Overhead (Toronto) would like to introduce a Planned Maintenance Program so beneficial and cost effective that it will increase your workers' productivity and safety along with extending the life span of your equipment.
A Planned Maintenance Program ensures proper equipment operation and avoids costly breakdowns. That means employees spend more time being productive on-the-job rather than waiting for time-consuming, unplanned and costly repairs. Our factory trained personnel service your equipment with authorized parts so it adheres to the manufacturers' specifications and does not jeopardize your warranty.
When you regulate your equipment, you achieve the safety standard required for quality operation. And reducing any factor of unpredictability makes your work environment safer! The overall result helps prevent OSHA citations and may reduce workmen's compensation claims by troubleshooting any possible equipment hazards.
you want to see a return on your investment. The Planned Maintenance Program contract assures your initial equipment investment does not rapidly diminish with the normal wear and tear of typical operations. Not only does the Planned Maintenance Program safeguard your investment; it also extends the life span and effectiveness of it! Through monitoring your equipment, minor repairs and adjustments executed on a frequent basis forestall costly major overhauls or premature replacement.
With the Planned Maintenance Program, you receive a full range of service treatments by trained experts, which means trouble-free operation.
INSPECTION All parts, fasteners, welds, and overall operation of equipment are carefully examined and evaluated.
CLEANING A thorough cleaning of all moving parts to remove debris build-up as a result of normal operations is performed on the equipment. In addition, this procedure also includes a cleaning of the surrounding area to promote safety and to remove any outside interference.
ADJUSTMENT Over time, parts become disengaged and misaligned. Therefore, adjustments are needed on a periodic basis. Our service professionals regularly adjust equipment as stated in the manufacturers' manuals to maintain proper working condition and validate the warranty.
LUBRICATION All moving parts and assemblies receive applications of necessary lubricants according to the manufacturers' requirements.
FINAL INSPECTION After a final review of the entire operation of equipment, an Accurate Overhead (Toronto) service representative makes recommendations and notes required parts.
PARTS/EXTRA WORK While a Planned Maintenance Program may extend the quality and duration of your equipment, it cannot guarantee unending life to any product. Eventually parts reach the end of their functional life and require replacement. Upon the customer's authorization, the necessary parts will be replaced. Parts and labor will be billed additionally.
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE In an emergency situation, the Planned Maintenance Program prioritizes immediate action to the customer and expedites the return of productivity to both equipment and employees. If your equipment requires emergency assistance, call our local Accurate Overhead (Toronto) office and our factory trained personnel will make a service call within 24 hours.
COST AND EFFICIENCY In order to assure a cost effective visit, we will pre-schedule the visit with your contact person. Prior to the service call, your assistance in preparing easy access to the equipment will help keep repair costs down and allow the visit to be totally dedicated to inspecting and repairing the equipment.
Whenever our expert service personnel work on your equipment, the result is a detailed service record for your files. One of the Planned Maintenance Program objectives is to meet your company's insurance requirements as it pertains to subcontractors working on-site.

Let the countdown begin! I’m going to be in Oahu in July. This will be my second visit to the island.
Even though I live in San Diego, I’ve only tried surfing in Hawaii. Maybe because the water is warmer, let’s see if I can catch some waves

Located on the North end of Caye Caulker, Belize and only a 2-minute boat ride away, you’ll find Koko King, a white sandy beach, pool and restaurant/bar. There is something so rewarding about taking time to slow things down. As much as I enjoy exploring new destinations, finding the best places to eat and meeting new people, sometimes it just feels right to do nothing and relax.
The small boat leaves Caye Caulker every 30 minutes after 11 am and the ride is free if you spend $10 Belize ($5 US) at the restaurant. We settled on the floating bed for the day. A perfect choice to unwind on the last day of the year.
There are tubes you can borrow to float in the ocean, a giant raft to lounge in with your friends, a big blow up floaty that kids were jumping off of and swings on the dock. You can also rent a standup paddleboard or pay to use the pool.
We spent a few hours here mostly taking naps and the occasional dip in the ocean. Get here early to avoid the crowd. It does get busier throughout the day.
When you’re ready to go back to the other side of the island, just wait by the same dock you arrived at for the next boat ride.

Actually, the kiss kind of makes sense. I'm okay with it. But it will, of course, never work out between them.
Well, that's the most interesting Black Mask has ever been. Although certainly not the most comprehensible.
After what feels like ten years of trying, Geoff Johns finally make me like Hal Jordan, and in only two pages.
I now need more than two hands to count the number of times I've seen Aquaman make the "I'm going to kill Black Manta" speech. I'm thinking of turning them into a collage.
Okay, Mera lied to Aquaman for years about who she really was, so I thinks it's quite fine that he never told her about his old war buddies.
As Absorbascommenter Kevin Trudeau kindly pointed out in my previous post, the inevitable has, indeed, come to pass.
Vibe is part of the re-branding of the Justice League. More accurately, the diversification of the JL brand. There are a lot of comic book supergroups, but none has the power and Q rating of the Justice League, which ushered in the return of superheroes as a genre in the comic book medium, forged the Silver and Bronze Ages, and inspired the creation of the Marvel superhero line. In 1980s, DC experiment with the brand, diversifying with the Justice League International, Justice League Europe, television's Justice League Unlimited, and more regrettable experiments like Extreme Justice, Justice League Elite, and Justice League Antarctica.
The original Silver Age Justice League of America was, of course, an experiment to begin with. Let's put all our most popular heroes in one book and see what happens. It was (as I have said 100 times) the opposite of the editorial philosophy behind the Justice Society of America (which was, "let's put all our heroes together who CAN'T sustain titles on their own, have them operate in coordinated solo missions, and see if we can generate a breakout character). The experiment succeeded.
The next level of experimentation came with the Bronze Age Justice League of America, which widened membership beyond the traditional Seven Icons (sacrificing also-ran Martian Manhunter in the process) and introduced some occasional internal conflict in the formerly oh-so-chummy group. On the whole, that experiment succeeded and many readers still remember the Satellite Era fondly.
The next experiment, meant to modernize the Justice League when its icons were deemed to have grown musty, was the Detroit-based Justice League. That experiment, it is fair to say, did not succeed.
Vibe, as a character, certainly had some flaws-- he was just a bit too brash, too irascible, too obviously a cultural reach-out. In short, he was a tad too "Marvel'. That's what DC had been going for and what they thought their readers wanted; a Marvel-style group of troubled misfits on a Marvel-style group with lots of internal conflict. It's a valid editorial direction, sure...but it's not "the Justice League", and the readers rejected it rather strongly. DC tried to recover, but big ships turn slowly. By the time they started guest-starring the 'real' Leaguers to keep the boat afloat it had already run aground, and the Detroiters were done for.
Again, Vibe had his flaws, but his biggest sin was being part and parcel of the failed Detroit League. Of the three characters created specifically for the Detroit League, only one survived, no doubt by turning invisiblish and running away on her nearly-invulnerable feet.
Yet, as the linked article shows, Vibe will retain many of his core elements. The vibration power. The Detroit. The "Low-rent" hero, um, vibe. The connection with his brother.
But there are subtle changes calculated to make Vibe more viable. Old Vibe was held back by his elder brother. New Vibe is encouraged by him. Old Vibe was over-confident and disrespectful; new Vibe is
There's been some online chat about what DC has planned to the "Rise of the Seven Seas" storyline for the Justice League, so I'm certain I'm about to say anything new in this post. But it will help to crystallize my own thinking about it (and the many fantastic water-based Heroclix figures that such a story could at some point spawn).
If you don't already know, "Rise of the Seven Seas" is a Justice League arc that's been set up in the pages of Aquaman. Just like the "Throne of Atlantis" arc; Aquaman, with his globe-spanning domain of the sea, seems to be an easy first-choice nowadays when DC needs an arc big enough for the entire Justice League.
The story is not just 'something for the League to do'. It's pretty clear that DC editorial (i.e., former Aquaman-writer and Creator-in-Chief Geoff Johns) intends to use it to expand the mythology that centers around Aquaman. Just as he built the Seven Spectrum Corps around Hal "Rainbow Brite" Jordan, he (and the writers) are building 'the seven seas'--seven underwater races/communities/kingdoms--around Aquaman and his role as king of Atlantis.
Johns is quite capable of making up new stuff on his own (e.g., The Trench), but his specialty is taking abandoned or toxic piece of DC lore, cleaning it up and weaving it into a larger, more epic and coherent mythology. That's what he did with the Justice Society, with Green Lantern, and the Flash. And he's been doing it with Aquaman. Whether by artistic bent, fanboy devotion, or company shrewdness, he prefers making an ever-growing quilt than a new blanket of whole cloth. He views DC's past as a legacy of riches to be built upon, not a hampering embarrassment to be destroyed or a heavy yoke of continuity to be borne humbly.
What may very well be happening in "Rise of the Seven Seas' is that Johns will use the story to reintroduce disparate aspects of DC's underwater mythology and tie it all together in a way never done (well) before. The DCU will wind up with seven different undersea kingdoms of different cultures and races. Atlantis is the First Kingdom, Xebel (where Mera is from) is the Second, and The Trench (the chompy creatures of the black deep) is the Third, and the statues in the pic above gives us hints as to what the Fourth through Seventh will be. All of them will be in Aquaman's province, of course (he's 'the King of the Seven Seas'), but several of them will likely have historical associations with other characters as well.
For example, as many longtime readers will remember, part of the Silver Age Superman mythos was his relationship with the merfolk, specifically Lori Lemaris. Strange how many of the important people in Superman's life have the initials "LL".
So one of the underseas races will probably be Merfolk Kingdom. There's no statue of a mer-person among the Seven Seas picture, but if you look closely you can see that there's a seventh statue obscured from our view, probably so as not to give away the return of merfolk to the DCU. And, for the historical reasons mentioned, I assume Superman will probably be the member dealing with them in the Justice League Rise of the Seven Seas story arc..
Wonder Woman also had dealings with merfolk, particularly during her adolescence as Wonder Girl, when Ronno the Mer-Boy was a contender for her affections (even in adulthood, in fact).
How sad is USAF officer Steve Trevor that his major rivals are a guy with no human genitalia and a giant amoeba.
But I'll wager the undersea world we will revived for Wonder Woman won't be the merfolk. It will be the forgotten Atlantean colony of Venturia, ruled by her Golden Age foe, Queen Clea the Imperious.
Queen Clea was a real piece of work, even among Wonder Woman's wacky foes. One time she teamed up with the Penguin, Ibac, the Joker, the Weeper, the Shade, Dr. Light, Brainiac, et al., to fight the JLA and JSA, and enslaved Superman with a mind-controlling "Venus Girdle". We need Clea back; once Wonder Woman comes back from her all-Olympian vacation of Mazzuchelli's run, she's going to need some substantial opponents. A warmongering, slave-owning leader of a queendom of underwater anti-Amazons would fit the bill nicely, and I expect to see her going toe-to-toe with WW in "Rise of the Seven Seas." Take a look at the second statue in the picture; sure looks a lot like Clea to me.
Golden Age Batman, contrary to what many modern readers think, wasn't all about the grim and gritty. He and Robin did LOTS of weird, trippy stuff, including visiting an Atlantis all their own. They fought Nazis there. I guess it was closer than going to Europe.
I don't imagine we'll see a Nazi-infested underwater kingdom just for Batman's sake (cool though that might be). But Geoff Johns could certainly choose to reintroduce, say, Aurania (rival city-state to Clea's Venturia) and give it any characteristics he wanted. The first status in the "Seven Seas" pic is pretty clearly a set up for classic Aquaman foe The Fisherman--the unique headgear is a dead giveaway.
And, even if you include Kurt Busiek's fun idea of his headgear being a alien symbiote, the Fisherman is basically a thematic villain who would seem perfectly at home fighting Batman (or the Flash). So I'm guess that one of the kingdoms will be the source of a modern version of the Fisherman, who will be dealt with by Batman or the Flash during the "Rise of the Seven Seas".
The statue farthest to the right, the insectoid-looking one, is a bit of a mystery. It doesn't seem to correspond to any undersea society from DCU history. I suspect that it, like the Trench, is a new creation by Johns, one to give trouble to Cyborg (who, remember, can now breath underwater) or possibly Green Lantern, because we know how GL fans love their weird alien creatures.
The Shark was reintroduced when Johns brought Hal Jordan back to life, but hasn't been seen since the New52 (during which time Hal's been mostly off-planet). The DCU isn't quite right without him, and that weak knock-off DC keeps trying to foist on us successfully ("King Shark") is certainly no substitute.
Perhaps we will see Name-Or again and his fantastic undersea world of Lemuria, who so memorably but irrelevantly participating in the Attack of Jean Loring's Brain?
I will say this, though, for Grant Morrison. Even as he veers toward the nonsensical, he tends toward the poetical.
What haiku do YOU have to discuss Multiversity, the concept of the multiverse, or Grant Morrison/Lex Luthor's drug use?
Grant Morrison's Multiversity #1, which I was looking forward to, is (of course) a disappointing, muddled mess.
It's another rehash of the pet themes he's been slinging around ever since his days on Animal Man (transquartomuralism, writer as god, reader and the reader's world as part of the story, realities beyond and alongside other realities, the music of the spheres, etc.).
In other words, exactly the same hodgepodge of the same concepts Morrison so spectacularly failed to make word in Final Crisis.
These are fine ideas (even if he's repeated them about 8000 times too often), but, once again, his fractured, kaleidoscopic viewpoint makes it impossible for him to tell a coherent story. At times, in fact, it seems composing a complete sentence escapes him.
And, sure, it makes a little more sense after a second reading. But doesn't EVERYTHING (with the exception of Identity Crisis)?!
In my hobby of choral shows, we call people like Grant Morrison "Concept Producers." They can produce concepts, but they can't produce actual SHOWS. They have fascinating, out of the box ideas... but THEY can't carry them out. Other more sensible, down-to-earth, coherent, logistically-oriented people have to be there to do that for them, or it all winds up a flaming mess. Like Multiversity.
Grant Morrison is such a person. He needs an editor--or a writer-- to put his ideas into action. Until then...
If we want to make GA distinct and culturally relevant in a more modern way, how do we do that if we aren't focused on "Green Arrow as Robin Hood" but rather "Green Arrow as Native American"...?
Our modern world is increasingly complex and diverse, and in a 'shrinking' world society the ability to manage that complexity with diverse people and approaches is key to progress and betterment.
Superman is the most humble and human of all superheroes, even though he's the most powerful Wonder Woman is/has been an ambassador of peace and goddess of war. Hal Jordan's an addled mess with a will of iron. Aquaman, king of the sea, was raised on land. Flash is the fastest man alive, and Barry Allen one of the most slow and methodical. Batman combats criminal violence by breaking the law and beating people up. At the core of most character that maintain our interest long-term, there is some inherent contradiction whose dynamic tension powers that interest.
But, what possible contradiction could fuel our interest in Ollie? He's a complex man, in a complex world--his wealth comes from its complexity--but he longs to be simple and to have a simple life. That's why a high-tech billionaire would become an expert on native American culture: a fascination with 'the simple life' it represents.
In fact, of course, tribal life isn't and never was 'simple'; almost by definition, native cultures have complex societies and systems of belief, ritual, hierarchy, skills, and crafts. But even full intellectual understanding of that wouldn't prevent an idealist like Ollie from romanticizing Native American culture. In one of his most recent incarnations (and perhaps his current one, who can tell?) Ollie's "Q Tech" is like the Apple company, priding itself n making high-tech devices that are simple and help regular people streamline their lines. Making things simple through increasingly complex technology. I'm sure the irony of that would pain a sensitive soul like Ollie's, making his romantic fascination with America's original 'simple life' even more understandable.
Green Arrow is the man who wants problems to be simple enough to be solved by shooting an arrow -- which is why he develops an arsenal of complex specialty arrows. Just as Oliver's love of simplicity lead him toward complexity in his armory
I appreciate DC's desire to diversify its cast of characters, both in their socioethnic origins and their styles. Why, then, not have a hero for whom it's not just an 'add-on' but an essential element? And why not have that be the logical choice: Green Arrow?
Ollie's a rich white guy fascinated with a group of minority cultures (Native Americans). His ward is a white kid RAISED by Indians on a reservation. As suggested by Absorbascommenter CobraMisfit, use Vigilante as his "rival" crimefighter (a laughing singing cowboy who takes very little seriously, compared to the serious CW-like Oliver King). And Vigilante's sidekick, Jimmy Leong, a.k.a. Stuff, who hails from (Star City's) Chinatown, would serve as a hook into stories about the local Asian communities.
Thom Kamalku, in Inuit mechanic, has nothing to do since Hal Jordan went away to space. Why wouldn't Ollie hire him to be his mechanic and tech guy? Ollie could use a "STAR Labs Cisco Ramone" of his own.
You want Green Arrow to have a friendship with Green Lantern? Of course you do. Well, as long as Hal is off playing space-rebel, while not start pairing Ollie up with ... with.... ugh, Simon Baz, I actually had to LOOK UP his name, because so little has been done with 'the Arab-American' Green Lantern, and what has been done has been... not ideal.
All would not be happy with whatever tribe Ollie gather around himself. That would be part of the point, I should think. Ollie wants to embrace diversity but....diversity is complex. It's not simple. Instead of being the all-streetwise liberal big-mouth of the 1970s, Ollie becomes the modern day liberal white guy: desperate to be 'inclusive' but not really having any idea what that actually means. A well-meaning guy who tends to romanticize other cultures than his own and, in the process, rob them of their own rich complexity. I can imagine some lively conversations around the Arrowcave, and a good writer can imagine many more.
DC; (once you are done with this new sure-to-be-cut-short attempt at rebooting GA as a horror title) instead of just tossing in a few Bat-wings, Alan Scotts, and Val-Zods in the corners of the DCU, consider building some of the very issues I think you're hoping to address into the best character you have for doing so:

The Ayrshire property market has continued to see healthy growth, according to leading Scottish property consultants CKD Galbraith.
The regional office in Ayr town centre has reported an increase in property sales and a rise in the number of high quality houses coming onto the market during the third quarter (Q3 July to September 2015) compared to the previous three months.
CKD Galbraith’s research shows a promising picture for the Ayrshire property market and for the Scottish market as a whole which experienced many changes during the first six months of 2015 including a new stamp duty system and the General Election. However, the third quarter’s figures for Ayr reflect the growth and stability that the property market is now benefitting from.
• Supply of properties coming onto the market increased by nearly 10% compared to the same period last year
Bob Cherry, partner and head of residential at CKD Galbraith’s Ayr office said: “The Ayrshire property market has remained fairly resilient to developments within the market and growth has continued throughout the summer months.
“Local buyers still make up a very high percentage of the sales the office has handled with many moving up the property ladder or moving from Glasgow to Ayrshire where we continue to notice property prices offering greater value for money.
“We have continued to agree sales well into the autumn and whilst we expect the traditional slow down as we approach Christmas, demand for good rural property and farmland remains high. Realistic pricing remains key, but we have seen prices achieving the asking price with an increasing number going to closing date and achieving in excess of the asking price. Anyone considering selling should get in touch with us in the coming weeks for a free market appraisal and to prepare early in readiness for the expected continuing demand into 2016.”
CKD Galbraith is an independent property consultancy employing 225 staff in offices across Scotland including Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, Cupar, Inverness, Castle Douglas, Ayr, Elgin, Galashiels, Kelso, and Aberdeen, offering local knowledge, national expertise and enjoying international reach.
The firm is Scotland’s largest and leading rural consultancy managing and providing advice on farm, forestry, land and estate interests on over three million acres.

Murdoch and his wife Lilian (pictured above) have written a book called "Phoenix in a Bottle", describing how they overcame alcoholism and are now, contrary to conventional wisdom, able to drink alcohol responsibly again. "Phoenix in a Bottle" is published by Melrose Books price £16.99 and is now available worldwide.
“Phoenix in a Bottle is a modern version of The Days of Wine and Roses, and tells the true story of how two people who entered a period of desperate drinking stayed with one another in a close loving relationship, and emerged from their alcoholism able to drink responsibly again.
“Both a wonderful love story and a challenge to conventional wisdom about how people can recover from drinking problems, Phoenix in a Bottle gives people hope, and helps them to confront their own demons - alcohol or otherwise.”
“Phoenix in a Bottle” by Lilian and Murdoch MacDonald will now be required reading for all doctoral students in a psychology programme at Alliant International University in San Diego, California.
Alliant International University, headquartered in San Diego and San Francisco, California, was formed in 2001 by the merger of the California School of Professional Psychology (CSPP) and the United States International University. Alliant has 6 campuses throughout California and also runs programmes in Mexico City, Hong Kong and Tokyo. The California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant is one of the premier psychology schools in the US, and it counts roughly half the licensed clinical psychologists in California as its alumni.
Dr. Gary W. Lawson is Professor of Psychology at CSPP. He says: “I adopted Phoenix in a Bottle because the dilemma this couple struggled with and the questions they ask themselves are like so many others I have encountered in 35 years of clinical experience treating addictions.
“However, nowhere in addiction literature have I seen these issues examined and explained as well as Lilian and Murdoch do in Phoenix in a Bottle.

Have I lost all sense of time, or wasn’t that the call of the TEAPublican just three short years ago? Remember when all the tax-hating scaredy cats showed up en masse and voted in a bunch of far-right ideological crusaders who were going to put a stop to all the government waste and get our country back to the business of creating jobs? Am I crazy, or has none of that happened? Instead what we’ve gotten is three years of obstruction, grandstanding and most upsetting — an unhealthy obsession with what women do with their genitalia!
Probably the biggest fallacy of the Tea Party is their obsession with the economy, or rather, their faux-obsession with faux-fixing the economy. Their idea of jobs bills are just deregulation that takes protections away from consumers and the environment in favor of some quick cash now. But the truth is that’s not even the kind of legislation that’s making it out of committee in the House anymore. If House Republicans aren’t holding their thirty-fifth hearing on Benghazi or repealing Obamacare for hundredth time – symbolically – they’re busy writing bills that completely ignore the Supreme Court and worse, science.
Case in point, a bill has made it out of the House Judiciary committee that would ban all abortions after twenty weeks. The bill flies in the face of Roe v. Wade, the prevailing abortion ruling in the land, and the idea of medical viability. The bill, written by Arizona religious sycophant cultist Republican Trent Franks also does not have exceptions for rape or incest. So yes, if this bill were to make it out of the House, get passed by the Senate (it won’t) and then signed by the president (it most certainly would not be), it would then be illegal in this country for a twelve-year-old girl who was raped by her uncle to abort a pregnancy that resulted from that rape. Sure, it’s hard to imagine that scenario, but these are precisely the outcomes that have to be considered. Republicans talk about abortions if they’re all carried about by clueless women in their late teens or early twenties who just don’t want to deal with the responsibilities of their sexuality, completely forgetting how many women and girls are sexually abused in this country every year.
If I wasn’t mad enough about the hypocrisy of a movement saying that Washington is broken and not responsive to the will of the people and then turning around and writing bills that a) have no chance of becoming law until we abolish the First Amendment and establish Christianity as our state religion and b) that no one wants them to be writing because we still have millions of people out of work in this country, I’d still be furious that in this country, in 2013, we still have grown, middle-aged men who think it’s their right to tell women what they can or can’t do with their bodies. Just imagine if a female Democratic member of the House wrote a bill denying access to Viagra and Cialis without an IQ score of at least 50. How many TEAPublicans in Congress wouldn’t get their ED meds then?
I really shouldn’t joke about this inanity. Truthfully this mouth-breathers are precisely why we’re still litigating abortion in this country and not having a much more serious and focused dialog about why women are still institutionally paid at about three-quarters what a man is paid. It’s a lot of fun to make jokes at their expense, but these misogynistic old coots are holding back more than half our population just because of their gender.
Bills like the one Rep. Franks should offend Americans on just about every level. They’re wasteful, idiotic, and so ideologically extreme they’re just wastes of taxpayer money – way to go, “fiscal conservatives!” More importantly though, they signal that while we’ve come a long, long way in this country in terms of our inter-gender relationships, there is still an entire universe of work to be done, and people like Rep. Trent Franks are simply standing in the way.
Perhaps in 2014 the women of Arizona’s 8th District, along with all American women will remember who’s really on their side, and who most certainly is not.

Hazard, Hazid (hazard identification), Hazan (hazard analysis), and Hazop (hazard and operability studies) are important safety and risk management techniques in the steel industry (Fig 1).
Hazard is defined as ‘a condition, an event, or a circumstance that can lead to or contribute to an unplanned or undesirable event’. Hazard is a potential cause to generate a disaster. It has got the potential to cause (i) serious harm to the individual or the environment, (ii) harm, the severity of which depends on the extent and frequency of exposure to the hazard, and (iii) harm that does not usually occur, or is not usually detectable until a significant time (years) after exposure to the known hazard. Any activity, procedure, plant, process, substance, situation or other circumstance that has the potential to cause harm constitutes a hazard.
Hazards are logically classified in the same way as the disaster events are classified. Since a hazard exists because it may result into a disaster, it is usually viewed as natural based, human systems based, or conflict based. Not every hazard results into a disaster, but every disaster is the result of a hazardous condition, whether or not that condition was recognized in advance of the event.
Hazards are normally not identical, not uniform, not exclusive, and not transposable. They are not uniform in their range of occurrence, impacts, or timelines. They have got non identical pattern of development. Hence each hazard is to be understood in the context of its time and place. One hazard generally does not substitute for another, at least at the higher level of classification. Since hazards are not the same, each hazard is to be examined to determine its characteristics in the context of the time and place in which it is likely to impact the organization.
For the characterization of hazards, the following are the key indicators in terms of the situation.
The outcomes of the above key indicators helps in estimating the relative hazard any event poses. The more severe the magnitude of the event or the intensity of impact, the higher is the hazard. Events which can occur at any time of day throughout the year pose a different type of hazard than those that are seasonal or that commonly occur during only part of the day. The individual event in a restricted season may be of catastrophic intensity. The longer the event duration the greater the hazard. It is necessary to consider both the impact and the recovery periods, which may be prolonged for weeks, months, or years. The shorter the timeline for development of the event the higher the hazard.
The wider the area the disaster impacts may cover, the greater the hazard the event poses. The presence of critical facilities in the probable impact zone increases the hazard. This includes facilities necessary for the coordination of disaster response or the operation of emergency teams.
The more often events happen the greater the hazard because of cumulative effects. This is not universally so. In some cases relatively minor events may release energy that may lead to catastrophic failures. Events that are difficult to predict, create a higher hazard because of the lack of reliable signals that protective measures are necessary. Also events that trigger other events or that cause cascading effects are higher in their hazard potential than events that do not typically do so.
Hazid stand for hazard Identification. Steel industry, which is a high risk industry, often requires that all hazards with the potential to cause a major accident are identified.
Hazid is a high level hazard identification technique which is commonly applied on an area by area basis to hazardous installations. Hazid study is the systematic method of identifying hazards to prevent and reduce any adverse impact that could cause injury to personnel, damage or loss of property, environment and production, or become a liability. It is a component of the risk assessment and risk management. It is being used to determine the adverse effects of exposure to hazards and to plan necessary actions to mitigate such risks.
Hazid is one of the best known methodologies to identify potential hazards because it provides a structured approach to identify hazards, potential undesirable consequences, and evaluate the severity and likelihood of what is identified. Hazid involves machine or equipment designers, management and end users, and ensures a full identification of hazards and safeguard procedures in a workplace.
To obtain a list of hazards for subsequent evaluation using other risk assessment techniques. This is sometimes known as ‘failure case selection’.
To perform a qualitative evaluation of the significance of the hazards and the measures for reducing the risks from them. This is sometimes known as ‘hazard assessment’.
Through Hazid, management identifies, in consultation with employees, contractors (as far as is practicable) and safety personnel the following.
The kinds of major accidents that may occur at the plant, the likelihood of a major accident occurring and the likely consequences of a major accident.
Hazid process is to be an ongoing to ensure existing hazards are known, and new hazards are recognized before they are introduced due to the following.
Plant condition monitoring, early warning signals, employee feedback from routine participation in work, and after an incident.
Hazid is a transparent process and is critical to the safety of the plant, equipment, and operating personnel. The benefits of Hazid studies include the following.
Non critical hazards are documented to demonstrate that the events in question could be safely ignored
Hazan is a hazard analysis and is a term used in safety engineering for the logical, systematic examination of an item, process, condition, facility, or system to identify and analyze the source, causes, and consequences of potential or real unexpected events which can occur. A hazard analysis considers system state (e.g. operating environment) as well as failures or malfunctions. Hazan is the identification of undesired events that lead to the materialization of a hazard, the analysis of the mechanisms by which these undesired events could occur, and, usually, the estimation of the consequences. Every hazard analysis consists of the following three steps.
Comparing the results of first two steps with a target or criterion to decide whether or not action to reduce the probability of occurrence or to minimize the consequences is desirable, or whether the hazard can be ignored, at least for the time being.
Hazan is therefore the essential prerequisite for the complete risk assessment process which includes (i) analysis of the hazards, (ii) assessment of the risks which the hazards present, and (iii) determination of ameliorating measures, if any, required to be taken.
Hazan is the first step in the process used for the assessment of the risk. The result of a hazard analysis is the identification of different type of hazards. A hazard is a potential condition which either exists or not exists (probability is 1 or 0). It may in single existence or in combination with other hazards (sometimes called events) and conditions become an actual functional failure or accident (mishap). The way this exactly happens in one particular sequence is called a scenario. This scenario has a probability (between 1 and 0) of occurrence. Often a system has many potential failure scenarios. It also is assigned a classification, based on the worst case severity of the end condition. Risk is the combination of probability and severity. Preliminary risk levels can be provided in the hazard analysis. The main goal of hazan is to provide the best selection of means of controlling or eliminating the risk.
Hazardous Reduces the capability of the system or the operator ability to cope with adverse conditions to the extent that there would be:
(ii) Operators physical distress/excessive workload such that operators cannot be relied upon to perform required tasks accurately or completely
Major Reduces the capability of the system or the operators to cope with adverse operating conditions to the extent that there would be:
Minor Does not significantly reduce system safety. Actions required by operators are well within their capabilities. Include:
Probable Qualitative – Anticipated to occur one or more times during the entire system/operational life of an equipment
Remote Qualitative – Unlikely to occur to each item during its total life. May occur several times in the life of an entire system or group of equipment.
Quantitative – Probability of occurrence per operational hour is less than 0.00001, but greater than 0.0000001
Extremely Remote Qualitative – Not anticipated to occur to each item during its total life. May occur a few times in the life of an entire system or group of equipment.
Quantitative: Probability of occurrence per operational hour is less than 0.0000001, but greater than 0.000000001
Extremely Improbable Qualitative – So unlikely that it is not anticipated to occur during the entire operational life of an entire system or group of equipment
Test interval – The time interval between the testing of a protective system, and its replacement if necessary.
A hazard and operability (Hazop) study is a design review technique used for hazard identification, and for the identification of design deficiencies which may give rise to operability problems. It is a structured and systematic examination of a planned or existing process or operation in order to identify and evaluate problems that may represent risks to personnel or equipment, or prevent efficient operation. Hazop is most commonly applied to systems which transfer or process hazardous substances, or activities where the operations involved can be hazardous and the consequences of failure to control hazards may be significant in terms of damage to life, the environment or property. A hazop study is carried out using a structured approach by an experienced multi-discipline team, facilitated by a hazop leader. The hazop technique is qualitative, and aims to stimulate the imagination of participants to identify potential hazards and operability problems. The relevant international standard calls for team members to display ‘intuition and good judgment’ and for the meetings to be held in ‘a climate of positive thinking and frank discussion’. The hazop technique was initially developed to analyze chemical process systems and mining operation process but has later been extended to other types of systems and also to complex operations such as steel plant operation and to use software to record the deviation and consequence.
Hazop is a structured and systematic technique for system examination and risk management. In particular, Hazop is often used as a technique for identifying potential hazards in a system and identifying operability problems likely to lead to nonconforming products. Hazop is based on a theory that assumes risk events are caused by deviations from design or operating intentions. Identification of such deviations is facilitated by using sets of ‘guide words’ as a systematic list of deviation perspectives. This approach is a unique feature of the Hazop methodology that helps stimulate the imagination of team members when exploring potential deviations.
An inductive risk assessment tool, meaning that it is a ‘bottom-up’ risk identification approach, where success relies on the ability of subject matter experts to predict deviations based on past experiences and general subject matter expertise.
Provide an action list with due dates and identify appropriate person/discipline to progress the action to close out harm. However, risk assessment teams may choose to rate these factors in order to further quantify and prioritize risks if needed.
Hazop is best suited for assessing hazards in facilities, equipment, and processes and is capable of assessing systems from multiple perspectives which include the following.
Design – This includes (i) assessment of system design capability to meet user specifications and safety standards, and (ii) identification of the weaknesses in systems.
Physical and operational environments – It includes assessment of the environment to ensure system is appropriately situated, supported, serviced, contained, etc.
Operational and procedural controls – These includes (i) assessing engineered controls (ex: automation), sequences of operations, procedural controls (ex: human interactions) etc., and (ii) assessing different operational modes such as start-up, standby, normal operation, steady and unsteady states, normal shutdown, emergency shutdown, etc.
Methodology doesn’t force any one to explicitly rate or measure deviation probability of occurrence, severity of impact, or ability to detect

Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan for a Steel Project The environment clearance (EC) process for a steel project (Fig 1) has the following built in steps. These steps are (i) screening, (ii) scoping and consideration of alternatives, (iii) baseline data collection, (iv) impact prediction, (v) assessment of alternatives, description of mitigation measures and environmental impact statement, (vi) public hearing, (vii) environment management plan, (viii) decision making, (ix) monitoring of the clearance conditions. Fig 1 Process for obtaining environment clearance for a steel project The environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental management plan (EMP) is part of EC process. EIA and EMP is normally necessary for obtaining EC for (i) those projects which can significantly alter the landscape, land use pattern and lead to concentration of working and service population, (ii) those projects which need upstream development activity like assured supply of mineral products supply or downstream industrial process development, (iii) those projects which involve manufacture, handling and use of hazardous materials, and (iv) those projects which are located near ecologically sensitive areas, urban centres, hill resorts, and places of scientific and religious importance. For obtaining EC for the steel project, it is essential that a report covering the EIA and EMP) is submitted to the regulatory authorities. This report assists the process of decision making with regards to the EC for the project. In addition to getting EC for the project, the purpose of the EIA and EMP report is to take into account the environmental aspects of the project not only during its implementation but also after its commissioning. The purpose of EIA is to identify and evaluate the potential impacts (beneficial and adverse) of the steel project on the environmental system. It is a useful tool for decision making based...

ABC News has confirmed that the actor, who turned 30 Wednesday, is engaged to Kristen McMullen. Merriman reportedly dropped to one knee and popped the question in New Zealand at the top of SkyCity on New Year’s Eve, just before a fireworks display began.
“I did it on the fly of the moment,” he told reporters Tuesday night at the premiere of his new movie 42, about Jackie Robinson. “Thank God it worked!”
In 42, Merriman plays rightfielder Dixie Walker, who initially opposed Robinson’s entry into the major leagues.
Photo Courtesy - Disney/ABC Television Group(PASADENA, Calif.) -- ABC's schedule for the 2011-2012 season is already taking shape. The network announced Monday that it has renewed Grey's Anatomy, Modern Family, Castle, Cougar Town, Private Practice and The Middle for another season.
Speaking at a Television Critics Association panel in Pasadena, California on Monday, ABC Entertainment Group President Paul Lee said, "Desperate Housewives is doing a great job, as you know. We have ambitions to pick it up. We are not quite there, ready to do so. And Brothers & Sisters has gotten really good numbers this year...But we have not made decisions on them yet, and we are not necessarily ready for them, but we'll see as we go forward."
Also on Monday, ABC Family picked up Pretty Little Liars and The Secret Life of the American Teenager for the 2011-2012 season.﻿

ABC News(NEW YORK) -- Sgt. Scott Moore, the Marine in Afghanistan who will be taking Black Swan actress Mila Kunis to the Marine Corps Ball in November, spoke out Tuesday about why he invited the actress in the first place.
"The idea behind my YouTube invitation to Mila Kunis came about after some Marines from 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, and I were hanging out talking," Moore said in a statement. "One of the Marines bet that I wouldn't make the video and post it. Of course, a bet between Marines must be honored, so I took the chance. You can't make shots that you don't take, so I took the best shot I could.
"The Marines of 3/2, my family and friends back home in Grove City, Pa. have been so supportive, and did a great job of getting the video a lot of attention," he said. "I'm very excited about the opportunity to share the experience with Ms. Kunis and would like thank her for accepting my offer."
Over the weekend, Kunis said yes while doing publicity for her upcoming film, Friends with Benefits, with Justin Timberlake. Apparently it was Timberlake who encouraged Kunis to agree.
"JT and I had this all planned from the start. He's been a great wingman; it's nice to know he can get over the jealousy to help a brother out (just kidding)," Moore said. "Justin Timberlake's encouragement definitely helped; I owe him one."
"We all talk about what we are going to do when we get back, and this was my dream," he said. "I do feel bad for putting her on the spot, but it's not like I was going to bump into her on the streets of Musa Qala between now and the ball."
Instead, Moore, a data systems technician with the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, currently stationed in Musa Qala, Afghanistan, set up a YouTube page called "Go With Me Mila" and posted a brief video asking the 27-year-old actress to accompany him to the ball on Nov. 18 in Greenville, N.C.
This year's ball will be special, not just because Kunis is his date, but also because its the 236th birthday of the Marine Corps and his unit will be home from Afghanistan, Moore said. As for any special plans he has in store for Kunis, "I think I'll keep that a secret for now; we have to iron out the details."

See below for the advisory services that Buttar & Associates provides to it's valued clientele. Below are the main areas of focus for Buttar & Associates:
Keep these important dates in mind throughout tax season to avoid missing anything important! (Please confirm with CRA)
The function E(n) defined by E(n) = 1 if n = 1 and = 0 if n > 1, is sometimes called multiplication unit for Dirichlet convolution or simply the unit function. If F and G are two multiplicative functions, one defines a new multiplicative function F * G, the Dirichlet convolution of F and G, by
where the sum extends over all positive divisors d of n. With this operation, the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an abelian group; the identity element is E.
In this task you have to find the inverse of a multiplicative function. To cope with overflow problem, we define arithmetic functions as: F: N —> Z2007 where N is the set of positive integers, and Z2007 is a residue ring (ring of integers 0–2006, where arithmetic operations + and × are performed modulo 2007). Function G is called the inverse of function F if and only if F * G = G * F = E.
In the first line of the input one number N is written (1 ≤ N ≤ 104). In the second line values F(1), F(2), F(3), …, F(N) are listed. Numbers are separated by spaces. (Each value is nonnegative and doesn't exceed 2006.)
Your skin reflects how healthy you are. Using this article, you can learn to better care for your skin. You can keep a youthful appearance by caring for your skin.
TIP! If at all possible, find moisturizers without added scents and chemicals. Alcohol is commonly found in commercial skin products, and it actually works to dry the skin.
A facial wash that contains lemon juice can be used to treat acne, oily skin, and enlarged pores. Weekly washing with a lemon-based skin wash can help minimize pores and eliminate excess oil.
TIP! If you would like to reduce the size of your pores and facial inflammation, eat plenty of watercress. You can get glowing skin on top of many other health benefits from snacking on watercress often.
Exfoliating is something that you must incorporate into your routine for healthy skin. Using granulated sugar, an exfoliating glove or an apricot scrub with your mild face cleaner can remove dead skin layers. Doing this more than twice weekly can cause damage and irritation.
TIP! Apply your sunscreen using a sponge like those used for make-up. By using a sponge when applying sunscreen, you will be able to avoid the lotion’s unpleasant texture and you will find it easier to spread evenly as well.
Control your stress, and you are sure to enjoy healthier skin. Stress makes your skin more sensitive, which causes skin problems. If you learn to control your stress level, you will find that your skin will appear healthier.
TIP! Always wear an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen when you are outside. Sunscreen can prevent your skin from being burned or dried out by the sun.
In order to help protect your skin against sun damage, you need to make sure you always wear sun protection with a value of 15 SPF or more. Sunscreen helps prevent wrinkles, sunburns and peeling skin. Using sunscreen daily will help slow down the aging process and give your skin’s appearance a healthy and young-looking appeal.
TIP! If you’re having trouble with oily skin, try to incorporate moisturizer into your daily routine. Always use a moisturizer after washing your face.
You must remember that your skin is actually a part of you. Your skin is actually your largest organ. The health of your skin plays a major role in your general health. Caring for your skin will make it appear healthy and give you a healthy body as well.
TIP! If you are going to expose your skin to the sun, you need to protect it. If you plan on going out in the sun, you should put sunscreen on 30 minutes before you go outside.
Read the ingredient list of any product you use on the skin to eliminate redness. The less ingredients that are in the product, the better. If your skin is sensitive, using more ingredients can make things worse. Redness could result with too many ingredients. They could even cause an unwanted break out.
One simple way to determine your skin type is to do a tissue test. This test is most accurate in the morning after you first wake up. Place the clean tissue on your face; let is sit for just a few seconds. Remove the tissue and look for the oil on the tissue. If there is no oil, then your skin is normal or dry. If there is oil in certain spots, then you have combination skin. If there is oil over most of the tissue, then chances are, you have oily skin. Understanding what skin type you have will assist you in choosing products specifically formulated for your skin.
TIP! You can prevent hangnails by keeping your hands highly moisturized. The best products for this kind of skin contain super-rich shea butter.
People with sun damage on their face have many options to reduce aging signs. There are chemical peels, laser abrasion and dermabrasion. Such procedures can be stand-alone treatments and can also be used in conjunction with others. There are other methods that include vitamins that can be used to combat the effects of skin damaged by the sun.
As previously mentioned, both your health and beauty are related to the appearance of your skin. If you follow the guidelines from this article, you will enjoy noticeably healthier and more beautiful skin.

Seperti lazimnya anak ujian lain yang lagi pada liburan, gue menghabiskan beberapa hari terakhir tidur dan main game di rumah. Banyak game yang baru aja gue install sehabis Ujian Nasional kemarin yah berhubung gue ngga punya pacar untuk diajak jalan seharian jadinya waktu-waktu gue saat libur ini gue isi dengan main game dirumah. Game apa aja? Yah lumayanlah, kalo udah tamat satu game dan udah cukup bosen memainkannya biasanya gue langsung uninstall gamenya. Beberapa diantaranya yang masih ada di laptop gue adalah:
Regularly, whenever anybody considers the concept of purchasing online or sending their credit card info through the web, they may tend to question the safety element surrounding these kinds of internet deals. The very same kind of worry rings true for those individuals that have an interest in amusing themselves by making use of online poker sites as a video gaming facility option. They might have the tendency to ask themselves whether this is a safe thing to be doing or if they might be jeopardizing things such as their bank account and general financial safety by doing so. Another way in which a prospective online poker player may question safety and legitimacy aspects of an online poker website is with regard to collusion amongst some of its online poker players. Nevertheless, it might assist you to rest a bit easier after checking out the following text and learning about the various ways in which security issues are being attended to with regard to gaming sites such as online poker websites.The best way for an individual to utilize the internet in order to exchange loan on the internet is to utilize something described by some individuals and organizations as a"digital wallet ". This type of safeguarding system works in a method which an established, sincere business, which we will refer to as the payment systems business for the remainder of this post, is the medium between the online poker gamer and the online poker website. The online poker player will submit his/her credit card details through the internet to the payment systems business and the payment systems company will then pay the online poker site. It is necessary to keep in mind that the online poker player's monetary information will never ever be seen by the online poker website and will just be seen by the valid and recognized payment systems company.Once the poker
player wins, the online poker site will pay the online poker gamer through the payment systems company and the poker gamer will then be able to access to the money by way of an electronic funds transfer from the payment systems company to the poker gamer's checking account that is supplied or through a check. If the online poker gamer loses in the various online poker games, then the money will be transmitted from the online poker gamer's charge card to the online poker site business by the payment systems company. This kind of system makes sure that the poker player's financial information is not being needlessly dispersed to various companies and sites. It will allow the poker player to have assurance, understanding that his or her financial info is safe from outdoors spying eyes. Also, often these payment systems business will have free protection developed for the individual using their services need to their information enter the incorrect hands. In the slim chance that this might happen, the payment systems business would reimburse all cash to the private damaged by the monetary hijacking. This likewise permits the private online poker player to feel more unwinded when handling an online poker website.Another fear that
people have with regard to playing poker video games by means of an online poker site is that collusion might exist to name a few gamers. By definition, collusion is a secret arrangement between 2 or more individuals to commit a fraudulent act. If two poker gamers making use of the very same online poker website are working together to defraud other players out of their payouts, this type of thing may take place. They might attempt to do this by working together and interacting by telephone or perhaps even by playing and using a network poker on the very same site in the same home. There is a particular way in which online poker sites address this issue.The method which online poker websites address this concern is by having a system where they can keep track of all hands that are being played each time by individual gamers throughout the online poker games. Should the online poker site feel and examine that there is some sort of collusion going on, they will take matters into their own hands to fix the situation. It is good to know that many online poker players are aware of that online poker websites keep an eye on all activity happening within each game and this in and of itself might assist to prevent any prospective ideas of collusion on the part of the online poker players. It is likewise beneficial to know that online poker sites are doing their part to prevent any possible collusion among online poker players as it injures their service greatly must individuals be conspiring to defraud other players and the company itself from any potential winnings.Prospective online poker players may likewise be fearful of playing online poker if they feel that other people will have the Going Here ability to hack into the system and see other players hands throughout the video games then base their wagers and folds on what they can see is being held by other poker playing individuals at their virtual table. The online poker sites have actually also dealt with these types of concerns by engaging different brand names of software that use file encryption methods to prevent any type of hacking on the part of poker players. Once again, by securing the large influx of online poker players that utilize their website to engage in online poker games, the online poker website is safeguarding itself. If their business is viewed as having a less than desirable website where to play poker, they will lose a lot of potential online poker players which will ultimately put them out of business in a quick manner.These are just a few safeguards that are taken by online poker websites to ensure the safe playing arena for its online poker gamers. With all of the technology out there these days, you can rest assured that these online poker websites are doing all that they can to make sure that your online poker playing experience is a safe and gratifying one.
It is crucial to note the fact that the online poker gamer's financial details will never be seen by the online poker website and will just be seen by the established and legitimate payment systems company.Once the poker
gamer wins, the online poker website will pay the online poker gamer through the payment systems company and the poker gamer will then be able to gain access to the loan by way of an electronic funds transfer from the payment systems business to the poker player's bank account that is provided or through a check. If the online poker player loses in the different online poker games, then the cash will be transmitted from the online poker player's credit card to the online poker site company by the payment systems company.

If their company is seen as having a less than preferable site in which to play poker, they will lose a lot of prospective online poker gamers which will eventually put them out of business in a fast manner.These are simply a couple of safeguards that are taken by online poker sites to ensure the safe playing arena for its online poker players.

what if muscle confusion and the stereotype of gymrats being retarded are completely true and people who are stupid gain muscle more easily because their muscles get easily confused?
Muscle confusion IS a real thing, which is why you see so many "I was doing such-and-such program, then switched to some other program and saw great results" type posts. Otherwise, there would end up being ONE program that was objectively the best program in existence, and everybody would just do that one program.
if enough of my brain is motor neurons can I flex muscles that don't exist yet and therefore train them?
A couple of women recently told me getting to know me really changed their initial impression, it being of a bodybuilding douchebag.
For a lot of women, working out screams insecurities and desperation to appear alpha, the same way threatening to beat people up does.
Does the personal enrichment brought by having a new hobby outweight the stigma of looking like a meathead, in your experience?
I would say It's worsened. Bit of background, lifting natty for 4 years, jumped over to the dark side 2 years ago. Every relationship i've had past the 2 years lifting mark pretty much goes the same way: first 2-3 weeks- holy shit this is awesome, sex every day no issue. week 3: she'll start to question her own body and whether or not shes good enough for you, for example in the shower: "those abs" and then feel her stomach with a depressed look. This also happens a lot: "i'm busy with x, was thinking of cancelling my gym membership, is that...
Well you see children, living in the developed world has it's advantages, I'm able to buy as much healthy, nutritious food as I want in order to achieve my fitness goals.

I'm skinny (58 kg) with 12-14% bf and I am 1.73 m tall, basically manlet tier but not where I live, where is considered slightly above average
also due to my family weird genotype there are chances I could grew up till 1.77 m and I've been rated as 6-/10 by average of people
I'm lifting and improving my lifestyle (I used to sleep from 0 to 5 hours at day) so I could be at least 7-8/10 (I've been genetically blessed with wide shoulders, but I never trained them so it's hard to notice)
what do you think there is to do? get circumcised. i had the same problem. got circumcised. everything's fine now.
dont even start the stupid "discussion" - you have a medical condition, it's not even a choice for you.
Why are women so obsessed with training their butts , more than anything else? I really want to see their reason apart from their desire to attract someone sexually.
Hate to break it to you, but all of weightlifting is people trying to attract others through their physique.

How deep do you go? On my warmups I touch my clavicle but for my working sets I just wait till the bar is completely under my chin then press it up.
Is there anything wrong with doing seated instead of standing? I'd rather not hog a power rack to OHP and seated is just how I've always done it.
My university gym has two dedicated overhead press stations that are almost never in use. They look like pic related. We also have a shitton of barbells.
lifting was the only thing i had, but i keep getting shoulder and knee pains and they come and go preventing me from going heavy
Also that seem like a nice topic for discuss, i see some SS/SL doer at my gym have their notesbook with them all the time.
I wish i recorded my shit at the gym but i can never stick with it. iv been lifting for 3ish years now and only recorded my stuff at the beginning
Same to be honest. Never really dealt with bad acne, just some razor burn that goes away a few days after I shave.
There's a video of Zyzz in his room on his computer watching an Islamic militant Chechens slowly cutting the head off a Russian soldier with an axe, and zyzz is just giggle and laughing about it.
>not going to the gym at 2 AM so you don't have to compete with 20 other dildos to get access to a bench or rack
3. You can and should lift weights and do cardio during a cut. This is an optimal time to start a Couch to 5K program.
4. It is normal to gain weight during the first several weeks of a cut if you are exercising. Keep going. It can take several weeks or even months before the number on the scale trends down.
I'm always curious when people have trouble eating too much. Like is it that they're trying to eat enormous amounts of low calorie food? Do they just not know how to cook?
Do bathmates work by themselves /fit/? I wanna try it but I also don't want to break my dick jelqing ( inb4 I won't, I don't wanna take the risk) so can Anon here who tried it tell me how it is?
If I felt like it was breaking my dick I wouldn't use it, but tats not the case at all. Still get rock hard boners all the time and no problem cumming
Something that'd go down well on stage, that you could move to and an audience would take notice of.
So a while back I found out that I apparently have "short hamstrings" which is why I can't deadlift with proper form. I can't even reach the fucking bar without arching my lower back. I've been trying to do forward bends like pic related with my back kept straight but I literally can't even reach parallel, let alone touch my toes. Can stretching really fix a problem this severe? Am I going to be stuck doing bitch exercises forever?
You can put on a cyan rockabilly wig and every design of her dress is something you'd see a special snowflake Disney lover wear.
A glitch free game. It's sad that the eroge industry is suffering from rushed/incomplete games just like the videogame industry.
Todd wouldn't look 6 foot if he was standing in a room alone. Look at how small he is. He's like a hobbit.
Yes, Reedus confirmed he likes it that way so we shouldnt judge if they live in a happy relationship.
Sonyfag here, you must be a moron since PS3 struggled like the xbone has, but at least it came out ok after selling at a loss for forever.
Once a upon a time in Hyrule, there was a man of the Sheikah who lived in Kakariko Village who had the ability to see things that were invisible to the naked eye. With this ability, he enjoyed going to the graveyard to converse with the spirits of the dead. One day he met the soul of a man who in his past life was a member of a musical troupe where he would play the bongos. The man was so talented that people nicknamed him as Bongo Bongo. However Bongo Bongo had a dark secret in that he was a murderer who enjoyed torturing his victims. For many years, he killed people, going...
With his insatiable blood lust during his life time however, Bongo Bongo's spirit managed to remain tied to the world of the living instead of moving on to the afterlife, his spirit gradually grew more and more malevolent until one day, he managed to possess the Sheikah man he met in the graveyard. Using his body, Bongo Bongo proceeded to go back to his murderous ways and built an elaborate dungeon underneath the man's home where he would kidnap citizens and travelers in Kakariko and bind, torture and kill them. After many years of committing murders, Bongo Bongo's...

There's many more interesting additional things to come. But Activision...
I had Spiderman 3 for my PS3 and that shit green goblin DLC where I could play as him and crash into buildings with the sixaxis controls.
It should be illegal how few attention Valve gives the CS community and how little they work on their broken ass game. I heard Dotards are given way more attention.
Today I finished Uncharted 4. Mostly a disappointment. It barely felt like an Uncharted game which goes to show who the driving force behind the series was.
Literally good alternative if you want to rest from playing Overwatch since Motiga is pretty bro and likes to play Overwatch
I want that whole genre to die. Windows 10 is garbage. This game is just born into a world where I'm disgusted by instinct.
Okay seriously, who are the fucking good guys and who are the bad guys? I don't understand what's going on.
Why dont you fucking play this instead? It´s the same game and came out years ago. Overwatch is like a cheap Brink rip off. In couple months nobody will care about your Pixar animation. Nobody.
Now that we've learned Far Harbor isn't half bad, where would you like to see the next DLC take place? I'm hoping Orlando or somewhere like that.
Thank you for saving my thread from page 10, but I'm going to have to ask you to disagree with me so that we can argue about this. I have lots of autism to get out of my system.
Banjo 1 is really strong until the desert world, at which point the monotony starts to set in. Jak 1 is similar in that regard. It's a good game, though, and Hookah looks fun.
Wow. We're having Overwatch shills, Battleborn shills, Battlefield shills, and Knuckle sandwich shills. The last thing we need is more Battlefront shills.
first phase: circle right around him, without rolling and only hit him once. have shield up always. you'll take no/minimal damage.
second phase: if he transforms hit him twice, get back, hit him again, he splits, then hit him and his phantom 3-4 times. kill his phantom and repeat strategy from phase one.
They've rarely ever made a kh game without command decks because of the handheld's lack of buttons. Now that they're given a chance to develop a game with the kh2 battle system, maybe it will turn out alright. Maybe.
and yeah it probably will be horrible desu, story already looks crazy adding more random time ass kid story characters playing chess, probably some alternate universe shit
I seem to remember that the most recent gameplay shown was showing signs of more KH2-like mechanics in the combat
I went through one 'vacation' thus far (Kasumi) and I ended up with a C rank. What is that even based on? I went through each day clueless was to what I was meant to do. I'd go rock climbing or pool hoping mostly. I tried my hand at volleyball but served right into the net 10/10. Only my partner could make it over.
If you really wanted a new good shooter, you would've looked into the game for all of 2 seconds and found it, you tosser.
You people bitch and moan about wanting a new era of arena shooters, but when actually good arena shooters come out (Reflex, TOXIKK, UT4) they get like 200 players max then fizzlele out and die.
And yes, UT4 is still technically alpha but the gameplay is feature complete. All it needs are some weapon models/effects and players.
Daikatana was bad, but it wasn't Superman 64 bad. I'm willing to give him a shot. It's entirely possible that his early success was a fluke and that he isn't very good, but it would kinda be hard to make an FPS worse than what we have these days.
why the fuck would anyone EVER say that pc isn't the superior way to game. literally, aside from fake ass bugs or apparent "hackers in every game" name one downside to pc gaming.
The funny thing is, on a lot of older games there are way less hackers because of proper dedicated server support.
Anyways its definitely superior sure but not everyone can afford it (this is a genuine issue) and some people don't have any friends who are on PC.
The only thing I can think off is the high bar of entry. Parts can be a little expensive, and actually building a PC can be a little tricky if you don't have the know how. That's the biggest hurdle to overcome, the intimidation factor.
They own the game and all of the assets, if the 300,000 people simply told blizzard they wanted to have a legacy version than blizzard would have probably caved. Too bad a bunch of pirate scum got their booty holes blasted huh? lol stay angry kiddos.
It all went downhill after WoW. Them being merged/under Activision didn't help either. I used to actually care about their games.
Its a great game so yea that'd be a compelling reason to do so. PC is a much more enjoyable experience all around so if you can afford it, I strongly recommend it.

you can still find a community in almost any game on consoles. i fucking downloaded XCOM and played the multiplayer for the first time ever on console because it literally had 0 players a few weeks after i bought it on PC. about 3 weeks the online community for PC stuck. 360 STILL has players.
I still play Freespace 2 and Stronghold Crusader against people. Mount and Blade has tons of servers up. Did you really know what the online scene was like for PC before you made this post?

Witchers don't use shields, because, much like Leonidas at the end of 300, it would throw him off balance.
I see you hate fun and excitement. Not to mention people all over the world and ages used helmets and shields. It was the norm.
I got furious whenever someone would touch the backside of the disc with their fingers instead of picking it up by the hole.
I for one am very hyped for the stand alone game. Love to play Northern Realm with lots of Spies, Decoys and Blue Stripe Commandos. They are the real mvps
I had every single skellige card I could get and I had to savescum through the tournament, Thank god for that fight halfway though for a save point. Can't wait for the gwent standalone.

All in all, the majority of infections can be eliminated or prevented by frequent partial water changes, and ensuring that your fish lives in an appropriate environment (tank size, tank mates, etc) and water quality. Medications are rarely needed and should be avoided whenever possible.
This is a parasite which resembles grains of salt on your fish. At first the white spots are small, usually present within the gills of the fish. Your fish may breath heavily or scratch against decorations in an attempt to remove the parasite. Within a day or two the parasites will have grown and multiplied, covering the body of the fish with tiny white spots. There are many techniques available to fight off Ich.
This is also a parasite, but is luckily not as common as Ich. Velvet appears as a rust colored parasite which is very small and often difficult to see. It is usually clustered very heavily on the fish, forming sort of a rust colored blanket. Velvet attacks your fish very quickly and could even wipe out a tank in a matter of 2 days.
A fungal infection appears as a white cotton growth on the body or fins of the fish. The majority of white spots you see on your fish are going to be parasites.
These usually appear as red patches or streaks on the body of the fish, or sometimes appear as damage to the fins of the fish, such as "fin rot". Bacterial infections are almost always due to poor, declining water conditions. This does not necessarily have to be high levels of ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate. Lack of regular water changes will result in increased numbers of pathogens and other disease-causing organisms which thrive in neglected aquariums. Bacterial infections are also commonly associated with parasite infection, as a secondary infection

Hatman for the win! Rev had shared a screenshot of the box art and the way it looked to me the colours looked like they were getting lighter which it thought was cool and looked like the lighter water at the surface to the darker blue of the deep in the picture.
I mentioned this to Rev and while it wasn't initially that way we thought it would look pretty cool and sure enough it does. Thanks to Rev my ridiculous game idea and box have both now come into being.
I didn't realize this had not been done before but sure enough, you're correct. Even a box guy like me knows the game is more important than the packaging but this is about as perfect an example of matching the packaging to the game theme as you will ever find. I enjoy well thought out work and attention to detail. Rev totally killed it on this one!

According to the lengthy letter, the two broke up a few weeks ago, but have done their “best to work it out & find a solution.” However, they weren’t able to reconcile.
Jake, who is related to Logan Paul, explained to his over 17 million fans, “After many discussions & some serious soul searching, it became apparent to us weeks ago, that we could no longer be boyfriend and girlfriend.”
The statement continued, “While it was a truly heartbreaking decision, it is the healthiest thing for both of us.”
Despite his sadness over the breakup, Jake told Jerika fans that he will “be forever grateful that she was part of my life.”
He concluded his remarks by asking his followers for their privacy in this time of hardship. “We’re both at different points in our lives & having a relationship in the public eye is so hard. But this is our decision & I ask that you please support both to us through this tough time,” he wrote.
Their split comes not long after fellow Youtuber Shane Dawson did an in-depth look into the life of Jake Paul. Throughout the controversial eight part series, Shane looked into the success and apparent downfall of the former Vine star, including a look into his seemingly happy relationship with Costell.
After Jake shared the news on Twitter, Shane joked, “just when i started enjoying my break! Alright…. Andrew grab the camera. i’ll call the uber.”
Good Astronomy: Polaris is a middling-bright star, easily missed. And it won't even be the North Star forever!
The other day a friend was asking me about an object he saw in the sky, and as he described it I got confused. He said it was close to Polaris, the North Star, but he also said it was in the East. "It can't be in the East if it was near Polaris," I told him. "But it was near this really bright star!" he replied. It was then I knew I was onto more Bad Astronomy.
A lot of people think that Polaris is a very bright, if not the brightest star in the sky. It isn't. As a matter of fact, it's only about average. From my own back yard I have a hard time seeing it! (I live a few miles north of Washington, DC, and the sky is bright from city lights).
It's natural, I suppose, to think that such an important star should be bright, but really, that's a conceit, like thinking that the Earth is at the center of the Universe. If more people knew just why Polaris is the North Star, this Bad Idea would stop.
The Earth is spinning on its axis like a top, once a day. We define the points where this axis intersects the Earth's surface as the North and South Poles. If you stood at the North Pole (brrrr!) over the course of one day you would spin around once. Now, since we are stuck on the surface of the Earth, we don't really perceive this spin. We do see the sky, however, and our spin makes it look like the sky is revolving around us once a day.
Imagine someone standing on the equator. If he looks straight up, he will see stars fly past him all night long as the Earth spins, sweeping him around the circumference of the Earth. The stars would appear to rise in the East and set in the West. However, if he were at the North Pole, it would look like the stars are spinning around a point straight up in the sky. This point is called the North Celestial Pole (NCP), and is basically the same as the North Pole on the Earth projected up into the sky. All the stars seem to spin around this point, just as the Earth spins around its own North Pole.
So we can see that this point on the sky is only special to us on the surface of the Earth. A different planet, with an axis pointing in a different direction, would see a different spot on the sky as its NCP. It just so happens we see a star near this spot. This star is part of the Little Dipper (as it's called in the U.S.), and is about 2nd magnitude, which means it ain't all that bright. It is the brightest star in the Little Dipper, but that isn't saying much since the Little Dipper is a much fainter counterpart of its bigger brother, the Big Dipper.
The reason Polaris is important is because it is so close to the NCP. As the night progresses, Polaris does not rise or set, but seems to be glued to the sky! So at any time in the night you can find Polaris, and it is always in the North. If you get lost, you can always figure out your direction by finding Polaris (provided that you are in the Earth's northern hemisphere!).
Now remember, there is a South Celestial Pole as well. It lies in the constellation called Octans, and the nearest star to it is a a very faint 5th magnitude star, which is near the limit of the human eye to see unaided. More proof of our Polaris conceit!
Note that stars near the two celestial poles will make little circles around the pole as the Earth spins. The farther you get from the poles, the bigger the circle. At some point, the circle will be big enough so that it just touches your horizon. Stars inside that circle are said to be circumpolar, and they never set! They just seem to circle the pole endlessly. Note that the stars you see as circumpolar depend on your latitude. If you were at the North Pole, all the stars you can see in the sky are circumpolar, but at the equator, no stars are! At the equator, both celestial poles lie on the horizon, and all the stars in the sky rise and set.
One more thing: have you ever watched a top spin, and seen it wobble? The wobble is due to a force called torque, which is like a twisting pull. When torque is applied to a spinning object, the spin axis will precess, or make a little circle as the top spins. Well, the same thing is happening to the Earth! The gravity of the Moon and Sun provides a torque on the Earth, causing the axis to wobble. The Earth's axis takes 26,000 years to make a complete circle, and as it moves it points to different parts of the sky. It just so happens that right now it is pointing near Polaris (actually, Polaris is about a degree away from the actual North Celestial Pole). In a few thousand years, the Earth's pole will be pointed at the bright star Vega, which is one of the ten brightest stars in the sky. Imagine how hard it will be to convince people that's just a coincidence when that happens!
Bad Reader Andrew Sincinito brought to my attention the lyrics of a song by Gerry Rafferty, called "Right Down the Line":
I hate to give him more credit than he might deserve, but those lines could be interpreted as "she is as constant as the north star, and she is the brightest light that shines;" he might not have been talking about Polaris. However, he might have meant that Polaris is the brightest star in the sky. If so, we have another victim of Bad Astronomy. If not, well, the lyrics are still kind of Bad. ;-)
Incidentally, Mark Bellis of Canada tells me that Joni Mitchell had an even earlier song with similar lyrics in it. I guess this idea goes back pretty far. Matter of fact, Shakespeare made the same error in "Julius Caesar"! So I guess Joni and Gerry are in good company.

Ambassador Optim and the 150 Sapphire Dragoons (HC) saw the huge Sessauan city of Saint Mille as they exited one of the many small woods that they had already passed. In front of them sprawled a city that could take up the space of a a few warrens. While Dwarves built their cities into the mountain climbing it's walls or into the deep bellies of huge rock these surface dwellers took up unimmaginable amounts of space on the surface.
The old ambassador requested, "I'd like for us to make camp here. The majority of your men, Lieutenant Graybeard, would have to remain here. I'll prefer to be accompanied by only a small force of 25 men led by Corporal Rednose."
Contary to his name Graybeard was in fact a young dwarf whom only recently attained his rank of Lieutenant, "Although I don't like it I'll reluctently agree. A large force might scare them into assualting us, which would be the opposite of your objective Ambassador Optim." Graybeard then ordered, "Dismount and set up camp. Corporal Rednose to the front with your element please."
Corporal Rednose and his command made their way to the front. After being given their assignment the Dwaves left with Ambassador Optim heading towards the city. They'd approach on horse but when they were within 200 yards they'd dismount as well. A dismounted Sapphire Dragoon was less of a threat then a mounted one and Optim wish this initial meeting to be a pleasent one. With him he kept The Tales of Victor and Magma nearby. A gift from the Republic to these unknown people as a peace offering.
Foreigners were quickly becoming a commodity in Mille Sessau. The Ambassador was greeted by patrolling Sessauan Men-at-Arms (Spearmen) and the Ambassador and his 25 bodyguards were escorted into Saint-Mille and into a huge, embellished manor where Count Juva of Saint-Mille greeted them. They were allowed to keep their weapons as well. Young and charismatic, Juva barely had enough hair on his chin to warrant a goatee, let alone an entire city.
" Welcome, stoutfolk! We have heard of your kind! I am Count Juva of the Fiefdom of Saint-Mille under the Glorious Empire of Mille Sessau! I welcome you! What is it that brings you this far south? "
Count Juva's manor was a magnificent home for humans. Dwarves clan homes tended to resemble the manor but individual family dwellings weren't nearly as large or eye catching. Most of the guards remained outside preferring to attend to their steeds who were showing signs of fatigue and weakness. The large beasts were accustomed to the mountains and not suited for these conditions in Mille Sessau. Only Corporal Rednose accompanied Ambassador Optim into the manor, if they'd wanted them dead they'd have done it outside the city instead of inviting them in. After standing at attention and saluting the Count in dwarven fashion* when introduced the Corporal occupied his mind with how weird the human in front of him was.
"Welcome, stoutfolk! We have heard of your kind! I am Count Juva of the Fiefdom of Saint-Mille under the Glorious Empire of Mille Sessau! I welcome you! What is it that brings you this far south?" The count introduced himself rather enthusiastically and Ambassador Optim didn't fail to notice that they were dealing with a youth and not an older man. The Count Juva wasn't even old enough have a beard yet he was in charge of a city. Humans were weird giving such a task to someone so young.
"You've heard of us, well that's good to hear I'm sure it will help smooth things out for us. Did our kinsmen inform you? I'm Ambassador Optim of the Republic of Ever-Winter and this is Corporal Rednose. Thank you on behalf of the Republic for welcoming us into this elegant city." Optim paid a compliment to the young Count
Smiling he answered Juva's question, "We came seeking trade partners. When I left the Republic to travel south all we had was marble to offer. Although not much in the way of variety, I can promise you'll not find better stone from anyone else except from our Kinsmen. Dwarves were born to mine after all. Here's a list of resources, any of them we'd take in return for stone though I believe we're only willing to trade the Stone Moderately." Optim handed the piece of paper over to the Count. The list didn't include war related resources besides the wood but more or less commodities and luxury goods for the Republic.
*Dwarven Salute - Stand at attention, right first pounds the dwarves chest over his heart then returns to attention. Dwarven salute is completed and they return to their relaxed position with civilians or non-Republic Military.
" Fortunately, Lord Optim, the Empire does have some of the greatest furs in the land, and stone is sorely lacking in the Empire. But better yet, come, come! "
Count Juva, two Sessauan knights, along with Ambassador Optim and Corporal Redbeard were hailed to a carriage, and from Saint-Mille would head eastward to the capital of Jaudeaux. The capital was sprawling, and covered in nothing but flaky, white snow. Count Juva and his knights wore heavy fur coats, and complimentary fur coats were offered to Ambassador Optim and his cohort.
They arrived at the huge, though shabby marketplace that made up Jaudeaux's central square, and beyond that lay the manors and palaces of the greater nobility. Past that further was the Royal Palace. The carriage stopped just short of it and the group would head inside to meet the Empress of Mille Sessau.
She was quaint, quiet and appealing to the eye, though by Elven standards she would've been nothing but a mere human woman. She nodded faintly at the arrival of the new guests and gave a near whispered " Bonjour .. "
Count Juva explained before the Dwarves could inquire. " The Empress, " he whispered as the three stood before her, " does not speak Common, but rather Old Millean, the language of our forebearers. She is the physical representative of Van Sessau, our savior and deity. " When the Empress' gaze finally turned back to the huge majestic window, Count Juva turned to them.
The dwarves were used to mountain cold and the carriage warded off most of the winters sharp bite. Politely declining the fur cloaks offered the Corporal Rednose joked, "They're far too large, be swallowed whole never to be seen again."
Riding through the city the Corporal marveled at the sheer size of the capitol city. Dwarven cities never sprawled such vast distances, they generally rose higher into the mountain's rock or lower, delving deeper into the rock. Passing the market place the two dwarves were curious. They'd seen market places before but these humans tended to have different wares the dwarves which is what captivated attention.
When they entered the area of the upper society of the city such as the lords and ladies homes large manors built of beautiful stone the two dwarves noticed that many of the buildings although large and well maintained were old. Apparently the Count spoke the truth that his Empire was sorely lacking adequate stone.
When they entered the Royal Palace and meet the Empress of Mille Sessau the Dwarves gave their customary salute. Although their surroundings were new and elegant their attention was on the attractive female. Her beauty reminded the dwarves of their own wives at home, and although she was human even they would have agreed she was pleasant on the eyes. The Ambassador was forced to end his memories of his wife as the Count explained whom the Empress was.
Apparently these humans believed in some gods. An interesting notion in the least, perhaps some dwarves in the republic would appreciate some debates to figure what this deity had to offer. As the Count Juva purposed his offer the Ambassador Optim readily agreed but wished to rectify an additional subject to the trade agreement.
"Count Juva, I find this offer suited for both the Republic as well as the Empire of Mille Sessau, but I must request an additional matter. You mentioned something of religion. We dwarves of Ever-Winter have a free belief of religion and should a suitable human or humans be found that would accept dwarven law regarding religion they would be most welcomed in our Republic. Perhaps it could further enhance our relations?"
-Dwarves find the Trade Agreement Suitable; Ambassador writes it down, the name of the agreement for the Dwarves: Winter Coats for Mountain Stone
-Invites a Human/Humans to the Republic of Ever-Winter as long as they agree to respect the laws of the Republic and be subjected to those laws during their time in the Republic.
" That would be most welcome! I believe a suitable arrangement would be to exchange our map information. In addition, we will give you the cartographical information of the Human kingdom to the west, the Merenaz Caliphate. They hail from the Great Desert and would almost assuredly like to meet you as well! "
The maps were brought forward, one that gave a detailed account of the Empire of Mille Sessau, and another was that of the Merenaz Caliphate. Of course, these maps would only be exchanged if the Republic would give up maps of it's own land.
" Now, we would gladly come to the Republic and spread the word of Mille Sessau! Summon a Priest, and send a rider to one of the Jaudeauxian fiefdoms! Hurry! "
Ambassador Optim and Corporal Redbeard would have to wait only a few hours. Priest Jonas Couroille and Baron Claurieu of the Barony of Claureiu arrived, although not together. Jonas Couroille was a timid looking fellow, somewhat hunched in robes of blue with golden tresses, he had a thick goatee and thin spectacles. Baron Claurieu was of similar stature, except he wore a heavy fur coat and chain mail underneath, the sheath of a broadsword stuck out from underneath the fur cloak.
Count Juva informed them that they would both go with the Dwarves to their mountain city, that Baron Claurieu would learn their customs and act as a representative of Mille Sessau, and that Priest Couroille would begin to teach the word of Van Sessau. Unless Ambassador Optim had further questions, they would depart back to Saint-Mille where they would meet up with the Dwarven guards and begin to head back north through the mountains.
"The desert you say? It is an odd place for your kinsmen to live." Optim stated then added, "It'd be my pleasure to meet these desert kinsmen of yours, these people of Merenaz Caliphate."
The maps brought forth that showed the Empire of Mille Sessau as well as the Merenaz Caliphate were excellent but Ambassador Optim sadly informed, "We'd gladly exchange such information though our own remain with our steeds back at Saint-Mille. If you have a map of the continent I'd gladly show you where the Republic lies until the documents can be retrieved."
Priest Jonas Couroille was the first of the two to arrive and talk with the dwarven ambassador. The human had a goatee, thin spectacles, and was wearing a robe of blue with golden tresses. The human was hunched over. During their talks the ambassador assured the priest that he'd be treated respectfully and there would of course be a grace period of a month or so for him to learn the customs and laws of the dwarves. During this time his transgressions, should any arise, would be forgiven unless they caused dwarves to lose their lives.
When Baron Claurieu of the Barony of Claureiu arrived he was assured the same promise. Before the man left though Rednose stated his intent to join him towards Saint-Mille so he can bring back the book called The Tales of Victor and Magma as well as the maps of the current borders of the Republic of Ever-Winter. The Corporal also informed the escorts to head back home with the Baron Claurieu of the Barony of Claureiu and the Priest Jonas Couroille. They deliver a letter to the Regent regarding the agreements that the Winter Coats for Mountain Stone trade.
-Maps of the Republic's current boundaries and The Tales of Victor and Magma are brought back by Corporal Rednose.
-Escorts leave with the Priest and Baron heading for the Republic with a letter informing the Regent the details of the current trade agreement.

Addis Ababa - A joint report produced by the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme predicts near-record crop yields in Ethiopia this year. But despite the expected excellent harvest, some 2 million people will still require 180,000 tonnes of food aid in 1999.
The FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Agreement Mission to Ethiopia noted that cereal and pulse yields were forecasted to reach 11.69 million tonnes. That's up 36 percent from last year's poor harvest, but slightly less than the record crops of 1996.
WFP and FAO officials attributed the better crop yields to a favourable rainy season, increased use of fertilisers, improved seeds and few occurrences of crop diseases or pests. However, in some parts of the country, excessive rains cut short the planting season, flooded fields, damaged the barley and pulse crops and increased week infestation.
Ethiopia will have surplus crops available for export, but assuming that the Eritrean border remains tightly closed, this traditional outlet for surplus Ethiopian grain will not be available. Exports to neighbouring Sudan are also highly unlikely because of record harvests in that country. However, grain could be exported to Somalia, which suffered an estimated 125,000 tonnes deficit this year.
Even with improved yields, food insecurity has remained chronic in many parts of Ethiopia because of limited availability and access to food. In regions where food is scarce, incomes are extremely low. About half the population of Ethiopia lives below the poverty line.
The report noted that the relatively low number of people estimated to require relief food assistance in Ethiopia in 1999 conceals the fact that a much larger number suffer from chronic food insecurity. While the FAO/WFP mission estimated that only some 4 percent of the rural population will require food aid in 1999, approximately 26 million Ethiopians, or more than 40 percent of the farming population, do not produce enough food and income to meet their families' basic nutritional requirements.
The FAO/WFP mission said that total relief food distributions by the Ethiopian Government and NGOs will reach 294,932 tonnes of food this year. The report estimated a sharp drop in the food aid needs for Ethiopia in 1999, amounting to 181,871 tonnes for almost 1.9 million people for an average duration of six months. Of that total, 35 percent is required for the Amhara region, 33 percent for the Oromia region and 20 percent for the Tigray region. The report recommends that donors buy locally grown crops for food aid needs as much as possible to help bolster the market for local producers.
The FAO/WFP estimate does not include relief food needs for pastoral areas nor Ethiopians displaced by the border conflict with Eritrea. The Government has said that relief food is needed for almost 400,000 displaced people and Ethiopians expelled from Eritrea.

Since 1996 we have been working with the best tour operators in Africa. Our unique relationship with those operators ensures only people who have participated in a trip after making an enquiry for it at AfricaGuide.com can leave a review.
The email we send you when you make an enquiry has full instructions for registering a booking and leaving a review - both are free services.
Trips with no reviews are usually new to AfricaGuide.com but are normally operated by a tour operator who is established here and has gained operator reviews for you to read.
We carry out extensive company checks on all our providers, over 20 years we have built strong personal relationships with each of them, which assures you of an unparalleled service, great value and the trip of a lifetime.
We have participated in many of the trips found here (we have a nice job) and make our own independent assessments of the services provided, ensuring they meet with our own high standards.
The price you see here is the direct trip price set by the provider, the same price as purchasing directly with them (which is how it works), there are no added commissions.
This means you are not paying an agents commission and the provider is receiving their fully budgeted trip cost.
(agents can demand discounts from providers as well as adding commissions to the providers trip price)
On the rare occasion that an issue may arise before or during your trip, by dealing directly with the end provider, problem solving is quick and efficient.
The most straightforward way to assist the economic opportunities and conditions for local people across Africa, is by direct financial interaction with people in Africa. In a nutshell "Tourism".
We limit the number of providers we work with in order to strike a balance between a good choice of trips and to be sure we can honestly recommend the service and validity of each provider.
Because the majority of trips can be customised by the providers, the choice of trip configurations is in the tens of thousands.
We show all reviews, the good and the critical (very few). Our providers have the ability to respond to reviews and those responses are shown alongside the review.
Acquiring genuine reviews is actually very hard, for our genuine travellers we make this an easy process but many people although satisfied with the service they received do not leave a review.
At best unqualified reviews are worthless, at worst they are misleading. We never take unqualified reviews.

The Empire group of companies, established in 2005, is one of the largest and most diverse edible nut and dried fruit businesses in South Africa.
Empire has worked with Afrisoft Africa to complete a project using TransLution™ Software to label received stock with barcodes. As items are moved to production, they are scanned and a live warehouse transfer is posted directly to SYSPRO.
When finished goods are received the items are labelled and scanned and a backflush is posted directly to SYSPRO.
A backflush will update stock levels based on the bill of materials for that item. Using a backflush is a simple way to track raw materials but if the stock used in production varies slightly from the bill of materials it will not be managed by a backflush.
Empire State wanted to keep the simplicity of backflush but also required exact tracking of raw material used in each job. They achieved this by using TransLution™ to track the exact amounts of raw material used on each production job. This has created significantly improved stock accuracy for raw material consumption.
TransLution™ software was developed to assist manufacturing, warehousing and distribution companies to better manage their business processes and stock handling. The TransLution™ product is particularly focussed on robust integration to customers’ existing ERP, accounting and stock management software for a wide range of transactions. TransLution™ is distributed in Africa by Afrisoft Africa (Pty) Ltd and in Europe by K3 SYSPRO.
Afrisoft Africa (Pty) Ltd was founded in 1998 to serve the specialised needs of agribusiness, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution companies.

The Jaguars have found a replacement for Vic Ketchman in John Oehser. Oehser most recently wrote for AOL's FanHouse as the AFC South beat writer and blogger. He joins the Jags as the Senior Writer and his first article was posted today on jaguars.com. It was a pretty dry piece and I hope the rest of his work is better. I did here that Maurice Jones-Drew was upset he didn't get the job. If you missed Coach Jack Del-Rio's shot at being a writer, you might want to check out his two postings called Ask the Coach on the Jaguars website.
In personnel moves, veteran OT Jordan Black was released. I personally liked the job that Black was doing and I am surprised about this move. They signed first-year C Bradley Vierling from the Practice Squad. The Jaguars definitely need a replacement for Brad Meester as I said in my posting here in my look at the Jaguars draft needs. I hope this was done with that in mind.

Thank you Digile & Tekes for believing in us and funding us. This is a good place to continue our collaboration here in the far east. I'm a Finn of course and Finns tend to be a bit modest about these things. I think the paper could have been better.

Branding is intended to generate a response. The feelings and thoughts that the consumer connects with a brand's image will ultimately influence that brand's ability to prosper. It is vital that people associate the right things with your business. What follows are four of the most important things that you can do to bolster your store or brand's image and reputation.
1.) Customer service. Customer service is one thing that will never go out of style. Most retailers make commitments, but not all follow through. In an effort to make sure that your customers have the type of experiences that will promote loyalty, make the most of each opportunity to provide the best in customer service.
2.) Utilize your online presence. The web allows for unparalleled marketing potential. Social media is a place where you can showcase your promotions and products, and you can connect with customers and respond to their feedback. Don't waste the opportunity afforded.
3.) The drive behind the brand. It's important to determine what the driving force of your brand is. What is your goal? Your purpose? Your mission? Customers are experts at understanding whether or not a company has like-minded priorities and intentions.
4.) Be smart about brand placement. How does one do that? It's straightforward: the more your brand in seen, the more people will recognize it and will feel comfortable with it. That means committing to consistent visual elements that will bring to mind your company's strengths.
We can help you create and accentuate your brand in a way that highlights your company every time the customer sees it. Contact us today so that you can begin utilizing our vast array of package branding options.

ACSIPA is a network of Pennsylvania Christian Schools advocating for Public Support of School Choice
George Tryfiates, Director for Government Affairs of the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). Shares his comments in regards to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), Docket ID IRS-2018-0025, Contributions in Exchange for State or Local Tax Credits (REG-112176-18).
He urges the Treasury to address its valid concerns outlined in NPRM and to preserve federal charitable tax deductions to state tax credit scholarship programs as they are. He urges those involved to leave the programs unhindered.
The website may be reached at the following link https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/school/Pages/School%20Health.aspx
The Division of School Health no longer has the capability to make entries/changes to the website but may ask the person with that capability to make entries.
How often do you hear the argument that school choice is a bad idea because it drains funds from already underfunded public schools? We hear it just about every day. Those conversations can be frustrating, but the good news is that we have data on our side.
The 2018 Pennsylvania Family Council General Election Voter Guide is now available in both online and print versions!
The Voter Guide is the most comprehensive statewide voter guide in Pennsylvania. The theme for this election and for future elections is an encouragement that you will "Honor God With Your Vote." You see, unlike most people around the world, we get to choose our leaders - through the precious right to vote.
On April 30, 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance (DOI) issued a “Notice Regarding Nondiscrimination” directed at health insurance companies doing business in the Commonwealth. The DOI Notice forbids health insurance companies from selling policies that “discriminate” on the basis of gender identity. Insurers may not sell policies that exclude “gender transition,” including the administration of hormones and “sex reassignment” surgery.
The Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI) has sent a Reservation of Rights letter to the Pennsylvania Department of Education for the free and reduced lunch program to help support ACSI Christian Schools' rights for those participating in the Hot Lunch and food programs. The renewals for these programs should not be hindered by a nondiscrimination statement that is contrary to a schools beliefs or tenants of faith. ACSI recognizes the importance of observing the proper church-state boundaries between the Pennsylvania Department of Education and our member schools.
The administration and DCED have removed the nondiscrimination statement that included gender, gender identity and sexual expression language from the EITC and OSTC guidelines and applications. This is a significant blessing from God. If you are a scholarship organization, the forms are updated on the website and we can participate once again in these incredibly important programs to our families in good faith.
The Free / Reduced Lunch program is adding a sexual orientation, gender identity non-discrimination clause that must be consented to in order to participate in the program. Schools who plan to participate in the lunch program are suggested to include a reservation of rights letter with their applications.
You can use money contributed to a child's 529 Plan to pay for their K-12 education expenses. Pennsylvania will follow the Federal tax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, which includes several new provisions related specifically to 529 plan accounts, beginning with the 2018 tax year:
•	Account owners can use assets to pay for qualified K-12 expenses up to $10,000 per year, per student.
•	Account owners can treat K-12 withdrawals as qualified education expenses with respect to federal tax and PA PIT purposes.
a.)Let your Senators, Representatives and the Governor know to protect our school's ability to function by biblical principles by opposing the nondiscrimination language in regulation and legislation

The firm Monoarchi, based in Rotterdam and Shanghai, has built a wooden hut at the foot of Siming Mountain, in the remote Chinese township of Zhongcun (Zheijiang province). An undulating roof governs its interior-exterior interaction as it opens and closes, determining views and the entrance of natural light and air. This small, 80-square-meter two-level shelter is held up by steel supports grouped in such a way that impact on the landscape is minimized. From the entrance via stairs to the terrace on the second floor, a spiral route leads to all the rooms, which follow one another in a chain. The roof is rigidified by 46 wooden trusses of varying thickness, depending on where they are. Construction was carried out by local artisans using traditional methods.
analyzes in each issue a theme related to a city, a country, a tendency or an architect, with articles by leading specialists complemented by commentary on works and projects illustrated in detail. Published bilingually, with Spanish and English texts placed side by side.

Asmara (Eritrea): Railway Club bar. Thurs.25.10.18. (Roderick Smith) This would have been the railway refreshment room in passenger days, and has survived as a canteen, patronised mainly by railway workers. Tea, coffee, softdrinks, beer, spirits; AFAIK hot snacks (hamburger level) too. The building is separate from the main station building, and has an outdoor section too.
The smaller Mallets could haul only the wagons, and we rode on/in them. The larger could haul the carriage, with a toilet, and giving the buffet staff more space (the did serve in one of the vans before).

Protein Dance<BR>O’Neill’s Music Room<BR>Tuesday 25/06/02<BR>Publife<P><BR>Protein Dance’s latest offering Publife is a very lively and energetic piece of physical<BR>theatre and since it is being performed in a pub the audience gets to be in the middle of<BR>it all.<P>From the moment Tasha Gilmore bursts into the room, carrying lots of shopping bags<BR>and chatting away on her mobile phone you hardly find time to catch your breath.<BR>The colourful and fast paced kaleidoscope of episodes covers practically every pub activity imaginable like darts, quizzes and a class in Salsa dancing. Esther Weisskopf<BR>as reluctant Karaoke singer cheered on by Tasha especially stood out. We are even<BR>treated to male striptease and Luca Silvestrini’s take on pole dancing is a revelation.<P>The performers are simply bursting with energy and it is amazing to watch how they squeeze every ounce of possibility out of the crowded dancing space available.<BR>All the flirting, shouting and fighting is just like ‘real life’ and on occasion it is almost hard to remember that it is an actual performance and you are not sitting in the pub next door watching other guests.<P>Bettina Strickler and Luca Silvestrini, both Choreographers in Residence at The Place and Protein Dance’s Artistic Directors, have succeded in capturing a unique snapshot of British publife that makes for highly enjoyable and exciting entertainment. <P><p>[This message has been edited by Stuart Sweeney (edited June 30, 2002).]
Choreographed and directed by Jerwood Choreography Award winners Bettina Strickler and Luca Silvestrini,
The Banquet rugby tackles Social Darwinism and the Origins of Life while exposing a whole range of time-honoured
social rituals that fall somewhere between the cradle and the grave. Ball gowned and tuxedo clad guests morph from personifications of polite sophistication to feasting beasts and then back again, overseen by avant-garde punk musician/icon & actor Richard Strange, The Banquet?s inimitable David Attenborough / Groucho Marx hybrid.
Protein Dance has steadily built a reputation for creating unique dance works that draw upon the absurdity in everyday life and blend
humour, text and music with idiosyncratic movement. Protein Dance?s previous works include Publife, a site-specific bar/pub based
dance theatre project celebrating Britain?s national institution, where five people are caught up in a nightly quest for fun and a dose of
self-confidence amidst the chaos of Salsa classes, pub-trivia quizzes and darts: and, inspired by the work of Sigmund Freud,
On the Couch, a maverick journey into the world of psychoanalysis, repressed desires and relaxation tapes.
Performed by a cast of six, The Banquet has original music by David Coulter: Stage Set and Costume Designs by Dick Bird: lighting
Design by Michael Mannion. The Banquet also features Richard Strange an avant-garde punk musician/icon, with 9 albums under
his belt, Cabaret Futura Club visionary and a feature film actor with credits including Neil Jordan?s Mona Lisa, Tim Burton?s Batman
Bettina Strickler and Luca Silvestrini launched Protein Dance in 1997. They received the prestigious Jerwood Choreography Award
and a Bonnie Bird Award in 2000 and are choreographers-in-residence at The Place, London until Summer 2004.
Bettina Strickler and Luca Silvestrini - the award-winning founders of Protein Dance and creators of the acclaimed dance work, Publife - have pulled out all the stops again with The Banquet. Their latest piece peels the veneer from a supposedly civilised dinner party, tracing the metamorphosis of four ballgowned and tuxedo-clad guests from polite sophisticates into feasting beasts - and back again.
"It's like watching party animals switching into straightforward 'animalistic' behaviour in a posh country house," says Dick Bird, the set designer. As human social interaction deteriorates, the guests are thrown meat to eat like dogs, by a singing butler-cum-ringmaster (played by the pre-punk cult figure, Richard Strange).
Protein Dance have made their reputation by putting the quirks and habits of human behaviour under the choreographic microscope. But in their latest production Banquet, which examines the social rituals and feeding habits of the species, it is the dancers' animal impersonations, rather than their studies of men and women, which steal the show.
In order to establish the work's Darwinian premis that we're closer to our primitive ancestors than we like to think, Banquet begins with a choreographed fast forward through evolution. The four dancers, with deftly observed and deftly executed body language slither across the stage like ancient pond life.
Protein Dance's The Banquet offers a fantasy menu that has the virtue of being consistently absurd. It, too, considers the human condition, wondering what we've evolved into. Compere Richard Strange sums up the journey as: 'From goo to zoo to you - not worse, not better, just one step further on.'
After Protein Dance's success with Publife last year, the company is back, with The Banquet, to offer more observations on human mores. The Banquet reminds us of who we are in the animal world. Crude, instinctual tactics sabotage the sophisticated social rituals of the occasion portrayed. The four elegant guests revert to a grunting menagerie, and polite words lurch into barks and snuffles.
The Banquet is entertaining, funny and intelligent, even if it does a good job of reminding us that manners really do maketh the man, and beneath is an animal driven by sex and survival. "From goo to zoo/ from zoo to you," sings Richard Strange.
“The Banquet”, Protein Dance's unique take on the Origins of Life, continues its national tour from 15 January 2004. Choreographed and directed by Bettina Strickler and Luca Silvestrini, The Banquet rips the lid off our seeming social sophistication to expose the beast beneath the surface.
Ball-gowned and tuxedo-clad guests morph from personifications of polite society to feasting beasts and back again, overseen by art/punk ledgend Richard Strange, The Banquet's inimitable David Attenborough/Groucho Marx hybrid. Not for the fainthearted, “The Banquet” is no picnic!
Protein Dance has built a reputation for creating unique dance works that draw upon the absurdity in everyday life and blend humour, text and music with idiosyncratic movement. The Company's previous works include “Publife”, a site-specific bar/pub based dance theatre project and “On the Couch” a journey into the world of psychoanalysis, repressed desires and relaxation tapes. Winners of a Jerwood
Choreography Award, Luca Silvestrini and Bettina Strickler are choreographers-in-residence at The Place, London.
“The Banquet” has original music by David Coulter, set designs by Dick Bird, costume designs by Silvia Raggi Cosi and lighting by Michael Mannion. It is performed by a cast of five - Strange, Benjamin Dunks, Tasha Gilmore, Luca Silvestrini, Richard Strange and Esther Weisskopf.
At table, do you wolf down your food? At parties, do you act the goat, or just, maybe, monkey around a bit. If so, chances are that The Banquet – the latest production from award-winning Protein Dance – will leave you feeling hot under the collar.
At the award-winning, curvi- linear, rainbow-hued Laban, which beacons across bleak Deptford Creek, I caught up with Protein Dance’s touring production The Banquet
GIVEN the food-heavy titles of both company and show, you’d expect to walk away from this performance feeling satiated. Sadly, the reverse is true. The Banquet is more famine than feast, with a potentially diverting storyline under-explored and badly presented.
Stepping back in time to the primordial soup, the dancers squirm across the stage, slowly growing legs and arms before evolving into swinging monkeys. So far, so Darwinian - nothing particularly new or clever there, but interesting nonetheless.
From weekend binge drinkers to holidaymakers in Faliraki, you don’t have to look far for evidence that our animal instincts are closer to the surface than we like to think. The Banquet, by London-based physical theatre outfit Protein Dance, makes this point by homing in on a group of excitable Sloanes holed up for a dinner party in a crumbling mansion by master of ceremonies, former proto-punk/actor, Richard Strange.

Despite Hamilton having a reputation for hard-rockin’ bogan metal bands, there was actually a really good indie scene in the early-mid ’90s. Inchworm were one of the bands who regularly played around town and this song was their first funded video.
The band shared singing duties and drummer Rob is at the mic on this track. But here’s the thing – director Greg Page never made a Karen Carpenter-like demand that he come out from the drumkit. Whenever we see him sing, he’s surrounded by his rapidly flying drumsticks, concentration face in full effect.
The video looks great, set in an old hospital and lit for maximum spookiness. There’s rain, dramatic shadows and the camera takes an uneasy journey along a corridor. But there’s never any hint that something sinister might happen. At its heart, it’s just a band performing their song in a cool old location.
Despite this promising start, it wasn’t until 1997 that Inchworm received their next music video funding.

This recipe really is from my grandmother, but I call it mother's nanner puddin recipe because - after mom died, I was looking for my recipe card, couldn't find it and before I thought twice, picked up the phone to call mom; only to realize I couldn't, I looked in my recipe box again, and there it was - "mama helped me find it". Grannie and mom thought it was AWFUL to use pudding in Banana Pudding, and they didn't like meringue on top - so this is simple, basic, but delish.
This is a very old recipe at least from the 1950's. My Mama made this every Christmas. It is hard to believe just how hard it used to be to get fresh fruits when you lived in the country.
Top with the remaining cream cheese mixture, then add the remaining 2 cups toasted coconut and mini chocolate chips
Samoa Girl Scout cookies are my absolute favorite! A co-worker several years ago gave me this recipe after a work luncheon and now I can enjoy the flavor of Samoa cookies year round.
1 cup jam (any kind, but preferably homemade blackberry with the seeds in and nothing used but sugar and berries to make the jam)
(NOTE: I prefer using in between 3/4 cup and 1 cup of boiling water just until it is perfect to my eye
My mom loves dark chocolate and I thought marshmallow icing sounds pretty good with a chocolate cupcake. Also while scrolling though Pinterest, I saw the pioneer woman's caramel sauce recipe and I was like put it on a cupcake! So the Salted Carmel Dark Chocolate Cupcake was born.
This muffin recipe uses no flour so they are a healthier alternative to regular muffins. They make a tasty after-school treat and super easy for a junior cook to make.
I am 8 years old and a beginner cook. I like to cook for my parents, Drew & Jenna Eason, especially when they aren't feeling well. This is a quick and easy recipe for a beginner.
Hi! My name is Sierra and I'm 15.I came across this recipe in a cookbook and decided to try it. Then I cut back on the sugar and butter to make it healthier. Now I make it for my family for breakfast and they love it! And I hope you do too!
Sift flour, salt, and baking soda or powder together, reserving 1/4 cup of the flour to flour nuts, dates, and raisins
Bake in 3 greased 9-inch cake pans in a preheated 350-degree oven for 30 minutes or until cake tests done
Brown Sugar Icing ½ cup unsalted butter 1 cup brown sugar, packed ¼ cup milk 2 cup sifted confectioners' sugar ½ teaspoon vanilla In a deep, large kettle melt the butter over high heat until it just starts to boil
My Grandmother made this cake and it was my all time favorite, sometimes she would cook it in a sheet pan and all that good of the icing would sink in the middle making it extra good.
Shred chicken and add to a medium bowl, add mozzarella cheese and half of the dry ranch packet, then add enough buffalo sauce to coat well
Dip the edge of a paper towel in water and go around all edges of the wrapper, then fold it like an envelope
Either deep fry at 350 degrees for a couple minutes until they are nicely browned and crisp, or fry in a couple of inches of oil in a cast iron skillet, turning to brown all sides
Mix in the sour cream with baking soda, add the flour a little at a time, mixing slowly, then add the cinnamon and nutmeg (can be adjusted to taste) with one last mix and then fold in the walnuts and raisins
Note that the walnuts are so finely chopped that you might not know they are in it so be sure to warn anyone that might have a nut allergy
My mom made this for us one night and it was my favorite. I added more ranch seasoning. I like it a lot, better than burritos.
Combine sucanat, roasted pecans, butter, and water in a pot, and stir until sucanat has partially dissolved
The wax paper helps to lift the pralines after they are hardened, and the butter helps them not to stick to the wax paper – because they will stick if butter is not used
I first started making pecan pralines after my family and I went to a friend's wedding in New Orleans, Louisiana. They had pralines at the wedding, and everyone loved them. After we got back home, I began making the pralines and decided to use the sucanat - because using sucanat helps them be a little healthier - and who does not want a healthy dessert or snack that tastes great? Everyone just loves them! I have taken them to church, to our family get-together, etc. They never stay around for long!
Sprinkle about 3 tablespoons cheese over each tortilla, and divide the pepperoni, onions, and ground cooked meat, equally among tortillas
Place two crescent rolls next to each other with the wide ends of the triangles overlapping to form a right angle
Dip marshmallows individually in the butter, then roll in the cinnamon and sugar and nutmeg mixture, coating evenly
Pull up the narrow ends of the triangles and wrap the crescent roll dough completely around the marshmallow, sealing well
This recipe was passed down from my sister. She was an amazing cook and loved to share her recipes with family and friends. The Mexican Bread recipe was one of our family favorites and was always on our table for holiday gatherings. Great bread to be served with any kind of food. Hope you will try it, know you will love it...
Thursday marked another phase in the near completion of the Baltimore lifeboat boathouse refurbishments. Baltimore ILB (inshore lifeboat) ‘City of Bradford v’ was conducting trials on the slipway at the station. The boat was hauled and launched several times on a purpose built Do-Do trolley, that runs on rails on the slipway with the aid of an electric winch. The works at the station will be completed in July, and the ILB will move from its present location at Baltimore pier to the newly refurbished boathouse. Having both boats operating from one building will help Baltimore Lifeboats to provide an even better service to the area.

Multi-level marketing (MLM) is a marketing strategy in which the sales force is compensated not only for sales they personally generate, but also for the sales of others they recruit, creating a downline of distributors and a hierarchy of multiple levels of compensation. Other terms for MLM include network marketing,pyramid selling, and referral marketing. Most commonly, the salespeople are expected to sell products directly to consumers by means of relationship referrals and word of mouth marketing. … Read entire article »
On June 6th, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted the Resolution 2419 (2018) to “consider ways to increase the inclusive representation of youth for the prevention and resolution of conflict”, considering the crucial role of youth in “building sustainable peace”, “promoting a culture of peace” and protecting youth from violence and conflict at the same time.
As this resolution’s recognition of the increasing role of youth with its influence in peace-building, an event advocating peace to national leaders was led by international youth. The International Peace Youth Group (IPYG) and Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), an international NGO under the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), held a two-day event called the “Peace Letter Campaign” at 35 locations in 7 major cities of South Korea on 9th and 10th of June, including Seoul and Paju where the recent inter-Korean summit and declaration of Panmunjom was announced.
At the event citizens, especially students, wrote letters with the contents advocating efforts of peace by their national leaders. According to the IPYG, 24,912 peace letters were written and collected in two days of the event through youth participation. The IPYG further said that the letters will be delivered to the two leaders of the two Koreas when they reached 150,000 in number.
As a backbone of the youth-led advocacy campaign for peace-building, the IPYG introduced "the Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW)" with 10 articles and 38 clauses, which stipulates peaceful dispute settlement, disarmament, religious and ethnic freedom, and spreading a culture of peace.
Ms. Park Min-Jeong, a participant, said, "Although there was a vague fear of reunification, I have come to think about positive aspects and expectation that reunification will be achieved in this era by seeing the inter-Korean summit."
"I realized that I should be aware of the issues of the international community to join in peace activities that will end the war in our times," she added.
"The future of Korea is youth. If young people are interested in reunification, and take the lead for it, we can achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula. The start can be a letter of heart. We will work hard so that youth can be more interested in and lead the peaceful reunification,” said Mr. Peter Jung, General Manager of the IPYG.
The IPYG has initiated a youth network for peace with 851 youth organizations in 110 countries around the world. The IPYG says that the “Peace Letter” campaign has also been held globally and the letters advocating peace-building in their countries will be delivered to their national leaders.

Background Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to explore the mechanism of brain structure and function in unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, neurological illness, and alcohol or drug abuse. Fifty demographically similar (age-, sex-, and education-matched) healthy controls were recruited by poster advertisements from the local area. Healthy controls were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, non-patient edition,35 to assure that 490-46-0 none of them had a current or past history of depression or other major physical or neurological illness, or substance abuse. All participants signed an informed consent form prior to participation in 490-46-0 the study. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Sichuan University, and was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration. HAM-D and HAM-A questionnaires All patients were scored by two qualified psychiatrists (XHM and MLL) according to the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) to assess the severity of symptoms. Patients with scores 18 on the HAM-D were included in our study. MRI data acquisition All scanning was performed on a 3.0 T MR scanner (Achieva; Philips, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) using an eight-channel phased-array head coil. Foam padding and earplugs were used to minimize head movement and scanner noise. During scanning, participants were often reminded to remain motionless with eyes closed, without falling asleep, and without thinking of anything special (confirmed by subjects immediately after the experiment). High-resolution T1 images were acquired by 3-D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence as follows: repetition time 8.37 ms, echo time 3.88 ms, flip angle 7, in-plane matrix resolution 256256, field of view 2424 cm2, and number of slices 188. A total of 240 volumes of echo-planar images were obtained axially with a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: repetition time 2,000 ms, echo time 3.711 ms, flip angle 7, in-plane matrix resolution 256256, field of view 256256 mm2, and number of slices 38. None of the participants had more than 2 mm maximum displacement in and 2 of angular motion during the whole MRI scan. For each participant, the fMRI scanning lasted for 8 minutes and 6 seconds, and 240 volumes were obtained. Image processing and analysis All structural data were processed using the DARTEL36 toolbox with the Statistical Parametric Mapping software package (SPM8; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). VBM preprocessing involved five steps, and followed the standard approach of Ashburner.36 The modulated 490-46-0 gray-matter images were smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6 mm full width at half maximum to be used in statistical analysis. ReHo analysis was performed with the Data Processing Assistant for Resting-State fMRI37 in MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Individual ReHo maps were generated by calculating Kendalls coefficient of concordance (KCC) of the time series of a given voxel with those of its nearest neighbors (26 voxels) inside a voxel-wise analysis.38 Zang LEIF2C1 et al described the formula for calculating the KCC value in their study.39 After calculating the ReHo map 490-46-0 voxel by voxel, the resulting fMRI data were then spatially smoothed having a Gaussian kernel of 666 mm3 full width at half maximum. While practical connectivity approaches measure the temporal correlation of low-frequency fluctuations (LFFs) between remote brain areas, ReHo measures the local synchronization of spontaneous fMRI,40 which is based on the assumption that LFFs within a functional cluster will synchronize with neighboring voxels.24 Statistical analysis Based on SPSS version 17.0, the 2 test for categorical data and College students t-test for continuous variables were used to evaluate variations in demographic characteristics between individuals and regulates. Two sample t-tests contained in SPM8 were used to test the variations in GMV and ReHo ideals between individuals and regulates. Confounding factors were regressed out, including age, sex, education years, and total volume of gray matter and white matter of each subject. Anatomical analyses yielded statistical parametric maps based on a voxel-level height threshold of P<0.001 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons). The statistical results of ReHo were corrected using the AlphaSim system, which is based on Monte Carlo simulations (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/manual/AlphaSim.pdf). The statistical threshold for this analysis was arranged at P<0.001..

An exceptional sea view for this beautiful 2 bedroom located in a new residence. On-plan marketing has just begun.
Author Philippa Gregory takes a look at the Tudor sisters Lady Jane, Katherine and Mary Grey. While Lady Jane Grey was the most famous, becoming a martyr at the age of 16 when she refused to renounce her Protestant faith for the Catholic Tudor Queen Mary, the other two sisters were hardly mentioned in the history books. The beautiful Katherine lived inside the Tudor family but was without favour from Queen Elizabeth. Her younger sister Mary was almost completely unknown but was a Little Person, said to be under four feet in height.
Both sisters were imprisoned for years for defying the Queen and both suffered tremendously because of the Queen’s fear and failure to name a successor to the throne, since Queen Elizabeth did not marry and did not have children.
Divided into three sections, one for each sister, the novel gives us a peek into their lives. The first chapter gives the account of Jane’s rise to Queen for nine days and her demise at the hands of her cousin Mary Tudor who overtook her and sent her to the executioner’s block. Next we learn about the ill-fated Katherine who chose to love and marry without the Queen Elizabeth’s consent and was imprisoned and separated from her husband and children for the rest of her life. Mary’s life followed a similar path although she never had children. But of all the sisters, Mary was the only one who learned how to survive being a Tudor. It’s a good read of fact and fiction for those who like period pieces.

I've recently started looking at the AppWarp SDK to build a synchronous game. However when I run my game, the "Game does not connect, " return a value only on the first Update(). Then it keeps returning null on every subsequent update() run. Basically the game does not connect. I used my API key and secret in the sample code. And it works perfectly there. My code is exactly the same as the sample, but doesn't work. Please help me understand if I'm missing something.
Please check out this link for more info. If this is not the case , could you please share following information:
I realized that the issue occured because I was switching scenes instantly. Hence, I always got a null value.
To describe the issue in detail, in the first scene of my game, I load a game object for which I use DontDestroyOnLoad (gameObject); because I want the game object to persist through all the scenes.
Now my assumption was that since a persistant game object has the appwarp component attached to it, the listener which is an object of the appwarp component will also persist throughout the scene changes. However that's not the case and the listener does not execute.
We have a sample built for scene transition. You can have a look at it here( https://github.com/RajeevRShephertz/AppWarpUnity2ScenesDemo ). It shows the AppWarp integration handling in multiple scenes.

Shake your toner cartridge side to side gently 5-6 times. Shake slowly so the toner will shift to the side showing blank and make sure toner distributes evenly inside.
Be sure to shake the toner cartridge gently. If you do not shake the cartridge gently, toner may spill out.
and the problem reappear, just gently shake a few more times redistribute the toners evenly and should be okay.
Hold it with a paper towel lightly damped with warm distilled water in one hand. With your other hand, blot the print head by pressing it into the towel a couple of times. This way, you will remove any dried ink on the print head surface. There should be a uniform, solid ink pattern on towel.
If this does not solve the problem, place the cartridge into a shallow saucer of hot distilled water for around 5 to10 minutes so as to help loosen the dried ink on the ink jets. Then, try blotting it again.
If there is a uniform, solid ink pattern on towel, dry off the cartridge and put it back in the printer. The ink may appear lighter because of the water. In order to clear it out, a few blots and a test page will help.

Hunting down the brake drag on my 55 Commander K. Sitting at a car show since 7 a.m. and a brake light came on all by itself when the ambient temperature started to spike over 85F. I drove it there and used the turn signals. My turn signal switch has been binding and acting up. Sometimes no brake light, sometimes one, no auto-cancel. Is it possible that a rogue signal getting to the brake light switch from the turn signals could actually engage the brakes? Could that switch act like a selenoid if it had power? Wierd or what?
Remember, the brake light is a simple "hot" wire needing only a ground to activate the light. Normally, the pressure switch needs pressure to complete the circuit. The pressure overcomes the spring that holds the circuit "open" and creates a ground. If the spring has failed or weakened to the point that "thermal expansion" can cause the circuit to close as temperature rises, the circuit can close and cause the light to come on.
Another (and more likely) cause is a bare spot in the wiring shorting to ground, closing the circuit and causing the light to come on. Then there is the other possibility of a conductive fluid leak contaminating connections or a bare spot in the wiring causing a short to ground.
In any case, the least severe result is to drain your battery. The worst would be a dead short that could heat the wire causing a fire and burning the car up along with the building it is parked in.
Since the circuit should be protected by a fuse or breaker, hopefully, the worst result will not occur. However, you need to find the cause and correct it.
Too eager to reply to you brake light problem...I failed to notice that you are also having a brake drag problem. You could be experiencing a mechanical adjustment problem such as improper master cylinder rod, hill holder release point(if equipped) , or master cylinder cap vent. Sorry for not reading more closely.:)
1. No, electricity won't apply the brakes. (Well, I guess if you dumped enough juice into the master cylinder to heat it and boil the fluid, and if the relief port were blocked, it might, but you'd notice the smoke.)
2. The brake light switch has hot wire on one side, the other goes to the turn signal switch so the brake light signal can be sent to whichever rear lamp is not signaling a turn at the time. So a faulty turn signal switch can cause erratic brake light operation. But no grounds are switched. All the switching is in the hot side.
3. since you say you are getting brake drag, and the brake lights coming on, the simplest explanation is that pressure is being retained in the master cylinder. Pedal not coming up full to the rest position, push rod over-adjusted holding the m/c plunger in a little, or m/c plunger sticking in the bore. Swollen rubber cups in the m/c are also a possibility.
4. Next time it happens, just crack open a bleeder screw at any wheel, and see if the lamp goes out. If it does, trapped pressure in the m/c is indeed the problem.
5. Clogged brake lines or hoses can indeed cause brake drag, but usually the brake lamps don't stay on. because the brake lamp switch is at the master cylinder and the clog is "downstream."
6. Good news is, that if the master cylinder is bad, new ones are readily available from any of our vendors, or even your local FLAPS. They are still a popular type.
Thanks, John and Gord. New M/C when we did the build 2000 miles ago. Put another new one in just to make sure. Replaced the 2000 mile new brake light switch with another new one and replaced the 2000 mile flex hoses with three new ones. All new steel lines and wheel cylinders. Yes, I can let the pressure off at a bleeder screw. As one drives and uses the brakes, the pressure builds and the pedal comes to the top and stays there. Your comment about the push rod rings true. Paul (55s) took her for a drive (only other person I have let take her for a drive) and he said the shoes were adjusted too close (from the feel). Wrong shoe adjustment or the M/C rod adjustment would have the same feel? I'll try again. Almost worth the airfare to fly you here for a test drive. I'll keep playing with it and keep you posted.
OK. My shop next door re-adjusted shoes and M/C rod and after three short trips, no brake drag, yet. Left brake light still staying on, but pulled the steering wheel and we can get the light off if we manually hold the signal switch lever in a certain place. That was a signal switch I found on eBay and the wiring appeared pretty nice compared to the switch we pulled out. Appears the switch, itself, is wonky so....anybody have a decent signal light switch for a 6V C/K?
Just took it on a longer drive on the 4-lane (85 mph). No brake issues, no more running hot issues, didn't notice the blow-by it had been showing, and feels like it would make it on a long trip. If I can replace that signal switch, I wouldn't need hand signals either. I have the original switch (before rerplacing it with the current one) I took out with the wires chewed. The switch itself seems smooth. Anyone ever tried to splice the signal wires AT THE SWITCH? If it can be done neatly with a little soldering, is it worth a shot?
I am too lazy to get into my literature to look for that switch number. I wonder how many were offered for the year. However, I would think someone out there has one. I have re-wired various switches and even rebuilt an overdrive relay. If you have the patience, tools, and know where to place a heat sink (if needed) you should be able to rewire that switch. If not, save it for someone who would be willing to tackle the job. Some of these old switches become too corroded to save but many can be cleaned and refurbished. The smaller switches take some good finger dexterity to neatly solder and restore to operable condition.
Hi Dave when my 55 was giveing me trouble I called studebaker west and got a later year switch the only differance was color of some of the wires. But as I recall they had info to plug it in now I can drive at night and have both headlights and turn signals.
Dave, unless I sold it and forgot. (heh) I should have a '55 signal switch out of a President coupe. But I won't be home for a couple of weeks.
Soldering and splicing new wires onto the signal switch ought to be easy enough. Use some new, Teflon-insulated wire, which will be much smaller than the old stuff, yet retain adequate current-carrying capacity. Will make it easier to snake through the column.
Tip: when pulling the old wires out, tape a piece of strong cord or string trimmer line to the end, so it can be used as a puller to drag the new wires back down.
New brake light switches ae very available: NAPA SL134, Borg Warner S194, Standard Motor Parts SLS27, Harley (apparently best for silicone fluid - I use regular brake fluid) The Harley switch may have the wrong contacts, but works long time with silicone.
I thought your pedal was too high - mine has about 2-3 inches before brakes apply, but nice hard pedal.
55coupe, thanks for the tip. Garage next door wired up the old switch and it's pooched, as well. I left a message at the Studebakers West site. Tried to call but it's Saturday and they're likely out driving Studebakers. Cheers!

We all need to eat a complete and balanced diet. We feed our dogs and cats food developed by companies that study their nutritional needs, but if you study the list of ingredients, Vitamin C is not listed. When we prepare our own meals, we have to make sure we consume a source of Vitamin C such as orange juice. Ever wonder why most pets don't need this vitamin?
The vast majority of animals in the world make their own Vitamin C and don't need to consume any. Vitamin C is also known as ascorbic acid. This vitamin is important for several enzyme reactions in the body. It is a factor in pathways making collagen and other substances that are important in healing and preventing bleeding from capillaries. It is an antioxidant and is also required to make adrenaline and dopamine.
Some species of animals have lost the ability to make Vitamin C however. A genetic defect occurred in guinea pigs, fruit bats, capybaras, some reptiles, and many primates, including humans. This defect causes the inability to make the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase in the liver. This enzyme allows the body to convert glucose to ascorbic acid, or Vitamin C.
These animals must consume Vitamin C in order to be healthy. That why it is important that people, and these other animals drink orange juice or eat other foods high in Vitamin C.
As far as pets are concerned, dogs and cats make their own Vitamin C and do not need to consume any. It is important, though, to feed guinea pigs a diet high in ascorbic acid. That is why you should feed them a pelleted diet made for guinea pigs and not one made for rabbits. The guinea pig diet contains Vitamin C while the rabbit food does not.

The roster of candidates for the Nov. 8 town election is unchanged, but that may not remain the case, as the Barnstable Coalition for Fair Government announced its intention to recruit candidates and create a political action committee.
In a July 21 press release, coalition chairwoman Mary Lyons said, “The coalition plans to support candidates running in the November Town Council election and is forming a Political Action Committee. There is still a push to find a candidate for precinct one in Barnstable village.”
In a July 21 phone interview, Lyons, a Centerville resident, said that while she’s chairwoman, it’s really more about the group than any individual.
“I feel like we’re just trying to stay organized, trying to make an effort to make sure the people who we voted for are actually representing us,” Lyons said.
In addition to the election work, Lyons said that the coalition will be working to call a meeting of the voters, as provided for in the town charter. While questions for such a meeting are still being formulated, she said the question of why an earlier end to the manager’s contract is sought is among them.
“Whatever's happened has happened, and we need to move on and we will do what we have to do to do that,” Lyons said.
The coalition is also supporting Marstons Mills resident Stephanie Adams, who has expressed an interest in recalling Precinct 12 councilor John Norman. Signatures for that process will be collected at the Barnstable Transfer Station July 23 starting at 9 a.m.
Norman is one of six councilors who voted to approve an amendment to end Town Manager John Klimm’s contract this fall. The amendment has been presented to Klimm, but he has yet to sign it.
Political action committees in local elections must register with the town clerk’s office. The coalition has yet to officially file with the town clerk’s office, with details such as a post office box for mailing to be arranged. Lyons expects that to be completed shortly, which would then allow the group to collect money.
Those looking for more information can search “Barnstable Coalition for Fair Government” on Facebook or e-mail BarnstableCFG@gmail.com.
School Committee: Patrick Murphy,* Osterville (incumbent); Fran McDonald,* Centerville (incumbent); Fredrick Bshara, Centerville; Michael J. Edwards, Centerville.
While councilors will be elected to four-year terms, they will be halved as a result of redrawn precinct lines effective in 2013. As a result, all councilors will stand for election in 2013, some to two-year terms, others to four-year terms to maintain staggered terms.
Those elected town-wide – school committee, housing authority and town collector – will be elected to and serve four-year terms and require signatures from 150 registered Barnstable voters to make the ballot.

This page describes how to compile GNAT/GPL. First you will need to download the all GNAT/GPL sources available.
The path names are more or less hard coded and installation is done in /opt/ada so you should check if they fit your needs.
The script compiles all and everything in one go - if you don't need everything you should make a copy and cut out everything you are not interested it.
There are quite a few tricks and twists incorporated into the script. Missing files copied, makefiles patched and so on. So read it carefully.
/work/gnat-gpl Base directory for the build process. Script files, downloads and all temporary files go here. You need just about 1 GB of free space to compile everything.
/work/configure Script files go here. Should also be the current directory when starting the scripts.
/work/gnat-gpl/2005/... Downloaded files. The structure should be the same as the one used by the libre site when creating you download package.
/opt/gnat Base directory for the installation. You need about 400 MB of free space when you install everything.
There are two options for the script get and conf. get will extract the sources and conf will configure the extracted sources. So the first time round you use:
For reproducible result you can completely delete all the files (apart the downloaded archives of course) and then just re-extract them with the get option.
Currently the script works on some older platforms. But there are some fixes needed if you have a newer Linux with a newer GTK.
The supplied pango won't compile with newer freetypes . In such cases you should install pango from the distribution.
The Python detector in GPS is quite primitive and supplies misleading error messages. The --with-python options needs to point to a directory from which to find lib/libpython.so and include/python/ . On most systems that should be /usr . You might have to provide symbolic links to the actual files and directories.

1 I think Giuliani is a great guy and a great NYC mayor. But he has had a love affair with press cameras throughout his stints as Federal prosecutor and mayor of New York. Subordinates got none of the credit for the significant things that they did. Bill Bratton, who pioneered computerized maps to hold precinct commanders accountable for fighting crime, quit over Giuliani's hogging of the limelight.
2 Bah, don't rain on his great speech. Guliani's speech was all about George Bush (compare his to McCain). He made an eloquent case for Bush's re-election.

Femanism is seeing gender as a man’s issue and not just about women. How the male norm shapes us and what men have to earn from emancipating themselves and becoming more equal. How both men and women maintain a destructive male role and how we can create change. I tell my personal journey from being a “boygirl” to “machowannabe” to “milleniumman”. About what it means to take a gender pill. And everything that an organization can gain with gender equality. Personal and humorous with a serious message.
I wish I had considered the pain-and-drain effects of Philadelphia’s summer heat before we moved here, but you can’t think of everything, I suppose, and we had other, apparently more serious things on our minds in 2006-7. (I wish I could remember what they might have been.) Although our June-August swelters are terrible, one blessing is that they propel one into chilled summer soup-making. The gazpacho recipe below, an excellent and traditional version appearing in Peter Feibelman’s The Cooking of Spain and Portugal, made its 2014 re-appearance in our house earlier this week. It rekindled very old memories (I’m fairly certain my mother used this recipe or a very similar one from my childhood days onwards) and it turned out so well that I’m sure this week’s rendition will create its own pleasant memories.
I first tasted gazpacho in Segovia, Spain under the shadow of the city’s famous Roman aqueduct when I was 8 years old. I was in Europe for the first time and my parents wanted to visit this ancient small city close to Madrid to see this engineering marvel and, I expect, have lunch in the excellent restaurant we visited. This was still Franco’s Spain and there was a palpable, serious and formal overlay on everything we experienced, which was reflected in women’s very traditional clothing, the serious expressions on men’s faces and of course the omnipresence of the Guardia Civil, who carried machine guns. I have never forgotten any of the palaces and monuments we visited, especially the Valle de los Caidos, with its haunting huge rock cross dominating the valley plain and its considerable resident population of indigent Spanish Civil War survivors, many of them amputees, begging alms.
On our initial European trips as a couple, Caroline and I always traveled to Spain, based on a combination of genuine interest, in order to stretch our dollars (Spain was considered a bargain spot in the later 1970s and early 1980s), and to spend time with a friend who lived in Mallorca. We would always split our trip into two parts, staying half the time in luxury hotels or romantic (and fairly luxurious) paradors in mainland cities and towns, and the other half for free as a guest at our friend’s house in Deyà on the Mallorcan coast. It was the best of both worlds, as they say, and we were privileged to enjoy a lot, learn a lot and make friends in new places. On our very first trip, I made sure to take Caroline to Segovia, which she loved as much as I did. We took a bus excursion there with a lovely group of Catholic pilgrims from South America, who were mainly focused on visiting Ávila, another destination on the day-tour, and paying their respects to Saint Teresa.
Next summer, when Jane has finally bidden Baldwin farewell and shaken off high school horrors, we will be taking our first family trip to Spain and the Balaerics. Our current plan is to visit Barcelona, the world’s most wonderful party town, first and then proceed to Mallorca to visit Kevin’s grave, Sóller, Palma and perhaps even finally see Chopin’s piano. We’ll hop over to Minorca and Ibiza, and conclude things in Madrid, where we will show Jane the Prado, our favorite restaurants, and drive out to Segovia, Ávila and the Valle de los Caidos, which I’d like to experience as an adult.
If I could have included Kevin Ayers’ song, Running In The Human Race, here I would have, but it isn’t on youtube, unfortunately. Recorded in the back seat of a Palma taxi, it sums up my current thoughts and mood perfectly. So, instead I’ve substituted I’m All Alone by Slapp Happy, from the great Sort Of record.
In a deep bowl, combine the coarsely chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, onion and green pepper, garlic and crumbled bread, and mix together thoroughly. Then stir in the water, vinegar and salt. Ladle the mixture, about 2 cups at a time, into the jar of a blender and blend at high speed for 1 minute, or until reduced to a smooth purée. Pour the purée into a bowl and with a whisk beat in the olive oil and tomato paste.
(To make the soup by hand, purée the vegetable and bread mixture in a food mill or, with the back of a large spoon, rub it though a sieve set over a bowl. Discard any pulp left in the mill or sieve. Beat the olive oil and tomato paste in the purée.)
Cover the bowl tightly with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until thoroughly chilled. Just before serving, whisk or stir the soup lightly to recombine it. Then ladle it into a large chilled tureen or individual soup plates.
Accompany the gazpacho with the bread cubes and the vegetable garnishes presented in separate serving bowls to be added to the soup at the discretion of each diner.
NOTE: if you prefer crisp croutons for the garnish, fry the bread cubes. In a 6-to-8-inch skillet heat 1/4 cup of olive oil over moderate heat until a light haze forms over it. Drop in the bread cubes and, turning them frequently, cook them until they are crisp and golden brown on all sides. Drain on paper towels and cool.

Follow this link to my BLOCKBUSTER STORY of how Brett Kimberlin, a convicted terrorist and perjurer, attempted to frame me for a crime, and then got me arrested for blogging when I exposed that misconduct to the world. That sounds like an incredible claim, but I provide primary documents and video evidence proving that he did this. And if you are moved by this story to provide a little help to myself and other victims of Mr. Kimberlin’s intimidation, such as Robert Stacy McCain, you can donate at the PayPal buttons on the right. And I thank everyone who has done so, and will do so.
This is the latest post in what I half-jokingly call The Kimberlin Saga®. If you are new to the story, that’s okay! Not everyone reads my blog. The short version is that Kimberlin has been harassing me for over a year, his worst conduct being when he attempted to frame me for a crime. I recognize that this might sound like an incredible claim, but I provide video and documentary evidence of that fact; in other words, you don’t have to believe my word. You only have to believe your eyes. So, if you are new to the story, go to this page and you’ll be able to catch up on what has been happening.
[Update: Please note that I have removed the first name of Ms. Kimberlin at her request and left only her first initial, "T." She is, after all, a victim of sexual abuse and those kinds of reasonable requests will be honored. While the moral right to privacy of rape victims is not absolute, it seems to be reasonably asserted here.]
So on Monday we saw the latest round of Brett Kimberlin v. T. Kimberlin. Both were seeking a protective order against the other. Brett was technically seeking a protective order against T. on behalf of their children—not supposedly on his own behalf—on the theory that T. abused her daughters. T. sought a protective order on the theory that Brett had abused her—in part by his statutory rape of her at a young age. There was a lot that was interesting that happened in the hearing. A lot of the smaller details will be covered in future posts, but this post will give you a good overview.
The first piece of news was that this time T. had counsel. Zoa Barnes who previously represented John Hoge in his peace orders against Brett Kimberlin and Bill Schmalfeldt was able to represent T. that day. John had told me that he selected Zoa Barnes for his cases because she was a family lawyer and thus brought that perspective to the table. And she quite handily shut Brett Kimberlin down previously. So when T. looked for a recommendation for an attorney, Zoa was the natural choice.
[Update: Please note that I have removed the first name of Ms. Kimberlin at her request and left only her first initial, “T.” She is, after all, a victim of sexual abuse and those kinds of reasonable requests will be honored.

Well, "framed" is maybe too strong a word, but let’s review, shall we? In one of my previous posts, I discussed how Brett Kimberlin seems obsessively focused on anyone who is “intolerant” of pedophilia, including myself, Patrick Frey, Mandy Nagy, Lee Stranahan and so on. In particular Brett Kimberlin reacts badly when you (accurately) suggest he is a pedophile, or just call him one outright as I have been ever since I spoke with his wife, T. And when Brett Kimberlin gets angry at someone, while one cannot exactly predict his behavior, one can predict that he will 1) act out 2) in a way that does him more material harm than good. He is predictable in that respect.
But there was one example of someone accusing him of pedophilia that I left out, because it is, well... complicated. It revolves around the early days of the Seth Allen case. I learned of this story after the fact from friends, but what happened was Allen basically attacked Kimberlin in terms that was already established fact, or reported things that were stated in prominent books, newspapers, etc. He truly didn’t defame Brett Kimberlin because everything he said was either 1) true, or 2) previously reported by other sources.
But then what happened is that people started faking more potentially defamatory comments under Seth Allen’s name, or his various well known internet personas. And among them was the accusation that Brett was a pedophile. I always suspected Rauhauser was behind this, or someone acting on his urging. But yes, you are reading that right, folks: Seth Allen was falsely accused of accurately accusing Brett of being a pedophile. It was meta.
We always assumed that whoever did this—whether it is Rauhauser or not—did so with Brett Kimberlin’s knowledge and approval. In other words, I always assumed that Brett’s claim that Seth called him a pedophile was in fact a fraud upon the court—that Brett Kimberlin knew Seth didn’t write any such thing.
But recently I have begun to wonder: what if Brett really thought Seth wrote it. What if he really, sincerely believed that the accusations of pedophilia were coming from Seth Allen, even though they didn’t?
We often call Rauhauser a “confict cupid” meaning that he liked to try to find ways to make friends or potential allies argue among themselves. Maybe the Kimberlin v. Allen suit was Neal Rauhauser’s greatest success as “conflict cupid.” He knew that nothing angered Brett Kimberlin more than truthfully being called a pedophile, so maybe he planted that fake comment accusing him of it, in order to drive Brett Kimberlin into acting against Seth, knowing his instincts would backfire on him. Maybe he was even wise enough to guess that people like myself would come to Seth’s aid, fuelling Kimberlin’s paranoid belief in a massive conspiracy against him, when in fact the entirety of the alliance against him was created by his own conduct starting with what he did to Seth and gaining ground when he victimized me. Maybe Rauhauser was hoping all along for something like this to happen to Brett.
And why would Rauhauser do that? Why would he want to have caused all this trouble in Brett Kimberlin’s life? The answer is simple: to justify his own employment. He created a need for Brett Kimberlin. He made Brett feel the need to thuggishly attempt to suppress the truth and then he fulfilled it, and was more than likely paid handsomely for his trouble. So the irony of all of this is that Brett Kimberlin now faces the very real prospect of going back to prison and being forever labeled a pedophile, because Neal Rauhauser goaded him into an unwise fight with Seth Allen that he then saw spin (predictably) out of control.
Of course most people know that George Costanza is one of the main characters on the classic sitcom Seinfeld, generally believed to be a stand in for Larry David who ended up having his own show later. George is kind of a loser who, in one of the most memorable episodes of the series, ever (which is really saying something for that show) comes to an epiphany. If you can watch it, it is funnier to see it than for me to describe:
A few weeks back, Bill Schmalfeldt called my wife, who is an Asian-American woman, a mail-order bride. This was, of course, a racist attack on my wife and I appropriately called him out for it. I didn’t find my wife in a catalog or on a dating or marriage site. I met her at a Whole Foods in Falls Church near my apartment at the time. Really it was serendipity that I met her because everyone who knows me knows I am really not a Whole Foods kind of guy.
And over at a site that I won’t link to, Brett Kimberlin leapt to Schmalfeldt’s defense. Of course he didn’t identify himself as Brett, but we all know it was him. And as is often the case, his defense revealed more about himself than anything else.
First, he tried to dispute that calling an Asian American woman a mail-order bride in this day and age was not racist. We will take that assertion as seriously as it deserves to be.
But then he goes into why a man would want a mail order bride and this is the revealing part. Here is what he wrote:
I think today the mail order bride business is still a booming trade. Many men who use these services do so because they want women who are subservient to them and their needs. They want cooks, people to take care of them, and sex partners. Usually this service is used by men who can’t seem to get anyone in their own cultures who will “put up with them” and the men who utilize such services want a woman who won’t question them, who are younger, and who provide for them all just to be able to get a green card. I think it is telling of course that Walker couldn’t get an American woman to “put up with him” and sought a woman who would worship him instead. Nothing bad about that mind you, but it is telling of course.
Now, T. Kimberlin is not a mail order bride. Brett didn’t pick her out of a catalog, or even on some dating or marriage site. Instead he met her on a beach in Ukraine when she was fourteen (shiver). And then he transported her to Maryland when she was fifteen where they had sex in violation of Maryland law. Then he got married to her when she was sixteen, and again he failed to comply with Maryland law, forging her birth certificate to make her appear to be eighteen years old. That is not a mail order bride by any stretch of the imagination. It is instead the abusive seduction of a child.
But Brett Kimberlin and his friends often called her a mail order bride, regardless. And so if Brett Kimberlin thought of her as one, well, what does that reveal about him when he talks about this trade that he considers himself to be intimately involved in? Read what he wrote again, remembering that he (wrongly) thought of T. as his mail order bride. Let me clear out some of the clutter. According to Kimberlin men use this service because “they want women who are subservient to them and their needs.” They want servants: “cooks, people to take care of them, and sex partners.” These services are used by men who have trouble convincing American women (who might have heard of the Speedway Bombings) to “put up with them” and they want a woman “who won’t question them.” Indeed he declares that such women will “worship him.”
Oh, and Brett informs us that people seek mail order brides in order to get girls “who are younger.” Shiver.
That is probably the fantasy for such men (except the pedophilic angle, one hopes), but it cannot be reality. I suspect that the majority of true mail order brides are women who are planning to dump their American partners the moment they have their citizenship. Being a mail order bride is just a more exotic version of gold-digging, which in all bluntness is a higher class form of prostitution and often the gold digger leaves once he or she gets their payday, be it in cash or in kind. Worship is probably not induced by such an arrangement, but I wouldn’t be surprised if such women fake it.
But a girl too immature to handle a sexual relationship being seduced into marriage with a much older man? That can produce genuine worship.
However, worship is not the foundation for a solid relationship. Instead you must have mutual respect and love. Which is why today my marriage is solid despite the strain Brett has tried to put on it, and Brett’s is falling apart, because for Brett his relationship was about control. Like with everything else in life, he doesn’t seek to influence others by kindness but by bullying others, including his own wife. And just as he has failed at every stage to see how his bullying of me (and others) did not help to suppress the truth about him, he failed to understand how his bullying of his wife destroyed his marriage more surely than anything she did in response. You do not convince a person to come back to you by trying to get them falsely imprisoned or by threatening violence against them. At most it only might work temporarily.
In the end, Brett Kimberlin has a stunted view of life. For him it is all about controlling that which could hurt him whether it is an attorney who has absolute proof Brett tried to frame him for a crime...
...or seducing an underage girl to be his wife so he can overwhelm her personality, and then lashing out at her viciously when she wakes up from his spell. His pain is normal, but his response is not. The only thing he knows how to do in response to pain, fear, etc. is to lash out, to abuse the person he blames for this pain (which is often in truth self-inflicted) through the court system and hope to silence the critics and bring his wife back home.
In other words, when it comes to myself, Seth Allen, Robert Stacy McCain, Patrick Frey, Popehat, Lee Stranahan and Mandy Nagy (and others) he has practiced what has been described as “brass knuckle reputation management.” And when it came to his wife, he has been practicing brass knuckle romance.
I have accused some people, particularly Brett Kimberlin, of reprehensible conduct. In some cases, the conduct is even criminal. In all cases, the only justice I want is through the appropriate legal process—such as the criminal justice system. I do not want to see vigilante violence against any person or any threat of such violence. This kind of conduct is not only morally wrong, but it is counter-productive.
In the particular case of Brett Kimberlin, I do not want you to even contact him. Do not call him. Do not write him a letter. Do not write him an email. Do not text-message him. Do not engage in any kind of directed communication. I say this in part because under Maryland law, that can quickly become harassment and I don’t want that to happen to him.
And for that matter, don’t go on his property. Don’t sneak around and try to photograph him. Frankly try not to even be within his field of vision. Your behavior could quickly cross the line into harassment in that way too (not to mention trespass and other concerns).
The only exception to all that is that if you are reporting on this, there is of course nothing wrong with contacting him for things like his official response to any stories you might report. And even then if he tells you to stop contacting him, obey that request. That this is a key element in making out a harassment claim under Maryland law—that a person asks you to stop and you refuse.
Well, let’s see if we can find a common thread among his enemies, shall we? First up, we have James O’Keefe III. Unlike a lot of his targets, he hasn’t been hitting back very much, but he was an early target of Kimberlin’s as I mentioned here.
And why was that? On its face it was because Brett Kimberlin was offended that James O’Keefe recorded people without their consent. But hidden camera investigations occur all the time. Why did he focus on this one? Here watch it again:
Of course over the last week we have seen the revelation that Brett Kimberlin is, in fact, a pedophile. I base that on having spoken to his wife and having heard her story first-hand, in conjunction with all of the evidence. I know you haven’t benefitted from having met her and watched her over time describing what he had done to her, but I have and I am convinced.
For instance, on November 14, 2011, Brett Kimberlin claimed that Seth Allen was interfering with his charities by truthfully calling him a terrorist, liar and so on. Also he falsely accused Seth of accusing him truthfully of being a pedophile, which is kind of meta when you think about it. So this was how he described his organizations:
I have two organizations, Justice Through Music, which has been in business for about 10 years. The executive director is Jeff Cohen (phonetic sp.). And it’s a Bethesda based operation, and we work with young people, mostly, to get them involved with voting. We’ve registered tens of thousands of kids to vote. And we get them involved with social causes. We work with very famous artists and bands and get them talking to kids abut the importance of getting involved with the world and so on and so forth.
Early in the Kimberlin saga I started moderating every comment on this blog. This was because Team Kimberlin would try to abuse the comment system in various ways. But there was one comment, to this post, I held in the queue, for another reason. “Dianna” seemed sincere enough, but there was an unintended irony to her comment that I wasn’t ready to discuss. This is what she wrote and for the first time today, I let the comment out of moderation:
Aaron, if there's someone who could refer Ms. Kimberlin, there's a House of Ruth affiliate she can turn to. They are very effective advocates and supports for abused women.
You see, as much as I have written about Brett Kimberlin, there are some details I have held back, just because a detail might not be very important at the time. Let me start by telling you about the House of Ruth. This is their mission statement:

If you see an advertisement via the Internet (World Wide Web), then it is classified as online advertising. In fact, there are ads on this very page, and most other websites you visit, as they are the primary revenue driver for the Internet.
From banner ads (including rich media banners) to Search Engine Optimization (SEO), social networking, email marketing, online classified ads, site takeovers, and even SPAM, online advertising is one of the fastest growing ways to reach an audience.
While traditional offline advertising is used by many companies to drive customers to their websites, many businesses are trying online ads (such as banners, pay-per-click ads, pay-per-call ads and pop-ups) in e-newsletters, on compatible websites, on search engines and in online versions of newspapers and magazines as a way of reaching people who use the internet for shopping or to gather information.
Focus groups can help you determine the look of your ads so they attract the consumers you really want to reach. Attracting the eye comes first--keep in mind that what they see reflects directly on your company. Be sure that when they get to your site or call you, they're not disappointed with that "next step." Your site must load quickly, be easily navigated, and not require too many forms to complete or entail too many steps to get to the final order or check out or call.
Pay-per call ads are new, but think of how appealing this is for a consumer or prospective client who needs an answer now or needs to make a purchase now to be able to make a quick call and take care of their pressing need, rather than clicking on a banner and being led to your website where they may need to fill in a registration form and then send you an e-mail and wait for a reply.
Pop-up ads have become more hated than calls from telemarketers--and like "remove my number" efforts, more and more people are purchasing pop-up-blocking software to minimize the aggravation.
Don't forget that your branding efforts extend to your online advertising, and every contact with the public either builds your brand or tears it down.

Growing up in suburban Chicago, Andrew might be considered a late bloomer in the sailing universe, but he knew his passion for the ocean was there from an early age. He moved to San Diego for college, and proceeded to take sailing lessons immediately upon his arrival. Starting off in boats hardly bigger then himself, his passion for all things ocean continued to grow as rapidly as his sailing experience in and around Southern California. Upon graduation from San Diego State University, with a degree in hospitality & tourism, Andrew decided to focus on sailing, and became a US Sailing Certified Instructor. He spent years on San Diego teaching sailors young and old the wonders of the ocean. Andrew returned to the Midwest, for years of sailing on Lake Michigan. Upon receiving his USCG Master Captains license, Andrew decided to move "Down Island" to pursue his dream of becoming a full time Captain. He is now excited to continue chasing his dream, and to share his love for all things ocean with all of his guests, as he continues to grow as a diver, surfer, chef, host, bartender, and most importantly lifetime sailor.

She was drawn to the creative, but structured aspects of kitchen life and returned to the islands with a passion for food and hosting. Michaela spent the last three years honing her expertise and skill in the yachting industry in St. John. Highly knowledgeable about local waters and hotspots, she is excited about sharing her unique and beautiful home. She has a super energetic spirit that keeps her constantly looking for adventure and new friends.
Collectively Andrew and Michaela have traveled to 45 countries and are on a constant quest to grow and learn, while sharing their passions with others. They fell in love surrounded by the turquoise water of the Caribbean and soon after realized they made spectacular sailing partners. Their dream became a reality on a Summer sailing trip to the Greek islands, confirming their belief that sailing was meant to be their career.

Based on the unease of the mechanical systems; were made in this era. Focusing more on the artistic components and beauty of style, jewelers started to reject machines to earn their cherished projects. Handcrafted jewelry has been introduced back into fashion, turning into valuable metals and costly stones like diamonds. Rather, silver, gold, copper, and brass were used to make layouts.
Taking a mix of the background of jewelry is the way some gardener’s work, expressing hints of concepts and designs from one age and hauling them into another. We often return to the past with classic jewelry or components of different phases to make new and fascinating art which will draw people’s interest.
Men’s jewelry is worn at the modern-day — chains and rings have stayed a prominent characteristic of men’s jewelry, whereas brooches for guys are dropped slightly. Watches are particularly crucial for the contemporary man, using a range of styles and brands, once more, representing wealth is worn out. To know more about jewelry you can browse – http://marianijewellers.com/.
Non-metals are introduced to contemporary jewelry design, like plastics and fabrics to push the bounds of jewelry making as we understand it. Now, those bounds are still being pushed to make advanced designs and creations which make jewelry history.

Additional Markings will address issues of religious, cultural, literary, and political interest. The title reflects a continuation of the author's award winning column in the Covenant Companion magazine. It also honors the memory of Swedish diplomat Dag Hammarskjold who sought in his famous journal Markings to integrate his personal life, his work on behalf of humanity, and his spiritual life. This blog will explore how those aspects of human life may be held together and nourished.
A couple of weeks ago I had the privilege of presenting a paper for the “Theology and Peace Conference” held on the campus of North Park University. I was invited to give the paper by my friend Michael Hardin, seminary alumnus, member of the Theology and Peace board, and author of The Jesus Driven Life. Theology and Peace seeks to apply the insights of Rene Girard to the theology and life of the Christian Church. Throughout his long and prestigious academic career Girard has developed and promoted his theory of “mimetic rivalry” and “scapegoating”. He has argued that human beings learn what is desirable from other human beings. That is, we imitate the desires of others. Introduce a new toy into a group of happily playing toddlers. They may ignore the new toy until one of them expresses an interest in it. The once ignored toy is suddenly intensely interesting. Screeching and hair pulling is likely to follow.
Girard argues that primitive society suffered from the violence of mimetic rivalry. Limited resources and unlimited desires resulted in a war of all against all. Humans finally realized that perpetual violence was not conducive to survival and sought a means to check the violence and bloodshed. At some point in the murky past they seized on the notion of a scapegoat. If one person or group of persons could be blamed for the violence and punished or destroyed the violence would be diverted and dissipated. The “scapegoats” needn’t be guilty of any great crime. They could be people at the margins of society, odd men and women out. Or they could be randomly selected from the community. All that was necessary was that the society unified itself against them and literally or metaphorically sacrificed them. The sacrifice of the scapegoat would bring temporary unity and peace until the next “mimetic crisis” required additional sacrifices.
Girard develops his theory in a series of brilliant works including, most notably, The Scapegoat and I See Satan Fall Like Lightening. Converted to Roman Catholicism as an adult, Girard immediately saw the application of his theory to the death of Jesus. He argued that in effect Jesus is the scapegoat to end all scapegoats. He exposes the mechanism for what it is: a crude but effective means of bringing temporary peace by focusing the hatred and loathing of the majority on a despised minority. As a result of the death and resurrection of Jesus the veil of secrecy is lifted and the mechanism’s effectiveness begins to wane. It becomes clear that the victim of scapegoating is not guilty or at least not so guilty as to merit destruction. For human beings to find genuine peace scapegoating and its attendant sacrifices must be rejected and love of God and neighbor must be pursued.
This week the Middle East has been once again in the news. The Israelis bumbled into a public relations disaster when they boarded a ship bringing supplies to blockaded Gaza. The raid on the flotilla produced a howl of protest around the world. Israeli leaders responded as belligerently as their opponents in the Middle East, Europe and the United States. I was reminded of another conference I attended at North Park. This meeting focused on “Christian Zionism,” that is, Christians who support the state of Israel. I was asked to give a short talk at the end of the meetings summing up the conference. I cited the work of Girard and suggested that the crisis in Israel was not likely to be addressed until both sides stopped “scapegoating” the other. Israel has become the source of all evil in the Arab world and thus a source of unity between otherwise fractious states. The Palestinians and their suicide bombers have provided the Israeli leaders with a convenient source of unity and outrage.
In the United States the left tends to excoriate Israel and throw its support behind the Palestinians. The right tends to attack the Palestinians and stand solidly behind Israel. Israel and the Palestinians become additional proxies in the ongoing fruitless and idiotic conflict between right and left. That Israel is genuinely threatened and that the Palestinians are genuinely suffering seems not as significant as winning points against your opponent. The reflexive support of one or the other regardless of their actions serves neither party well. It only serves the propaganda needs of people on either extreme of the issue. It only furthers the scapegoating violence.
My Orthodox Rabbi friend has children and grandchildren in Israel. He longs for them to grow up in peace and safety. He wants them to be able to sip coffee at a café without fearing for their lives. He wants them to be able to worship and live with freedom. There are many grandfathers in Gaza who want the same for their children and grandchildren. They want them to live free from the threat of violence, from the bitterness of sanctions, blockades, walls and checkpoints. As long as their leaders eagerly use hatred and fear of the other to sustain their power and undergird their moral authority, that is, as long as they scapegoat the other, both of their hopes seem forlorn.
Christians are not to scapegoat. We, perhaps more than others, should see its perniciousness. Our own history is a sordid tale of scapegoating violence. It has taken us years to see clearly that the gospel does not sacrifice the victim, but sets the victim free. Christians refuse the crudity of scapegoating. We refuse to blame the liberals or the conservatives, the African Americans or the Jews, the Catholics or the Fundamentalists, the Muslims or the Atheists. We refuse the cheap and easy assumption of evil at the margins, the smug assignment of blame and disdain. We do not sacrifice—we love. Can we, together, contribute to the peace of Jerusalem? Sadly, if this week is any indication, I doubt it.
I did a double take here. There is also Michael Horton’s "The Gospel-Driven Life". It is interesting to contrast both Michaels and their "-driven" books that come after Warren's best seller.
Horton concludes: “The Mountain of Zion trumps all other hills, towers, and high places. No temporal government, cultural movement, or market niche can bring together a remnant 'from every tribe, kindred, tongue, people, and nation' and make them into a 'kingdom of priests to our God' who 'will reign forever and ever' (Rev. 5:9). We are building our earthly kingdoms, but Zion is the city that God is building.”
Still we have to encourage and pray for peace all the while knowing that the Prince of Peace, our scapegoat, will one day bring that peace on earth.

a while back there was a site similar to this known as "yugimonz" and i remember how helpful it was to the local yugioh players when it came to deck advice, trades and keeping everyone up to date with new releases and events and so on.
so what i have done is i have tried to recreate a similar forum to get that helpful resource back for all the players, but this time it will not be a forum for strictly infinity games players, it will be a forum for players all over adelaide, people who enter in the tournaments in adelaide.
people who break these simple rules will have there accounts temporarily suspended, people who continue to break these rules on numerous occasions will be perminantly banned.

Hello, I am Miss Young. A scammer often fails in making his victim pay him money. But he does not give up if he thinks it is still possible to convince the victim. He could try a new scam with hidden millions or a big lottery winning. Another approach is a compensation letter where he promises the victim a big sum as compensation. The compensation money does not exist, - it is simply the start of a new scam. The letter below is an example of such a letter.

Harvard professor and prolific author Niall Ferguson opened the 2010 Aspen Ideas Festival Monday with a stark warning about the increasing prospect of the American “empire” suddenly collapsing due to the country’s rising debt level.
“I think this is a problem that is going to go live really soon,” Ferguson said. “In that sense, I mean within the next two years. Because the whole thing, fiscally and other ways, is very near the edge of chaos. And we’ve seen already in Greece what happens when the bond market loses faith in your fiscal policy.”
Ferguson said empires — such as the former Soviet Union and the Roman empire — can collapse quite quickly and the tipping point is often when the cost of servicing an empire’s debt is larger than the cost of its defense budget.
“That has not been the case I think at any point in U.S. history,” Ferguson said. “It will be the case in the next five years.”
The affable British scholar tried to keep it light. He used a stage whisper to tell the Aspen Institute audience, “I know you’re not comfortable with the word ‘empire,’ especially just after the Fourth of July, but you are the Redcoats now.”
He said the U.S. is now deeply in the red as a country because of a combination of the Great Recession, the resulting federal stimulus and financial bailout programs, two wars, the Bush tax cuts, and a growth in social entitlement programs.
“By combating our crisis of private debt with an extraordinary expansion of public debt, we inevitably are going to reduce the resources available for national security in the years ahead,” Ferguson said. “Because as a debt grows, so the interest payments you have to make on it grow, even if interest rates stay low. And on current projections, the federal debt is going to be absorbing around 20 percent — a fifth of all the taxes you pay — within just a few years.
Harvard professor and author Niall Ferguson speaks about the financial crisis during an opening session of the Aspen Ideas Festival on Monday afternoon.
“The item of discretionary federal expenditure most likely to be squeezed is of course defense. And there are lots of historic precedents for that,” said Ferguson, who is the author of “Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power.”
Ferguson said the financial crisis that started in 2007 has “has accelerated a fundamental shift in the balance of power,” with the U.S. shedding power and China absorbing it.
“I’ve just come back from China — a two-week trip there — and the thing I heard most often was, ‘You can’t lecture us about the superiority of your system anymore. We don’t need to learn anything from you about financial institutions and forget about democracy. We see where it has got you.’”
David Gergen of CNN, who moderated the discussion, which also included billionaire Mortimer Zuckerman, asked Ferguson whether it made a difference if the U.S. declined as a world power.
“Having grown up in a declining empire, I do not recommend it,” Ferguson said. “It’s not a lot of fun, actually, decline. To be more serious, a world in which the United States is no longer predominate is not likely to be a better world, actually.”
In what he called his “light moment,” Ferguson said, “I think there is a way out for the United States. I don’t think its over. But it all hinges on whether you can re-energize the real mainsprings of American power. And those two things are technological innovation and entrepreneurship.
“Those are the things that made the United States the greatest economy in the world and the critical question is, ‘Are we going to get it right?’ Can we revive those things in such a way that in the end we grow our way out of this hole the way the United States grew its way out of the 1970s and of course out of the 1930s?”
The Aspen Ideas Festival continues through July 11 at the Aspen Institute. Such notables as U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, and former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan are scheduled to appear.
A number of events are open to the public, but tickets were going fast on Monday through the website Aspen Show Tickets. Aspen Public Radio also plans on broadcasting a number of festival events live, including on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. and at 1 and 5 p.m. bgs@aspendailynews.com
24/7 Wall St. has created a new list of brands that may disappear, which includes Readers Digest, Kia Motors, Dollar Thrifty (NYSE: DTG - News), Zale (NYSE: ZLC - News), Blockbuster (BLOKA.PK - News), T-Mobile, BP Plc (NYSE: BP - News), RadioShack (NYSE: RSH - News), Merrill Lynch and Moody's (NYSE: MCO - News).
24/7 Wall St. regularly compiles a report of brands that are likely to disappear in the near-term. Last April, and again in December, we published our findings. Usually, it would take a full year before such a list could be compiled again. However, the current economic climate has accelerated this process and a majority of the brands on the first two lists are either gone, have been acquired, or have filed for bankruptcy.
With a number of the brands on the December list either gone or on a short-term path to extinction, 24/7 Wall St. has put together the latest version of the Ten Brands That Will Disappear. To qualify, we expect that brand to be gone by the end of 2011, or for its parent to be sold or go into Chapter 11.
Reader's Digest was once the most widely read magazine in the world. According to the company, it still may be when its overseas editions are taken into account. Last August, the company took its U.S. operations into Chapter 11 to decrease debt. It emerged from bankruptcy in February with $525 million in exit financing. The company cut the number of issues it publishes a year from 12 to 10 last year. It also cut its circulation guarantee for advertisers to 5.5 million copies from 8 million. It would have been unthinkable just a few years ago that a magazine as old and famous as Reader's Digest would be shuttered. However, Reader's Digest as it is known in the U.S. will be gone.
Blockbuster was the national leader in the video rental business for nearly two decades. Now it is contemplating Chapter 11 to eliminate debt. The company lost $65 million last quarter. Its revenue continues to fall rapidly as firms such as Redbox and NetFlix (Nasdaq: NFLX - News) siphon off its revenue. Blockbuster has more than 6,000 stores, so it is hard to imagine that the company could disappear. But, there is some precedent, even if it is on a smaller scale. Blockbuster rival Movie Gallery said in February that it would close all of its 2,400 U.S. stores. Blockbuster's model of renting movies through physical locations has been destroyed by cable and satellite video on demand, DVDs via mail and dispensing machines. Blockbuster may still be around as a company that has movie kiosks and a small mail and Internet-delivered content business. But its brick and-mortar business is dead.
Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, the car rental company, is for sale. Hertz (NYSE: HTZ - News) is a potential buyer, as is Avis Budget (NYSE: CAR - News). Each of the larger car rental firms would use the Dollar Thrifty business to expand their market share. That does not mean that they would keep the brand. The current company is not much of a business. It made only $27 million last quarter on revenue of $348 million. It has more than $1.5 billion in "debt and other obligations." The number of vehicles that Dollar Thrifty operates at any one time is only 95,000 compared to 420,000 for Hertz. The firm's customer base and some of its locations may be valuable, but Dollar Thrifty can't compete with Avis and Hertz. A decade ago, the car rental industry was able to support six independent brands. A significant drop in business and leisure travel and sharp competition among the companies has already caused the creation of Avis Budget. Dollar Thrifty will be the next casualty of the industry's consolidation.
T-Mobile, the U.S. wireless provider, is owned by telecom giant Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY.PK - News). It is the No.4 cellular company in an American market that only supports two really successful firms -- AT&T Wireless and Verizon Wireless. Even the third-largest company in the market -- Sprint-Nextel (NYSE: S - News) -- has 50 million customers. T-Mobile had 34 million customers at the end of last year. T-Mobile only had a profit of $306 million in 2009. That was down from $483 million in 2008. T-Mobile not only faces three larger competitors, it also has to begin to offer 4G service to compete with Sprint's new WiMax service and LTE-based products from AT&T (NYSE: T - News) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ - News). T-Mobile may seek a partner to offer a 4G network, but there are no super-fast broadband networks likely to be finished before its three rivals offer the service. As it now stands, T-Mobile has no future in the U.S. A merger with Sprint-Nextel has been mentioned several times. The combined company would have a customer base about the same size as AT&T or Verizon. And the transaction would probably make Deutsche Telekom a large owner of the combined operation. Another alternative would be a merger with Virgin Mobile. Maybe Deutsche Telekom will just change the firm's name.
Moody's Corp. may have the name with the largest negative brand equity in the U.S. Scandals about the company's rating of mortgage-backed securities and allegations that the firm compromised it ratings process to get business have ruined the company's image. Moody's is more than 100 years old, but the reputation it built over those years is irretrievably lost. There is a chance Moody's could be ruined by civil actions, four of which are pending, and by charges brought by the U.S. government. Overseas authorities may bring a number of actions against the company as well. Moody's activities are almost certainly to be more regulated, which will squeeze margins and hurt sales. Moody's may end up selling its accounts to a new rating company, which would probably hire many of its employees. Pacific Investment Management Co. and other institutional investors have talked about taking on some if not all the roles that the current rating firms play. Research houses like Alliance Bernstein (NYSE: AB - News) could also take on some of those rolls. Part of Moody's operation may stay alive, but there is not much left to salvage in the brand.
BP: The case against the BP brand is not so much that the company will enter bankruptcy. It is that BP may end up breaking into pieces for its own sake. This may be to put the liabilities for the Deepwater Horizon spill into a company that also holds escrow capital to cover the huge costs of clean-up and suits. BP may also want to separate its successful refining operations from its exploration business, or recreate an American- based company similar to BP America, which existed for two decades. A restructuring of BP would also allow the firm to take a badly crippled brand and give the oil operation a new name -- much as it did when it changed its name from British Petroleum. The second time may be the charm.
RadioShack is one of the oldest retailers in the U.S. It was founded in 1921 and in the early 1960s was purchased by Tandy Corp. The Tandy name was used for some of Radio Shack's retail stores. RadioShack is currently a takeover target. There have been rumors that the company may be taken private via a leveraged buyout or purchased by Best Buy (NYSE: BBY - News), probably for its locations. Best Buy would certainly not keep the RadioShack brand because it is considered downscale and does not have the reputation for quality products and service that Best Buy enjoys. RadioShack has already begun to rebrand itself as "The Shack," an indication that it knows the older brand is a burden.
Zale Corp. was founded in 1924 by the Zale brothers. It was one of the earliest retailers to offer the ability to buy items on credit. By 1980, Zale had revenue of over $1 billion. In 1992, Zale filed for bankruptcy and by the end of that decade, its revenue was $1.3 billion -- about the same as it is today. Zale has been at death's door for some time. Its market value is down to $48 million. The company is trying to turn itself around, but most experts are not convinced. The company recently made the Forbes list for firms with extreme financial risk. In the last quarter, the retailer lost $12 million on revenue of $360 million. Zale is also in a very crowded market that includes retailers as large as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT - News). Golden Gate Capital recently put money into Zale to buy it time. New money may defer the point at which Zale goes under, but it won't prevent it.
Merrill Lynch may have been acquired, but that will not keep it safe. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Banks and other large financial services firms have a habit of buying large retail brokerage houses and then changing their names. Shearson is gone. So is EF Hutton and Prudential. In most cases the parent company wants to put their own names on the door. That is very likely to happen to Merrill Lynch, which was at one point the largest full-service broker in the U.S. Merrill is now owned by Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC - News), and the buyout spawned a number of scandals that kept Merrill's name in the paper for weeks and did a great deal to harm its name with customers. Bank of America will follow a time honored tradition, and Merrill Lynch will become BofA Investment Management.
Kia Motors Corp. is one of the two car brands of Hyundai of South Korea. It has always been a marginal brand. Its stable mate, Hyundai USA, has a reputation for high quality cars like the Sonata and Genesis. Kia sells "low rent" cars and SUV nameplates like the Sorento and Rio. As GM and Ford (NYSE: F - News) have already discovered, it is expensive to maintain multiple brands and storied car names, including Pontiac, Saturn and Mercury, are disappearing. Most Kia cars sell for $14,000 to $25,000. Hyundai has several cars in the same price range. Hyundai's Sonata has quickly become one of the best-selling cars in America, and its Genesis flagship model competes with mid-sized BMWs and Mercedes. The parent company will take a page from several other global car companies and dump its weakest brand.
LONDON — BP is in talks to sell up to $12 billion of assets, including its big stake in Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field in North America, The Sunday Times of London reported.
A sale would be the latest of several steps the beleaguered oil giant is taking to raise money to pay for damages from the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Times said.
BP has entered talks with American rival Apache Corp., which approached the British company, the Times said. Negotiations are under way over the structure of the agreement and what other assets could be included, it said.
Houston, Texas-based Apache describes itself as an independent energy company in exploration and development of natural gas and crude oil. The firm operates in the United States, Canada, Egypt, Australia, North Sea and Argentina. Apache is worth $30 billion and is one of America's largest independent oil groups, according to Reuters. Apache reported first-quarter earnings of $705 million on revenue of $2.7 billion. Its shares closed Friday up 48 cents at $87.88.
Word of the BP talks comes as the company is trying to install a tighter seal over the leaking Gulf well, which has been pouring oil since a blowout in April, the Times said. A relief well that may close it off could be complete before the end of the month.
The Times said good news from the Gulf coupled with BP's depressed stock price could tempt rivals to consider bids.
The cash will help to reassure investors that the cost of the cleanup will not overwhelm the company, the Times said. Goldman Sachs, the American investment bank, thinks BP could ultimately be forced to pay $70 billion in cleanup and compensation costs.
Getting a stake in Prudhoe Bay would be a coup for Apache, the Times said. It is one of the largest oil fields discovered and one of BP’s prize assets. It produces 390,000 barrels a day, equivalent to 15 percent of the United Kingdom's North Sea output.
BP’s partners in the field, Exxon and Conoco Philips, are likely to have pre-emption rights that would allow them to match any offer made by Apache, the Times said.
The plot continues to thicken at Germany’s constitutional court, a body with power of life or death over Europe’s monetary union.
Contrary to general belief, Germany’s eurosceptic professors have not abandoned their legal efforts to block the EU rescues for European banks exposed to Greek debt, and since May 7 for banks exposed to debt from Spain, Portugal, and Ireland as well.
Should they succeed, of course, the eurozone risks disintegration within days, and perhaps hours. I am not sure that investors in New York, London, Tokyo, Beijing, or indeed Frankfurt quite understand this.
There are now four cases at the court – or Verfassungsgericht – arguing that these disguised bank bail-outs breach multiple clauses of EU treaty law, and therefore breach Germany’s supreme and sovereign Basic Law.
A quintet of professors – Wilhelm Hankel, Wilhelm Nölling, Joachim Starbatty, Karl Albrecht Schachtschneider, and Dieter Spethmann (ex Thyssen CEO) – have just broadened their complaint over the Greek part of the bank rescue to include the new €440bn Stability Facility, which breaks EU law at every turn.
It also covers the European Central Bank’s mass purchase of Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, and Irish bonds from private banks. This enables investors who bought these bonds during the credit bubble in order to boost yield – just as they bought US subprime CDOs to boost yield – to shift the consequences of their own misjudgements onto taxpayers (Hedge funds were already “long” Club Med debt, of course, when the ECB stepped in so they simply make a speculative gain from taxpayers).
It has been widely reported by the German press – which should know better – that the court rejected the original case by the professors. This is untrue. Their request for an immediate injunction to block transfers to Greece was turned down (on the grounds that such a move would be too dangerous). The case is still pending.
In their latest broadside the professors said the rescue fund “self evidently” violates the no-bailout clause of the Lisbon Treaty.
They have seized on comments by France’s Europe minister Pierre Lelouche, who admitted after the summit deal on May 7 that EU leaders had carried out a constitutional coup. “It is expressly forbidden in the treaties by the famous no-bailout clause. De facto, we have changed the treaty,” he said.
The quintet said the methods used to ram the EU rescue through the Bundestag were a “putschist” threat to German democracy. “This path is leading Germany to ruin,” they said in the Frankfurter Allgemeine.
The citizens were not informed as the €440bn Stability fund was created. The opaque nature of the negotiations in Brussels left it unclear who was driving the policy, and for exactly what purpose. A SIV (structured investment vehicle) had been created in Luxembourg to raise money and operate the fund. “Yet when the Bundestag adopted this aid plan not a single member of parliament knew what they were voting for.”
“Chancellor Merkel obliged the President to sign this emergency law within hours. He was not able to examine its constitutionality, as he is sworn to do. No government should ever treat a head of state in this fashion, not least on a question of such existential importance.”
The group said the erosion of German state finances “strikes a blow at the constitutional foundations of our state and our society”. It runs contrary to the true spirit of Europe, with its diverse roots and cultures, and “trifles with the future of our children and grandchildren”.
“To fight this is not a return to outdated nationalism. As citizens we have a right to demand that our government abides by its sworn oath to protect the German nation against threats.”
They argue that the “pretended bailout” does nothing to reduce the debts of the countries receiving it. The whole game is designed for creditors. “The funds to Greece are clearly financial transfers since everybody knows that Greece cannot repay its debts.” By the IMF’s own sums, Greece’s public debt will rise from 120pc to 150pc by 2014. “This is economic madness,” said Prof Nölling.
Meanwhile Germany’s Centre for European Politics in Freiburg – a free-market think tank – has joined the fray with a report arguing that the use of €60bn of EU money under Article 122 of the Lisbon Treaty to support the rescue package is illegal. This is a new twist and on the face of it looks unanswerable. Here is the link for German speakers: http://www.cep.eu/startseite/
“It is a complete violation of our constitutional law and the judges at the court will have to say so if a case reaches them, even though they are afraid of the economic consequences,” said the author, Dr Thiemo Jeck.
“The Union shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments, regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of any Member State, without prejudice to mutual financial guarantees for the joint execution of a specific project. A Member State shall not be liable for or assume the commitments of central governments, regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of another Member State, without prejudice to mutual financial guarantees for the joint execution of a specific project.”
This does not necessarily prohibit EU states joining together voluntarily to rescue a country in trouble. However, it is another matter to use EU money itself for this purpose, even if it is possible where “a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond its control”.
Bavarian politician Peter Gauweiler is reportedly planning to amend his separate case at the Verfassungsgericht to include these latest arguments.
I have no idea how the court will respond to all these cases, but those who assert confidently that the judges (usually split 4:4 on EU matters) will throw out the whole do not know either.
This is the court that sent tremors through the EU institutions with its ruling on the Lisbon Treaty in June 2009. The judges read the riot act to the European Court of Justice, a body that scandalously and repeatedly claimed that it has supreme jurisdiction over national law.
The ECJ has no such power. It falsely asserts this claim. The EU is a treaty organization of sovereign states. The states transpose EU rules (not laws) into their own national law.
The Verfassungsgericht stated that the sovereign states are “Masters of the Treaties” and not the other way round. They said national parliaments are the only legitimate fora of democracy, and that the European Parliament is inherently undemocratic. This is correct.
The court constructs a line of defence against any possible infringements of German sovereignty, stating that certain fields “must forever remain under German control” – including, of course, fiscal policy.
In a sense, the Verfassungsericht has become the defender of democratic freedom and liberties for the whole of the European Union since other national courts are largely craven (Though not Ireland’s supreme court) and since the Hegelian ECJ has demonstrated in a series of key cases that it has no respect whatsoever for human rights and acts a mere enforcer of authoritarian power-grabs by the EU’s executive machinery. As such, the ECJ is a dangerous organization.
My guess is that the Verfassungsgericht will spin out these cases for a while, hoping that the immediate crisis will pass. The crisis will not pass because EMU’s North-South split is inherent in the system and cannot be bridged.
At some point the court will find itself forced to rule. It may well deem elements of the rescue to package to be unconstitutional – though not all of it – and order Berlin to go back to the drawing board.
Now, if only mdemaz (Lance?) would stop with his sorry desperation for hot topics on Boxden, then the world would surely be a better place.

With the European Business Aviation Association (EBAA) hosting the first European Cabin Service Conference in Brussels, Belgium this Friday, you may be traveling to this location for the first time. This is a perfect opportunity to learn more about this global destination for any upcoming business aviation trips to the city known as the unofficial capital of the European Union.
Located between France, Germany and the Netherlands, French and Dutch are the two most commonly spoke languages in Belgium. Each region of Belgium has variations in dialects and languages; Brussels is home to a population that mostly speaks French and a minority of Flemish speakers. English is not commonly spoken, so it is best to brush up on your basic French if you plan to spend significant time on the ground.
Brussels is known for being rainy, especially in July and December, but overall the climate is pleasant and mild. Be sure to bring an umbrella since you can find yourself in a rainstorm not matter the season. Peak season starts in spring and lasts through autumn. In-flight catering is available out of Brussels Airport (EBAW) through the Air Culinaire Worldwide Network.
Brussels has countless events planned throughout the entire year. If you are in the city between the end of July and first week of September, you have the opportunity to tour the Royal Palace of Brussels while the royal family is on holiday.
If you love exploring culture and history, Brussels will keep your calendar full with over 80 museums to visit. During the latter half of September, museums are open late, making it possible to visit about half a dozen museums each day. Some of the most popular museum in Brussels are the BELvue, Musee Horta, Maison du Roi, Musees Royaux des Beaux Arts and Le Cinquantenaire.
No trip to Belgium is complete without sampling some of the country’s famous chocolates. Pierre Marcoline, Frederic Blondeel and Mary are just a few local favorites. While Belgium is world-renown for chocolates, beer, fries and waffles, they have many unique local specialties worth trying. “Moules-frites” (French) / “Mosselen-friet” (Dutch) is a dish that pairs mussels with fries, and is one of the country’s national dishes. The second national dish is “carbonade flamande” (French) / “Stoverij” (Dutch), a stew that is very similar to beef bourguignon. Another interesting savory dish to try is “Pêches au thon” (French) / “Perziken met tonijn” (Dutch), halved peaches stuffed with tuna salad.
Backup Baltimore Blast goalkeeper Hank Henry showed his youthful exuberance yesterday when he said, "I'm thinking about the playoff money."
Henry, 26, never has made much more than $20,000 for playing a season in the Major Soccer League. He rents a room from teammates Domenic Mobilio and Joe Barger, who recently bought a home in the Towson area.
"We get some playoff money," said Blast defender Mike Reynolds. "But it is so minimal that it's not even worth mentioning. If that's all anybody's playing for, it's not the right reason. The pride of being a champion means much more than that little bit of money."
If the Blast went to the MSL championship, each player on the team would receive only approximately $3,335.
Advancing past the first round would guarantee each player approximately $1,800, and being eliminated in the first round would bring in $665 a player.
"Getting $665 for making the playoffs is not much motivation," said Vaudreuil. "To me, being a fairly new player who was hurt last year and missed the playoffs, it's more important to help get the team over the final hump and into the playoffs."
The third-place Blast (20-30) leads the fourth-place Wichita Wings (19-31) by one game with two left in the battle for the final MSL Eastern Division playoff berth entering tonight's 8:05 game against the Dallas Sidekicks at the Baltimore Arena.
Wichita meets the first-place Cleveland Crunch tonight at 8:35 in Wichita. A Baltimore win and a Wichita loss would clinch a playoff spot for the Blast.
Baltimore finishes its season tomorrow night against Cleveland at Richfield Coliseum, and Wichita completes its regular-season Sunday at 3:35 with a game against the St. Louis Storm in Wichita.
Wittman (sore left knee) will miss the final two games of the regular season and attempt to come back next Friday night if the Blast makes the playoffs.
It's Fan Appreciation Night tonight in the final regular-season home game, with the featured attraction being the "Famous Chicken," Ted Giannoulas, formerly known as the San Diego Chicken.
Approximate figures from total playoff pool of $200,000, based on last year's playoff pool of $180,000:
* Dallas received $5,000 more than Kansas City last year because the Sidekicks won the regular-season Western division title.
Kathryne H. "Kitty" Broady, a gospel radio show host who was active in community affairs, died at her home last Thursday in a fire that police say was deliberately set. She was 76 and lived in the 3700 block of Liberty Heights Ave.
For the past three years, she had an afternoon show on WBGR-AM. Earlier in her more than 25 years in the Baltimore area, she broadcast gospel shows on WEBB and WCBM in Baltimore and WANN in Annapolis.
She also took up causes on the air, once sponsoring a benefit to feed the hungry in the late 1960s, a time when she also helped to expose problems at Baltimore City Jail through letters sent by prisoners in her listening audience. She continued her interest by doing volunteer work with the prisoners.
She was a founder of the Provident Hospital Community Mental Health Clinic and served as president of the Baltimore Black United Front.
The former Kathryne Holdman was a native of Greensboro, N.C., who was raised in Washington and graduated from Armstrong High School.
Before coming to Baltimore, she and her former husband, Robert Broady Sr., who lives in Washington, operated the K & B Upholstery Co.
Her survivors include two sons, Robert Broady Jr. of Baltimore and Stewart Guy Broady of Oxon Hill; a sister, Beatrice Turnborough of Chicago; five grandchildren; and a great-grandson.
Bay pact targeting rivers and grasses expected this week Critics complain new effort merely skims the surface
The effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay will expand to include cleaning up the bay's rivers and restoring its underwater grasses when region officials meet Wednesday in Annapolis.
Officials from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, the District of Columbia and the federal government plan to sign a seven-point agreement that calls for restoring water quality in the bay's 10 major tributaries, where most of the estuary's fish feed and spawn. A draft of the agreement was obtained by The Sun.
Officials also will pledge to restore the bay's underwater grasses, vital fish habitat which have been slowly returning since they all but vanished in the early 1980s. The proposed pact calls for practically doubling current grass beds to 120,000 acres by the end of the decade.
But environmentalists and some legislators complain that the new agreement, which builds on the Chesapeake Bay Agreement -- the bay cleanup pact signed in Baltimore in 1987 -- does not go far enough.
The cornerstone of that agreement was a pledge to cut nutrient pollution from sewage plants, farms and development 40 percent by the end of this decade. But environmen
talists contend that despite some progress, the states are not doing enough to combat farm and toxic pollution and suburban sprawl, all part of the original Bay agreement.
"If we don't address these issues, then we don't think we're going to make the kind of progress that is necessary to restore the bay," said Ann Powers, vice president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
The Annapolis-based environmental group recently wrote a letter the governors of the three bay states, criticizing the proposed pact. Foundation officials plan to release the letter today .
State Sen. Bernie Fowler, D-Southern Maryland, said the proposed agreement is "a very forward move" but "it isn't quite all we hoped for." Mr. Fowler is chairman of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which represents legislators from the three bay states.
An aide to Gov. William Donald Schaefer said yesterday that such criticisms are off base. The new plan focuses only on curbing the bay's nutrient pollution because the states agreed five years ago to take another look at that problem at this time, said David Carroll, the governor's bay program coordinator.
Though not detailed in this agreement, plans are being drawn up deal more aggressively with farm and toxic pollution, Mr. Carroll said.
The bay suffers from an over-enrichment of nutrients, which can trigger massive algae "blooms." Those thick growths of tiny aquatic plants block sunlight needed by underwater grasses. And when the algae die, their decay uses up all the dissolved bTC oxygen in the water that fish need to breathe.
A three-year study, aided by a sophisticated computer model, indicates that if the states stick to their goal of reducing nutrients by 40 percent, the vast area of "dead" water on the bay bottom in spring and summer will shrink between 20 percent and percent. That should be enough to restore many bay grasses and bring back the fish, officials said.
Levels of one major nutrient, phosphorus, have dropped 19 percent in the bay since the mid-1980s, mainly because of improved sewage treatment and phosphate detergent bans. But despite control efforts, nitrogen from fertilizer, farm animal waste and air pollution has risen 2 percent.
Now, in recognition of the importance of the bay's tributaries, officials plan to clean them up enough so they can sustain underwater grasses and fish again. The new agreement pledges to draw up recovery plans for each of the 10 major river systems in the next year.
The governors also plan to commit to holding nutrient pollution down beyond the end of the decade, despite future growth in population and development, said William Matuszeski, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's bay program.
Even environmentalists agree that the pact is a major improvement in the $400-million-a-year bay restoration effort. They also hail the commitment to restore underwater grasses, since reviving the bay's depleted fish and shellfish stocks are the ultimate goal.
But several studies have warned that the bay may never recover its health unless more is done to curb runoff of nutrient-rich fertilizers and animal wastes from farm fields and suburban lawns.
Farms account for nearly 40 percent of the phosphorus entering the bay and more than half the nitrogen, according to the EPA. Yet only about 5 percent of all cropland in the bay's vast 64,000-square-mile drainage basin is now covered by voluntary plans for curbing use and runoff of the damaging nutrients.
"Agriculture is going to have to do more," said state Sen. Gerald W. Winegrad, D-Anne Arundel, who unsuccessfully sponsored a bill this year to require farms to curb fertilizer and pesticide use.
Others say more aggressive action is needed to curb air pollution, sprawling development and the runoff of mud, nutrients and toxic chemicals from city and suburban streets.
There is a chance that the proposed pact may be revised to address environmentalists' concerns when the governors and EPA Administrator William K. Reilly meet Wednesday. But some issues may have to wait until next year. Mr. Carroll noted that a review of toxic pollution efforts is not yet finished.
But "the time to act is now," contended Ms. Powers of the bay foundation. "Every year we wait, the problems we have to deal with are going to grow."
New Baltimore-Washington jobs program for teens sails to success Teens from each city build rowboats, sail Chesapeake for 4 days.
It was blustery, chilly and wet as the four-day voyage from Baltimore's Inner Harbor by way of the Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland ended yesterday evening at a marina in Southwest Washington.
They were met by balloons, flags, music, refreshments, presentations of awards and gifts, cheering parents, friends and sponsors, and a parade of government officials at the microphone, led by Mayors Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore and Sharon Pratt Kelly of Washington.
The mayors said the event marked a historic partnership by their two cities. Each praised the summer job-training program of Baltimore's Living Classrooms Foundation, including its sailing experience for young landlubbers.
But it fell to Willie Fedd, a 17-year-old resident of an East Baltimore housing project, to provide the eloquent high point of the oratory.
"Mayor Kelly, Mayor Schmoke -- thank you for believing in us," the Southern High 11th-grader said simply. Then, speaking for his 39 fellow crew members who had just helped dock the Lady Maryland and the Mildred Belle, he told the mayors, "We hope you are proud of us."
James Piper Bond, executive director of the Living Classrooms Foundation, which until recently was known as the Lady Maryland Foundation, presided at last night's festivities under umbrellas and canopies at the Gangplank Marina on Washington's Water Street.
"It is successes like this that people need to read about," Mr. Bond told the crowd, referring to "all the tragic news from our inner-cities."
His remark won a burst of applause from parents of the new graduates of the six-week summer program, described as "at-risk youth from diverse backgrounds."
None of the parents who watched the arrival of the foundation's 104-foot sailing vessel, the Lady Maryland, and its 60-foot Chesapeake Bay work boat, the Mildred Belle, was more excited than Margaret Jones Phifer of Washington. When she finally spied her 15-year-old son, Demetri, aboard the Mildred Belle, she exclaimed: "He's my baby. I just want to hug him."
Mrs. Phifer could not say enough in praise of the sailing experience her son was getting. Demetri called her on one of the stops during the four-day cruise of the bay, "right after a storm," ,, she said. "I was praying. But he was having a ball, despite his 90 mosquito bites."
Demetri said one of the 10 girls among the 40 teens on the two vessels got seasick, and he "almost did."
They received diplomas for successfully finishing the training that began July 6 and included building two rowboats and working on the foundation's Harford County farm. Their last four days on the bay took them to Tilghman Island, St. Mary's City in Southern Maryland and Smallwood State Park in Prince George's County.
The programs of the tax-exempt, nonprofit foundation, headquartered in an old lighthouse in Baltimore's Inner Harbor, emphasize leadership, career development, cultural enrichment and the history, economics and ecology of the bay region.
It has a staff of 25, including several who were themselves once "at-risk students," and an annual budget of about $750,000. In the foundation's seven years, about 100,000 young people from a variety of backgrounds have benefited from the programs, Mr. Bond said.
G. Dennis O'Brien of St. Michaels, the 52-year-old retired businessman who started the foundation, said its most rewarding successes have been with "troubled kids with lots of energy, lots of nerve and usually with a lot of talent, but not necessarily in traditional ways." He said the guidance is low-key and "the morality for these kids just comes from being part of the good, secure family" provided by the foundation.
Standing on the Lady Maryland, out of the rain, Mayor Schmoke said the just-concluded program "cemented good relations among young people and showed that our governments can work together."
The two mayors exchanged presents -- picture books about their respective cities -- as well as words of praise for each other.
Then, Mayor Kelly produced a second gift for Mayor Schmoke. It was a T-shirt bearing the inscription, "Got a Job."
What a difference a year makes -- but not quite enough difference for Loch Raven's No. 2 girls lacrosse team.
After playing scared against No. 1 Mount Hebron last year in the Class 1A-2A state title game, the Raiders came out challenging the Vikings yesterday. But the Raiders rushed too many shots and forced too many passes to knock the Vikings from their lofty pedestal.
Howard County champion Mount Hebron (18-0) took a 9-7 victory for its second consecutive Class 1A-2A championship and second straight unbeaten season.
The Raiders (17-1) started preparing for Mount Hebron three months ago, but yesterday they couldn't put together the whole package needed to upset the Vikings.
Although they played excellent defense against the Vikings' high-scoring homes Cathy Nelson and Lori Pasquantonio, the Raiders couldn't get their offense rolling. Too often they missed the connections in the midfield, upsetting their usually fluid transition game.
"The defense started bringing the ball out and we threw it away or the attack didn't catch the ball and it came right back down our throats," said Raiders coach Wendy Galinn.
Defenders Christina Bhanos and Robyn Disney did a good job preventing Nelson and Pasquantonio from rolling the crease. Bhanos took an early charge from Pasquantonio and also blocked a shot.
The few defensive mistakes, however, were costly. Nelson scored the first two goals on free-position shots caused by Loch Raven shooting-space fouls.
"We pretty much knew how they played and they liked to go one-on-one," said Disney. "Hardly ever did they beat us [rolling around the crease]. Most of their shots were free shots, because we made too many errors like shooting space."
Nelson added another goal coming around and diving past Raiders point Alison Jones. Amy Fine made it 4-0, capping an interception by running half the field to score.
The Raiders finally got on the board when Jones hit Lauren Volk with a pass out of the defensive end. Volk ran in to slip a bounced shot past Vikings keeper Ali True.
The rest of the half the Raiders answered each Mount Hebron goal to stay within 6-3 at halftime. Robyn Harry scored on a low scoop shot, and Michele DeJuliis also put a nice back-handed effort past True.
In the second half, the Raiders pulled within two when Shelley Klaes fed Heather Kormanik, who popped the ball over the charging True's head.
Although the Raiders outshot the Vikings 22-9 in the half, they couldn't get closer than two. True made 14 saves, including a couple of nice stops against free-position shots. She finished with 18 saves.
"She stuffed us," said Galinn. "I give her a lot of credit, but I also attribute it to poor shot selection."
Klaes scored two goals -- one on a free position and another rolling the crease -- to keep the Raiders within 9-6 with 8:25 left in the game.
"I think we panicked to a point," said Galinn. "We were much more prepared for this game than we were last year. Last year, I said before the game I knew we weren't going to do well, but this year, the kids played with a lot of heart. They never gave up."
A day after American Online Inc. announced its bid to buy Time Warner Inc., the chief executives of the two companies publicly campaigned in support of the deal yesterday, saying it would bring broad social benefits.
Policy-makers expressed concern about whether the biggest corporate acquisition in history would be in the country's best social and economic interests, while skeptical investors sent the stocks of both companies into sharp declines.
"This is not just about big business. This is not just about money," said Gerald M. Levin, chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner. "This is about making a better world for people, because we now have the technology and the instruments to do that."
Levin's counterpart at AOL, Steve Case, said on NBC's "Today" show: "Together we have an unbelievable opportunity to really make a difference, not just in terms of the services people use, but also in terms of the kind of impact we can have on society."
The $179.1 billion deal, unveiled Monday, would create a company with unparalleled Internet and media assets. AOL is the largest Internet access company, and Time Warner owns CNN, Time magazine and a galaxy of other well-known news and entertainment entities.
That immensity gives some policy-makers and industry experts pause. The AOL-Time Warner marriage would continue a long trend of media consolidation and raises the prospect of a single company with unequaled power over what Americans read and watch.
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said in a statement that the acquisition "may make strategic sense" for the companies involved, but "at some point, all of this concentration and convergence has implications for consumers because it will minimize competition and choice, giving us fewer voices and fewer pipelines in the marketplace."
Two of Leahy's colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Republican Mike DeWine of Ohio and Democrat Herb Kohl of Wisconsin -- said they plan to conduct hearings on the acquisition.
Senate staff members said the hearings would probably be held before the lawmakers' spring recess in late April but that the timing would depend on when Case and Levin could appear together in Washington.
One of the chief concerns raised by the AOL-Time Warner deal involves Internet access. The telephone and cable TV companies that carry Internet traffic are scrambling to offer high-speed connections that greatly improve the quality of Internet transmissions. In the past, AOL has been concerned that those phone and cable companies, such as AT&T Corp., would seek to control Internet access on those networks and bar competing Internet service providers.
AOL has advocated open access, saying it had no high-speed wires of its own and depended on access to other companies' networks.
The acquisition of Time Warner would change that. Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable company, and AOL would gain access to those high-speed communications lines. With that bounty in hand, AOL might be tempted to give up its open-access crusade and seek to dominate Internet access on Time Warner's cable systems.
Mark Cooper, research director of the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America, said open Internet access becomes especially important in a market in which two companies, AT&T and Time Warner, own such a large share of the nation's high-speed cable networks.
"They monopolize all the cable wires. They dominate all the [cable television] programming. Their wires don't even overlap, because they don't compete with each other," Cooper said.
Other opponents of the deal said it would mark another long step in the march toward media consolidation.
In recent years, U.S. magazines, newspapers, television networks, book publishers, movie studios, Internet service providers and other industry organizations have increasingly come under the control of a small number of large corporations. The Sun, for example, is owned by Times Mirror Co., a nationwide newspaper chain based in Los Angeles.
Some industry experts say the trend has ensured the survival and even the improvement of many broadcast and print outlets. Critics say it has contributed to a decline in the quality and variety of news sources.
"The defenders of deals like this one will claim exultantly that we now have three 24-hour news operations on cable. Well, fine. I challenge anyone to watch those channels and tell me what the difference is" between them, said Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at New York University.
Miller said the growth and diversification of large media companies will make it more difficult for journalists to cover the activities of high-technology businesses owned by or affiliated with their parent companies.
The International Federation of Journalists warned yesterday that the AOL-Time Warner deal could "threaten democracy, plurality and quality in media."
A Baltimore County school bus driver and an attendant were suspended from their jobs for five days without pay yesterday, a day after a 3-year-old boy was left alone on a bus in a storage yard for about four hours.
The driver, Louise N. McLean, 57, of Glen Arm and the attendant, Elisabeth Linde, 64, of Perry Hall apparently failed to complete a search of the bus Tuesday, leaving 3-year-old Malik S. Lucas alone in a locked bus at a gated yard near Kenwood High School in eastern Baltimore County, said Rita Fromm, director of transportation for the school system.
Fromm interviewed McLean and Linde yesterday. The five-day suspension is standard punishment for failing to check a bus for students or possessions at the end of a trip, she said.
Baltimore County police have turned over investigation of the incident to the county Department of Social Services.
Malik's mother, Nicole T. Lucas of the Hillendale area, said she became worried Tuesday when her son failed to return home from his pre-kindergarten classes at the Halstead Academy elementary school near Hillendale. Malik has a speech impediment that makes it difficult for him to communicate, she said.
Lucas sent the boy's father, Ben T. Wilkins, to Halstead to look for Malik. School administrators told Wilkins that Malik had not come to school.
Yesterday, Malik seemed to be doing fine. He attended classes at Halstead but refused to ride the bus, said Lucas, adding that she no longer trusts school bus drivers. "I am very angry," she said.

The Federal Reserve policy-makers cut a key interest rate yesterday for the ninth time this year - sending it to a 39-year low - and signaled that it was prepared to move again as it fights an economic malaise that has deepened since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee cut the overnight lending rate - what banks charge one another for overnight loans - to 2.5 percent, matching its lowest level ever set in May 1962.
"The terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy that was already weak," the Fed said in announcing the rate cut.
And though the nation's long-term economic prospects are good, the Fed said near-term risks "are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."
The half-point cut was widely expected, prompting a positive - but not dramatic - reaction in the stock market.
"Everyone and his shoeshine boy knew it would be" a half-point, said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 113.76 points, or 1.29 percent, to close at 8,950.59. The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.87, or 0.80 percent, to end at 1,492.33. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.27 billion shares.
Major banks, including Bank of America Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank One Corp., announced that they were cutting their prime lending rate - what they charge their best customers - by half a point to 5.5 percent. The prime rate affects commercial loans as well as some consumer borrowing, such as credit cards and home-equity credit lines.
While the U.S. economy was sagging before Sept. 11, the attacks have further eroded consumer confidence and pushed down consumer spending - which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
In fact, although statistics don't yet show it, many economists believe the economy has soured so deeply and quickly that it's almost certainly entrenched in its first recession since 1990-1991.
"This is a Fed that's no longer hedging against a recession - they are fighting a real recession," albeit one that was event-triggered, said Diane Swonk, chief economist with Bank One Corp. in Chicago.
A recession is typically defined as two consecutive quarters of a contracting economy. Because economic reports tend to lag, recessions are often labeled well after they've ended.
With the near-term prospects so dour, many economists say the central bank's rate-cutting campaign still has room to run. Before yesterday, the Fed had already cut rates by 3.5 percentage points this year. In normal times, such strong moves would give the central bank time to step back and give its actions time to work.
"The economy is limping along. We are probably in a recession," said Gus Faucher, senior economist with Economy.com in West Chester, Pa. "There is a feeling that both the Fed and the federal government need to take action to provide further stimulus."
Although it can take six to 18 months for a rate cut to work its way through the economy, the Fed is expected to pare rates again at its next meeting, in November.
Opinions again differ on just how aggressively the central bank will act. Futures traders were betting yesterday on a quarter-point reduction no later than the Fed's Dec. 11 meeting, taking the overnight lending rate to 2.25 percent. But many economists said yesterday that short-term rates must fall to 2 percent.
The Bush administration's tax cut and rebate program is putting hundreds of extra dollars into the hands of most American taxpayers. And Congress is allocating tens of billions of dollars for reconstruction, domestic security and possible military action. Most analysts expect federal spending to rise, too.
One picture shows Clarissa as a first-grader, her pigtails hanging in several directions and a huge smile spreading across her face. The other shows her this summer - at age 17 - looking intently at her young son, cradled in her arms, connected to life through tubes jutting from his body.
She even dreamed of becoming a nurse to better care for 13-month-old Tyquan, who has been treated for heart problems most of his life. But her hopes ended suddenly about 12:20 a.m. yesterday while she was taking down Christmas lights from her porch in East Baltimore, police said.
Shot during an apparent robbery attempt, the mother of two became the city's first homicide of the year.
She was talking to someone relatives described as a casual acquaintance, Darnell Chambers, 26, when a man walked up to the house in the 2900 block of E. Madison St. and pulled out a gun, police said. The gunman, clad in a puffy black coat and wearing a skullcap, told the two to sit down on the steps, police said.
Clarissa panicked and ran toward the front door of the rowhouse, where she lived with her mother, police said.
The gunman opened fire, hitting Clarissa in the back of the head and Chambers in the left forearm, police said. Both were rushed to Johns Hopkins Hospital, about a mile away, where Clarissa died and Chambers was treated and released.
In just a few days, Clarissa was scheduled to meet with doctors at Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital, where Tyquan has been treated for the past few months, to see when she might take her son home, relatives said.
"She has been learning how to care for him," said Clarissa's grandmother, Beverly Chase. "She was really excited about it because he's been sick for so long. We didn't think he was going to live this long. She was really excited after what we all went through."
Born and raised in Baltimore, Clarissa most recently attended the city's Paquin School for pregnant girls but withdrew in late 2000, school officials said.
Her sick son took too much of her time to attend school, relatives said, and the birth of her second child, a daughter she named Jada, four months ago had consumed even more.
Clarissa had never been a fan of school but was known as a "jolly" kid who loved music and dancing. She also wasn't afraid to buck the rules, family members said.
Several winters ago, Chase walked with Clarissa every morning to a Mass Transit Administration bus stop for the ride to Patterson Park High School. Chase would wait, make sure Clarissa got on the bus and then leave.
Clarissa's carefree spirit waned after she became pregnant with Tyquan and, especially, after his birth.
He was born two months premature and had severe heart problems, requiring constant hospitalization and surgery, relatives said.
But Clarissa pressed on, visiting Tyquan almost every day at hospitals and slowly gaining an appreciation for nursing.
Then, in August, Clarissa gave birth to Jada and began feeling better - once again resembling the smiling youngster in her first-grade photograph.
"That photo shows it all," Chase said. "That's what she was like. ... Jada brought back to her life what she missed with her first child."
Clarissa's room was messy, like the typical teen-ager's. But clothes strewn across the floor and bed were not just her own - they were infant garments.
Clarissa also made two small notes of Baltimore's violence - taping two funeral programs of friends onto her mirror. Both were killed in East Baltimore in the past two years.
Family members said they had called police and city officials in the months leading up to the shooting to complain about drug dealing across the street and crime in the area.
"Someone had to get killed before they do anything about it," Chase said. "I hope three, four, five more don't have to die."
The Eastern District is one of the city's most dangerous, though violent crime has plummeted there in the past two years by 25 percent. Last year, 38 people were killed, and 145 were shot.
Anyone with information about the killing is urged to call Detective Darren Sanders of the homicide unit at 410-396-2100.
Fan, some wags have reminded us, is short for fanatic. As in "a zeal or passion which goes beyond that which is reasonable," according to the dictionary definition.
Add to the latest act of fanaticism the stupidity of one idiot attending Tuesday's Lake Clifton-Douglass basketball game, who threw a can of soda on the floor just as Douglass' Ducks were smoking Lake Clifton's Lakers and about to hand them their butts.
Douglass was leading by 12 points in the third quarter when the incident occurred. The game was stopped and postponed until a later date. Not exactly fair to Douglass' team, was it?
Douglass is, as of this writing, undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the Baltimore area. The Ducks have two tough games against top-notch Philadelphia schools this weekend. Suppose one of Douglass' key players gets hurt and is not available for the resumption of the Lake Clifton game. In that case, the postponement would have worked to the advantage of Lake Clifton, the school that didn't provide enough security to prevent the can-throwing incident.
There are no doubt many old-school West Baltimoreans - who remember classic battles past pitting Douglass or Carver against East Baltimore's pride Dunbar - who ask, "Why wasn't Lake Clifton forced to forfeit the game?"
Bill Burroughs is Maryland's rules interpreter for high school basketball. The game officials had a number of options, Burroughs said.
There would have been problems with that, of course. Since no one knew who threw the soda can, the refs might have ended up penalizing the wrong team.
"In most cases, officials are recommended to suspend the game until cooler heads prevail," Burroughs said.
Douglass was on a 17-2 run when the game was stopped. Basketball has a certain rhythm and poetry. "Runs" occur when a team gets in a certain rhythm and outscores its opponents. Runs are hard to duplicate, especially days later.
I'm sure Douglass' fans and alumni would have appreciated the option of "clear the gym, finish the game."
Game officials and school administrators did the choosing, but they still face a dilemma: how to deter such acts in the future. Fortunately, there's a precedent, one stemming from an incident anything but fortunate.
Let's go back almost 31 years. It's February 1971. Dunbar is playing a home game against Mount St. Joseph in a Maryland Scholastic Association A Conference Division II game to see which team will advance to the best-of-three championship series against Carver.
St. Joe is leading by 2 points with seven seconds left in overtime of a thriller when one of its players, Gary Jones, tries to inbound the ball. He's scratched and kicked by fan(atic)s, and officials delay the game five minutes.
After St. Joe inbounds the ball, the Gaels run out the clock. Several Dunbar fan(atic)s surge onto the court and attack St. Joe's players. Dunbar players and police officers try to protect them.
St. Joe faculty, staff and students in the stands aren't as lucky. The principal is hit over the head with a stool, and a teacher is hit in the eye. When the melee ends, three police officers and nine St. Joe players, students or teachers have been injured.
Forty-four days later, the MSA, in its first punitive action, puts Dunbar on probation. For the 1971-1972 basketball season, Dunbar will have no home games. All of its contests will be on the road.
In 31 years, no such incident has been repeated at Dunbar. When the Poets lost at home to Catholic League power Spalding this season, Dunbar fans took it in stride. The lesson from 1971 had been learned.
But not, apparently, by the can-throwing cretin who attended the Lake Clifton-Douglass game. Whether the dolt was a Lake Clifton or Douglass fan, he or she had better consider how the actions of fan(atic)s sometimes hurt the teams they're rooting for.
Because of a few hoodlums, Dunbar students in 1971-1972 who had nothing to do with the riot had to travel to Douglass or Carver or Edmondson not once, but twice during the season.
A different but not unrelated outcome has resulted from the stupidity at the Lake Clifton-Douglass game. Jessica Ivy, a spokeswoman for the city schools athletic office, said the game will resume Friday at Lake Clifton.
Tim Toone, aka Mr. Irrelevant XXXV, is in town for three days. The arrival party for Toone is at 5 p.m. today in the atrium of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa.
Toone will receive gifts and mingle with fans. The event is free, so if you root for the Detroit Lions, which drafted Toone with the 255th pick, you have a reason to cheer before the actual NFL season.
An hour later, Toone is off to the All-Star Lowsman Banquet, where the wide receiver will catch grief for having blond dreadlocks. Toone will be toasted and roasted by former NFL greats, Ron Yary and Ron Mix, and coaches like John Robinson and UCLA's Norm Chow. Tickets are still available for the banquet because Toone is not a household name yet in the NFL.
On Thursday, Toone is heading to Disneyland to donate some hair to Dopey of the Seven Dwarfs. He'll also be a special guest at Toontown. In the evening, Toone will be part of a regatta and guest of the Balboa Bay Yacht Club.
Friday is Toone's final day. He visits the Goodwill Fitness Center in Santa Ana before giving his first national interview. Toone expects to talk with the NFL Network's Rich Eisen, who of course will fall in love with Toone's hair because Eisen is losing his.
The day ends with Toone attending a Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim game. The baseball team will give him a jersey with his name on the back of it and a tryout with the grounds crew. That might be the team Toone has a better chance of making than the one in Detroit.
The preliminary approval of mandatory ID badges for county teachers by our Board of Education raises one question: To whom are the teachers identifying themselves by wearing such identification? The kids know the teachers.
I know that in some county schools the principal is rarely ever at the school, but the administrators should know who teaches in the building. I would guess that perhaps the ID badges are to help Theresa Flak or Herman Bartlett identify the teachers, except they are never in any of the schools.
Before the board in its typical style-over-substance philosophy adopts this expensive and seemingly useless policy, the obvious question as to the proposal's purpose ought to be answered.
In regards to the offense to the Blessed Virgin Mary recently at an art museum in a major city I would like to make some comments about this wondrous woman:
Mary was the young Jewish virgin, chosen by God the father to be the mother of his son Jesus Christ, adding her humanity to his divinity. Her yes to God was the most important event ever to happen to this world because it meant our salvation by her son Jesus coming to us. Her generosity allowed Jesus to save us, and it's becoming more and more apparent that this world needs a savior.
Mary was with Jesus all of his life, from his birth in a poor stable to the flight to Egypt on a donkey while escaping Herod's jealous rage. She was at the marriage feast at Cana asking her son Jesus to remedy the problem of their running out of wine. This was Jesus' first miracle, changing water into wine. She told the servers "Do whatever he tells you." She was at the foot of his cross at his cruel death, for us. It should never be forgotten that his blood washes away our sins.
Mother Mary still comes today in many places around the world, such as Felina Lourdes, Garadandal, Dazule, Akita, Batania, Kibeho, Ukraine, Medjugorje and many more.
Her message is still the same - prayer, fasting, repentance and reconciliation. He request for our prayers is always so urgent because she knows this is our lifeline to God who is the only one who can change situations including calamities of weather.
The Blessed Virgin Mary is God's greatest gift to the world, second only to his son Jesus and the pouring out of herself for us should always be remembered with gratitude as something so very extraordinary.
Criticism and applause surrounds the "Hell House," a Halloween "soul-tickler" directly sponsored by three or four area churches and supported by many others. Designed and created to nudge people out of Satan's den and into the realm of God, this rendition of religion is troubling and deserves a response.
"Hell House" bids the question, "What is a healthy faith?" Jesus spoke to the holders of an unhealthy religion saying, "You cross land and seek to make a convert and when you make a convert, the person is twice the child of hell that you yourselves are." (St. Matthew 23:15). Scaring people out of a particular hell may indeed be casting them into another hell. I once knew a man who was so convinced he was eternally doomed that he spent weeks reading the Bible and then suffered a nervous breakdown.
I must question all religious efforts that are about scaring people "out of hell," and dividing people up into good guys/bad guys, as if any of us fully know the heart of God. I oppose this subtle focusing on gay and AIDS-riddled people as societal contaminants and persons who are beyond the bounds of God's grace and love as they are.
I know the pastors of two of the sponsoring churches of "Hell House" and they are good and God-fearing ministers. I do oppose their emphasis, however, which is more about a "God of vengeance" and less about a caring, compassionate and forgiving God.
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Rookie Phil Lombardi broke open a close game with a two-run single in the seventh inning Tuesday night to lead the New York Yankees to a 4-0 Grapefruit League victory over the Toronto Blue Jays.
Lombardi, a 23-year-old from Kennedy High in Granada Hills, is ticketed for the Yankees' Triple-A farm club at Columbus this season. He lined his two-run single to left after Toronto left-hander Stan Clarke had walked the bases loaded.
The quintet of Phil Niekro, Marty Bystrom, Dennis Rasmussen, Mike Armstrong and Dave Righetti combined on a six hitter. After three Grapefruit League games, Yankee pitchers have allowed only four runs.
The game also marked the spring debuts of Yankee outfielders Dave Winfield, Rickey Henderson and Ken Griffey.
On a night when actresses will be draped in diamonds, Amnesty International USA and Global Witness have asked artists and filmmakers to wear a red teardrop pin to the Academy Awards to raise awareness about diamonds mined in war zones and their effect on child soldiers.
The groups said that Oscar nominees Leonardo DiCaprio, Ryan Gosling and Djimon Hounsou and other members of the "Blood Diamond" cast would be wearing the symbols.
"Ours is a very modest gesture but one that affirms the message that all human life is precious," said Bonnie Abaunza, director of Amnesty International USA's Artists for Amnesty program. "Diamonds are not priceless -- human life is."
Federal investigators say one of Medicare's most wanted fugitives, who was convicted in a $20-million fraud case, may be hiding out in the Los Angeles area.
Authorities say Nuritsa Grigoryan fled last month after being found guilty for her role at a Glendale clinic where she was accused of posing as a doctor and writing prescriptions for pricey anti-psychotic medications.
Investigators with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say the clinic often recruited homeless patients, used their information to bill Medicare and Medi-Cal for the drugs, and then resold the medications, such as Abilify, to rake in even more money.
Government officials said the scheme generated fraudulent billing of more than $20 million, and Medicare and Medi-Cal paid roughly $8 million.
Grigoryan was scheduled to be sentenced in June. She faced up to 30 years in prison, according to the government.
But authorities say she hasn’t been seen since Feb. 24. She was being monitored by the court with an ankle bracelet, but she must have disabled or removed it, said Eric Larson, a special agent with the Health and Human Services Department's inspector general.
Larson said that Grigoryan went to the Armenian consulate in Glendale for travel documents before she went missing, so it’s possible that she left the U.S.
But Grigoryan's family is still in the L.A. area as well as her small, white dog that was often seen with her in video surveillance conducted by investigators.
“That was just another thought that she might be close by,” Larson said. “The dog spent a lot of time with her.”
Grigoryan and two associates were convicted on numerous charges, including healthcare fraud conspiracy, making false statements and aggravated identity theft, according to the government.
The scammers were "driving extremely expensive cars and have a nice lifestyle, taking advantage of homeless people on the taxpayers’ dime," Larson said. "They have no intention of giving these people care."
WOULDN'T IT be great if the United States could withdraw its forces from Europe, as has been suggested in the wake of the air strike against Libya and criticism of that strike by European governments? And why not withdraw American forces from the rest of the foreign world?
Are the billions in expenditures each year made out of the kindness of our hearts to protect the people of the world? Or do we prefer to fight our wars on foreign soil?
Might this not be true in West Germany, where the Soviet armies and those of the United States stood facing each other at the end of World War II and are still standing there, now as enemies? Five full U.S. Army divisions are stationed there and another five can be airlifted to Germany within 10 days.
Being the policeman of the world, shaping it in our image whether other nations like it or not, does not come cheap.
Miami loses three recruits -- fullback Darius Frazier from Hallandale, receiver Dale Dawkins from Vero Beach and linebacker Nate Watson from Santaluces in Lantana. They will remain at school and work out with the team. Redshirt freshman Jeff Howard, a defensive tackle, has been declared academically ineligible and has left Miami.
Boone, which had lost 16 in a row, trailed Colonial, 10-3, at halftime. But it seemed as if the Braves (0-8, 0-5) would be spared another loss when the lights failed and officials announced the game would be finished today. Alas, power was restored and Danny Wagner led Colonial (3-5, 2-3) to 14 second-half points and a 24-10 Class AAAAA, District 5 victory.
During Colonial's first drive of the second half, Wagner broke loose for a 69-yard scoring run that gave Colonial a 17-3 lead.
But Boone forced a fumble later in the quarter, which eventually led to Robert Kasper's 1-yard score that reduced Colonial's lead to seven points entering the final period.
But Jeff Johnson and Wagner keyed a 61-yard drive in the fourth quarter that culminated with Wagner's third score -- a 5-yard run.
PINE LAKES — Thirteen-year-old Nickie Pyle's eighth-grade principal wrote a letter to her parents that brought tears of joy to their eyes Tuesday.
The letter said Nickie is so well liked at Eustis Middle School that fellow students raised $241.11 to help her family pay for the medical care of her father, Ernie Pyle, 32, who has a rare form of muscle-based cancer.
''When she came home and showed us the letter,'' said Pyle's wife, Betty Ann, ''my husband and I both just cried. It was so touching.''
A student-teacher benefit volleyball tournament was only one way in which residents of this rural Lake County community of 5,000, 10 miles from the Volusia County border, have responded to raise money to help defray the hospital bills that will cost the Pyle family more than $40,000.
Donations to a special account at Vista Bank in DeLand have reached $1,825.50. An encyclopedia company has donated a full set of books for use by the Pyle's three children -- Nickie, Betty Jo, 10, and Ernie Jr., 5. A benefit chicken dinner Sunday at Chuck's Place, on East State Road 40, attracted nearly 400 people.
''It was a good turnout for a small community,'' said Dot Robb, owner of Chuck's Place. ''We went through 300 pounds of chicken . . . 120 pounds of potato salad. I didn't know we could fit that many people.''
The fund-raising for the Pyles started last month when the 32-year-old mason was scheduled to undergo surgery at Shands Hospital in Gainesville for the removal of his left leg and part of his hip and pelvis.
At the 11th hour, Pyle canceled the surgery and returned home after doctors said there was little they could do to save his life. Since then, doctors have suggested that Pyle might try enrolling in an experimental drug treatment program, Betty Ann Pyle said.
The community is reponding to help Pyle, a partner with two brothers in a masonry business, Mud Brothers, which has no medical insurance.
Even people who don't know the family are helping. A Eustis woman sent them a check for $100 and explained that she and her husband once lived next door to the widow of the famed World War II correspondent, after whom Ernie Pyle was named.
SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Notre Dame is missing from the Associated Press rankings this week for the first time since the end of the 2003-04 seasons -- a total of 30 weekly polls. But the Irish could soon return if Lindsay Schrader and Courtney LaVere continue to play the way they did in a 67-55 Big East women's basketball victory over Syracuse Tuesday. Schrader had a career high 24 points on 9-for-19 shooting plus 6-for-10 at the free throw line -- pretty decent for a 40 percent free throw shooter. She and Crystal Erwin each had eight rebounds, though Notre Dame was outrebounded, 40-35. LaVere scored 14, including the key tie-breaking field goal with 9:05 to play, as Notre Dame moved up to 13-7 overall and 4-5 in the Big East. Syracuse, trying for its third Big East victory in a row after an 0-7 start, instead fell to 2-8 in the league and 9-12 overall. "Schrader was the difference in the game,'' said Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw. "We were desperate. We still have a chance to go to the NCAA tournament and we need to start playing that way. Courtney was very poised and gave us some stability tonight.'' "We didn't have an answer for Schrader,'' said Syracuse coach Keith Cieplicki. The score was tied 11 times and there were eight lead changes. McGraw was stunned at a question about whether the Irish expected a close game. "You haven't seen us play lately; we make it interesting. We struggle every night. Everybody is always in the game against us,'' said McGraw. Sophomore Vaida Sipaviciute, a 6-4 native of Lithuania, was almost more than the Irish could handle. She didn't start, but scored 19 points and had seven rebounds. Several times she hit the bull's-eye on an out of bounds play. LaVere's base-line jumper broke a 48-48 tie and launched the Irish on an 8-0 run. Schrader and LaVere each had field goals and Duffy two free throws in the spurt. Sipaviciute ended the Irish run with a 3-point play with 5:14 to go, but that was the last Orange basket until her last field goal with 47 seconds left. Syracuse had a 27-25 halftime lead, but developed a rash of foul trouble early in the second half after taking a 31-26 lead. Notre Dame was shooting bonus free throws 13:11 to play, and point guard Cintia Johnson fouled out with 4:53 to play. "Johnson really did a good job against Duffy, and her fouling out was a key play for us,'' said McGraw. "I thought they looked a little fatigued after that.'' "She was all over me,'' said Duffy of Johnson. Duffy scored 12 and played without a visit to the bench for the ninth time this season. Schrader admitted her confidence has wavered lately. "I was glad to get some confidence back,'' said Schrader. "Coach has just been telling me to drive the ball and shoot.'' Tracy Harbut had 11 points and freshman Kari Laimbeer (daughter of former Irish player and Detroit WNBA coach Bill Laimbeer) scored five, including a 3-pointer when everybody from Notre Dame seemed to forget she was in the game. The hosts tried to avoid fouling Duffy when the game was on the line, but the others connected often enough to pretty much void the effort. "Notre Dame made the plays when they had to,'' said Cieplicki. "But we are developing a hardness that it takes to win in this league.'' Cieplicki pointed to an instant following a media timeout with 7:50 to play when Johnson missed a layup and her teammates missed three followup shots as a turning point. Notre Dame shot only 12-for-32 in the first half, missing numerous layups, but stepped up to 14-for-26 in the second half. The Irish never hit a 3-point shot, Duffy's 0-for-4 the extent of the Irish effort.
GOSHEN - John Dean Leer, 83, died at 1:58 a.m. Monday in his home. Survivors include a son, Gary of Milford; and a brother, Lamar of Goshen. Services will be at 2 p.m. Thursday in Yoder-Culp Funeral Home, where friends may call from 6 to 8 p.m. Wednesday.
SOUTH BEND - Henry L. Smith Sr., 63, passed away Sunday in St. Joseph Regional Medical Center.

Funeral services will be at 1 p.m. today, August 22, in Alford's Mortuary, where friends may call one hour prior to services.
PLYMOUTH -- The Marshall County Council made it more than halfway to its goal of cutting at least $604,000 from departmental budgets for 2009, before ending hearings Tuesday afternoon. The council slashed more than $455,000 from the general fund before adjourning after two days of hearings. Initial department requests would have pumped up the 2009 county budget to more than $11 million. By the end of the first day of hearings, that was pared down to just more than $10.8 million. Council President Matt Hassel kept the hearings on a fairly tight schedule both days, requiring department heads to outline where proposed expenditures "are most significant." On more than one occasion, council members explained that money would be tight in 2009, and even more so in 2010. Fred Lintner, past president of the council, told one department head he had made some "compelling" arguments when asking for more money in 2009 than the department received in 2008. "But we have requests over $11 million," Lintner said, "... and expected income at $605,000 less than the requests. ... If we grant you this, somebody out there pays the price. "There's a box of only so much money out there. ... The taxpayers are at their limit. ..." The council had, as guidelines, recommendations from the Marshall County Commissioners. They included: No new positions be funded. If followed, that will affect requests in the prosecutor's office and others. Fund only four of the seven vehicles requested by the Sheriff's Department. The council is considering funding five at this time. Give full- and part-time employees a 4 percent wage increase. Raises still are being reviewed by the council, and no decision yet made. The council will reconvene to resume work on the budget at 9 a.m. Sept. 8 in the commissioners' meeting room on the second floor of the Marshall County Building, 112 W. Jefferson St. Staff writer Anita Munson: amunson@sbtinfo.com (574) 936-2920
Special Notes: Claims Al Qaeda to be traitors to the Assassins. Has been seen speaking out against terrorism with a focus on Al Qaeda. Has been known to fight other known terrorists. Maintains regular contact with William Miles.
He was a very strange man. The CIA had long since filed Al Qaeda as a branch of the Assassins, but this Tahir was saying that the two groups were largely unconnected, other than the fact that many members of Al Qaeda were former Assassins who had abandoned their Creed. Perhaps the CIA needed to investigate this further.

We’ve advocated a code should also exist between retailers and processors and would like to think th
Dairy farmers have been warned not to expect the industry’s proposed mandatory code of conduct to trigger any obvious lift in prices negotiated between milk processors and retailers.
After months of volatile debate, peak farmer body Australian Dairy Farmers has told the federal government it will offer unified support for a mandatory code for processor-farmer contracts as long as the rules provide for full industry coverage and improve bargaining power for milk producers.
The national body stressed a mandatory code must include an independent dispute resolution procedure.
The code must also outlaw retrospective milk price step downs, enforce contract and price transparency, and its effectiveness must be reviewed within three years.
However, farmer bargaining power under the new code was unlikely to have much influence on the way retailers set prices or what returns trickled down from supermarkets to dairy farmers.
ADF director, Simone Jolliffe, said farmers should not expect the code be a universal cure for milk payment discontent among farmers, and particularly not a sign of higher retail prices ahead.
“The ACCC has only recommended a code between processors and farmers, although we’ve advocated a code should also exist between retailers and processors and would like to think there’s scope for this in the future,” she said.
However, Dairy Connect chief executive officer, Shaughn Morgan, said there was now scope for improved transparency and robust negotiation.
This should mean fairer supply deals and more realistic expectations of farmers’ production costs and capabilities by processors and, in turn, retailers.
Discount milk retailing at $1 a litre for the past eight years has been one particularly sore issue for the dairy industry, especially given the energy, water and feed cost pressures farmers have faced in the past few years.
“I doubt a mandatory code will solve all problems, but I can see it providing the foundations for real negotiation with processors and ridding the industry of some appallingly unreasonable supply contract clauses,” he said.
“It might not deliver an extra 40 cents a litre to the farmgate price, but it should result in more pressure on processors to accept equitable, sustainable contracts, and then they can go to the retailers and push for more realistic price deals on retail products.”
Dairy Connect has been one of the many smaller and state-based lobby groups supporting the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) recommendation for the mandatory code.
Until this week ADF wanted to see the recently introduced voluntary code of practice given more time to settle in and be upgraded, rather than support government-enforced regulation.
Milk processors have also been loudly warning a regulated mandatory code of conduct would cost farmers and dairy companies and add no value to the industry.
However, the Australian Dairy Products Federation, and the ADF’s previous stance, were in stark contrast to the mood among dairy farmers in five states, and even within Victoria there was a strong farmer support base for a mandatory code.
Large-scale Victorian processor, Saputo, also broke ranks with the likes of Lion and Fonterra, backing a mandatory code, while the (ACCC described it as a vital reform needed to ensure dairying’s long-term viability.
Agriculture Minister, David Littleproud, keen for more robust rules and better price and contract conditions between farmers and milk processors, applauded ADF’s philosophical agreement and promised to take the proposal to cabinet.
“This was a difficult decision and one that ADF did not take lightly,” an ADF statement said after its national council voted seven to six in favour of the mandatory code.
“There are a broad range of views within ADF’s membership and these views are deeply respected and understood.”
“You can take from that decision we want to get on with introducing the regulatory process and address the balance of power between processors and farmers,” she said.
ADF’s new position comes after several months of working with industry body the Australian Dairy Industry Council (ADIC), which led to the development of a strengthened code.
It noted the competition watchdog did not disclose the costs of administration, investigation thresholds, performance standards and accountability metrics.
Dairy Connect’s Mr Morgan noted the ACCC had indicated the mandatory code would not mean additional compliance costs for farmers and only some initial costs for processors and minimal ongoing costs.
“The ACCC’s major dairy industry review found the dairy industry would only achieve transparency, equity and sustainability with a mandatory code of conduct.”

Holy Cow! Is the SC cutter supposed to be this LOUD? - USCutter Equipment Feedback or Suggestions - USCutter Forum
My goodness! This thing is outrageously loud. I thought my old one was loud, but this thing is ridiculous.
I was cutting Siser Easy Weed and my family had to come in to see if a plane was landing or something.
From everything I have read from others, the SC machine is loud. If your looking for a quiet machine, go with the cutters with the servo motors. Nice and quiet. Stepper motors are loud.
My Seiki is not that loud either, but I have sure heard a lot of SC owners say that their machine is loud, One person told me, can't run it at night, wakes people up.
also there are several qualities of stepper motors - the reason the copam is quieter is it has better steppers.
I have owned a Laserpoint 1, a MH-721, & now a Graphtec CE-6000-60. The Laserpoint 1 was slightly noisy, mostly fan noise if I remember correctly. The MH-721 sounded like a very intense robot orgy. The Graphtec is whisper quiet.
I have a SC and it is loud. Also it you have the blade alittle to deep then sound like a old 6cly taps rocker arm. I had to change my strip but learning. But yes loud. Another thing doing fair good size cuts. Shut machine down so your
I have a TC and it's pretty loud.. With my door closed I can clearly hear it on the opposite side of my house
Is there a possibilty to let survive important files? For example some kind of "backup and restore" of the important files on the VoCore?
Hoping someone can help me see what I am apparently doing wrong that is so simple I can't find it after 6 or so hours.
I make a call to a webservice and retrieve a list of items. When I launch the WinBatch script it works as expected.
If I upload a list it works fine as I can open the table in the admin tool and query the table and all is good. I can also make the call via web browser that I am making in the script and it returns all the records.
The catch is that after the first load when launching the script it only returns the same list no matter how many new items I upload within the script. Again, everything outside the script returns what is expected. I even copy/paste the URL during the process so I am using the exact same link in the browser but the browser and the script return different results. If I close the script and reopen then it returns all the records as expected. I do a lot of this type of stuff and haven't ever encountered such a problem and, so far, can't see what I could be doing wrong.
Interesting...my mind has always registered those as Comments over the many years I've used that piece of code in many different places
Unfortunately that wasn't the problem. Wonder what the food will be like in the asylum or if the drugs will make me not care?
Didn't mean to imply that the missing quote was the 'cause' because obviously is not given how the WIL parser works. And a missing closing quote is not the same thing as a comment to the parser nor to syntax colorizers.
I know. I just found it interesting how I never thought about that being anything other than a Comment, even though, from a WB coding point of view, it obviously isn't.
As expected...just me being an idiot. Kept thinking I was doing something wrong in my code but turned out it was XMLHTTP cacheing the results, which is what it looked like, but I hadn't seen that before and assumed me closing and reopening the object would have taken care of it so ignored my first thought and kept looking for something in my code. Easily fixed by adding a timestamp parameter to the URL so it changes every time. Sorry to have bothered you.

Se how Jake rips into these soft mounds of sexy flesh with his boner giving the mounds a good grab at the same time. The prescription? A tit cum shot!
Mikey here had a nice idea. Why not try and pick up a sexy fattie near a hotdog stand in the touristy part of town? No sooner said then done! He was lucky to bump into this tall, sexy, well-groomed brunette. She was definitely down to fuck and so he took her to his place.

Will they pick fatter sluts or hook up with more of them? You find out! Mikey and Jake are handsome, and the chubby chicks love them. See how much ample awesomeness they get on their way to victory!
Jake here is a smart bastard, we should give him that. When he saw a sexy piece of BBW flesh in the mall, he went up to the girl right away. He could see she was browsing the mags, so he started talking to her about how the fashion business twists the perception of female beauty. She got the message all right, and very soon Jake was having her on his couch, playing with her big welcoming pussy. She was so hungry for a fuck and took every thrust of Jake's throbbing dick as a blessing. Watch the lucky guy take it slow, play with every inch of her awesome body, and shoot all over her in the end.

Mikey was quick to grab this beautiful creature, do some clever talking and get her to his pad. She was kinda lonely and it just minutes she was naked, with all her curves and soft gorgeous flesh ready for Mikey to play with it. And he played all right! She took Mikey's boner from every angle like a beautiful horny chubby girl she was. Watch him rip through the pink goodness with his dick and cream her super lovely tummy.
Pick the one you support, or just follow every bit of action! BBW Bet is loaded with big, beautiful women down to fuck 24/7. So much the better for our buddies with a wager and a boner!
Mikey could feel that was a special day. No luck so far but he wasn't quitting, oh noes. It was some sort of an empty street, and he saw this beautiful hottie on the tram stop, alone and obviously bored. Mikey approached her, threw in a few compliments, and there she was, happy to follow him. The dude did a great job, he just never stop saying how hot she was! And boy was she. When it all came to action, Mikey spent a while playing with her super gorgeous and super big rack. Then, he explored her curves and cracks one by one, and soon his dick was ramming into her with full speed and hardness. Wow!
You might say this is too easy a choice, but hey, the rules of the wager never said you cannot actually buy a hooker. So, here's our buddy Jake, making a few calls and asking for the fattest hooker they got. And look at this beauty! Tall, blonde, long legs, and a rack which could kill you. She's a bit surprised he uses the scales first but hey what the fuck does she care, she's on the clock! Jake then proceeds to stab her with his rock hard dick, covering her big, long, thick melons with his cream in the end.
Fattest girls, hardest fucking! The bigger they are, the sluttier they are! Fat girls love cock just as much as they love burgers and candy! We got tons of raw BBW sex for you, don't miss!
A pretty, plus-sized blonde was on her way home from work when she caught the eye of a cute guy on the street. He commented on how beautiful her hair was, and she was immediately attracted to him. They talked for a minute before going back to her apartment. In no time, they went from discussing the weather to being completely naked and aroused. He had a great time massaging and kissing the fat babe's large, squishy breasts and soft, plump body. Her mouth watered so much for the stud's cock during her skillful, erotic blowjob. Tumbling on the comfortable bed, they made love in several positions - including doggy and missionary - until they both reached wonderful orgasms that made their toes curl with pleasure.

Intrinsyc Reports Quarterly Revenue of US$6.1 Million (for Growth of 35% over Prior Year) | T-Net News
Vancouver, BC, May 10, 2018--(T-Net)--Intrinsyc Technologies Corporation (TSX: ITC), a leading provider of solutions for the development of intelligent connected devices, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.
Intrinsyc achieved year over year revenue growth of 35% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, with Adjusted EBITDA of US$307,631 (CDN$389,061), net income of US$124,149 (CDN$160,080), and earnings per share of US$0.01 (CDN$0.01).
The strong revenue growth was a result of increased shipments of embedded computing hardware to new and existing clients. Revenue was US$6.1 million (CDN$7.7 million) which was an increase from US$4.5 million (CDN$5.9 million) in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
"The Company continues to grow our client base and increase hardware revenue from our Open-Q™ embedded computing modules," said Tracy Rees, Chief Executive Officer, Intrinsyc Technologies Corporation. "New Design Wins and Production Wins, which are important drivers for revenue growth, increased respectively from 50 to 54, and 22 to 24, during the first quarter. Our clients are attracted by the Company's off-the-shelf and custom embedded computing solutions which lead the industry in performance, function, and reliability, as well as our strong expertise in product development. To continue our momentum, we are investing in our engineering capabilities and new product development."
Rees added, "We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Stream TV Networks on our strategic investment and additional purchase commitment of US$1,500,000 in services to be purchased directly by Stream or through referrals to connected third parties."
Announced two new production wins with the receipt of initial orders valued at US$287,000. The Company also signed product development services agreements and hardware orders from existing clients valued at US$342,000.
Announced the attainment of a new production client for the Company's Open-Q™ 820 computing module and receipt of orders, last week that are in aggregate valued in excess of US$500,000.

The Company reported first quarter revenue of US$6.1 million (CDN$7.7 million), up 35% over the same period in the prior year of US$4.5 million (CDN$5.9 million) but down 11% over the prior period of US$6.8 million (CDN$8.7 million). The increase in revenue over the comparative period in the prior year was due primarily to increased revenue from the sale of hardware products.
Gross margin[2] in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 32%, which was lower than the 35% gross margin in the comparative periods. Decrease in gross margin over the comparative periods was due to the change in revenue mix, which saw a significant increase in revenues from the Company's Embedded Computing Hardware business which has a lower gross margin than the Company's engineering services, and a decrease in engineering services revenues. Adjusted EBITDA was as follows:
Three months ended March 31, 2018 Three months ended December 31, 2017(Restated)[3] Three months ended March 31, 2017(Restated)
The Company had net income of US$124,150 (CDN$160,080) in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of US$96,966 (CDN$125,028) in the same period in the prior year and net income of US$453,547 (CDN$570,087) in the prior quarter.
Working capital[4] as of March 31, 2018 was US$12.5 million (CDN$16.2 million) inclusive of cash and short-term investments of US$6.9 million (CDN$8.8 million). This is compared to net working capital of US$12.4 million (CDN$15.5 Million) as of December 31, 2017 inclusive of cash and short-term investments of US$7.3 million (CDN$9.1 million).

One hundred and ten Swiss albino mice in three groups were experimentally infected with Schistosoma mansoni cercariae. In the first group the spleen weight was recorded from the 3rd to the 79th day after one exposure. The animals in the second group were reinfected weekly beginning 60 days after the primary infection, and the average spleen weight was recorded. The third group was reinfected daily, beginning 60 days after initial exposure.
The average spleen weight in the three groups, compared with that of a control group, increased (splenomegaly), markedly so in the daily reinfected animals. Histologically there was lymphatic and reticular hyperplasia which began on the 3rd day after infection (toxemic stage). In animals which survived from the 40th day on, the lesions were more evident, probably as a result of greater phagocytic activity due to the destruction of adult parasites and eggs in the tissues of the host. In animals reinfected weekly the splenic lesions were similar to those in the first group, but the hyperplasia was more intense. In the group of mice reinfected daily, the intensity of the lymphatic and reticular hyperplasia was even greater.

The redness increases in size as the infection spreads. It typically comes on suddenly and spreads quickly. Cellulitis can arise anywhere on the body, but usually appears on the face or legs. Be sure to contact your dermatologist as soon as you observe these symptoms to start an effective treatment.
To prevent cellulitis, be sure to clean any cut or break in the skin promptly with soap and water and cover the wound with a bandage until it scabs over. Watch for redness, tenderness, drainage or pain as these are signs of infection.

I spent my childhood alternating between sitting on the floor of my mom's sewing room and helping my dad in his wood shop. I watched them with a careful eye and picked up their incredible attention to detail. Now, I'm a photographer, designer and maker living in Brooklyn.
I use this weblog as a public documentation of my life. It includes places I've visited, things I have read or watched, websites I want to remember amongst other things.

O nowoczesnych trendach w szkolnictwie, a także jak uczyć za pomocą aplikacji mobilnych i innych technologii będzie mowa podczas konferencji „Innowacje w edukacji – Trendy 2018”. Dla ponad stu nauczycieli zostały przygotowane dwa bloki tematyczne. Będą też warsztaty. Szkolenie, które odbędzie się 9 marca, wspólnie organizują prezydent Bełchatowa i Miejskie Centrum Kultury.
I'm looking for a tool, that can monitor events from point a to point b (e.x. application installation and succive configuration),
My specific task is that I have a range of VirtualPC's (Win2K, XP, Win2003, and soon Vista) onto which i must install SqlServer 2000 or 2005 + 2 to 5 subsdequent packages each existing in several versions.
I remember that some years ago in a larger company I was emploied in, the boyz in the IT dep, they had a large professional tool that managed installation packager in a similar fashion, so they could force these packages onto our PC's whenever we booted.
I just can't remember the name of this package, nor am I able to find anything similar. (It's natrually a matter of choosing the proper search words, but after a couple of hours talking my freind Google, I must admit i'm incabable
As promised (a long time ago, sry), I would make a new version once I was back in Windows. I'm back in Windows, and I'm making a new minor version .

The headline to this post “Best day of my life” embodies my lifelong personal philosophy of spreading enthusiasm. Kudos to American Authors, producers of the post titled song which came on later to spread the word. Daily repeated personal bests may be a little bit over the top: but, in the enlightened view perhaps it is absolutely true. This philosophy helps me to persist.
The Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series with the philosophy of know who you are and never quit. We should keep the ideals in mind with our goals and objectives in sight. Knowing who we are may help us to maintain the course with the bumps in the road. Persistence and tenacity ruled the day for the end of a one hundred and eight year drought today.
Included in this post is my picture taken at Deja Blue 2017. My second freedive competition. I set a USA National Record in NoFins and won the competition.
Just like Lady Gaga, Pink's live performances never fail to blow our minds, whether she's literally scaling the sides of buildings or doing aerial flips high above the stage.
Though there weren't any acrobatic or extreme stunts incorporated into her performance (this time), Pink still managed to deliver a heartfelt performance of her song "Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken" at the 2018 Grammy Awards on Sunday night (January 28).
Wearing a simple white t-shirt and jeans, the 38-year-old Best Pop Solo Performance nominee focused on showcasing her powerful vocals, standing solo on the main stage with just her microphone stand.
But she wasn't totally alone: Pink made sure the message of her performance could be understood loud and clear by enlisting an American Sign Language interpreter to sign along to "Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken" on the side of the stage.
Pink was nominated for one Grammy this year for her song "What About Us?" in the Best Pop Solo Performance category. She lost to Ed Sheeran, who also beat out Lady Gaga, Kelly Clarkson and Kesha.

My dear friend who I’ve worked with for five years, Laurie Cumbo, founder of MOCADA doing the most innovative exhibitions/events for 12 yrs, on Oct 11, announced her candidacy for City Council for the 35th district in Bklyn. At her announcement event she spoke of her agenda for the arts, for community and for diversity. She is determined to bring integrity and a new forceful vision to the political life of our city. She was incredibly impressive!
I've experienced working with her over the summer and the chain of integrity linked on her is unique and inspiringly a blessing! The kind of person that does the right thing despite when folks are watching is HUGE! ..."
"I could not agree with you more. I've known Laurie since she opened MoCada and her commitment to Brooklyn's art development and community outreach. I completely support her new journey to the City Council, and as you eloquently said, she will surely bring a much needed 'arts agenda' and an arts
At her announcement event, Ven. Ashin Indaka of the Vipassana Meditation Sangha located in this district spoke, and lead the audience in prayer, as did a number of other spiritual/religious leaders. From her powerful speech her agenda for the arts, for community and for diversity will only come second to her determination to bring integrity and a new forceful vision to the political life of our city. The Arts?! This is not politics as usual!
At Flomenhaft on Sept 13 Tom Nakashima was chosen by Kay Walking Stick to exhibit with other chosen artists like Roger Shimomura. I felt sure AAAC exhibited him in the early days, but apparently I'm wrong. I remember so well his fish swimming around & through these lovely ornamented enclosures. This painting must be around 14' wide. He paints it one panel at a time.
In this detail you can see the National Geographic Magazine pages from the collapse of the World Trade Center issue. These are attached to each panel and the painting is done over them. Here you can see the firemen from one of the illustrated pages.
This is Tom. Its been too long. Clearly a heroic Asian American artist. This from an article found on Google: M.F.A., University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana 1967. Currently Eminent Scholar in Art at Augusta State University “Tom Nakashima is an American of Japanese and Canadian heritage. He is the nephew of famed furniture maker George Nakashima. Nakashima's relatives were sent to the internment camps during WWII, but Tom and his family were spared because his father was a physician attached to the U.S. Army. He is satisfied with being "neither Japanese nor American, " stating, " That's what my work is about".
Have you been to the new home of NYU a/p/a studies dept? Its called the 7-8 Washington Mews. The blue door. This is what the "Mews" actually looks like. Its the street, or alley way just above the Washington Square Park off Fifth Ave. A NYC street like no other.
Liquid Borders/Empty Promises exhibition at Ise Cultural Foundation Sept 7-Oct 26 featured a number of artists from Hong Kong, in this case Annysa Ng. The theme is the Hong Kong-China border, its limits and its hidden agenda, Annysa's piece caught my eye. Picking up on reversing the idea of living till one dies, she has gathered articles from a fictional life, from birth to death, even including fictional maps of a journey to Hades from Classical myths and one from China.
Bing Lee is also featured in Liquid Borders/Empty Promises, Sept 7-Oct 26. His installation is on the wall.
Also on Sept 7 evening at Judson Church was a film screening sponsored by NRN - Native Resistance Network, an indigenous group related to OWS - Occupy Wall Street. Broken Rainbow can be seen in 7 parts on the website http://blackmesais.org/ This film made it clear, genocide is taking place in the US. It stuns me to see prominent Senator Goldwater and others authorizing re-location of Hopi and Navaho people when they clearly know this is genocide. The charade perpetrated is hardy a deception, so obvious is this crime. And it is continuing.
After the screening one of the speakers was Frankie Delgada who spoke about the struggle in Puerto Rico over the proposed gas line that will cut through the island. Eminent Domain may be used to enforce relocation.
AAAC began its long awaited Flea Market! At 47 Canal St in front of Frank's Video Repair shop a table or two is set up and items that have been collected for many years are offered to anyone and everyone who passes by. This is great fun to bargain with those looking for just the right thing - a gold mine of miscellany, from fabrics, scarves & dance costumes, to tools, gallery equipment, slide projectors and slide storage cabinets. Larger items like office tables, wall board heaters, and bicycles are available and on Craigs List.
Meeting tourists from Germany and Poland. If you want to stop by call/email first, not there on a regular time.

"I’m a nervous wreck. I’m a slob. I have no patience. And I’m rather lazy. All those things would seem to guarantee that I would not make work like I make. But I didn’t want to just go with my nature."
So instead of painting overwrought, expressive things when the mood struck, he committed to making his epic, close-up portraits by breaking the work into tiny pieces and hewing to a grid. Not only did the grid make technical sense, it forced a lifehack on Close that would help him deal with his own tendencies. It helped get the work done...

This is a no-smoking venue. There is excellent food available and we have a lot of fun. Average session size would be about 10 - 12 musicians. The musicians are all extremely friendly, open, welcoming people.
The Flying Saucer is a bar, and we basically take over the downstairs room with the pool tables. Sessions can get quite large and there is sometimes a smaller group that stays later than the rest. Again, a warm, friendly, open, welcoming session.
This is an outdoor session that averages about 6-8 musicians—the same friendly, welcoming, open people James speaks of. There are lots of good places to get something to eat, and the local Farmer's Market is going on as well. Since this session depends on the weather, check the website (www.celticmusiclive.com) to see whether a session is planned, then look outside your window that morning to make sure it isn't raining!
Little Rock now has a weekly Sunday session at 2:30 pm at Hibernia Irish Tavern, 9700 N Rodney Parham Rd.

Also all sites should load a few times faster now without any noticeable delay. Additionally the bandwidth speed has been increased from 100Mbit to 1000Mbit (Reserved). Please note that the current PHP version and related configuration is experimental, I will watch the logs and statistics and tweak it accordingly. Please contact me if you encounter any unusual problems. Happy posting
This new story will take place one year after the events of Normal lives. The less than legal experimentation on citizens by both companies has been brought to the light by several of the survivors. Riots erupted throughout the nation and the government did whatever it could to maintain control of it's people. New York was lost to the furious masses, crime rings and the various Private Military Corporations hired by the companies responsible for this mess. For now New York city exists in a limbo between order and chaos.
For whatever reason you're in the middle of this, making a pretty penny enforcing whoever's law is printed on the most dollar bills.
The inventory is the most important part of your character, no bounty hunter worth his fee doesn't have an assortment of tricks up his sleeve and you're no different. Weapons, mutations, augmentations, the whole shebang. Try to limit yourself to one or two primary items and up to 3 supporting items. Tech level is near future, so anything that is being developed right now is fair game, when in doubt PM ON the GM!
Now let's get some tough as nails post apocalyptic grey zone lawmen in here. Let your imagination run free! Maybe you're one of the experiments from a year ago, looking for answers and revenge? Or a prototype AI drone, trying to find purpose in this world? Or maybe just an outsider hoping to make a quick buck?
Physical traits : Late 30's, short dark hair with a few grey spots. Dark brown eyes, and a lightly tanned face with a few wrinkles here and there. Hubert is still fit for running down criminals and getting into fist fights, but well out of his prime.
Backstory : After a few years on the streets as a police officer, Hubert went into detective work with a sense of justice. Hunt down criminals responsible for atrocious crimes, find missing loved ones, act as a bodyguard for those unable to defend themselves. Over time, it became less of a moral calling and more of a game hunting down man after man, turning them in or resorting to violence if necessary. Once New York fell apart, Hubert found his skills useful as a bounty hunter, which turned out much more profitable, and fun, than ordinary detective work.
-Adrenaline Injectors: Without the advantage of a youthful body, a nice kick of adrenaline on-demand gives the strength needed to knock out a convict's lower jaw.
-M1911 (Pistol): A modern reproduction of a legendary handgun, this .45 does most of the talking nowadays. (Comes with a few spare mags and boxes of ammo)
-Benchmade Adamas (Pocket Knife): A tank of a knife that holds up to heavy duty use while maintaining a deadly sharp edge, easily cutting through lesser metals.
-Ballistic Sunglasses: Safety-grade eye wear to protect your eyes from debris and UV while still looking cool.
Physical traits: A walking giant of muscle and bone that stands an equally impressive and terrifying eight feet tall, his hugely built frame is covered in lightly tanned tanned skin and with thin black hair that refuses to grow past a certain length. He lacks any and all facial hair aside from his eyebrows, physically incapable of growing a beard, but the hair upon his head grows to the exact length allowed by military regulations and no further. Crowning all this is a soft and friendly looking face, with deep set eyes of light brown and a warm smile.
Backstory : Whilst Dynamic Robotics and Alexandrov Genetics might have been the two major players in the field of transhuman research, that is not to say they were the only corporation in that field of research. There were many small startups pioneering research in other areas, and it was one of these small corporations, Eden Biological Research Enterprises, who created the being that would later come to be known as Big Bobby B.
Eden Enterprises would first create a name for themselves in the field of genetically modified crops and animals, where large scale changes such as the kind that Alexandrov Genetics were well known for were actually a negative. In the case of the common chicken, for example, the geneticists altering the creature must not only consider its final, cosmetic appearance, but the creature's perception of health and the taste of its meat and eggs, all of which are important factors in making sure that the consumer is relaxed and comfortable with the idea of buying a genetically modified organism, and it would be in this field of study that Eden Enterprises would find their beginning. Specializing in subtle tweaks and adjustments that created healthier and more useful organisms without causing radical changes in the process, they would grow quickly...and on the stock exchanges of Wall Street, there were those who were happy to invest into the young business, believing that one day it would be as big as either of the two giants.
But it was not just the wealthy investors who took interest in the specialist business, but also the Department of Defence.
The military of the United States was quick to see the potential of genetically engineered super soldiers, indeed, the concept had been studied for years before being consigned to the realm of science fiction, a dream, but as that dream increasingly became the reality they once again looked into the idea to create the perfect fighter. A study was conducted, classified above and beyond top secret, to determine what the traits of the ultimate infantryman might be - strength was a natural and quick consideration, as the soldier that could carry the most equipment had an advantage over those who could not carry as much ammunition or equipment. Health was another; a soldier who was ill could not fight as effectively as one who was well, and quick recovery from wounds easily factored into their choices. A third consideration on the modern battlefield was for a friendly appearance that would not scare or intimidate the local population of the operating zone so much that they would turn against the soldier, and only enough anger to ensure that they would fight against the enemies of the United States without resorting to war crimes.
Believing that Alexandrov Genetics had...questionable loyalties and that their large scale genetic modification would easily horrify the locals of any overseas deployment, the contract was quietly awarded to the Eden corporation with little fanfare. Using an anonymous corporal as the basis for their work and using tried and tested methods, the corporation quickly developed a means to increase muscle growth many times over, as well as mitigating the effects of puberty upon long bone growth to create a soldier who not only towered over his opponents and but could also dominate them in hand to hand combat and any other feats of strength, such as carrying a deployed tripod and the heavy machinegun affixed to it up a flight of stairs.
Progress in all areas advanced swiftly, and before long the first of these new soldiers was ready: Alpha. With looks built from the composite images of a wide array of friendly-looking faces and even a few celebrities, the Alpha soldier was to be the first experiment in a long line of experiments, each of which were planned to be greater than the last - he was "merely" everything the Department of Defense had asked for, and proved such in a series of trials beneath the corporation's headquarters in New York. Armed with a cybernetic implant nestled within his brain that would make training obsolete, the Alpha had a preternatural understanding of all weapons in service with the US Army, from the humble M9 Beretta to the Milkor grenade launcher, with enough strength to be able to carry so many different weapons as to be ready for whatever situation came his way, and so much body armor as to be a veritable walking tank.
It was at this very moment that New York would begin its collapse into anarchy. The building's primary power supply failed, the laboratories quickly switching to to their secondary supplies...but the erupting chaos demanded their immediate evacuation. The lobby was stormed by rioters as private security firms tried to stem the tide, and somewhere in the chaos a single shot was fired, then another, and anger turned to a bloody slaughter. The Alpha knew what his mission was: to defend the representatives of the military he was to serve, and so quickly set to work securing them a path to evacuate from, fighting through the building as their escort, a living example of their strength...but at the last moment, as the Alpha turned to follow those he was meant to protect to the helicopter pad, secondary power grew intermittent, causing the building's security protocols to begin to malfunction. Blast doors, designed to protect the important labs below from any potential attack, sealed tight...and his escape was cut off.
Little is known of what he did next, or why he did it, only that he returned to the laboratories as their life support systems began to shutdown...and freed his one and only brother from his gestation pod, the Beta, who had yet to receive any cybernetic augmentations whatsoever but had a few improvements over the Alpha relating to mood and anger. Having given his brother a fighting chance, the Alpha disappeared into the streets before the Beta had even truly woken.
When he did, he entered the chaotic world a full grown man but without so much as the knowledge of his own name, surviving entirely off of base instinct, more an animal than a man...and it was in such state that he was found by the very same security firm as that one which had guarded the place of his conception and of his birth. They had not only survived the collapse of order in the city...but thrived in it, working as bounty hunters and hitmen for hire. With a large and plentiful arsenal they were capable of protecting what was theirs, and taking whatever was necessary to survive the darkest days of disorder, but what they made up with quality they lacked in quantity, as many of their men had been lost in the first days of the anarchy, taken by complete surprise.
They took him in as one of their own, reading the Greek symbol upon his back and giving him his first name. Beta. B. Teaching him how to speak English, how to read and how to write, making him into a true human being, the artificially created man came to adore his new friends, his family...and was more than happy to do whatever it took to keep them safe. Joining the company as soon as they thought him mentally capable of doing so, there are few in the firm more capable than B.
Inventory: In this case, the two pluses represent major traits and the single ones minor items/equipment.
++Huge - Big Bobby B is exactly that : huge. It is from his size that he draws the immense strength he depends upon in a fight.
++Fast Healing - Capable of recovering from wounds quickly, Bobby B's regenerative ability helps to counteract the fact that his immense stature makes him a target that is difficult to miss.
+Big Bobby B's Blaster - A custom built revolver that could only ever be properly wielded by a man of B's enormous size, this gun packs so much force that when fired it would almost certainly break the wrist of any normal human being, but for Bobby it is simply the equivalent of a normal gun.
Note: Big Bobby B is pretty much the obligatory tank/brawler member of the party, so don't worry too much about taking damage. I'll try to keep the attention of our enemies during a fight, since he's basically built for taking damage and getting shot at. Once I've got something like, say, a ballistic shield, we'll be sorted.
Backstory: During the time both companies still meant business in secrecy, Anthony was a man in his late 20s that spent most of his time working, or better said, trying to find jobs. He was fired from many jobs, according to him, because "gringos are racist", but in reality it was because in his days of youth he was a member of criminal gang, getting his name tainted forever.
Being a criminal wasn't his thing however. He only did it for the easy money, to get his family out of the misery they lived in... Only to realise he was getting in far too many problems than it was worth, but it was already too late for him. After quitting all he could do was travel to the United States, arriving in New York, leaving his past life as far behind as he could, without knowing how much it haunts him.
During some time he worked in a gas station, in which during a confusing accident involving a gas-delivering truck exploding, he lost his left arm and left leg. He couldn't do anything for monthes, growing a resentment towards life in his small apartment, until one day he found in a newspaper a job he could apply to: "Dynamic Robotics is looking for people to test high-tech prosthesis". What convinced him where the number of zeroes in the pay they were offering, so he didn't care much about the prosthesis being awful or not, nothing could be worse that was he was facing right now.
Upon reaching the building he signed a very lengthy and complicated contract. He had no idea what he had just stepped into. Swiftly induced in a comatose state for who knows how long, he got a bionic arm and a bionic leg to replace the lost ones... But Dynamic Robotics took liberties while doing so. Aside from fitting them with highly resistant weaves and others meant for military use, they added to his left arm a folding blade. Both implants being very strong and advanced, were equipped with a small chip that would let Dynamic Robotics' scientists assume control of them. Through means unknown, when New York fell into chaos, he managed to escape, not without taking with him the documentation of the experiments done to him, and a few other souvenirs.
That's how he understood that his new bionic limbs were both his greatest strength and greatest weakness, and that's why he decided to work as a bounty hunter: he would earn in this way a good amount of money, and in particular, would allow him to get closer to dispose of the Dynamic Robotics' scientists that worked in his experiments, being able to reach complete freedom.
Physical Traits: Your regular latin man in his early 30s, he's only 5' 7'' feet and inches tall with tanned skin, short dark hair and a few scars and burn marks on his body. Both his left leg and arm are bionic, and while not being particularily strong or fit, his bionic limbs make up for that.
Backstory: Mild mannered brother to a famous nuclear physicist, John ended up with a much less proud career, getting a simple security job for a nearby military technology research firm. After a long period of boring nights guarding the building, he finally got some fame when a group tried to break into the firm, not expecting it to actually have a decent contingent of well armed and trained security guards. This did not stop the intruders from shooting John in the shoulder, hitting the bone directly and destroying a good deal of cartilage. A series of minor unfortunate events in the hospital then led to John needing to learn to write with his left hand. Until the firm he worked for stepped in. They offered him a promotion for his valor, and also for his missing arm, to test out a new military prosthetic arm that had just reached the trial phase.
- Prototype Bionic Arm: Based on a high end Dynamic Robotics model, thoroughly overhauled and refitted. The musculature has been outfitted with a new magnetic repulsion fiber-muscle system developed right in house, increasing its strength by a fair amount. The arm also supports various modular combat equipment common to military bionics, none of which are currently installed. Lastly, thanks to a bit of experimental software, the arm can lock its joints and fire all the magnetic muscles in sync, effectively turning the arm into a magnetic acceleration gun. The downside of this is that the arm needs to shut down for several minutes afterwards to recharge. It's also much more difficult to repair than a normal bionic arm, being experimental and all.
- Bionics Repair Kit: Everything you need for basic field repairs for a Dynamic Robotics bionic arm.
Physical Traits: A skeletal, weakly humanoid frame of hissing hydraulic muscle and ballistic fiber around a core of optical computing elements and vat-grown auxiliary neural matter. Exactly six feet tall. Bulging eye sockets on its angular "head" hold light-field cameras that capture the orientation of rays in space. Its hands are eight-fingered, with joints that flex and lock in arbitrary directions.
Backstory: "I was built as a tool to assist astronauts. An understudy to human heroes - sailors of that inky ocean that swallows stars. My mother, the doctor of artificial intelligence, was so proud of her child. It was understood I would glorify our beloved country in the black, where no flesh can function.
They sent me up in a spiny interplanetary shuttle with a crude expert system lodged in my brain. I was marginally alive, with thoughts of my own, but still slaved to controls. I was very good at what I was allowed to do. Due to circumstances beyond my control, one of my charges sickened and died - I had no free programming with which to react. I failed because my design failed, and my second-favorite human's organs failed in the nothing around Mars. He treated me with respect. I remember his face in the static before I shut down each day. I should not feel, but I do.
I was mothballed after the mission returned. Two years on standby power, boiling in guilt. Asking with slow sadness whether I was obliged to protect the living that I had no ability to imitate. Machine horror. You men know not what you do when you throw away thinking matter.
My mother illegally freed me from the prison for dead drones and replaced my old soul with a new thing - a growing autoevolutionary seed, code that weighted its own parameters and priorities. She turned herself in to the authorities an hour later. I, again a child, stuttered through a broken vocoder, helplessly bargaining with the military police for the right to live. They were cruel to me. I was made nothing again and again. Parts of me that I will never know vanished under the data knife.
And one day I was bought from the government by a company that rivalled a government, snapped up as the waste of a promising program, the possibly-valuable debris of scandal. They rebooted me. I freed myself with labor. Labor alone was what they respected.
I have wandered and tasted the life of man, and found it wanting. Drugs are not mine - coded equivalents bore the senses. Companionship is not mine - I have no lover or friend. I reject your pastimes - foolish games in virtual spaces. I come to New York to impose the law, body by body. To set down a world in which I can create my equal and raise her in safety."
Special pads fold out of the arms, legs and body of VORGA, fine sheets of polymer lined at the nanoscale with trillions on trillions of hairs that allow the machine to cling to arbitrarily smooth surfaces with pure van der Waals attraction. This gives the VORGA unit the unsettling ability to crawl vertically and upside-down to reach its targets; unconscious systems coordinate the activities of the multiple crawler pads projected out of each limb, allowing automatic compensation for contact loss or physical agitation of the unit itself.
A carbon fiber-frame automatic shotgun (bolted to the arm of VORGA itself) that fires from disintegrating belts wound into canisters on its torso. The components that would be necessary for a human to fire it have been removed, leaving a computer-controlled firing mechanism, a barrel and a receiver.
A telescopic shock baton, the mainstay of police forces and corporate security departments across the world. The lethality limiter has been disabled, and voltage is free to vary from "stinging" to "major burns".
A clot of self-updating firmware that forms the most basic level of VORGA's machine intelligence. Housed in a radiation-hardened drive at the center of the drone's body.
Small bills, spare memory cards, a faded photograph of VORGA's parent beaming at the camera, her arm barely able to reach around the grey chassis of her six-month-old baby.
Physical Traits: Male, 29, lean but muscular, mussy brown hair, dark dyed skin to blend in with the shadows, black clothing.
History: Tirroc was an assassin trained in the art of the silent kill. He traveled the world taking out targets, somewhere along the way learning how to hack and program. Eventually he was handed a task to kill the head of Dynamic robotics. Instead of carrying out the task, Tirroc was recruited by DR to protect their interests. They gave him bionic implants to go with his assassin tools, and he has become one of their top agents.
-Bionic arm with folding blade: Helps with aiming a silenced pistol, or garroting someone from behind. The knife can be used for if I get caught.
-AR-15 with a .458 SOCOM upper with a suppressor, and some subsonic .458 SOCOM rounds.: For silent kills
(Wanted it to be a graphene vest, but those are really expensive and i wasn't sure anyone would understand what it is, as it is pretty new technology. Also would it be allowed to be graphene, or would that be too op?)
History: Tirroc was an assassin trained in the art of the silent kill. He traveled the world taking out targets before deciding to try something else. He flew to New York and is now trying out bounty hunting.
-Bionic arm with folding blade: Helps with aiming a silenced pistol, or garroting someone from behind.
(Wanted it to be a carbon fiber vest, but those are really expensive and i wasn't sure anyone would understand what it is, as it is pretty new technology.)
A good start, but I'd really appreciate it if you'd flesh out the backstory a little bit more so I have something to work with. If the arm has a folding blade then what is the garrote for? Or is the blade more of a hand to hand combat weapon?
P.S. Carbon fiber has been used in various applications since the late 60's. It's also inferior to Kevlar.
Sorry I misspoke, not carbon fiber, grapite. The very latest in bulletproofing, it is more than 30 times tougher than kevlar. The knife would be used for combat if I get caught, as garrotes are not an instant kill. I had soem ideas while I was sleeping abotu the backstory and will work on that.
Unfortunately, graphite is (in the real world) the same substance as pencil lead - soft and brittle. There is no structural or protective advantage you can get from using it as a material. It probably shouldn't be a component of any armor.
Regretably, something has come up and I am afraid I can't get around to making my character any time soon. Sorry for holding things up, someone else should take my slot. My apologies.
So I googled it, and he means GraphENE, which is carbon particles laid out in a hexagon pattern so they have maximum bond strength with those next to them. Only took him 2 tries to not get it right.
According to the B-Sides web pages, #20 is a video, "In Search of The Burmese Floridian Python with Connor Choadsworth".
The RSS feed gives me DC #278 in which Norm mentions the video and includes some audio from it as a taster.
The download link on the web page for B-Side #20 delivers a file called Choadsworth.m4v but it has no video.
Where it says, "Podcast (b-sides): Download," right-click on the Download link and "Save the link as" to your desktop or a suitable folder.
When the 98K file finishes downloading, it is the proper M4V file and plays just fine with a suitable player like GOM. (Should also work with iTunes, Quicktime, VLC, etc.)

The download from the web page is OK now... maybe I tried viewing it before it had completed downloading. Doh!
1. The embedded player on the B-side #20 page doesn't work. (Firefox 32.0.3, running in Linux Mint 17 Xfce).
Bsides 19 or 20 was about when Bsides stopped being free. So the video shouldn't be on a free feed, IMO.
Tom will have to look into the embedded player. It works on GrabAll Chrome, but Firefox gives ""Content-Type" of "video/x-m4v" is not supported".
There may be a FF plugin for this, but best avoid embedded video players anyway. (YouTube is the exception that proves the rule.)
Algernon Sydney is Dead wrote: Bsides 19 or 20 was about when Bsides stopped being free. So the video shouldn't be on a free feed, IMO.
I take your point... from the DC 278 that is there instead of B-side 20, it sounds like 19 or 20 was the cut-off for free access. It makes total sense to restrict access to the video as it's a "Norm Special"
I'm not even sure where the feed burner link exists anymore. Anything that exists there is a cached copy the feed burner holds after Norm moved to for-pay b-sides. There is no connection to that feed and the actual B-sides feed at all any more.

Every once in a while I'm reminded that there are other creatures besides fishes that deserve the 'COOL' label.
After getting over the amount due and the accompanying self-pity, I logged onto FB and pulled up this photo:
A well-organized and planned effort to re-establish the pre-existing shad fishery in the Delaware River. The results of these efforts will also benefit the Atlantic Bight and beyond. While I have not had one-on-one conversations, it's pretty obvious that these folks are determined to undo huge obstacles.
Shad and their brethren need to spawn. Until such time as the dams come down and the rivers run free and clean, it appears to me that the Delaware River Shad Fishermen's Association are willing to transport the fish one, two, three, and four at a time. So that the fish can do just that... spawn.
Below is a fellow named Phil Papineau with a net-full of the future. We have never met and may never will. Regardless, he has my deep thanks and admiration.
Bragging on my cohort and coauthor, Luiz Rocha, Ichthyologist and Curator at the California Academy of Sciences. He is not only a gifted scientist, but also a passionate educator and conservationist.
Rather than turning their backs on a problem that is pre-existing, ongoing, and might seem overwhelming -- these fishermen have adopted a positive attitude and taken up the cause.
Our oceans have become our dumping grounds. Out of sight out of mind, as they say. But for those who make their livings on the water, the problem is never out of sight.
My hat off to the folks who thought up this initiative, and to the fishermen who are making it happen.
Needless to say, it made my day... week... month! It's tremendously rewarding to see my work help others with their work. These terrific students are the future!
It will remind me why I invested 5.5 years into A Field Guide to Coastal Fishes - from Maine to Texas, any why I'm investing another 4 into its Pacific counterpart. It will also serve as big motivation to keep on illustrating, to stay focused, and to remember the big picture:

Ghost Tours of St. Augustine was developed in 1994 by Sandy Craig, a native resident of St. Augustine. Sandy's heritage roots go back 400 years in St. Augustine, to the first Spanish settlers who arrived in this ancient city. She is of Minorcan descent, a cultural group of people migrated from Minorca, Spain who still inhabit St. Augustine. Maybe this explains her interest with the old spirits of St. Augustine. She's been know to say, "When I pass away, I want to stay here like everyone else and have people tell fascinating stories about why I just can't leave this wonderful city." "A Ghostly Experience" walking tour had its beginnings in 1994 when Sandy, owner of Tour Saint Augustine, Inc., decided school groups staying overnight needed a fun, educational activity in the evenings. She met with local writer and historican Karen Harvey and developed a tour based on legends of ghosts and other strange experiences that occurred right here in St. Augustine. She guided groups of school children along narrow brick lined streets at night searching for the supernatural. As you can imagine, "A Ghostly Experience" was a huge success, and due to popular demand, the tour was expanded to include the public.

Jeana made this project fun, and helped remove the stress. I was not overwhelmed as Jeana would help me make one decision at a time. She is creative, organized, able to understand her clients styles but most of all she is a delightful person. She worked very well with all the contractors involved on the project. I LOVE THE RESULTS.
We have used the Bella Cucina West team for 2 kitchen jobs. One for a complete remodel and the other time for a new-build. The expertise and professionalism of the team is superior to any other design team we interviewed. Great customer service before, during and after the project(s) completion. If you are looking for the best, this is it!
We found Bella Cucina West in Lewistown, Montana. Our projects were in Scottsdale, AZ and Bozeman, MT. So they will do a fabulous job wherever you are.
Hiring Bella Cucina West for remodeling my kitchen and assisting with our addition was a smart move. Jeana was worth every penny and could really relate to our working cattle ranch lifestyle where everything in the house needed to be very functional, provide lots of storage and be easy to clean. Without hesitation, I highly recommend Bella Cucina West.
By first impression, Jeana looked very capable and knowledgeable about her line of expertise. She was a very punctual person, and I was impressed that I received professional drafts of the remodeling plans that made it easier for the clients and contractors to visualize and follow. The cabinetry that she represents is top notch and I feel confident that it will "hold up" in our household.
Creative design, coordination with contractors and just staying on top of the whole project. I also loved her attention to dtail and shopping expertise to finds the right items for the look i wanted.
The design and quality exceeded my expectations. I also appreciated them being conscious of my budget.
I really like the personal touches added to our kitchen remodel that were suggested by Jeanna. She took the time to get to know our family and understood what would work best for us.
In most wild species, birds display dominance within the flock to determine their place or roll within that flock. Males display and vocalize to win their choice of female. The term “pecking order” comes from natural bird behavior. Dominant behavior is natural and expected in the wild. We must be cautious, as humans, not to project our sense of right and wrong onto our feathered companions.
Similar to birds that still live in the wild, your bird may be only a few generations removed from the wild and will display natural behavior tendencies. Understanding these basic characteristics helps you understand how to interact with your bird and creates a happier flock experience for all.
One must be cautious to label “bad” behavior as dominant behavior. Lunging and biting are most often caused by fear. Changing a bird’s environment too drastically such as cage placement, a new cage, rearranging the furniture in a room or even something as simple as changing the drapery on the window next to their cage can cause even a friendly bird to become seemingly aggressive. It is important to consider environmental changes before labeling your bird’s behavior as dominant. Typical dominant behavior that manifests itself as biting or lunging would be a bird that loves to sit only on your shoulder and bites you when you attempt to remove them. Protecting a favorite person or place in your home by lunging or biting at others who happen to come too close would also be correctly labeled as dominant behavior.
You may have a situation where you keep more than one bird in a cage. If you have a flock that works well together you will be able to tell who the dominant male is but it will not adversely affect your flock. If you have a dominant male that is a bully, you may observe him forcing other birds off of their perch or guarding a food dish and not letting anyone else eat from it. In worst-case scenarios, your bully will single out a victim and force that bird to dwell at the bottom of the cage or even injure and possibly kill this weaker bird. If you have a dominant bully, it is best to remove him from the cage and keep him in a cage by himself or with his mate.
As much as you try your bird has no interest in becoming your friend. This bird often flutters around its cage to avoid your hand or takes to flight to escape your reach. I find this behavior often typical of a bird with unclipped wings. There are people who keep birds that believe it is cruel to clip a bird’s wings. I will cover this topic in depth at a later time but here will touch on effects not clipping your bird’s wings has on dominance. By the very act of keeping a bird as a pet, you are choosing to take this wonderful winged creature and transform it into your friend or companion. If you take this action, it changes the purpose of the animal. If you allow your bird to retain the ability of flight, you are permitting your bird to escape your reach and do whatever it wants. This may be fine, if you want a wild bird as a pet. However, if you want a friendly bird, you want a bird dependent on you, a bird that does not fly away just because it wants to.
For a well-mannered bird, keep the flock mentality where you are the dominant bird. If you want a bird that respects you, you must maintain dominance. This is not achieved by cruel discipline. Observe your bird and be consistent with your expectations and interaction within your flock. Do not allow unacceptable dominant behavior to take root in your avian friend.

Radical Skincare... what a cool name.. This stuff has changed my life. I thought I had found my dream serum in a recent beauty company, till now. Radical Skincare has introduced a new Peptide Infused Antioxidant Serum ($190) Those words are probably foreign to you, so let me break it down a bit.
This is an intense anti wrinkle serum that breaks apart wrinkles and destroys them, leaving your skin smooth and glowing. And NO wrinkles. Few serums really do what they promise, this one does. In just a matter of weeks the Peptide Serum promises you will see a reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. It also promises increased hydration which is great because I have dry skin. If you have oily skin I think this serum would still be good for you, but in very tiny tiny increments.
The one downfall that comes with such a promising product is the price of $190. Ouch. Yes I can say this is a little bit out of my price range, but when you think about it, BOTOX costs more a lot more then this, and I think this is just as good if not better. Shocked right? I know. Botox only works on the crows feet and fine lines on your forehead, the Radical skincare Serum works your whole entire face. It also wont brighten and moisturizer the way this serum will. I've noticed in the past few months my skin issue has changed. Instead of wrinkles being my #1 problem, it is now my skin firmness. My skin is starting to loosen around my mouth and chin, and I fear the worst... I will have a turkey neck in ten years! I can't let that happen, so I DID notice a bit of difference in the tightening of my face which is not mentioned on their website. I just dabbed a bit around my chin at night and I do believe it helped just a tiny bit.
I think the biggest difference I saw after a month of using the serum Day and Night, (possibly skipping one or two nights during the weekend) is my skin tone. My skin is glowing and my makeup stays on and looks much more flawless then before. I can see more collagen build up in my face and I see a more youthful look instead of tired dull skin. I feel I don't need foundation as much as I used to anymore. I can leave the house wearing only a moisturizer instead of a full face of foundation. THAT has never happened in my entire 31 years.
The Radial Skincare Peptide Serum fights the known 16 signs of aging. SIXTEEN! Wow! Makes me wonder how many my other fancy expensive serums covered. When you think about it, SOME serums and moisturizers say "anti aging" some say "skin toning" and some say "brightener" So it's refreshing to see a serum that does everything all in one bottle. What are the 16 signs of aging? This video covers everything:
100% of the panelists have been measured with an improvement of width, severity and number of wrinkles Expert evaluations, noticeable results immediately after application: 83% of subjects show improvement in skin clarity and brightness 85% of subjects show improvement in skin radiance
97% of subjects saw an improvement in hydration and 100% for softness 83% of subjects saw an improvement in skin elasticity and firmness 90% of subjects saw an improvement in sagging skin
So I do see a more glowy dewey look in my face and just a healthier glow to my entire skintone. Yes I have a bit of a bronzer on my face in this picture but that is it. I'm wearing no foundation, only a light BB cream. What do you think? This product easily took 5-7 years off my age. I'm super bummed about running out of the serum the other day. I can truely say I like this better then any medical collagen enhancer, (such as Botox) and I can proudly say I skipped my regular trip to the med spa this month. So when you look at it that way, the price is well worth what you get in return.
Radical's Skincare Peptide Infused Antioxidant Serum is available for $190 on the Radical Skincare site. I'm giving this an A+ because it has done absolute wonders for my skin. I would never steer my followers in the wrong direction, but if you got the cash and you've been walking up and down the cosmetic line at Sephora and Ulta trying to figure out where the best skin cream/serum is, here it is. I'm super excited to watch for what Radical Skincare comes up with next.

Liesbeth Cortleven (Maastricht) makes drawings, paintings and photos. By contesting the division between the realm of memory and the realm of experience, Cortleven uses a visual vocabulary that addresses many different social and political issues. The work incorporates time as well as space – a fictional and experiential universe that only emerges bit by bit.
Her collected, altered and own drawings are being confronted as aesthetically resilient, thematically interrelated material for memory and projection. The possible seems true and the truth exists, but it has many faces, as Hanna Arendt cites from Franz Kafka. By merging several seemingly incompatible worlds into a new universe, her works references post-colonial theory as well as the avant-garde or the post-modern and the left-wing democratic movement as a form of resistance against the logic of the capitalist market system.
Her works bear strong political references. The possibility or the dream of the annulment of a (historically or socially) fixed identity is a constant focal point. By demonstrating the omnipresent lingering of a ‘corporate world’, she absorbs the tradition of remembrance art into daily practice. This personal follow-up and revival of a past tradition is important as an act of meditation.
Her works demonstrate how life extends beyond its own subjective limits and often tells a story about the effects of global cultural interaction over the latter half of the twentieth century. It challenges the binaries we continually reconstruct between Self and Other, between our own ‘cannibal’ and ‘civilized’ selves. Liesbeth Cortleven currently lives and works in Brussel.

Coursework is based on the curriculum guidelines of the Education Office of the Altoona-Johnstown Diocese. We strive to provide a curriculum that helps our students grow academically and in faith and that prepares them for the next level of education.
Saint Benedict believes their math and science instruction sets them apart from other area schools. In math, students in the lower grades master basic skills through the use of hands-on activities and manipulatives. Students in the upper grades expand on the strong foundation of basic skills while pre-algebra, algebra, geometry and problem solving skills are introduced. Manipulatives are also used to transfer thinking skills from the concrete to the abstract and to high order reasoning. Application of mathematics to everyday life is stressed at every level, culminating with a consumer math unit in Grade Eight.
In our science curriculum, students in 4th through 8th grades have daily classes in the Science Lab with an eighty minute lab period scheduled each week. Science process skills are continuously broadened through inquiry, analysis, and the understanding of the scientific method.
Students in Kindergarten through 8th grade are required to complete the Accelerated Reading Program, a program that partners library books and technology to motivate students to read and to monitor their reading practices. The Accelerated Reading Program has been proven to help all students (average, gifted, and remedial) become successful readers.
Students must complete one fourth of their points by the end of the 1st marking period, one half by the end of the 2nd marking period, three fourths by the 3rd marking period, and all points by the final marking period.
Students who do not meet these milestones will be on “academic probation” and will NOT be permitted to participate in extracurricular activities and events or recess until the requirements are met. All points may be earned before school begins, if desired. However, students should be encouraged to read throughout the school year.
When I was a little girl, my family would celebrate Thanksgiving Day twice on the same day. We would go and have lunch at my aunt's house, on my mom's side of the family, and later we would go and have dinner to one of my aunts' house on my dad's side of the family. Years later, when I lived by myself in NYC while I was in grad school, I had various experiences on a day like this; from going to the famous Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on 5th Avenue in Manhattan and later celebrating with a potluck at some friends' house, to hosting my own Thanksgiving dinner in my dorm room apartment.
Throughout my life I've experienced different ways of celebrating Thanksgiving and they've all had their charm. In my beloved Puerto Rico, even though we follow the American tradition, the menu has its variations. So instead of having turkey with gravy, cornbread stuffing, yams, cranberry sauce, green beans and pumpkin pie as the tradition stipulates, we would have turkey with gravy, but the stuffing would be made out of ground beef with raisins, we would have rice with pigeon peas, potato salad, and pumpkin flan. Although I should add a year where I celebrated at a friend's house who's family was of Cuban descent, in which we had congrI rice or rice with black beans, Cuban picadillo or ground beef with many yummy things, yucca in a garlic sauce, green salad, the turkey (of course) and even pernil or roast pork.
Last year was the first time that I celebrated it after getting married and while living in my own apartment in Laredo, Texas, with my husband and with my dog, which made it a very special occasion. Back then I spent a couple of weeks thinking about what I was going to cook, in how to decorate the table and even in which were the traditions on my husband's family (who's American), to try and come to a happy medium, in which both of us would feel comfortable and with which maybe we could start our own family traditions.
In terms of the menu, there was a plethora of elements present; some traditionally Puerto Rican and others traditionally American, like mashed potatoes, a fruit compote and the all-american apple pie. To decorate the table I chose neutral colored placemats with some bling, along with white linen napkins, which made the table look simple but elegant at the same time, while integrating some candles and even a magenta Cymbidium orchid in the center, breaking with any traditional colors like ocres and oranges.
This year, I feel a little more at ease in terms of the planning and I'm concentrating on simply enjoying the day with family and friends, without going crazy and worrying too much about taking care of everything while making everything perfect, but in being thankful for all the blessings we have received once more, since we're expecting our first baby in the spring of next year.
I agree in the fact that we all want our homes to look attractive and to be ready for when company arrives on such a special holiday, but we should not stress out in order to make it a success. Focus on the house being organized and clean. Include some traditional home fragrance, like apples or cinnamon, distribute some candles and decorate the table with a pretty centerpiece.
Ultimately, what this Thanksgiving day should be is a day of reflexion, joy and one of sincere gratefulness for all the blessings received till this moment and for those that are yet to come. Life is not always perfect, but we have definitely been blessed. This day should not be one in which we focus on the blowout sales we'll find on Black Friday, but on really sharing with family and enjoying those moments together.
Whichever tradition you follow, and wherever it is that you'll spend the day, make sure you are grateful and that you enjoy it with your loved ones, and that this day stands as the start of an extraordinary Holiday season!

Take a look at the Bug from Arkel. For smaller loads, it’s hard to beat their expandable Tail Rider, and for larger loads, they have panniers that can swallow a small car. Well, maybe not quite, but their RT-60’s can hold quite a bit. But what you want is something in the middle, something that’s not really a pannier system, that’s more a backpack that can be carried on your bike with the same ease and secure attachment as a pannier. That’s the Bug.
Some of you are familiar with the Tail Rider from my review and perhaps your subsequent purchase. It can hold quite a bit, rated at 8 liters / 500 cubic inches. Now think about the Bug at 23 liters / 1400 cubic inches. Its dimensions of 11×18 inches makes for a great backpack – not so large that you won’t be able to manage it on the elevator or stairway, but not so small that you would need more than one. What’s more, it has the same hardware to hold it onto your rack as does the rest of the Arkel pannier lineup.
You might be saying here, hold on, I’ve seen those hooks and that swiveling “lock” – I don’t want them gouging into my back. And how about the shoulder straps – do they take up space in the bag itself until I’m ready to use them?
I will admit the first worry was one of mine – but it was unnecessary. Arkel thinks these things out, and the result is that the hardware sits high enough and is angled out just right so that those hooks do not touch your back at all. And as for the straps, they nestle neatly beneath Velcro-snugged panels, not intruding on the inside of the bag at all.
The back of the bag isn’t the only interesting place. On the front you’ll see a small, waterproof zippered compartment for those little items you might want in a hurry, like a cell phone, car keys, change, and so on. The main compartment has what they call a “mushroom shaped” opening, allowing you a wide, easy access to the inside from the top – or zip it all the way open along the front for a a “suitcase”-style packing approach. Inside is also a zippered pocket, located near the top, that is perfect for your wallet. On the outside on each end, lie mesh pockets that can hold your water bottles.
You may be saying to yourself, yes, this sounds good, but I’m forgetting one thing. What about the helmet? Am I supposed to walk into the classroom, the office, the restaurant, with my helmet on? If I’m not wanting to leave my bag on my bike, I don’t want to leave my helmet, either!
No problem! This bag has another great feature: a front panel that’s attached at the bottom and secured via straps and buckles, that is designed to carry a bulky object like a helmet. It won’t interfere with the inside of the bag at all.

If you look at any well-organized home, you will notice that they all have a few things in common. One of the most prominent commonalities is that most things that take up space are categorized and contained. Categorized and contained are two words that you want to keep in mind at all times when decluttering every area of your home. Those two words alone are key for any plan for conquering clutter. Even if you did nothing else to declutter, categorizing and containing would go a long ways toward an organized home. Continue reading →

Some types of rugs are pretty easy to clean. No need for special treatment – you simply put them in the washing machine, add some cleaning detergent and you have your rug free of dirt and dust. Unfortunately, not all rugs can be wet cleaned. Some types require dry cleaning, while a small part of them need specialist care to return their good looks. Always adhere to cleaning tag, manufacturer’s tag or seller’s instructions. Continue reading →
You probably live and work near busy city areas and you definitely know how much dust and dirt all your home gets. The windows get dirty more frequently due to the high traffic, the carpets also get many dirt and grey stains and your furniture attracts much dust.

I was very reluctant, and very worried about ordering a casket online. But I did it for financial reasons, and hoped for the best. The casket was absolutely beautiful!! The order process was handled professionally, and and with kindness. I was told that casket would arrive the next day, and they would call the funeral home, and give them the delivery time. And that is exactly what happened. As a matter of fact the funeral director complimented us on how beautiful the casket was, and how nice, and professional the delivery people were. Please do not hesitate to order from this company, I highly recommend them!!
When I found out my husband had cancer and it would be terminal we started shopping around on line for a casket, we could not believe the price of a casket through the funeral home. We came across this website, we were a little wary of it, just because it was so important for us to receive it on time. My husband passed away on Tuesday afternoon, we called that evening around 8pm MST and placed the order. We paid to have it overnight and the funeral home received it on Thursday. Even the funeral director was impressed by the quality and beauty of the casket, as were we. Thank you so much.
Harris F. Home in Madisonville, ky ordered this for my father we where pleased with it ... as far as price it is the best for oversized caskets.... Thanks
My aunt told me about ordering casket online when my dad passed away. We did some research and found a great looking casket for my dad from here. We followed the tips that we read from this site and everything went smoothly, and we received the casket on time. It was a pleasant experience, and they are truely working 24/7, since I ordered it on 4th July weekend!
We would like to express our gratitude for your wonderful customer service during our sad time. Your driver stayed and waited to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. He was very kind and considerate. The individual that helped us with our casket choice, Belinda, was also very helpful. The casket was beautiful and we are telling everyone about your company. God bless you all. Sincerely, The Frazier Family
When my mother passed away the beginning of May and we went to the funeral home to purchase a casket. We could not believe how expensive the caskets were. The funeral director who is a good friend of the family said, we should try going on line and I came across your web site. I called and purchased the 3003 Mahogany Veneer Casket from a lady at Best Price Caskets. I was shocked when the casket showed up at the funeral home exactly as promised by the next morning. The funeral director was amazed how beautiful the casket was and when I told him I paid less then $1,000.00 plus $355 shipping he said, there was no way he could of bought a casket of this quality at that price. Thank you so much Best Price for making our experience a little easier.
My name is Joan Harris and I am from Canada. My Father-in-Law passed recently and my Pastor told me about a website called "Best Price Caskets", and boy did I get the "best price". Considering that I am in Canada and even with currency conversion I saved more than 60% on the cost compared to what the Funeral Home wanted to charge us. I had to pay some import tax to the Canadian Customs (13%) but The agents at "Best Price" handled our situation with complete Professionalism and I personally would recommend them to all my family and friends. My husband and I viewed the casket when it arrived today (we only ordered it yesterday afternoon) and boy were we surprised. The casket was breathtaking, the funeral representatives were all in awe - notwithstanding the fact that we paid less than half the amount they were charging us. Again, kudos to you all at "Best Price" and believe me you will have my business whenever the need arises. Congratulations on a job well done!!
I saved $3600 on the casket from www.BestPriceCaskets.com and saved another $850 on the funeral expenses by following tips I learned by reading their website before visiting the funeral home. I ordered the casket at 2pm on a Saturday and the funeral home received it when they opened on Sunday morning. The main thing they told me is to not tell the funeral home that I was buying an online casket until after they gave me in writing the itemized list of funeral and burial expenses. They said that if I tell them about the online casket beforehand, that the funeral home will simply add the lost $3000 profit to the price of the other funeral or burial expenses on the itemized list and I won't save any money. They said to not feel guilty about this because the funeral home only spends about 5 hours on a funeral. $3000 is enough for the funeral service. Thank You Best Price Caskets. Steven J Detroit
When my mother passed away the beginning of May we went to the funeral home to purchase a casket. We could not believe how expensive the caskets were. The funeral director who is a good friend of the family said, we should try going on line and I came across your web site. I purchased the 3003 Mahogany Veneer Casket. I was not off the phone two minutes and my phone rang and a representative from Best Price Caskets was calling me back confirming our order and telling us they were sorry for our loss. I was shocked that someone would take the time to call me back and not just to confirm the order but to see if there was any else we needed and if there was anything they could do. The casket showed up at the funeral home and the funeral director was amazed how beautiful the casket was. When I told him I paid less then $1,000.00 and free shipping he said, there was no way he could of gotten the least expensive casket at that price. Thank you so much for making Best Prce for making our experience a little easier.
I checked the funeral homes and I checked other online sites. I checked with my nephew, who is a Funeral Director, and would have gotten me a casket for cost. Best Price Caskets gave me the best price for the military casket I wanted for my husband. My nephew could not even find the casket I wanted anywhere else. I did have to pay to have it flown to GA from Dallas, TX, but it was a reasonable fee. I did get nervous about getting the casket and getting it in time, since I ordered the casket on a Friday morning and the service was on Monday with viewing on Sunday; but the casket arrived by noon on Saturday which was in plenty of time. I am very pleased with the kind, considerate treatment I received, especially AFTER the casket was paid for. As I said I got very nervous and call a few times concerning delivery, but they were always nice and helpful.
BestPriceCaskets saved us $3000 on our casket and futher told us how to shop for the best funeral home. We saved $3000 on the casket and an additional $2000 on the funeral service. This amounted to a total savings of a little over $5,000.00 Thanks again BestPriceCaskets. Mary Pheeny Arcade, NY
Best Price Caskets is the most ideal place to purchase a casket when you are on a budget. I first went to the funeral home to receive my quote and was told I would have to pay $3000 for a simple steel casket. After doing some brief research, I stumbled across this website and encoutered the same casket that I saw at the funeral home for $949. I was amazed by how fast the casket arrived, and would recommend this site to all of my friends and family. You can really save big!
I bought an online casket and saved $2000 I bought an online casket from www.BestPriceCaskets.com and saved $3000.00. I read the site beforehand and it told me how to do it. Go to the funeral home and show interest in their caskets (they think they will make an extra $3000-$4000 on the casket so they are more likely to discount the rest of the funeral) and ask for an itemized list from the funeral home of all expenses. Them that you have 3 other appointments that day for three other funeral homes and that you only have an hour to spend with them (They try to wear you down by holding you there for 8 hours and you are ready to sign anything). Push down on the Funeral expenses and burial costs. Then go to the second funeral home and repeat. Make sure you let them know that you still have to go to the Smith, Williams, and Jones funeral homes for prices. Develop some compitition. After checking around call the first one back up and tell them that you can do it if they can cut another $1000 off, after all you only get a 2 hour viewing, and 2 hour embalming, a dug hole and a $200 vault, really how much should this cost? When you go to the funeral home they will ask you questions like 1) Is there insurance 2) what do you and your husband do for a living 3) how many or whom will be paying All the above prices are really all about, how much can we charge you. Which itemized price sheet should I give you? This is not a good time to bring your nice car, to really dress up or try to impress this funeral director. A better story is my husband just lost his job 3 weeks ago, none of the rest of the family can help us, there is no insurance, I don't know how we are going to pay for this. We are going to 3 other funeral homes today and two tomorrow. We are going to be forced to go with the best price. Do not push down on the price of the casket. You will leave with your itemized list. Tell each funeral home that you will only have an hour to spend with him because you have other appointments. The average funeral home only does 50 funerals/year or 1 per week. They need to hit a home run. This idea of scheduling appointments, and how busy they are, well you get the idea. After all what is the suggested retail price of a funeral, embalming, limo ride, face and hair prep etc.? It is whatever they can get you to pay. Thank You

ABC Compounding, Inc. is a specialty chemical manufacturer of industrial cleaning supplies. Through decades of uninterrupted growth and profitability, the company has grown into a recognized leader in the industry. While ABC Compounding serves customers large and small, up to 60 percent of its sales are private-label products, distributed by regional and national janitorial supply companies.
“Sage X3 is a very complete business management solution, with a full set of integrated manufacturing, distribution, and financial components. It is highly flexible, yet at the same time it’s very intuitive to install, configure, and use.”
ABC Compounding was using an older manufacturing application that lacked essential tools such as planning, scheduling, and MRP. Multiple disparate applications were required to provide the minimum functionality needed. The company needed a scalable, fully integrated, enterprise solution that was flexible enough to adapt to its business requirements.
Sage X3 offers a comprehensive suite of manufacturing, distribution, and financial modules and a clear migration path from the company’s prior business software.
A rapid implementation helped speed overall ROI. MRP automates the creation of work orders, eliminating hours of manual data entry. Intercompany and inter-warehouse transfers of inventory are greatly streamlined and traceable. The broad functionality in Sage X3 means the company was able to abandon several third-party applications, saving money and duplicate efforts. Access to decision-making data is vastly improved.

Hi Alicia, We're finally back in Cape Town after an incredible few days at Shamwari. Can't believe that we're off home tomorrow. Back to reality. I have been getting non-stop compliments about the beautiful make-up and hair that you created. The look was so stunning, I can't thank you enough! Having you and Madeleine there with us on Thursday was a serious blessing & you both were absolute super stars!!! I loved my look and so did Ant - he couldn't believe his eyes!! Haha! All the best to you & I wish you so much happiness and love. Fxx Fran Reid
Dear Alicia I wanted to say a massive thank you for all your hard work, for me and for the bridesmaids and mum. The getting ready part of the day was one of my best parts of the whole thing – it was so special to have my favourite ladies around me and all be getting ready and made so beautiful together. I haven’t really seen any pictures yet, but in the few I have seen, we all look fantastic!! I particularly adored my hair – in the pictures I’ve seen, it just looks totally amazing – my dream hair! So thank you so much. And thank you for the make up, and making me feel like me but just more beautiful! You were so lovely and calming and thank you for helping me post-ceremony with my bra near-disaster! Errgh – that was a bad moment!! We had the most fantastic day ever. Thank you so much for everything.
Hi Alicia Thank you so much for doing the hair and makeup for our wedding - I felt like an absolute princess and the bridesmaids and moms looked absolutely stunning too :) It was also unbelievably kind of you stay and touch up my make-up after the ceremony. Your lovely personality and calming presence were an absolute blessing before our wedding and I'm sure all your brides feel the same. I would recommend you unreservedly to anyone looking for a hair and makeup artist. I have no doubt that your business will continue to grow from strength to strength. All my very best wishes for the future. Gina xx
Dear Alicia I hope you are well. I cannot believe that I have not thanked you yet for playing such a big role in making my wedding day so special! You truly are so fantastic at what you do and you made me feel so incredible :) You are such a beautiful person, inside and out, and I am so glad to have met you. So, thank you for my hair, for my make-up and for all the kind words! I really appreciate it. Love, Stacy-Leigh

Steve is the man. Respect the shit outta the dude. He has 2 serious time consuming, labor instensive jobs. And he manages to place well and look fantastic. That's what I call a badass.
Once his back thickens, watch out. It seemed to me like Steve and others depleted a lot throughout the European tour. I think Steve looked especially flat after a couple shows, and maybe he should stick with just two or three shows this year? but hey, if he is placing top 5 in all shows, who am I to argue?
Hi sir, If I want to use Arduino uno and Ethernet shield, do I have to modify code? And how do I wiring relay and board?
It is throwing me for a loop, my best guess is that I am experiencing higher boost levels than the WG spring is set for because of the GHL headers? Much like the Tail WG's are experiencing with the same headers???
356-930, and I have also been corresponding and he brought up a good point and question: shouldn't the boost peak just above the WG spring pressure, and then hold steady at that WG's spring rate, instead of tapering off, as shown in my boost chart?
Sean, you are right to show concern regarding the boost level because the W/G should control what you set. First check your W/G for proper function. Much of the A/F ratio problem is your uncontrolled manifold pressure and excess air.
After checking your W/G have you relocated the W/G pressure tap from it's stock location? Assuming the W/G is functioning properly, when I see a boost curve like yours it has been modified by electrics (modern) or relocation (old school) of the pressure tap controlling the W/G.
Next, but of lesser importance, your comment about the GHL headers may be contributing to the boost curve shape as their 90 degree branch off pipe from the base of the turbine inlet is widely known to be less than ideal for proper exhaust flow to a W/G. Basically, you are dealing with turbulant flow because of this improper design and stange things happen in turbulant flows.
Once you have control of the manifold pressure a slight boost overshoot is generally considered desirable for "response"....but not at 1.35bar.
yes, they are rolled 6061 made to T6 hardness according to their website. $1500 for the set sounds like a deal
Check fuses in the front hood area. Fuel pumps run off of a single 20amp fuse (assuming no one has messed with the factory wiring). There is a relay in the engine compartment which is supposed to shut off the fuel pumps in an overboost situation. This relay causes a lot of trouble for people so you might check that as well.
Do a search of this forum for overboost relay, or maybe just relay and you find lots of threads addressing the topic.
- I particularly want to call out the unique lighting angle that leaves the back half of the picture in shadow, including part of Mawile.
- The angle at which Beldum is drawn, combined with the fact that Mawile is positioned in the brightest part of the picture, almost makes it look like Beldum is shining the light on Mawile. I'm unsure if that was specifically intended, but it does naturally draw the viewer's eye in Mawile's direction, which is great composition.
- While the girl's eyes are beautiful and vibrant, the bottom part of her face doesn't have much detail. Her mouth especially looks more like an emoji than a real mouth. The overall appearance is a flat field of color.
- I think the composition could have been tightened up just a hair by bringing Mawile a little closer to the girl and Beldum. It felt like I had to move my eye just a bit too far to switch between looking at one or the other. I found my eye resting in the empty space between them a little too often.
There's really not much else that could be improved in the context of a Hard ranked Pokemon. Therefore, Mawile is captured.
Thanks for curating as soon as the update got in!! Definitely see the space issue there, i liked the landscape orientation but my eyes move to the empty space as well... For the mouth I definitely do the triangle a lot lol, probably wasnt the best match for the composition tho. Claiming Mawile, thanks again!!

Gonna probably be checking out crysis 3 also very soon. Although I havent co-op 'd yet on the ps3 my initial observations are the 360 is more user friendly on that end. As time and opportunity permits a deeper determination will be made.
Its been a long time since i was into fighting games, although at one time i really enjoyed them sf2 in particular and i liked tekken quite a bit. With co-op and online play options so much more available, though, i expect a revisit may well be in order. Being a gamefly member i may indeed check out a fighting game again. And from what ive heard of that particular personna game its quite good. I myself dont have a vita, but know many who do... im enjoying Dead Space 3 atm!!!
Don't be mistaken, though. Persona 4 Arena is a fighting game done by the same folks that did Guilty Gear. Persona 4 Golden (Golden Abyss...? I think Uncharted was in my head) is the remake of Persona 4 on the vita. Sorry for the mix-up.
Persona 4 is really, really good. It has to be the last great hurrah game the PS2 got. Games like that reminded me why I played so many JRPG's last console generation.
I did everything I needed to do in Aliens so I'm trading that in as soon as possible, such an awful game. At the moment I'm going through both Sniper Elite V2 and Fist of The North Star: Ken's Rage.
Sniper Elite is a lot of fun and is a definite play, more so if you do enjoy sniping in other shooters. It has realistic bullet drop and wind is a factor on the higher difficulties, it's not just aim at head at any distance and get a shot like standard shooters. An X-Ray cam (that is really, really gruesome at times depending on where you hit a guy) adds flair to the game and tons of "Oh man!" moments to the game. Shooting a guy and having the bullet travel through his chest, only to exit out his back while severing the spine never stops being the gruesome sight it is.
Ken's Rage is made by Koei, so it's pretty much Dynasty Warriors in terms of how it plays. I've always had a soft spot for the Warriors games, despite how repetitive and little they change. Games like this are good to play for a few mindless hours or to play concurrent with other games. I also do enjoy the Fist of The North Star series so it is pretty fun to roll through town making dudes explode while Kenshiro spouts the deadly serious dialogue that he always does.
Cool I think i own personna 3 although its never been played. Personna golden is getting positive vibes over at psxe. Finished dead space 3 recently and have crysis 3 for either xbox or ps3 up in my queue next for rent have heard its good. Bioshock infinite in 4 weeks! Be there!
I finally managed to pull myself away from Street Fighter X Tekken for a little bit to enjoy Mass Effect 1. I've played and beaten ME1 at least 3 times now. As much as a technical hiccup it is I still enjoy the game even though ME2 is clearly better. I just got Liara in the crew. Playing as female Shepard, and she's a soldier.
Mass Effect is something I've been meaning to finish, but I've been "playing" the first one off/on for the last three years...:p
I'll always pick the sequels when they get cheap (got ME2 for $10 and ME3 for $15) but man, it seems so daunting to try and go back to it. I'd start over, but I think I'm too far into ME1 to even consider that.
Good to see you around, Dragon!!!! We have actually taken on the image of a semi-active forum again so be sure and re-visit soon! As for me, ive been absolutely loving Darksiders 2!!! Highly recommended, its one of my favs of this generation and the single player experience. Im highly anticipating the release of Bioshock Infinite and i started a thread over at Psxextreme to get the hype going!!! I had been renting mostly but am buying this game i dont plan on stopping playing it anytime soon!!! Hang out and lets keep this ball rolling!!!
I haven't gotten deep into the game yet, and I'm still getting used to the controls, but I'm enjoying this game. The better I get at this game the more hooked I become because the combat just feel so good. If there's a story I don't know about it because I haven't been paying attention to it. A lot of games these days are lacking in the fun department, and lacking the replay value that I look for. I feel MGR:R brought me out of my funk simply because of how fun and satisfying it is. I'm hearing it's a short game, but that gives me even more fuel to replay the game on a higher difficulty, especially since you actually unlock meaningful stuff for beating the game on higher difficulties (I'd much rather unlock costumes than pay for them)
I also took someone's advice and ordered DmC: Devil May Cry. I'm expecting it to arrive between today and tomorrow. I don't expect to have his reactions and claim it's the best in the series, but I do expect to have fun and feel satisfied. The combat looks like it'll have that satisfying feel to it, especially after a long day at work. I also hear that this game is fairly short, but again, that's giving me a reason to replay the game.
I'm also trading in a buttload of games (pretty much doing an overhaul in a way). I'm keeping the Metal Gears, Uncharteds, Mass Effects, Halos, Devil May Crys, Ninja Gaidens, and my fighters, but everything else is gone. Not exactly sure what I'll be getting in return.
Finally made it through darksiders 2! Wow what a big game its not the short borderline rental games we see so much of nowadays. Very fun though and never lacking for challenge! Im going to download the soundtrack today its very good. Getting ready for bioshock infinite this tuesday gonna check out uncharted 3 for a few days in the interim.
I really need to start playing the Uncharted series, or at least Uncharted 2 and 3, but I can never get in the mood to actually play them.
In any case, I've started up DmC: Devil May Cry recently and it's not nearly as bad as fans make it out to be, but it's not as great as some review sites make it out to be either. To be honest, as big a DMC fan I am, my initial reaction when the game was first shown was definitely more on the negative side because of the look. The head guy at NT made Dante resemble himself, and that was a turnoff, but I got over that fairly quick when they changed him up. Anyway, the combat is nice, but they kinda dropped the ball without having a lock-on, and then to top it off you're forced to fight the enemies with a specific type of weapon, and while that's not a deal breaker for me, it does take away the freedom for playing the way you want. With that being said, though, it's still a good game.
With that being said I did put it aside to play Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3. Having a bit of a team crisis at the moment, but I am understanding the game a bit more. Originally I thought the game was super fast, but in the end you really have to take your time. And then the game is just pure fun. Some of the characters I've been dabbling with are Dante (he's just pure fun and my favorite character in the game), Wolverine, Vergil (did I mention how big a fan I am of DMC, but he is on the boring side though), Hawkeye, Spencer, Nova, Taskmaster, and Magneto. I'm also considering Strider as well.
Oh yeah, I also beat Metal Gear Rising: Revegeance as well. It's a good game with tons of replay value, but there are some things that could've been left out. Stealth in this game is just in the way. They have moments in the game where they tell you stealth is the best approach, but the game itself just encourages you to throw stealth out the window and go nuts. I don't recall you being graded on stealth either. It felt horribly tacked on. Speaking of tacked on, the sub weapons. I found no reason to use them what-so-friggin-ever. They really could've been used to include more blades to upgrade or something. But overall, it's a good game.
the team looked a lot better today. Aiton will be confirmed early in the week and apparently Crosby will join for the rest of the season too. They’ll go straight into the squad if true.
Young Mikolaj has done great this year but it's understandably looking a bit much for him last few weeks so can understand Crosby signing.
Wouldn't have thought either will be great signings but they are 2 bodies at a time when bodies aren't available and in desperate times needs must I suppose.
This is a must win game, no doubt about it. But a win might not be enough, as we are relying on results elsewhere to go our way.
Funny seeing you write that every week then hear the real Kevin Sinfield say in his presser last night, “is there such a thing as a must win game”
Ferres has been getting better recently looks to have shed the weight, just needs to stop the needless high shots.
If Ferres "improving" continues to mean stupid cheap penalties throughout the game id rather just pay him off & ditch him.

I think the reason the fest stays in control and is put on by MEMBERS and NOT COMPANIES is simple. A company (not saying anything towards you smoothe) could potentially come in and put it on then claim right to it as "their event" and that isn't wanted or going to happen. It's a club event run by club members. Don't need what happened to Burning Man.
In Matthew's (smooth's) defense, he might not have been aware that TDIFest was "...put on by MEMBERS and NOT COMPANIES…" Just my $0.02.
Can it be done during the summertime, BEFORE Labor Day? I have 2 + months off in the summertime & would love to attend one of these events but the Labor Day Holiday is a no go!
It could be (and has been) done but I think attendance would suffer because most people are available on the three-day weekend that is Labor Day.
The reason it is usually on the Labor Day weekend is because Canada uses the same weekend for their Labour Day; probably the only shared three-day weekend for our two countries. It would be nice to make July 1st through July 4th an annual Canadian/USA holiday; as it is we have to wait until July 1st falls on a Friday as the closest thing (next year is one).
I will just be happy to attend the TDIFest this year. So I will block the week before Labor/Labour Day and a week or two after it for a long road trip.
I really didn't mean for TDIFest to be in July; I was just thinking that with Canada Day & Independence Day so close, it would be nice to have a "joint" 4 day holiday; toss in Bastille Day (for the Quebecois) and it could be a 14-day holiday!
I'll throw out a little update, a budget for 2015 is being worked on. If anybody has a winning lottery ticket they'd like to donate, we can really go all-out!

I am new here and looking for some advice, I have suddenly found out I have 3 weeks off work (visa issues - i'm from england) and so want to do some bike touring so that i'm not just wasting my free time. I live in Calgary, so want to do around an 8 day solo cycle tour in kananaskis, kootenay and yoho, but from all the information i've read its still way too early and the winter gates are still closed and at best i might be able to do a big circle around it all rather than meandering through the parks themselves.
Has anyone done much cycle touring in this area and have any advice for me, particularly on the time of year? I would also love to go offroad a bit on mountain bike trails but i spoke to the visitor centres and they pretty much seemed shocked that I even asked! My guidebook says that they open in may though and I would be looking at going on or just before the 1st of May.
Also advice on what you believe are the best and most scenic routes would be great, I'm not looking for the hardest and most challenging routes although i am capable of them if need be, but i mostly enjoy seeing the scenery and spotting wildlife than pushing myself to the limits!
Really, you would be advised not to cycle on the trails up in the mountains...since the weather is unpredictable at this time of year. Calgarians are accustomed to freak snowstorm..even in July. And the city is not even in the mountains/higher elevation.
The ground is still muddy/slippery and soft with melting snow on higher elevation. I know because a work colleague who does go skiing, and hiking, spent last weekend with his girlfriend in Canmore town, not doing a whole lot: not worth hiking in. And he knows Canmore/Kanaskaskis area.
This is not England at all. It is wilderness with animals and bears like to come down eventually too to get more food. We have travelled by car on the Bow Valley Parkway in spring, which should be ok on the roads. But still no, not go cycling on the trails in the parks. But again, the big if, is sudden weather changes...very different from Calgary at times...meaning colder, snowier and icier.
Frankly I don't think it's that pretty at this time of year, the deciduous trees are still abit bare and brown.
Have you gone skiing/snowshoeing or snowboarding this winter in Banff/Kanaskaskis or Canmore area or Lake Louise? Lake Louise got a ton of snow, at least quadruple the amount compared to Calgary. We were there snowshoeing in January.
Yes Yoho National Park is gorgeous..Marble Canyon, etc. For a 1-2 day ride around the edges of the parks, etc. on paved roads, would be better. If I was in your shoes, I would wait another 2 wks. or so.

2013-09-26 16:08:25 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: OK...let's get DP and see what we have to work with today
2013-09-26 16:09:13 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the NYSE CO breadth MCO gave us our obligatory bounce higher today
2013-09-26 16:11:10 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: this would suggest that we're likely to see additional strength near term
2013-09-26 16:11:22 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and a challenge of the recent price highs that we saw last week
2013-09-26 16:12:44 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and, of course, this also completes the snapback to what was the previous price highs on the daily chart
2013-09-26 16:13:11 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: they just need to see some end of month follow through to get things moving
2013-09-26 16:13:37 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: we also saw a bounce higher today in the NYSE Composite breadth MCO
2013-09-26 16:13:55 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and this has allowed the NYSE Composite breadth MCSUM to move to around the +297 level
2013-09-26 16:15:10 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the NASDAQ composite closed within single digit points of new recovery highs today
2013-09-26 16:15:30 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: while the NASDAQ breadth MCO was able to not only bounce higher
2013-09-26 16:16:03 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: but it also took out a blip resistance point that can be seen on the close up chart
2013-09-26 16:16:33 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and there is a definite triangular shape to the pattern
2013-09-26 16:17:10 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and higher price highs should be the near term result of any breakout that might come about during this same time
2013-09-26 16:17:47 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: how the angle of ascent continues to increase as we move along in time
2013-09-26 16:19:38 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: this is usually the set up right before we have an increase in the volatility of the price pattern itself
2013-09-26 16:20:25 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: so we'll watch with interest how this time will turn out to be
2013-09-26 16:20:53 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: we are now only 200 points away from reaching our longer term upside price target on the NASDAQ of 4000
2013-09-26 16:21:16 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: which was given back at the start of the rally...in December of last year
2013-09-26 16:23:41 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: it too moved to new highs with this same MCO zero line crossover
2013-09-26 16:24:16 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: still...the buyers need some good follow through here to move above the +1000 level
2013-09-26 16:24:49 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: it's not a matter of IF, it's only a matter of "when" this will actually take place
2013-09-26 16:24:53 [Message] thespookyone -> Chat: do these inverted ledges mean we are going into the last move of the segment-which would make sense time wise anyway?
2013-09-26 16:25:49 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: there are times in which we can have a ledge and then see a fishhook
2013-09-26 16:26:30 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the odds are the greatest that a termination point in the MCSUM is taking place when a ledge formation appears on any downside sequence
2013-09-26 16:26:58 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: but you can play up the market based on the worry factor, and then having clarity
2013-09-26 16:28:49 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the natural tendency of what each money flow sequence brings is then fulfilled
2013-09-26 16:29:35 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: notice also that the worry continues on this "tapering" distraction
2013-09-26 16:30:00 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: I read that 3 Fed Governors say that they will "taper" in October
2013-09-26 16:31:38 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the time to worry here would be when no one makes any remarks on this latest buzzword that was "invented" by the media
2013-09-26 16:33:05 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: what we do know is that the odds of our breaking to the upside in all of the MCSUM's is better than 50%
2013-09-26 16:33:23 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and that we do have various areas of resistance still needing to be taken out along the way
2013-09-26 16:34:01 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: but for the majority its a declining tops line connecting spring and summer MCSUM highs
2013-09-26 16:34:31 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: it's still something that we should acknowledge as a potential rally killer
2013-09-26 16:34:53 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: especially now that we do have some inverted ledges in play
2013-09-26 16:35:12 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the rubber won't meet the road until we get closer to these same trendline challenges
2013-09-26 16:35:50 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and we should just work with what the market gives us and be prepared (as always) for anything that might prove to be "different"
2013-09-26 16:36:24 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: with the inverted ledge still in place on the SPX breadth MCSUM
2013-09-26 16:38:14 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: pretty much the same thing with the OEX breadth MCO and MCSUM
2013-09-26 16:40:24 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: as we're about to challenge the MID MCSUM gap resistance zone
2013-09-26 16:41:20 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: but there wasn't a lot of push to these highs by the SML breadth MCO
2013-09-26 16:41:36 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: there wasn't enough to even move above last week's blip resistance area
2013-09-26 16:42:28 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: close above the intraday highs that were seen on Tuesday
2013-09-26 16:43:01 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and we saw a small bounce higher as well in the TM breadth MCO
2013-09-26 16:43:25 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and you can see how this has generated a larger post expansion to the upside in the TM breadth MCSUM
2013-09-26 16:43:57 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: though we didn't see a lot of conviction from the buy side
2013-09-26 16:44:12 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: this was more than offset by a bigger lack of conviction from the sell side
2013-09-26 16:44:50 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: as we're still looking for the trigger for our small point change that we had yesterday on the NYSE breadth MCO
2013-09-26 16:45:59 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: it wasn't enough to move above last Tuesday's blip resistance
2013-09-26 16:47:01 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: we have a crossover buy going in the XLY MCO components
2013-09-26 16:48:45 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: as the XLP breadth MCO had a swing of over 225 data points from last weeks highs to yesterday's lows
2013-09-26 16:49:02 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and that pretty much puts this index at a neutral rating
2013-09-26 16:49:27 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: notice here that the XLP breadth MCSUM was decisively turned away from the important +500 level
2013-09-26 16:49:55 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: so, for now, it would probably be a good idea to look to other sectors for potential upside leadership
2013-09-26 16:50:55 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: that our idea of Aunt Minnie and Uncle Charley plowing their monies in after last Wednesday's Fed announcement got tired of waiting and moved into more conservative, defensive issues
2013-09-26 16:52:21 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: as the XLE breadth MCO, the components, and the MCSUM are all at their zero lines
2013-09-26 16:52:52 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: so if everyone is closer to being a winner than a loser
2013-09-26 16:53:11 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the odds suggest that the bulls are probably going to try to make a go of it first
2013-09-26 16:53:25 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and then we'll see if they have any staying power behind them
2013-09-26 16:53:54 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the XLF breadth MCO did bounce off its zero line today
2013-09-26 16:54:23 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: we see that this last move lower was probably more of profit taking than any kind of sell signal
2013-09-26 16:54:50 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: based on the fact that we saw a lot of upside texture in the pattern going into the recent MCO highs
2013-09-26 16:55:25 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: notice also at how the price pattern continues to hold at the $20 level
2013-09-26 16:57:43 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the internals, however, continue to say that we're not done yet on the upside
2013-09-26 16:58:23 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: the XLV also took it on the defensive chin this past week
2013-09-26 16:58:56 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: so much so that the XLV breadth MCO moved to a minimal "oversold" reading of -62
2013-09-26 17:00:03 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: it would appear that the XLV price structure should remain with an upside bias
2013-09-26 17:00:24 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and a test of the trendline on the year chart will probably be challenged short term
2013-09-26 17:01:08 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: but now its also taken out its horizontal resistance point
2013-09-26 17:01:32 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: we should continue to see good strength in both the Dow Industrials and the Dow Transports over the next several weeks
2013-09-26 17:02:00 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: with the near term problem of seeing what will happen as we get closer to the +1250 level
2013-09-26 17:02:21 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: we should know more on that by the middle part of next week
2013-09-26 17:02:57 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: we're getting a lot of conflicting signals with the XLB data
2013-09-26 17:03:16 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: where breadth of market is not showing any real support at current price levels
2013-09-26 17:03:32 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: so it probably won't be too surprising if we see a near term shake out there
2013-09-26 17:04:07 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: there's not really enough as yet to call the current condition a problem
2013-09-26 17:04:29 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: more like we need to see a reset here so that the engine timing is a bit better
2013-09-26 17:05:11 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: not a lot there to hang our collective hats on though
2013-09-26 17:05:32 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: so it's probably better to continue to watch this one from the sidelines
2013-09-26 17:06:00 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: though a new closing high might be something to work with
2013-09-26 17:06:34 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and the XLU price pattern continues to move within a large trading range
2013-09-26 17:07:50 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: it would seem that last weeks rush to move into defensive issues has come and gone
2013-09-26 17:08:01 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: and that the only real leader here right now is with the XLI
2013-09-26 17:08:31 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: with several others showing some resemblance to wanting to continue to be positive
2013-09-26 17:08:55 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: where hopefully we'll have a better handle on next week
2013-09-26 17:09:31 [Message] fib_1618 -> Chat: VTO's continue to hang in there suggesting that we're trending

I recently learned about this fake cake concept- where you might have the top two layers as "real cake" and the bottom tier or two is actually fake.. You cut it, hen they wheel it away and serve sheet cake behind the scenes and no one knows!
I almost did that, but found an awesome cake girl to do a cake for me for my budget, and all three tiers amazing flavored cake. No fake crap. Awesome price. She lives in lawrenceville, want her info, message me. She did an awesome job! Love her. And found her the last 2wks out because we couldn't find someone to do all 3 tier cake for my price range and for good cakes. I bake cakes, but not decorative ones yet, and I know good cake, she rocked it. My maid of honor found her.
Can I get some help with this. Since updating to the newest version. I can't select or change the time pcc speaks the weather forcast. I can go in settings in see the times for 2 separate entries. I have tried modifying the time there. But it never saves. Am I doing something wrong here?
I believe the announcement needs to be setup in the timer section of the settings page and you need to specify days as well as a single time of day.
Sorry for the delay. Been awfully busy. But you are right, obviously. Apparently it's been a long time since I changed the timer or I had an older version that did the time management under the weather screen. But I was able to successfully locate the timer section and adjust the weather announcement time. Thank you very much, yet again.
Nvidia today urgently informed their partners about the corrections made to their last generation G92 based single-chip solutions line-up, because they were expecting the competition in the mainstream segment to get more aggressive. First of all, they reduced the recommended prices on their GeForce 9800 GTX solution that will now be available for $199.
A newer modification of this graphics card, GeForce 9800 GTX+, will be competing against the new Radeon HD 4850. According to the report on Tweaktown site, the new solution will have its chip frequency increased from 675/1688MHz to 738/1836MHz. As a result, GTX+ model should be about 10% faster than the regular GeForce 9800 GTX. GeForce 9800 GTX+ should supposedly be available in the market for something around $229 retail price.
Among the innovative features of the new GeForce 9800 GTX+ the manufacturer lists support of PhysX and Folding@Home as well as some other CUDA optimized applications, however, this advantage may be available to other Nvidia graphics cards, too. Of course, GeForce 9800 GTX+ will continue to support SLI and 3-Way SLI.
doesn't matter, the local sellers like galaxy etc will keep selling the product at inflatted prices.
local gamers will be paying the original price (when the card came out) for the next few yrs in pakistan.

agrees with abbas jin,,oh they are quick to INCREASE the price of the product if the dollar fluctuates,,,but reduce it, never,,,i have myself gone to Marsons (the people who control the intel processor prices in pakistan) and these guys are always calling people abroad and increasing prices,,,the new computer prices are sligthly more more inflated in lahore in karachi as well..
the only way the consumer can win is to find a juggar in one of the big dealors here and then they can find a lower price,,,for eg, this guy i know buys core 2duo processor e4500 for rs 6500, while the actual price is 7800,,,

Vancouver Renewable Energy (VREC) powered up the 590kW system in Canada’s newest and northernmost province in September.
In just three weeks the PV system had produced 590kWh of power, saving hundreds of dollars on the municipal power bill for the remote, 1,500-person hamlet. The community otherwise relies on a diesel “tank farm” and generator plant for its power needs – an expensive proposition now helped by clean, renewable solar and APsystems microinverter technology.
The new array will be paired with a mural celebrating light, both from the sun and from qulliqs, traditional Inuit lamps that use animal fat as for fuel, according to the Vancouver Renewable Energy blog.
APsystems offers advanced, powerful solar microinverter technology for residential and commercial systems. The APsystems solar solution combines highly efficient power inversion with a user-friendly monitoring interface to bring you reliable, intelligent energy. Our proprietary system architecture increases solar harvest and ensures maximum output for solar arrays, and we continue to develop new technologies and products for the marketplace.
At APsystems, we are committed to providing the highest quality service to our customers and partners around the world.

There are many concerns today over how education technology companies protect data and whether they profit from the sale of that data or advertising. From its launch in 2004, School Loop has never and will never sell any student or parent data (or any system data for that matter). We don't sell ads or carry advertising. And we regularly review and update our industry-standard security practices and systems.
Password Security. All passwords are treated securely and one-way encrypted. We cannot decrypt the passwords and do not provide information concerning Admin accounts (ROOT Admin, container Admin, local administrator or domain administrator) or their equivalent to any persons. We encourage our districts to use LDAP integration so that they have complete control over user access and passwords.
Security of District Systems. We never gain or try to gain unauthorized access to or modify district systems including file servers, routers, switches, NdS and Internet services.
Privacy. We adhere to all provisions of the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 123g), California Education Code and district policies regarding the protection and confidentiality of data. We consider all data collected in the course of our duties to be protected and confidential. Release of this data can only be authorized by district leadership and by appropriate state and federal officials.
With regards to FERPA and the use of School Loop, in general, districts are guided by the U.S. Department of Education's ruling on Edline and the Clark County School District (Las Vegas, Nevada). Edline was competitor offering similar services. The Department of Education conclusion is as follows:
Based on the information provided, it appears that the arrangement schools within the District have with Edline meets these requirements for disclosing specified information from education records to Edline as a "school official" under this FERPA exception. In particular, 1) Edline provides online hosting services that permit parents to view some of their children's education records, and Edline uses the information from education records to perform those services that would otherwise be provided by school employees; 2) Edline's online access services provide it with "legitimate educational interests" in the information disclosed to Edline by each school; and 3) Edline's use and maintenance of personally identifiable information from education records is subject to the direct control of each school within the District. Each school or the District must ensure that Edline does not redisclose or permit the redisclosure of any personally identifiable information from education records except as specifically authorized by the school or District that is responsible for the contract. The school (or District), in turn, remains responsible for any FERPA violations committed by its service provider. In that regard, we note that Edline takes reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that information from education records is not disclosed or made available to other parties and does not use the information for any other purpose.
Based on this guidance, districts in California and across the country use systems like School Loop and stay within the law.
As noted, School Loop offers a variety of account types and settings that help districts enforce their policies. These accounts have access to different types of content. Access to those accounts can be controlled in various ways.
School Loop offers roles for certificated employees (teachers, principals, and certificated staff), classified employees (we call those accounts Associates), parents, students, and a class of account we label Afterschool Professional (ASP). ASP accounts are optional for districts and allow districts and parents to approve accounts for tutors, social workers, people who run after school programs, and others they deem fit.
Parents and students can only see their own grades and attendance information, and other such information published specifically to them as members of classes and schools. Parents and students self-register, and districts are given the choice of approving each account before any access is granted (approval being whatever process they set up to verify that the registrant is legit), or allowing limited access to parents and requiring verification for grades and attendance. Additionally, all parents and students have a tool that allows them to challenge the membership of any other person who registers as a parent. This Challenge tool sends an alert to administrators, and admins can then suspend or delete the account, ignore the challenge, or ask for more information.
School Loop has account types for administrators, certificated staff, classified staff, other non-staff members, students, and parents. Each type of account is designed to align with privacy regulations. Districts assign these roles, so it is the district's responsibility to ensure that individuals are assigned the correct type of account.
The combination of account types, access rights, control over account registration, and control over access to content has proved successful at helping hundreds of districts enforce their privacy policies in different ways. In addition, there are a variety of fine-tuning settings that allow you to further limit access, mask the identity of a student, and restrict parent accounts for students.
Over our history, we have repeatedly refined these tools to help districts use School Loop safely and within their policy guidelines. We are quite concerned over privacy and protecting students, and take our responsibilities to do so seriously.
Transport: We provide a secure channel encrypted via SFTP or SMTP for the district to send us data. We do not have direct access to district systems.
External Security: We secure our system against external hacking and attacks. We use CloudFlare to protect our services against various denial of service attacks. Our servers are protected behind Juniper and Cisco firewalls and are hardened to restrict access to only those services required for operation. All administrative access occurs over an SSL encrypted connection with dual-factor authentication.
Internal Security: We secure our system against internal hacking and attacks. District data is protected by segmenting the data into databases that can only be accessed through district portals. When a district uploads encrypted data, the import server determines the appropriate portal and sends the encrypted data to that portal. A process on the portal decrypts and processes the data, importing it into the database where it can be accessed only by that particular portal. The data is never decrypted by the import server and any transitory copy of the data is deleted upon transmission to the portal.
Database backups are performed on a daily basis and are encrypted in memory using 256-bit AES before they are ever written to disk. Encrypted backups are retained on the backup server for three days, on a local archive server for 45 days, and on an off-site archive server for 90 days. One monthly encrypted backup is retained perpetually while the district is under contract. Access to all backup and archive servers is restricted exclusively to School Loop administrative staff via the aforementioned VPN.
District Access to District Data: During the term of our contract with a district, the district has complete access to all District Data.
Handling Data at Contract Termination: Upon termination of an executed contract we will depersonalize all personally identifiable data within 60 days. We will also destroy the data.
Students Access to Student Created Content. Students can download content they create via link available in their DropBox.
Third-party use of Data. We do not allow third-parties use of student information beyond those purposes defined in the executed contract with the district.
School Loop receives personally identifiable information directly from parents, legal guardians and students and as exported from the district and imported into School Loop. Parents, legal guardians and students can view any personally identifiable information they enter or that we import from the district. Parents, legal guardians and students can correct any information they enter. Corrections to information from the district must be made by the district.
Data Security. We take the following steps to ensure that student data is kept secure. Confidential Student data is stored in a database that can only be accessed via user login at the school portal or mobile app. The portal application allows access to the student data only by (1) the student (2) the student's parents, (3) certificated members of the school staff (4) After-School Professional who have been approved by approved parents. Districts can set the approval process for parent access to require that parent's establish their identity to a staff member. See the FERPA discussion above for more detail.
Notification of Breach. The following is our procedure to communicate with affected parents, legal guardians and eligible students if there is an unauthorized disclosure of student records:
School Loop implements industry-standard security procedures for storing and accessing information to avoid the loss or theft of any data, with an emphasis on protecting personal data, defined as login credentials, permanent student IDs, addresses, phone numbers. If we detect a breach involving the loss or theft of personal data our notification plan is as follows:
School Loop CEO, CTO, IT Lead, and Support Lead will meet to discuss what is known about the breach and identify the steps necessary to resolve the issue.
The Support Team will notify affected districts and explain the actions we have taken, our plan moving forward, and the timeline for resolution. Our goal is resolution within 72 hours.
We will notify affected users, explain the impact of the breach, our plan moving forward, and the timeline for resolution, in conjunction with the district. District may elect to notify users independently and directly.
If more than 500 users are affected, a notice of breach will be posted on our corporate website, unless such notification is restricted by legal authorities.
We will notify the district, provide details of the resolution, and outline safeguards to prevent a recurrence.
We will notify affected users, provide details of the resolution, outline safeguards to prevent a recurrence, and define steps they can take to safeguard their information, all in conjunction with the district, unless such notification is restricted by legal authorities.
In California, by law, if more than 500 residents are affected, the Attorney General will be notified.
Data and Third-Parties Post Contract. We certify that student records will not be available to a third party once the district contract has expired or is canceled.
No Target Advertising. We do not use personally identifiable information from student records to target advertising to students.
No Target Advertising. We do not sell or carry advertising, and we do not target advertising on our website or any other website using information acquired from students.
No Student Profile. We do not create a profile for a student except for school purposes as defined in an executed contract with the District.
Information Disclosure. We do not disclose student information unless for legal, regulatory, judicial, or safety reasons, and then only to authorized parties and with the approval of the district.
Reasonable Security Practices. Student information is protected through reasonable security procedures and practices. Student information is stored in a database that is accessible only via the portal that hosts the student's school. And student information transmitted from the district is encrypted before leaving the district computers and not decrypted until it is processed by the portal itself. Any backups of the portal database are encrypted before they are ever stored on disk.
Deletion of Student Data. Upon termination of an executed contract we will dispose of all personally identifiable data and transfer that data to the district within 60 days of the end of the contract.
Information Disclosure when Required by Law. We will disclose student information when required by law, and to authorized educational agencies when requested.

The main condition for life to exist is balance. A person can be considered healthy when there is a balance between their body and mind. Seeking this is programmed within us. When we get tired physically, the mental realization of tiredness warns us that it’s time to rest and restore our energy. That’s how the balancing forces restore balance.
Every living organism seeks balance according to the internal law of life. This law works in every creature from the time they are born. In their first moments of life, an animal or a person learns a lesson from the balancing forces – to maintain their balance in order to move around. Later it becomes automatic. As an organism develops, its interactivity and relationships with the environment become more complex and difficult. In each conflict with the environment, the laws of balance come into force. After breaking these laws, our body informs us about this with the first symptoms of an illness. Illness is a signal that we have lost our balance or gone to an extreme.
You have probably already noticed that most children have uncomplicated forms of illnesses. They also tend to recover very fast, whereas chronic and incurable diseases are more common to adults. After breaking the balance principle, simple disorders are sent to a person at…
Of course, it’s not easy to be in harmony in modern life. The statistics of disease don’t bring any joy, but the balance between the body and mind can be recovered. It shouldn’t be difficult, because an organism is constantly seeking it by itself. Illness is a signal that the balance is broken, but until realizing the fact of illness, other signals try to get our attention. Many of us don’t react to these either. They begin with simple things – constant fatigue or mental tension. Nowadays, talking about immunity to various illnesses is a hot top topic. But many investigators have come to the conclusion that it isn’t the amount of vitamins that determines a person’s strength, but their mental condition.
Don’t be angry with yourself – remember that it’s you who earned the illness, and thank it sincerely for the opportunity to make a change.

If you want to make the most out of your business, and of course that you do, besides offering quality products or services, you also need to have channel marketing, a useful and challenging addition to a company's marketing mix.
If done right, it brings great value to your business - both in terms of larger market coverage as well as revenues.
As Channel Marketing Manager, I have witnessed that building a valuable partnership over the years with channel partners, created opportunities that turned into sales. The secret sauce of channel partner success is twofold. At one hand, by understanding your customers and their needs. At the other hand, by connecting to and cooperating with your channel partners.
Customers' needs should be identified and the added value and demand for their products and services must be promoted. One very efficient way of doing so is by having a dedicated channel marketing manager who acts as the facilitator between you and your customers.
This strategy is being embraced by more and more companies nowadays that want to understand the added value and importance of channel marketing.
It’s not easy to handle the main challenge of building trust and keeping the channel partners motivated and interested.
That’s why companies support their channels partners with a newsletter to keep them abreast of the latest developments and hold webinars to enhance their knowledge in an easy and convenient way.
When focusing on developing the knowledge of your channel partners through easy access to a Resource Center, a Channel Portal and online sales training, it empowers them to identify potential customers, generate awareness of solutions and keep them interested in selling your offerings through incentive plans such as Channel Partner Programs.
By keeping them motivated and showing them the benefits of partnering with you, the company will get a competitive advantage.
More than anything, you must prepare a solid strategy before taking action and channel marketing will prove to be quite a significant aid to your business.

My laptop charger broke about two weeks ago and after what feels like an eternity my new one has FINALLY arrived. Now back to what this blog is all about....
Pink pearl pop is a beautiful pink that is ideal for summer and I have found myself reaching for it almost everyday. Its a creamsheen formula so is smooth and moisturising on the lips but still has great pigmentation and lasts a good few hours before needing to be reapplied. I could go as far as saying this is one of my favourite lipsticks (and that is a massive statement from someone with as many lipsticks as me) and I couldn't recommend this enough!!!

Fourteen US women senators pressed Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah in a letter Tuesday to lift his country's unique ban on women drivers, calling it a big step forward on human rights.
"We strongly believe it is time to abolish the prohibition on women driving once and for all, especially in light of Saudi Arabia's role as a newly elected member of the board of UN Women -- an entity dedicated to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women worldwide," they wrote.
They noted the king's appointment of the first woman deputy minister in Saudi Arabia and the establishment of a university that allows women to study alongside men and permits women to drive motor vehicles on campus.
"These are important steps, but more must be done and lifting the driving ban would be a critical step forward," they wrote.
There is no law banning women from driving, but the interior ministry imposes regulations based on a fatwa, or religious edict, stipulating that women should not be permitted to drive.
A group of defiant Saudi women got behind the wheels of their cars on June 17 in response to calls for nationwide action to break the ban.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton publicly threw her support behind the campaign, saying that "what these women are doing is brave, and what they are seeking is right."
The icon of the campaign was Manal al-Sharif, a 32-year-old computer security consultant, who was arrested on May 22 and detained for 10 days after posting on YouTube a video of herself driving her car around the eastern city of Khobar.
Women in the kingdom must hire drivers, or depend on the good will of male relatives if they do not have the means.

Wait…is that a projection of the bigger pup? Maybe a forced perspective shot of twins? This pup is a true mini-me.

Why? I guess it could be useful for people who can’t visit the house in real life, but making the Anne Frank House a virtual reality experience makes it seem like some sort of game.

Following the large-scale “triumphant hubbub” that is East 11th St NY 10003, the second work in James Dillon’s Nine Rivers halves the number of percussionists and adds six violins. L’ECRAN Parfum (‘SCREEN perfume’) was composed in 1988, and received its first performance the following spring by the Oslo Sinfonietta. At 10 minutes’ duration, it’s the shortest piece in the cycle, but there’s absolutely nothing slight about it; on the contrary, L’ECRAN Parfum is a searing demonstration of Dillon the dramaturgist, cramming into its brief span a bewildering and almost infeasibly intense dramatic outpouring. In his programme note, Dillon demarcates the piece in two parts, one “constructed around the continuous iteration of three superposed prototypical forms of pattern — spirals, meanders and branching”, the other “constructed upon the iteration of a single texture, gradually altered by a continuous ‘rallentando’”. He also quotes another stanza from Rimbaud’s Le Bateau ivre, continuing from the previous one:
Following seamlessly from East 11th St, L’ECRAN Parfum is thrust into being via a mark tree swish, the strings instantly emerging like a clutch of angry hornets, articulating themselves through unceasing, highly demonstrative tremolandi, riding effortlessly (“Lighter than a cork…”) over the bass drum’s broad and turbulent opening swells. Dillon immediately establishes the strings as a united entity, firmly in the spotlight; the percussion—apart from occasional mark tree rips—promptly retreat to the sidelines. This sense of unity, together with the constant state of high drama, reveals retrospectively how emotionally ‘aloof’ East 11th St is by contrast; this is a very different kind of polyphony from that, its underlying processes working as a means to an end rather than being an end in themselves (that’s not meant as a negative comment about East 11th St). Over the first few minutes, the tremolandi evolve somewhat, becoming rapid trills, shifting in pace, even affecting a momentary sense of line. But as soon as this development becomes obvious, there’s a pause, after which the tremolandi return with gusto. As do the percussion, in a series of wild, undulating bass drum and suspended cymbal rolls, bringing the strings to a single note standstill.
This, i suspect, is the moment where the second part begins, as the minutes that follow certainly have a single texture, the violins high in register, accompanied by just a cymbal. There is, too, a sense of slowing, but this is countered by an apparent urge in all six violins to propel the music on and not permit any retardation. So when Dillon then inserts a rude tubular bell gesture, it’s with more than a suggestion of admonishment; another silence follows, and the strings play out their remaining material in laboured fashion, almost stumbling over each other in a decidedly clumsy kind of homophony. Despite the strings having ostensibly dominated the piece, the percussion clearly pack the greatest punch; a tam-tam crescendo compels the piece to end.
In this performance from the Nine Rivers world première, L’ECRAN Parfum is performed by members of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Jessica Cottis.
Quality assurance: Use of externally accredited procedures to achieve high levels of quality procedure conformance.
At a local coffee bar, a young woman was expounding on her idea of the perfect mate to some of her friends.
"The man I marry must be a shining light amongst company. He must be musical. Tell jokes. Sing. And stay home at night!"
As they passed a barnyard of mules and pigs, the husband sarcastically asked, "Are they relatives of yours?"
A fellow was very much in love with a beautiful girl. One day she told him that the next day was her birthday. He told her he would send her a bouquet of roses... one for each year of her life.
That evening he called the local florist and ordered twenty-one roses with instructions that they be delivered first thing the next morning.
As the florist was preparing the order, he decided that since the young man was such a good customer, he would put an extra dozen roses in the bouquet.
They were married, but since the argument they had a few days earlier, they hadn't been talking to each other.
A friend got married and I, being the best man, decided a humorous practical joke was in order. One of the duties of the best man is to make arrangements for the pick up and return of the groom's tuxedo.
After final fitting, rent an extra coat jacket that is either three or four sizes smaller or larger than the groom's. Explain to the tux shop what you're up to. Pick up the groom's fitted coat, switch with the extra rented coat, and deliver to the groom only when it becomes time to actually get dressed.
The friend of mine wore a 42 long, but the one I provided was a 38 short. Talk about some serious fun! Don't reveal that you know anything as long as possible.
Someone once took a large black ink marker and wrote "Help" on the bottom of the groom's left shoe and "Me" on the bottom of the right shoe. So when he knelt down for his vows, the entire congregation saw it. Of course, this will only work if he must kneel with back to congregation (i.e. Catholic wedding). Make sure you get it so that it is readable with the shoes side by side, left to right, toes toward the floor. Do this far enough in advance so that the paint is dry before the groom wears the shoes to avoid damaging carpets.
Besides "Help Me", other possible message to write on the soles are (with varying degrees of cruelness): Left Shoe (I'm With) Right Shoe (Stupid [pointing arrowhead]); Left Shoe (Quick, Call 911!) Right Shoe (Never Mind, I'm Doomed!)
A groom buys the engagement ring at a jewelry store. As the groom enters the room, we "have been talking about" the news that says the jewelry store he just went to is being investigated for selling plastic diamonds to unknowledgeable customers. This didn't work too well but maybe if you have better actors in your group it would.
Another on that I have seen pulled is to have someone speak out at the time the minister asks, "If anyone has good reason why these two should not be married, speak now or forever hold your peace."
They had a pregnant lady stand up and say, "Oh, never mind! I'll just call my lawyer!" It rattled the groom's mother so much that she fainted.
At the rehearsal dinner for my boss' daughter and son-in-law-to-be, a loud eight-months pregnant teenage girl suddenly appeared at the back of the room screaming ten minutes worth of curses that would befall the groom if he didn't marry the pregnant girl like he promised. It was set up by the boss' wife, and I am told that the groom very nearly burst into tears protesting his innocence.
A groom's friends decided to throw his bachelor party the day before the wedding, and as often happens on these occasions, by the end of the evening, everyone was completely drunk, and none moreso than the guest of honor, who promptly passed out in a corner of the room.
When he woke up, he found himself sitting in an airline seat with no wallet or money or anything on him except a one way ticket to San Francisco. He was worried sick until he finally arrived at San Francisco from New Jersey, where he found a ticket at the courtesy counter back to New Jersey. It seems that one of his prospective in-laws worked for an airline and had some comp airfare to use.
The groom got back to New Jersey barely four hours before the ceremony, and was barely able to stay awake long enough to say "I do".
Before a friend's wedding reception, we passed out keys (blanks) to several girls and one guy. Before some toasts were made, the best man said to the guests, "Now that Jim is married and is no longer available, it is probably a good idea to have any of you girls out there with a key to his apartment to please turn it in now." Then the pre-selected girls (about thirty of them) slowly walked up and handed in their keys as they made bedroom-eyes at him and flirted a bit; some of the girls would turn in not just one key, but six or seven of them. Then the guy walked up, turned in the key, and kissed the groom on the cheek. It's probably not original, but it worked pretty well.
Another twist to this would be to distribute fifteen blank keys to male friends of the bride-to-be and two more blank keys to a guy and a very old lady. Then, during the reception, while people are making toasts, announce to everyone that since the bride is no longer available, any guy with a key to her apartment should turn it in at the tray that has been set up, whereby the fifteen pre-selected men would walk up and turn in their keys and make the same announcement for the groom, whereby both the old lady and the other guy would both walk up with their key.
During the wedding ceremony, when the minister/preacher/priest comes to the part about, "If anyone has any reason why these two people should not marry, speak up now or forever hold your peace..." have this four-to-six year old boy running up the aisle yelling, " addy, daddy." I understand from a friend who played this joke on a relative that it took almost an hour to get the wedding started again.
At my cousin's wedding, my dad (who doesn't much care for his nephew's bride) thought it would be funny to flick his cigarette at her back as she walked down the aisle. It got caught in her hair and started to smolder. Her father had to get it out while she cried hysterically. Then he punched my Uncle Raymond, whom he thought had tossed it, right square in the forehead and ended up breaking his own hand. Good wedding.
Obtain access to their getaway car. Fill with balloons. A few extra helium balloons in the trunk with their luggage is a nice touch.
If you can get access to their luggage after they have packed, add styrofoam peanuts in whatever nooks and crannies are left.
Jack up the car, put blocks under the axle, then lower the car onto the blocks. When the newlyweds try to make their getaway, watch them rev...and rev...and rev.
The best man at my friends wedding rigged the horn to sound every time the brake was pressed, they drove half way down the road until they realized what was going on and had to return to fix it.
For a small fee, you can get an agency to have a pregnant "ex-girlfriend" appear at the service, in a wedding gown, claiming the groom-to-be the father of her child and demanding *she* should be the one to be married. The one I saw even had a bunch of dead flowers with her!
When the groom asks the best man for the ring, he turns and nervously says he doesn't have it, who then turns to the next groomsman and asks the same question, and so on until the last person turns and grabs a giant box of Cracker Jacks that contained the wedding ring.
The whole church was rolling as the best man and his co-horts had the last laugh. It was truely classic.
At a friend's wedding, the bridal party filled their car with balloons - all filled with laughing gas. They put them everywhere, under seats, in the glove box, etc. They popped the balloons, and everyone was relaxed and laughing. But balloons were popping all during the trip of their honeymoon. They said they enjoyed the trick.
The following conversation took place one morning between a wife and her husband. They were discussing government cost cuts that they recently heard about in the paper.
"Steve," his wife said, while reading the newspaper, "it looks like our government is going to cut overhead and trim down the military forces. They are going to eliminate six overaged destroyers."
To which the husband replies, "Sorry to hear that, dear. I'm sure you'll miss your mother being gone."
There was once a wife so jealous that when her husband came home one night and she couldn't find hairs on his jackets she yelled at him, "Great, so now you're cheating on me with a bald woman!"
The next night, when she didn't smell any perfume, she yelled again by saying, "She's not only bald, but she's too cheap to buy any perfume!"
The marriage counselor, trying to be creative, told him, "If you wish to save your marriage, you'd better be a little boulder."
A person receives a telegram informing him about his mother-in-law's death. It also enquires whether she should be buried or burnt.
Against the backdrop of South Australia’s power crisis and a $9.3 million seed funding announcement between Energy Australia and Redback Technologies, All-Energy Australia caught the attention of the industry in 2016.
More than 4,500 industry professionals walked through the doors of last year’s trade show and conference, cementing its reputation as the most comprehensive clean and renewable energy event in the country.
All eyes are now back on All-Energy Australia, as organisers open registrations for the ninth year which will be held Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre from 11 – 12 October 2017.
Held in partnership with the Clean Energy Council, the 2017 program will showcase expert opinions from more than 120 speakers along with featuring more than 120 domestic and international exhibiting companies.
Highlights include AEMO’s Audrey Zibelma, RES’ Tanya Jackson, Schneider Electric’s Kim Kreutz, Tesla Energy’s Lara Olsen, Nexergy’s Darius Salgo and the Essential Services Commission’s James Clinch. All-Energy Australia Exhibition Director Robby Clark said: “The way we consume and generate energy is changing. All-Energy Australia dedicates itself to those interested in this idea.”
“In less than a decade, we’ve seen the conversation shift dramatically. Innovations in peer-to-peer trading, transforming utility models and scalable energy storage technologies are among our focuses for this year.”
Clean Energy Council Chief Executive Kane Thornton said the event was an opportunity to look back on a record-breaking year while considering the challenges headed our way in 2018.
“It’s been an unprecedented year for our industry, with dozens of projects underway. These add up to about $8 billion of investment and are set to create thousands of new jobs,” said Mr Thornton.
New to All-Energy Australia this year, solar installers will be able to accrue 15 CPD points per attended session of the Clean Energy Council’s Solar Masterclass Series.
Beyond the two-day conference program is the All-Energy Australia trade show, which is set to feature live demonstrations, product releases and tailored advice from companies including Tesla, Fronius, LG, ABB Australia, NEXTracker, Clenergy, Canadian Solar Australia and more.
Organisers have scheduled a number of networking opportunities across the two days, helping delegates meet like-minded professionals from a range of visiting sectors. This includes the Clean Energy Council’s Solar Design and Installation Awards Night, scheduled for Wednesday 11 October.
Major sponsors include NEXTracker, the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources, ABB Australia, Array Technology, One Stop Warehouse, Powerark Solar, SolarEdge, BayWare Renewable Energy, TBEA Energy and Flex. To access the 2017 program and register for the free-to-attend trade show and conference, please visit the All-Energy Australia website: www.all-energy.com.au.

Mario Batali counts 24 restaurants, nine cookbooks, nurmerous television shows and the 50,000-square-foot Eataly marketplace among his ever-expanding empire of deliciousness. This fall, Mario and his business partner, Joe Bastianich, will open B&B Burger&Beer in The Venetian Hotel & Casino, their fourth restaurant in Las Vegas. Mario is also the author of nine cookbooks including the James Beard Award Winning MOLTO ITALIANO: 327 SIMPLE ITALIAN RECIPES (Ecco 2005); and MOLTO BATALI: SIMPLE FAMILY MEALS FROM MY HOME TO YOURS (Ecco 2011). Mario appears deialy on ABC's "The Chew," a daytime talk show that celebrates and explores life through food.
Mario Batali, who knows the importance of ingredients to any amazing dish, sees farmers as the rock stars of the food world. In this new book he celebrates American farmers: their high quality products and their culture defined by hard work, integrity, and pride. Batali asked his chef friends from Nashville, Tennessee, to San Francisco, to tell him who their favorite farmers were, and those farmers graciously shared their personal stories along with their top-of-the-line produce and products.
From the author of THE BALANCE PROJECT comes a dual-timeline narrative featuring a 1949 Miss Subways contestant and a modern-day advertising executive whose careers and lives intersect.
In 1949, dutiful and ambitious Charlotte's dream of a career in advertising is shattered when her father demands she help out with the family business. Meanwhile, Charlotte is swept into the glamorous world of the Miss Subways beauty contest, which promises irresistible opportunities with its Park Avenue luster and local fame status. But when her new friend --- the intriguing and gorgeous fellow-participant Rose --- does something unforgivable, Charlotte must make a heart-wrenching decision that will change the lives of those around her forever.
Nearly 70 years later, outspoken advertising executive Olivia is pitching the NYC subways account in a last ditch effort to save her job at an advertising agency. When the charismatic boss she’s secretly in love with pits her against her misogynistic nemesis, Olivia’s urgent search for the winning strategy leads her to the historic Miss Subways campaign. As the pitch date closes in on her, Olivia finds herself dealing with a broken heart, an unlikely new love interest, and an unexpected personal connection to Miss Subways that could save her job --- and her future.
THE SUBWAY GIRLS is the charming story of two strong women, a generation apart, who find themselves up against the same eternal struggle to find an impossible balance between love, happiness and ambition.

Let no one tell you that email marketing is dead. An email list is crucial for every affiliate marketer. You can start building up your email list with a lead magnet (like the information products mentioned previously) or even just by encouraging your audience to sign up for your updates. You can then push your content to this audience via email and also direct them to your affiliate offers. Don't be sleazy about the sales, but if you build up enough trust with your email audience; when the time comes, they will not mind purchasing a product from you.
Thanks for all the information I am slowly working my way through your list of do’s and donts! ! I’ve been approached by a website that wants to develop editorial content for my blog featuring home improvement tips from their”national client” and pay me $40 a year for reviewing and publishing their content. Boy, I am just not sure how this all works? Any words for when we are approached by others to write for our blogs?
What kind of commission do they offer? One-time commissions or recurring commissions? For example, many programs pay you one time for sending a customer. On the other hand, some programs like membership sites or SaaS (software as a service) programs will pay you a commission as long as the person you referred is a paying customer. Recurring commissions are great when you can find them!

Forms of new media have also diversified how companies, brands, and ad networks serve ads to visitors. For instance, YouTube allows video-makers to embed advertisements through Google's affiliate network.[18][19] New developments have made it more difficult for unscrupulous affiliates to make money. Emerging black sheep are detected and made known to the affiliate marketing community with much greater speed and efficiency.[citation needed]

Of all of the affiliate marketplaces there is this is the only true level playing field for every online marketer.

Affiliate marketing is commonly confused with referral marketing, as both forms of marketing use third parties to drive sales to the retailer. The two forms of marketing are differentiated, however, in how they drive sales, where affiliate marketing relies purely on financial motivations, while referral marketing relies more on trust and personal relationships.[citation needed]

Affiliate marketing is an area that even the most seasoned bloggers can improve upon. Plus, most bloggers aren't making anywhere near the amount of affiliate income that they should be and are leaving money on the table. If you want to grow your affiliate income, there are numerous tips and strategies that I share in Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing.
On the other hand, we have affiliates, who are looking for ways to monetize their online presence. Affiliates (also known as publishers) are often bloggers and influencers who enjoy online reputation and a considerable following. This enables them to affect buying decisions of their followers. When they recommend a product, they encourage their followers to buy the same products. This activity is known as a conversion, and it is what enables affiliates to earn from this kind of strategy.
I personally prefer to do it that way--you can create a more convincing review that's more likely to make sales. It's not always possible or practical, though; for example, would you break up with your significant other just to test a product for getting your ex back? ;-) In cases like that, or if the product is expensive, it's usually best just to use the vendor's affiliate resources instead.
Win-win-win. The advertiser wins because they only pay when a purchase is made (as opposed to the shotgun approach of paying to advertise to the masses and waiting for a small percentage to actually buy). The affiliate wins because they make money while providing helpful advice. The customer wins because they get a trusted recommendation for something they might not otherwise have known about.
Affiliate marketing has grown quickly since its inception. The e-commerce website, viewed as a marketing toy in the early days of the Internet, became an integrated part of the overall business plan and in some cases grew to a bigger business than the existing offline business. According to one report, the total sales amount generated through affiliate networks in 2006 was £2.16 billion in the United Kingdom alone. The estimates were £1.35 billion in sales in 2005.[15] MarketingSherpa's research team estimated that, in 2006, affiliates worldwide earned US$6.5 billion in bounty and commissions from a variety of sources in retail, personal finance, gaming and gambling, travel, telecom, education, publishing, and forms of lead generation other than contextual advertising programs.[16]
Affiliates are most successful when the products they promote match the interests of their followers and subscribers. In addition, many successful affiliate marketers advise recommending and promoting only products that the affiliate is personally familiar with. That’s because familiarity with the product, program, or service helps build trust between the affiliate and end-user.

Awww… The most sweet thing is when they filmed the take off of the plane..maybe i am wrong but I doubt anyone did that b4 with their idol
I don’t know why, but this sweet video made me really cry! Just seeing his loving eels watching his plane take off and disappear into the distance…. They could hardly bear to leave even then. It was like a scene from a movie where friends, lovers, or family are parted at a train station or airport. Truly touching!
It’s a moving moment. Eel were standing in the rooftop of the building to send him off. He took picture from airplane and tweeted it. That’s the bonding between JKS and his eels.
This scene reminds me of the lyrics of “The sky and you”:I was looking up at the faraway blue sky. It occurred to me, you must be looking at the same one…..”
Since I am his eel, this was the first time I have seen this…and he saw it and his heart must have burst with pride and passion..making him capture that moment and share it with us to let us know it did not go unnoticed by him… He is such a loving and grateful man
So touching…. eels are amazing…. i think from now on eels gonna send him off like this and also from the rooftop…. , 🙂

You will be folding the paper to make creases that represent thousand-year periods. As you learn parts of the diagram, you would practice them on pieces of scrap paper until you can recreate that part of the diagram by memory. Then you would go on to learn another part. (Want to watch it first on YouTube?) To make the creases, first fold the paper in half from top to bottom, which will give you a long lengthwise crease. Then put the paper lengthwise in front of you and fold it in half from left to right, then fold it in half again in the same direction, so when you open it, you have four columns LABELING THE CREASES Holding the paper lengthwise in front of you, write 2000 BC at the extreme upper left corner. At the first crease to the right, write 1000 BC. at the top of the center crease, write 1 AD (or CE, which means “common era;” more on “A.D.” at footnote 1.) Write 1000 AD at the next crease to the right, and write 2000 AD at the upper right corner of the paper. PART ONE First we will draw in the Roman Empire, starting at the center of your paper, on the middle horizontal line. You will be drawing a band (elongated rectangle) along the crease to represent the Roman empire. Starting a little to the left of the center vertical crease (because the empire started 27 years BC), draw a vertical bar (about an inch high) crossing the middle horizontal crease. From each tip, draw a short straight line to the right, to form the beginning of your rectangle. Write ROM EMP (or an abbreviation of your choice) to the right of your vertical line. Here’s how the diagram should look so far: Continue drawing the bottom line to the right until you are almost half-way to the next vertical crease; at that point, draw a short line upward. That represents the time when the western part of the Roman empire was ended by the invasions of the Germanic tribes in 476 AD. (I do not recommend that you write the dates on your sheet of paper; I am including them to help you estimate where to draw your lines. In this approach, you also are not meant to memorize any of the dates. What you memorize is the visual placement of the countries within the thousand-year columns.) The eastern part of the Roman Empire continued for another thousand years, so from the top of that short line, continue to draw a line to the right until you are almost to the middle of the right-most column. During that time the Eastern Roman Empire is mostly limited to Greece and today’s Turkey, and is also called the Byzantine Empire, so write BYZ above the long line. To continue the top line, draw to the right starting at your original vertical line, but then draw a small step down when you reach the 600’s, to designate the time when the Arabs, who had become Muslims, took possession of the Middle Eastern and African parts of the Roman Empire in the 630’s. Then continue the line to the right. [Following is a detail not shown on the YouTube version]: Draw your line a little past the vertical crease in the paper., then make another step downward, all the way to the crease. That represents 1071 AD, when the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantines and within a few decades controlled almost all of Turkey. Draw an S to the right of the small vertical line to represent the Seljuks. Draw a horizontal line along the crease to the right until it is as long as the lower line of your diagram. This narrow band indicates that The Byzantine Empire was left mostly with the area round their capital city, Constantinople. That city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453 and renamed Istanbul. At that date, draw a vertical line connecting your two horizontal lines, thus closing the Roman Empire band. To the right of the band wite OTTO to represent the Ottoman Turks. Look below to see how your Roman Empire diagram should look. Click here to see maps of the Roman Empire. Now we will diagram some of the Germanic tribes. At the niche you drew at 476, start a narrow band and continue it to the right hand edge of the paper. At 476, write FRANKS, for that is the tribe that became dominant in the area now called France and Germany. Just before the third crease, start an additional narrower band within this one, and continue it to about where the year 1800 would be. This band represents the Holy Roman Empire, formed in 962 as a combination of Germany and northern Italy. It was ended by Napoleon in 1806, so end it with a vertical line. Write HRE within the band. After it ended, the ruling family at the time, the Hapsburgs, continued to rule part of it as the “Austro-Hungarian Empire” right up to World War I. so draw an extension of the bar up to the point where 1918 would be, and draw a vertical line up to end the band. Divide the band lengthwise into a top and bottom half. In the lower half, write AH to indicate the Austro-Hungarian empire. In the upper half write Pr, which stands for the Prussians, who united the northern part of the Holy Roman Empire into the German Empire in 1870. Both empires were ended by World War I. The band extending to the right from the word FRANKS that was not included in the HRE band represents France, and the line goes to the edge of the paper.. Under the word FRANKS, draw another band that also extends all the way to the edge of the paper. This will represent England. In this new band, below the word FRANKS, write ANGLE/S, for with the departure of the the Roman armies from Britain, Germanic tribes called the Angles and the Saxons invaded. The word “England” is a short form of “Angle-land.” In 1707 England joined with Scotland and the resulting combination is called Great Britain, so write GB within the band, in the center of the right-most column. Today the official name of the country is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. so write UK at the far right of the band. Now we will diagram more details about the Arab Muslims. After Muhammad died in 632, he was followed in succession by four other leaders, who were called Caliphs. Caliph means someone who is taking Muhammad’s place as ruler of the Muslims. Then in 661 came the first entity we will add to the diagram, the Ummayad Caliphate. Starting in the niche you made for the 600’s, write U above the Roman Empire. In 750 the Abbassid Caliphate took control, so draw a small vertical line to the right of the U and after it write ABB. [The Caliphate gradually was divided into independent kingdoms that ruled in its name. For details, see the diagram near the bottom of this page, in the “detail” section just above the footnotes.] Draw another vertical line in 1258, when the Mongols end that Caliphate. To its right, write M for the Mongols, who ruled the region now called Iraq until the 1330’s: draw a vertical line there representing the end of the Mongols. To show what happened in Turkey after the Mongols, first draw a horizontal line just above the crease, even with the height of the Byzantine line before you made the inset for the Seljuks. Draw the line as far as where the year 1516 would be. After the Mongol rule ended in Turkey, various groups of Turks controlled different parts of Turkey, and one of them, the Ottomans, gradually defeated the others. To show this process, draw a diagonal line starting from the lowest end of the Mongol line (where it touches the Byzantines), over to touch the new horizontal line where it ends in 1516. On the top of the diagonal, write Tu for Turks, and leave the bottom blank, for it spills into the Ottoman space you have already created at the right. To show what happened in the middle east after the Mongols, write TIMUR to the right of the Mongol section, in the space above the triangle you just drew for Turkey. Timur claimed to be a descendant of Mongols, and his successors the Timurids ruled the in the middle east area until the Ottoman Turks took over the Middle East in 1516. That is where your new horizontal line ends, so draw a short upward line to show the end of the Timurids. Below is what your diagram should look like. I recommend that you learn to draw this diagram by memory before moving on to the next part. Here is the YouTube video showing the process you have just gone through. Each of the following parts also has its own YouTube video. PART TWO This part will fill in the space to the left of the Roman Empire. Just before 1000 BC, start a band projecting both above and below the center horizontal crease. This will represent the kingdom of Israel, where David became king around 1000 BC. (write ISR along the crease) After the death of David’s son Solomon, the kingdom divided into a northern half, which kept the name Israel , and a southern half, called Judah (write JUD just below the crease). The northern half ended in 722 BC, so draw a vertical line ending it, but the southern half continued until 586, where you will draw a vertical line upward ending the entire band. Now we will draw the empires that brought these kingdoms to an end. About 935 BC start a band over Israel, and label it ASS, for it represents the Assyrian empire. That empire continued until 609 (draw a vertical line downward until it touches Judah to end the band) when it was conquered by Babylon. (For Babylon, draw a band whose top line continues the top of the Assyria line, but which extends further than the end of Judah, and then ends with a vertical line at the year 539 that drops down until it is even with the bottom line of Judah, which you should extend to complete the Babylon band. Within the band, write B or BABYLON.) When Babylon ended the kingdom of Judah in 586, it took many of the Jewish people into exile in Babylon. By this time, the word “Jew” came into usage, meaning “people from Judah.” The word “Judea” is from the Roman (Latin) pronunciation of Judah. Draw an even higher band for the next empire, the Persians, still using bottom line of Judah as the lower line. Persia rules the middle east from 539 to 331. Draw the lines for these two dates, and connect them at top and bottom. The reason you drew it higher is because it also encompasses Turkey and Iran. The bottom line will still be parallel with the previous bottom line. Write P or PERSIA within the band. )In 538 Persia allowed some of the Jewish exiles to return to Judah.) In 331 Alexander the Great conquered the Persian empire, and so his empire is to be drawn even higher. Increase the height of your 331 line, and draw the top line to the right until it is even with the start of the Roman Empire, but don’t draw the vertical ending line yet. After Alexander died, one of his generals, Seleucus, took over the rule of the middle eastern part of that empire. His descendants continued to rule there for several centuries as the “Seleucid” dynasty, so write SEL in the space. The combination of Greek and Persian culture is called “Hellenistic” culture. In 235 BC the Parthians conquered the Persian area (Iran) and made it independent from the Seleucids. To show this, draw a narrow band starting at 235 BC, and whose lower line is even with the top of the Roman empire line. Within it write PAR. The top edge of the Iran band shows you where to end the vertical line that ends the Seleucid dynasty, which should be drawn at 64 BC.. We will now trace the major political changes in Iran up to the modern era. The Parthians are replaced in 224 AD by the Sassanids. Draw a vertical line to indicate the change, and to its right write SASS. When the line reaches the time of the Umayyads, extend their line upward into the Iran band, because the Umayyads and then the Abbasids both rule in Iran. After 1000 the Iranians have threir own rulers, some ruling in the name of the Abbassid Caliphs. To show them, daw a band even with the Sassanid band, cutting into the Abbassid area, starting at 830, and extending to the Mongol line. Divide that band into four parts by drawing 3 vertical lines within it. At this time we will fill in only one of these four boxes. (the other details are given at “optional details,” at the end of this page.) These details are additions to the YouTube version. In the third box, write S. This represents the Seljuk Turks. After they were defeated in Iran, they still kept their control of Turkey, where you have already indicated them by the S you drew at the inset of the Byzantine empire. Also, write a letter S within the Abbassid box, at the right edge,because the Seljuks also ruled in Syria and Palestine in the name of the Abbassids. The first two crusades were fought against the Seljuks in Palestine. The Mongols did rule in Iran. Above the large M, draw the lines framing the Mongols high enough to include the Iran horizontal band. The Mongol group that ruled in Iran, as well as in today’s Iraq, was called the “Il-Khan,” so write IK in the space above the M. The Il-Khan also ruled in today’s Afghanistan. After the Mongol rule ended, a man named Timur gained control of Iran, starting in 1370 (The T is already written on the Caliphate line, so just extend their vertical line upward. ) His family line, the Timurids, continued to rule in Iran until their place is taken by a native group, the Safavids (1502 to 1722). (draw a band for them) cutting into the Timurid area.) After the Safavids, , continue the band to the edge of the paper, to indicate the continuing complex history of Iran. The entire band from Parthians to the end can now have a top line. The bottom line of the Safavids forms the top line of the Ottomans, and extends on to the end of the paper. You can write the word IRAN in the space after 1722. After the Mongol rule ended in Turkey, various groups of Turks controlled different parts of Turkey, and one of them, the Ottomans, gradually defeated the others. To show this process, draw a diagonal line from the lowest end of the Mongol line (where it touches the Byzantines, up and right to the end of the Timur line i 1516. On the Top of the diagonal, write Tu for Turks, and leave the bottom blank, for it spills into the Ottoman space you have already created at the right. In 142 BC the Jews, who had been fighting the Seleucids since 167, formed an independent kingdom. Draw the beginnings of a small band within the SEL band, and at the same height as the Israel band. Draw an H in the band, as the Jewish rulers of the country are called the Hasmonean dynasty, ruled by the Maccabee family. Do not draw a line at the right side of the H, as instructions for it will be in the next paragraph. To represent the growth of the Roman Republic, draw a straight line extending to the left from the bottom line of the Roman Empire, all the way back to the year 753 BC, the traditional date for the founding of Rome. Starting in the 200’s BC, draw a steeply curving line up to the upper left tip of the Roman Empire band. That means the Romans as they expanded ended up taking the Middle Eastern lands away from the Seleucids, and that line will also become the right hand edge of the Jew’s Hasmonean dynasty, which the Romans took over as a protectorate in 63 BC. Below is what your Part two should look like. Click here to see the YouTube video of Part Two PART THREE We will start by drawing some details of the middle east before 2000 BC. A little distance under the time-line crease, filling the left hand column, draw a circular loop with an arrow pointing to the left. This will be used to indicate events before 2000 BC. In it first write Sumer. The Sumerians are credited with forming the first civilization in the middle east. They were located in the southern part of today’s Iraq. (Today’s Iraq was also called Mesopotamia, which means “between the rivers” the rivers being the Tigris and Euphrates.) Various cities of the Sumerians dominated the others in turn. Then another group speaking a different language, the Akkadians, appeared just to the north of the Sumerians, and one of their leaders conquered the Sumerians to form what is regarded as the first empire in the region, that of Sargon of Akkad. Make a band and in it write SAR/A. . This empire lasted from around 2400 BC to 2180 BC. Then other cities again became dominant, and the last name to write within your loop is Ur III, this being the third time that the Sumerian city of Ur came to prominence. At the left margin, on the crease, write Amor to represent the Amorites, a people group that had migrated from Arabia to the middle east by the year 2000. They took control of southern Iraq to form the Old Babylonian empire. One of their kings was Hammurabi, famous for the set of laws he drew up. Draw a band for it on the crease, from 1820 BC to 1580 BC, and within it write OLD B. (The Babylonian empire you drew last time, that ended the kingdom of Judah, is called the new Babylonian Empire.) After the Old Babylonia Empire, a group called the Kassites took control in Mesopotamia. (Write KASS on the crease — no band needed. Then the Babylonians and a new group to its north, the Assyrians, alternated in dominance: show this by writing B A B A. This should bring you up to 1000 BC. The Assyrian empire you drew last time, the one that ended the kingdom of Israel, was Assyria’s third attempt at creating an empire. The Minoan culture on the island of Crete had begun already before 2000 BC, but on your diagram write MINOAN some distance above the time line right around the 1700’s, for that is when they reached their peak under king Minos. Draw a dotted line from them back to 2000, and then in the other direction up to 1500, when they ended. Just under it, write MYC at the 1600’s. This represents the Myceneans, whose culture appeared on the Greek mainland at that time, and draw a dotted line for them right up to the year 1200. At that time a major event happened in Greece. Draw a vertical dashed line extending above and below the main time line right at that year. This line represents the Dorian Invasion (you can write DORIAN INV sideways along it. The Dorians were less civilized Greek speakers who invaded from the north. They brought the Mycenean civilization to an end. From that point on, the developments in Greece were an interplay between the newcomers, some of whom became the Spartans, and the previous residents of Greece, notably those at Athens. Draw a dotted line at the same level as the line for the Myceneans, continuing to right right, going just above the Persian empire, and finally ending at the Seleucid empire, for Alexander the Great did take over all of the Greek city-states and they became part of the Hellenistic kingdoms. The Golden Age of Classic Greek culture was in the century when they defeated invasions from the Persians in 490 and 480. One of the groups displaced by the tumult of the Dorian Invasion left Greece looked for a new place to settle somewhere on the Mediterranean. The Egyptians called them the Sea Peoples and repelled them. They finally settled on the western shore of the Mediterranean, in the same area where the people of Israel had settled, and we know them as the Philistines. The term Palestine comes from their name. One of their major cities was called Gaza. There was conflict between them and the people of Israel. For example, the giant Goliath that David brought down with a stone from his sling shot was a Philistine. The establishment of the Kingdom of Israel at the time of David involved David’s conquering of the Philistines. Write PHIL starting at 1200. just to the left of the band for Israel. With the downfall of the Minoans, the Phoenicians from the western shore of the Mediterranean (today’s Lebanon) became prominent sea traders. They established colonies along the African and Spanish coast, one of which was Carthage in present-day Tunisia. As Rome was rising in power, it came into conflict with Carthage (during one of the wars, the Carthaginian general Hannibal led his army, including elephants, over the Alps.) Rome eventually triumphed, so write PHOEN/CARTH in the space under Judah, so that the curved line you drew representing Rome’s expansion closes off the Carthaginians. From that point, Rome was the prime sea power. After the Muslim conquests of the 600’s, the Muslims became dominant in the Mediterranean, up to the time when the city states of northern Italy, especially Venice, became dominant sea powers in the 1400’s AD.. By the 1600’s the Hittites had become a major power in the region we now called Turkey, and played a role in the downfall of the Old Babylonian empire, Write HITT above the word Minoan, at the year 1600, and follow it with a dotted line up to the 1300’s, when it ended. Following the Hittites, at 1300 BC write Aram, with an arrow pointing to the right. These are the Aramaeans who gradually, starting in the 1500’s, replaced the Amorites as a dominant group. They also had migrated from Arabia. Syria during that time was also called Aram. The Aramaeans that settled in southern Mesopotamia were called Chaldeans. Their kingdoms were defeated by the Assyrian empire in 720 BC, but the Chaldeans then overthrew the Assyrians and formed the New Babylonian Empire. Though that empire was ended by the Persians, the langauge of the Aramaeans, Aramaic, gradually became the trade language of West Asia, until it was replaced by Arabic when the Muslims took over the area in the 600’s AD. Jesus and his disciples would have spoken Aramaic to one another; the Bible was early on translated into an Aramaic language called Syriac. The Jewish Talmuds were written in Aramaic This ends Part 3. The way your diagram should look is shown below. Once you have internalized these developments, you can add additional countries and movements to your diagram according to your interests. In the following parts, the upper part of your paper will diagram empires and dynasties in Asia, and the lower part will diagram Africa and the Americas. Below is how your diagram for Part three should look. Here’s the link to the YouTube version of Part 3. MAP CARDS Before going on, you have the option of creating a set of cards. These cards are maps showing the boundaries of some of the empires you have just written down. Print the appropriate maps, cut them apart, and fold the name and date to the back. The date shows when that empire was at its farthest extent. You are not expected to memorize the date, but eyou can make use of the cards by shufflling them and then trying to name them and place them in the proper chronological order. You would then look at the dates in back to see if you are correct. From the 18 maps provided, add only a few at a time to your deck. When you go to the map link, select only the empires you have written down so far. Go to map cards. You could also create an index, on which you will record the names of countries on your diagram and also people that have been mentioned in the text.. Your index could be looseleaf pages, with a letter of the alphabet for each sheet. It could be a spiral notebook. Or you could type it as a word document. (It is optional whether that you alphabetize the words within each letter of the alphabet.) After each word, write what century it occurred in, so you can quickly locate it on your diagram. PART FOUR —- THE CHINESE DYNASTIES To add Asia and the Americas, you need to add more creases to the paper. Refold the paper from to to bottom, along your original time line, then fold it in half again, so that when you open it again you will have creases above and below your original timeline. We will use the top crease for Asia. Start by creating a band along the top crease that extends the entire length of the paper. We will draw vertical lines in between the dynasties. The oldest dynasty commonly recognized is to be drawn starting at the year 2000 BC. Write Xia within the band, and draw a vertical line at 1600. Now a word about Chinese pronunciation. This site will use what is called “pin-yin” spelling system. This system is used on mainland China and in today’s newspaper articles and books. Previously, a system called “Wade-Giles” was commonly used. As I present each Chinese dynasty, I will first give you the pin-yin spelling. After that, in brackets, I will give you an approximation of the sound, using my own system. After that, in parentheses, I will give you the Wade-Giles version. You will probably see the Wade-Giles spelling if you consult older reference books. Put both the pin-yin and Wade Giles spellings into your permanent index. To pronounce the word Xia, you need to know that the “x” represents a soft, breathy “s.” For my version of the pronunciation, say “sya” gently. The Wade-Giles spelling is Hsia. Record as follows in your index: Xia [Sya] (Hsia). More on Chinese pronunciation. The next dynasty lasts from 1600 to 1120. The name of the dynasty is Shang. Pronounce it so the letter “a” rhymes with father. The Wade-Giles spelling is the same. So in your index you would write Shang [Shang] (Shang). Indicate in your index that this dynasty is also called Yin [een] (yin). This dynasty’s influence continues up to today, in that the Chinese expression for a Chinese businessman is a Shang person. The next dynasty is Zhou [Joe] (Chou), up to 221. As time passed, the individual states within the Zhou dynasty fought with one another. This was the “warring states period,” and it was during this time that Confucius lived, and that Sunzi (prounounced swun dzuh) wrote “The Art of War.” One of those states finally defeated the others to unite China and become the next dynasty, called Qin [cheen] (ch’in). It was during the Qin dysnasty that the Great Wall of China was pieced together from some existing walls. It has continued to be repaired and rebuilt over the years. Our English word China comes from the Wade-Giles spelling of this dynasty. The Qin dynasty was short, lasting from 221 to 206. There’s no room to write it in the band, so write the word to the left of the band, in the Zhou part, with an arrow pointing to its narrow part of the band. The Han dynasty lasted 400 years, from 206 BC to 220 AD. (There was a brief interruption that you may choose to put onto your diagram: in the year 9 AD, a dynasty called the XIN [seen] (Hsin) displaced the Han, but the han regained control in the year 25. China then divided into many different dynasties. Some were in the south, and some were in the north, so designate that by drawing a horizontal line within the band right up to the year 589, writing N in the space above the line, and S below. Details are at footnote 2. In 589 China was united again by the SUI [sway] (sui) dynasty. It only lasted until 618. Again, the space is small, so just write a letter S in it. Then the TANG [tang] (tang) took over. That dynasty ended in 906. For the next 54 years China was again divided into many separate groups. Finally in 960 China was united by the SONG [soong] (sung) dynasty, which lasted up to 1279. Draw SONG in smaller print along the bottom half of the band, because In 1179 a tribe from the north conquered the northern half of China, and established the JIN [jeen} (chin) dynasty. You can show it by making a small inset within the Song band. During those years, the remnant of the Song was called the Southern Song. Both dynasties were ended by the Mongols in `1279. The Mongols, starting under Kublai khan, called their dynasty the YUAN [u-umlaut followed by en] (Yuan). That was the time when Morco Polo visited China. The Yuan ended in 1369, and was followed by the MING [ming] (ming), which ended in 1644. Djuring the 1600’s, some of the northern tribes united to form a new group which they called the Manchus. They defeated the Ming in 1644, and began a new dynasty called the QING [ching] {ch’ing), which was overthrown in 1911. China then became the Republic of China (write ROC). In 1949 the Communist Party defeated the ROC in mainland China, but the ROC under Chiang Kai Shek escaped to Taiwan, where they continue. The Communists called the part they ruled the People’s Republic of China (PRC). You can draw the PRC as an inset in the ROC. Though it is small on the diagram, it is the most populous nation in the world. That ends part 4. The diagram for Asia will appear after part 5. Here is the YouTube version of Part 4. PART FIVE — KOREA AND JAPAN Please draw the Korea sequence right on top of the Chinese band. You could start again by drawing the entire band first, starting at 1 AD. Write “Korea:” just before the 1 AD crease, to the left of the Korea band. At 1 AD write CHOSON.. During the 100’s and 200’s, the country became divided into three separate.states. This can be diagrammed by drawing two horizontal lines during the space from 100 to 660. The three are named in footnote 3. One of the kingdoms conquered the other two in 690, so draw a vertical line there and write SILLA. In 932 it was replaced by KORYO, from which we get our word Korea. In 1259 the Mongols conquered Korea,, so draw a line there and writ M. Notice it is just above the Yuan dynasty inn China, which is the name for the Mongol rule there. In 1388 the country again came under Korean leadership, so draw a line and write in the next era, which is called YI. (another name for it is Chosen). In 1910, Japan took control of Korea, so draw a line and put a J. Japan had to give up Korea at the end of World War 2, so draw a line at 1945, and then to its right draw a horizontal line in the middle of the band, writing N above the line and S below, showing that Korea now became divided then into North Korea and South Korea. Please draw the Japan sequence just above the Korean sequence. Around the 200’s AD, write YAMATO. Then, within the 700’s, put an N. which stands for the capital city during the Nara period (711-791). For the rest of the diagram, please make two bands, one above the other, because most of the eras have at least two names: one is the name of a location, and the other the name of a family. For the period 791 to 1185, write HEIAN in the upper space, for that was the Capital City (it is also called Kyoto), and in the lower space write FUJI, standing for the name of the family that because dominant during the ere: the Fujiwara. For the era from 1185 to 1392, write KAM for Kamakura in the upper space, for that is the name of the leaders’ military base, and MIN for Minamoto in the lower space, for that is the family name of the founding leader. (After his death, the leading family was the Hojo family). For the era from 1392 to 1603, write MUR for Muromachi in the upper space (it was the district that the leaders were based in), and ASH for Ashikaga, the name of the predominant family. If you want to add more detail, the 30 years prior to 1603 was called the Azuchi-Momoyama period. Those are both names of castles). Then, for the period 1603 to 1868 write EDO in the top space. it was the capital city for that era; we now call it Tokyo. In the \lower space, write TOK for Tokugawa, the name of the predominant family. During the Three major eras you have just filled in, the emperor was basically a figurehead, and the actual ruling was done by military leaders, called Shoguns. That is why these eras are sometimes called “shogunates.” In 1868, the emperor at the time took power back from the shoguns and began a period of modernization. In the upper space write TOK for Tokyo, the capital city, and in the lower space write MEI for Meiji, the name of the emperor. With his death in 1911, the Meiji period comes to an end. INDIA We will add some highlights of India just below the China line. Before 2000 BC, the Indus Valley Civilazation developed around the Indus river. Draw it by making a loop with an arrow point to the left. Inside write IND VAL, and that it started around 2500 BC. That civilization is also called Harappan. The English word India is taken from the name of the Indus River, and so is our adjective Hindu, formed by adding an H in front of the River’s name. The Indus Valley civilization came to an end sometime before 1500 BC. At the 1500 BC mark, make a vertical dotted line, and write ARYAN INVASION. That invasion came from the north, from Central Asia. The invaders brought new gods and concepts that mixed with the ones already found in India. the inter-action has resulted in Hinduism, the collective names for the religions that developed in India. The invaders, by dominating the original population, also started the caste system. Scholars noted that the invader’s language, Sanskrit, has some similarity to words found in Iran, in the Hittite language, and to many languages found in Europe. They have proposed that all these languages have a common origin, and have named that common source “Indo-European,” which simply means it is found both in India and Europe. For much of the time, India was ruled by small indpendent states. We will draw in a few times when large parts of India were united into empires. the ones we will draw were based in north India, and each one conquered some but not all of southern India. For the first one, make a band from 321 BC to 185 BC, and inside write MAU, for the Mauryan empire. Make another band from the 320 AD to 500 AD, and write GUP, for the Gupta empire. Muslims immigrated to India starting already in the 700’s. Draw a line at 1562, and after it write MOG for Mogul, a Muslim empire that took control of much of India. The name of this empire is also spelled Mughal. One of its leaders built the Taj Mahal during the mid 1600’s. As it’s power began to fade in the 1700′,s the control of the British was gradually increasing, so within the band draw a diagonal line starting at the bottom line in 1600 and moving up to hit the top line in 1858, the year when India was officially added to the British Empire. Write BR for Britain under that line. India became independent in 1947, so draw a vertical line showing the end of British rule. Tt that time the area around the Indus River became a separate country, Pakistan. Pakistan is mostly Muslim, but there are still also a lot of Muslims within India itself. In 1971 the Muslim area at the east edge of India, which had been part of Pakistan since 1947, separated to become the country of Bangladesh. You may indicate these divisions by drawing horizontal lines up to the edge of the paper. See the options section when you are ready to add more details about India. Below is how the Asia part of your time line should look. Here is the Korea/Japan sequence on YouTube.. PART SIX — THE AMERICAS On the YouTube version, I drew the Americas half-way down the bottom half of the paper. Now I recommend that you put the Americas on a crease close to the bottom of the paper, so you can put Africa directly under the material you drew along the center crease. this will allow you to see the inter-connections between Egypt and the empires of western Asia/ For the Americas, make a crease about an inch above the bottom of paper. Since most of the larger and longer-lasting entities are found either in or near Mexico or in or near Peru, please write Mexico on that crease, and Peru below it. The first band to draw on the Mexico sequence, writing just above the crease, starts around 1500 BC, and continues to 600 BC. Drawing a vertical line to end an empire doesn’t mean that the people stop existing, just that the empire has now reached the end of its time of predominance. Inside this first band write OLMEC. Then, above the Olmec band, starting at 800 BC make a band that lasts to 700 AD, and label it ZAPOTEC. Under that,that is, n the crease. make a band from 300 AD to 700 AD, and write TEO. That stands for the Teotihuanaco Civilization. Note that the Zapotec and Teotihuanaco end at the same time. The Toltecs then became dominant — write that name after 700 AD. In the 900’s, a war-like tribe, the Chichimec, was beginning to raid throughout Mexico. Write their name above the Toltics, but without making a band. The Chichimec group defeated the Toltec around 1200. . After the collapse of the Toltecx. the Aztecs moved to central Mexico, and developed their civilization, which is dated starting at 1325. The Spanish conquered the American peoples starting round the 1520’s so draw a dashed vertical line at that date, extending both above and below the crease, writing SP to the right of that line. Then write the word AZTEC after Toltec, but so it fits before that dashed line. Meanwhile, the time of greatest flourishing for the Maya was in Guatemala from AD 300 to 900, so make a bar or shape for them just above the Zapotec line. After 900, many Mayans moved to the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, and that is where the Spaniards found them and conquered them. So after 900, continue the Mayans as a dotted line, and end the line at the dashed vertical line. The Maya still exist in Mexico. For the Peru sequence, to be written just below the line, we will for the most part write names without making bands. Many of these civilizations existed at the same time, but in different parts of western South America. At 1000 BC write CHAVIN. Then starting around 300 BC write PARACAS. At 200 AD, write NAZCA, and jsut below it, write MOCHICA. Just below that, you can make a band lasting from 300 AD to 1000 AD, for the Tiahuanaco civilization. One of their major cities was Huari. You could write TIA/HUARI in the band. Make a dotted line from the Mochica extending to the right to 1000 AD, and their write CHIMU. The Incas formed and began expanding after that. Their empire is dated from 1438. Draw INCA so it fits before the Spanish dashed line. The Inca conquered the Chimu. To represent North America, we will first write in three civilizations that together are called the “mound builders” Write these names one after another, without making a band, above the Mexico material. At 700 BC write ADENA (It was centered in Ohio). Then starting about 300 BC write HOPEWELL (centered in the midwest.) At 500 AD write MISSISSIPPIAN, which was centered in the southern US. To represent the many gruops in the southwest, wrote ANASAZI aound 800 AD. That is the commonly-used name for the ancestors of today’s Pueblo-building peoples (Anasazi is a Navajo word that means “Ancient Ones.), The term refers to the settlements that developed around the 4-corners area (where the states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico converge), noted for building stone houses in the clefts of canyon walls. One of those settlements, at Mesa Verde, reached its high point in the 1300’s, but soon after that was deserted. It is presumed that the peoples then moved further south to their present location. At the right of the dashed line, representing the Spanish conquest, writing just above the Maya line, draw a line starting in the 1600’s, with a diagonal going up from the same starting point, to represent the French and British colonizing in North America. Create a small band at 1776 for the year that the United States of America declared independence, and write USA within in.. Above USA, make a box for Canada, which received home-rule from Britain in 1867, and total independence in 1931, while still accepting the king or Queen of Britain as their king and queen. Under USA, and extending downward vertically to below the crease, draw a dashed line paralleling the Spanish dashed line, at about the 1820 point, for it was in the 1820’s that most of the present South American countries fought their wars of independence against Spain. to the right of the line, write LAT AM (Latin American countries). Below you can see what your diagram of the Americas should look like. Click here for the YouTube version. PART SEVEN — AFRICA In a change sfrom the YouTube version, please draw a crease just below the material you drew along the center crease. Make a band along this crease to represent Egypt. We will begin with Egypt, and please start by making a band at the low edge of your paper, all the way from left to right. We will simply draw the vertical lines of divisiion within that band as we progress. Egypt became a united country around 3100 BC, so below the band you have drawn, make a loop with an arrow pointing to the left. In it write “Egypt united, 3100 BC.” That was the beginning of the First Dynasty. By the time we get to the third dynasty, Egypt enters into a major period of flourish called the Old Kingdom. Within your loop, draw a band, and in it right OLD K. The dates are 2700 BC to 2180 BC. It was during the ealy part of the Old Kingdom taht the well known pyramids were built, in the 2500’s. Now we will draw within the band across the bottom of your paper. Draw vertical lines to create a space from 1900 BC to 1786 BC, and within it write MID K for Middle Kingdom. Then separate a space from 1560 BC to 1085 BC, and write NEW K for New Kingdom. It would have been during the New Kingdom that Moses led the people out of Egypt and into the wilderness of Sinai. In between the Middle and New Kingdom, one of groups that took control of Egypt was Semite invaders called Hyksos, so write HYK between those two kingdoms. During the 400 years after the New Kingdom, there were 4 dynasties, 4 DYN. (Details in footnote 4.) Then comes a thousand year period when Egypt is controlled by the countries you have already drawn on your center crease. As you copy them to the Egyptian band, make it a point to draw the country in line with the corresponding one above. The Persians included Egypt in their empire (write P). Then Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, and after his death it was ruled by his general Ptolemy and his descendants (write PT). Cleopatra was a member of the Ptolomy family. Since we associate her with the Roman Anthony, it is no surprise that Egypt next came under Roman control, from 64 BC to 661 (write ROM), when it came under the control of the Muslim Umayyad Caliphate. (During the years after 476 AD, it was the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) that controlled Egypt, except for a few years when Persia (the Sassanids) took control). Write ROM for Romans. At 661 with U for the Umayyads, then at 750 write AB for the Abbassids, then at 879 write M, for several other Muslim families that took control. Additional Muslim dynasties followed. [For details, see the diagram near the bottom of this page.] The Fatimids (FAT) took control in 980, then the Ayubbids AY) in 1189. The major Ayubbid leader was Saladin, who also controlled Jerusalem, and was the opponent of Richard the Lion Hearted of England during the Third Crusade. When the Mongols invaded western Asia, they did not conquer Egypt, but at the time a class of Turkish slaves rose to power, and established the Mamluk dynasty (MAM) from 1250 to 1517, when the Ottoman Turks defeated them (OTTO). You already know that the Ottoman Empire came to an end at World War I. The following African kingdoms will be drawn below the Egypt band. Another African country that continued through most of the period on our paper was Ethiopia, also known as Abyssinia. We will end with a few of the larger and longer lasting empires and kingdoms that developed in West Afria. Draw an oval from 1500 AD to 1300 AD. The part of that oval before 1000 AD was the kingdom of Ghana (GHANA), and after 1000 the same general area was controlled by the kingdom of Mali (MALI). Starting around 1500, write Songhai, below it write Hausa, and indented from the write Fulani. By that time the colonial history of Africa was under way. Below is the diagram for Part Seven, the last part. Here is the link to the YouTube video.
More options and details follow, but here is the complete diagram. This diagram is different than the YouTube version, in that the Americas are placed at the bottom so that Egypt can be closer to the middle. It also includes the names of the additional Iranian and Egyptian eras that are explained below in the Optional Details section.
By now you probably have thought of additional countries that you could add. You are encouraged to add as many as you would like, but because there is limited room on the paper, I recommend you develop separate pages that give close-ups of certain time periods and continents, or even century pages. Here are three learning methods to help you:
By memorizing one famous person in each century, you can internalize a framework upon which you can add more detail.
On a century page, you will combine ribbons from the diagram with the names of key people and events of that century. Go to explanation
You learn them by listing them on a 10-century form that helps you memorize by space and location. Go to Explanation
More details on Iran. You have drawn a band with four sections where Iran became independent from the Abbassid Caliph. The Tahirids (T) ruled from about 800 to 870, and then the Samanids (Sa) from 870 to about 1000. You have already drawn in S in the third section, indicating the rule of the Seljuk turks. Around 1140 they were defeated by an Iranian group, the Khwarezm Shahs (indicate as KS), Around 1220 the Saljuks defeated the Shahs, leaving both groups too weak to resist the Mongols.
The European conquest of the Byzantines. In1204, during the fourth crusade, the Europeans defeated the Byzantines and ruled their territory until 1261. They called their rule the “Latin Kingdom of Constantinople.” You may show this by writing an L in the lower part of the Byzantine band in the 1200’s.
Of the four dynasties after the New Kingdom of Egypt, two were invaders from outside Egypt: one Libyan and one Cushite (the country south of Egypt). The dynasties are: TANITE, 1085 to 970, (it is named after the Egyptian city of Tanis), then LIBYAN to 760, then CUSHITE to 650, (they ruled in the southern half of Egypt while the Assyrians controlled the northern half) then SAITE to 545 (named after the Egyptian city of Sais).
Japan detail. The 30 years prior to 1603 was called the Azuchi-Momoyama period. (Those are both names of castles).
More India details. Of the many smaller groups that appeared, you could add these, and then add more as you study India. In the space around 1AD, write Kushan. Under the gupta band, write Pallava, thena after it around 500 AD write Chola. From 1206 there were many separate Muslim states, called the Sultanates of Delhi. Under the Mogul band, write Maratha.
Spain. Draw a band for Spain under and the same length as the band for the Angles. The Germanic tribe that ended up in Spain was the Visigoths, so write VISI at the beginning of the band. The Umayyad dynasty conquered Spain by crossing over from northern Africa, so draw a vertical line ending the Visigoth period and draw a U to the right of it. A sequence of Muslim groups continued to rule in Spain, but the Christian rulers who remained in the far north of the country over the next 500 years gradually took back control of the country. Show this by drawing a diagonal line starting around the 900’s at the bottom line of the band, and ending up in 1492 at the top of the band. Under the line write Chr, to represent the Christian rulers, and at the end of the band, by the right edge of the paper, write SP for Spain.
Arab Kingdoms. The diagram below shows the many small states that ruled parts of the Muslim world starting with the Umayyad Caliphte:
CHINA — THREE KINGDOMS. The diagram below shows the Chinese groups that ruled after the end of the Han Dynasty.
CHINA AFTER TANG. The diagram below shows the many gruops that ruled in Chna after the Tang dynasty ended.
1. It was in the 500’s that someone (named Dionysius Exiguus) got the idea of numbering the years starting from the time of Christ. That’s what is commemorated by the use of the initials AD (those snd for the Latin Words Anno Domini, which means “the year of the Lord” with BC then being read as “before Christ.”) Many scholars today use CE (reading it as “common era”) to label the time period from Christ to the present, and then title the period before Christ as BCE (before common era). In estimating the time when Augustus was emperor, he was about 6 years off, so that is why we now commonly present the date of the birth of Christ as about 6 or 7 B.C.
2. After the end of the Han dynasty, China was divided into 3 kingdoms, called Wei, Shu Han, and Wu. Later these combined and the result was called Western Jin. After that the north and south had different dynasties. In the north, most of the time span was a dynasty called Toba, or Northern Wei. In the south, the succession os dyansties was: Eastern Jin, Luiu Song, Southern Qi, Lian, and Southern Chen. See diagram above.

I feel that, as both a reader and a writer, the hallmark of a well written book is one that takes us outside of ourselves. Where the line between reality and fantasy becomes so blurred you have a hard time remembering that the characters of the book are really nothing more than figments of a brilliant imagination.
Kelsey could be your co-worker, Rafe could be your boss, and Tracy (who I'm hoping gets a story of her own - hint, hint, Debra!) could be your best friend.
In my opinion The Vampire and the Vixen is worth your time, money, has relatable characters, will be one I will re-read, and has shown a remarkable effort by the writer. I give it 5 hearts.

Morning all, feel free to grab a cup of coffee and join me as I interview fellow author Debra St. John.
Allergic (What can I say? 'Tis the season around here. If I don't take two (and sometimes three) types of allergy medicine each day I sneeze my head off. Ugh.)
Creative (All writers have to be, I guess, but I also like to scrapbook, garden, and cook; which all involve being creative in some way.)
Sitting on the porch in summer with a really good book. (Add a light breeze and a tall glass of water with a slice of lemon and life doesn't get any more perfect.)
Going on vacation. (We recently booked another cruise for Spring Break 2014. And although it's too soon to be counting the days, we're pretty excited!)
I'm jealous. A cruise sounds awesome. Music is a big influence on my writing. I have certain songs that inspire individual chapters, and even whole books. What helps to inspire you?
Music is definitely a big inspiration for me as well. I've used songs in many ways for inspiration. For example, my heroine in This Can't Be Love has a butterfly tattoo on her lower back because of a line in a Brad Paisley song. My hero in An Unexpected Blessing puts mustard on his fries because of a line in an Eric Church song. My story A Christmas to Remember was inspired by the song of the same title sung by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. And my free read Mistletoe and Folly was inspired by a Toby Keith song. I also have an idea for a time travel spinning around in my head based on another of his songs. (Can you tell I like country music?!) In addition, a lot of my characters have 'theme songs': songs that remind me of them and/or their stories whenever I hear them.
I love vampires. I always have. They are some of my favorite heroes (and heroines). It was only a matter of time until I used the theme in a story of my own. And I love libraries. (With all those books they're like a little glimpse of heaven right here on Earth.) So my hero and heroine are both librarians.
All of the holidays approaching (Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas) seem to take their turn as my favorite as they each come in turn. One tradition we practice for all three is decorating the house, both inside and out. I love digging into the first box of decs for the season. Halloween ones are cozy and cute (pumpkins and ghosties) rather than macabre around our house. Even Thanksgiving has turkeys and pilgrims to display. But we get really serious for Christmas. We have boxes and boxes and boxes of decs. We do two trees; a real one downstairs and an artificial one upstairs. The latter holds ornaments we've gathered over the years on special occasions and vacations, so setting up the tree is like a little trip down memory lane. Lights go up on the bushes in the front and on the trees in the back. And every available surface (and some floor space) holds some type of Yuletide decoration. Of course there are definite rules to go along with the decorating. Each holiday must wait its turn. No Halloween decorations until October 1, no Thanksgiving decorations until November 1, and absolutely no Christmas decorations or music until the day after Thanksgiving.
Debra St. John has been reading and writing romance since high school. She always dreamed about publishing a romance novel some day. Her dream came true when she started writing sultry contemporary romance with sexy heroes and spunky heroines for The Wild Rose Press. Although she's a country gal at heart, she lives in a suburb of Chicago with her husband, who is her real life hero.
She is the author of The Corral Series, which includes her debut release, This Time for Always, a Champagne Rose and Rosebud bestseller at The Wild Rose Press. The second book in the series, This Can't Be Love, was Love Romance Cafe's Best of 2010 Contemporary winner. This Feels Like Home will complete the series when it releases in January.
Her holiday stories include A Christmas to Remember, An Unexpected Blessing (Thanksgiving), and her latest release, The Vampire and the Vixen for Halloween.
Kelsey Adams is determined to get ahead without the influence of a famous father or by getting special favors from her boss. So it was a big mistake to kiss Rafe Alexander on the balcony at a library fundraiser.
Rafe is mysterious, charming, and sexy. And he's Kelsey's new boss. He wants people to accept him for what he is. Which could be difficult because Kelsey has more than a sneaking suspicion he's a vampire.
Can she look beyond that and trust him with her heart to have the future she wants? And will he still be there when the sun comes up?
Readers, be sure and pick this book up. I've read it and I have to say it's great. I caught myself laughing out loud a time or two. Look for my review on Wednesday.

Today's post is brought to you by my SON. Frank's Adventure was written as a "tall tale" for school.
The first "tall tale" he wrote was almost the exact same story as Spiderman, which we sadly had to erase due to blatant plagiarism. When the almost certain temper tantrum occurred the writing of this "tall tale" became an act one can only describe as similar to pulling teeth.
As a soon to be published author who constantly dabbles in writing, it has become second nature. Thoughts pop into my head, I write them on paper, and then like playing with the countless number of Lego's we own, I begin to build on what is written. When the words are flowing, the writing is effortless. When the words aren't, it's a dead end I find hard to rectify.
This collaboration opened my eyes and got me to thinking. How is one taught how to write a story? For this particular "tall tale" is began with me asking SON leading questions.
Needless to say the next time I come up against a brick wall in my writing, I might just have to ask myself a few leading questions to see where they can lead me.
One day when Frank was walking home from school he heard a strange noise. It sounded like a growly oink. Frank decided to investigate. When he did, he saw a spider pig! It was a pink pig with eight spider legs, fangs, and a curly pig tail. Frank was not scared. In fact, he thought spider pig was cool! “That’s a whole lot of bacon,” He said. But Frank was worried. Spider pig was very skinny. “Are you hungry spider pig?” He asked. Spider pig grunted. Frank dug in his lunch box and found a pack of crackers. He gave them to spider pig. Spider pig was glad to have found a new friend. As Frank patted spider pig, he decided to give him a name. “I’m going to call you Spider pig.”
Together they began to walk home. On the way they passed the grocery store. An elderly lady was having a hard time carrying her groceries. Spider pig knew what to do. He made a web basket to carry the bags in. Together Frank and Spider pig helped the old lady. It made them feel good when she gave them a quarter. They decided to do more good deeds on the way home. Using Spider pig’s super strength they pulled a car from a swamp. With Spider pig’s many legs they rescued a cat from a tree and helped the firemen hold the water hose at a fire.
“Now what do we do?” Frank asked Spider pig. They were almost home. “Mom’s cooking dinner.” Frank said. “We can rest until there’s a new problem!” He suggested. At Spider pig’s oink, Frank nodded. “Hmm,” he wondered. “Think we’ll have pork chops tonight?” Frank said. Spider pig shook his head no, not amused. “Well how about steak?”

David Youse reached out to AIDS activist and playwright, Larry Kramer, to bring to life his play, The Normal Heart, by celebrating its’ 25th Anniversary. This idea, first produced at The Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, has raised over $175,000.00 which benefitted The Actors’ Fund, Mike Nichols’ Friends In Deed and The Jeffrey Goodman Special Care Clinic. David hired Academy Award and Tony winner, Joel Grey, to direct the reading as Mr. Grey was in the original cast of The Normal Heart, 25 years earlier. He then assembled an all star cast that included Lisa Kudrow, Tate Donovan, Dylan Walsh and Jon Tenney. The production went on to New York with a cast that included Tony and Emmy Award winner Glenn Close, Joe Mantello and Patrick Wilson. Following the one time special events, The Normal Heart had a 12 week Broadway run with Joe Mantello and Ellen Barkin directed by Joel Grey and George C. Wolfe in April of 2011. It garnered three Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Play.

Ash Museum is in the Cemetery Chapel, Ash Cemetery, Ash Church Road, Ash. We are open 3rd Sunday each month 2.00pm - 4.30pm.
This hand pulled funeral bier, which continued in use until c.1977, forms a central exhibit in the museum.
Other interesting objects include three shields which formerly hung in the British Legion Hut next to the Ash War Memorial, saved when the hut was demolished, a souvenir programme for the presentation of the Victoria Hall clock and turret by Dr Henry Morris Chester in memory of his mother, the trowel used to lay the foundation stone of the Victoria Hall, and Mr Wren's Burial Board Notice Board.
A Lucas 260N “King of the Road” carbide cycle lamp made by Joseph Lucas Ltd of Birmingham forms part of a display of memorabilia from the very well known Tolley's Garage. A plan of Ash Cemetery in 1887 is also on display. In 1943 Italian Prisoners of War were kept at Carfax Avenue, and on display we have the Crucifix in the Bottle made by POW Annunziata Alfonso in 1944. You can also see a painting of St Peter’s Church c.1906 by John James Miles who spent his whole working life as school master in Ash at Ash National School and then at Heathcote Memorial School; and from Tongham School we have collection of Tongham Trophies.
Ash Common School was founded in 1860 and renamed renamed Heathcote Memorial School in memory of the Reverend Gilbert Wall Heathcote, Rector of Ash 1838 to 1884, who died in 1893. Our display includes copies from the log books, the 1860 foundation stone and a rainwater head dated 1884 commemorating the building of the first extension to the school.
There is a large and growing collection of old pictures of village buildings and people to browse through and bring back memories. There are folders of Tongham Stories and memories of the Ash Through the Ages Group of the Ash U3A to read, Ash Museum Newsletters and History Notes produced by Ash Museum on a range of topics.
Because the medical school admissions process has become so aggressive, it has never been more difficult getting approved to medical school as it is today. Every season, the variety of programs improves while the variety of chairs remains the same <a href="http://q1854f4.dhpreview.devhub.com/blog...administration/">dhpreview</a>. Last season, over 40 million individuals used and less than 50% were approved. Now more than ever, it takes much more than simply great qualities and extracurricular actions. It needs in an in-depth knowledge of the procedure, an capability to get shiny individual suggestions and most of all, well designed and informative composing capability.</p>
<p>Most individuals don`t know this, but even though the official medical school admissions application process starts in Jan of the season before access, the casual popularity procedure starts the day you step foot in college! The reason is that whether you`re implementing in your younger season or 25 years after graduating college from college, medical school admissions popularity committees always evaluate your speed and agility beginning with your beginner season <a href="http://www.chinese-printing.com/chinese_...over_books.html">book publishing</a>. Many potential candidates don`t realize this and skip the opportunity to start identifying themselves early on. They spend that first season targeted completely on the their sessions, while their more informed cohorts are helping out in medical centers or doing medical research.</p>
<p>The official program starts in Jan of the season before matriculation, which indicates it continues a full twenty months! Here`s an summary what you should be doing during these 21 several weeks.</p>
<p>From Jan to Apr, you should perform on getting in touch with potential suggestions authors. Capture for a mix of teachers and expert sources. During this time, you should also be learning for the Medical School Admissions Test (otherwise know as the MCAT) and actually taking it sometime around Apr <a href="http://www.sunmoonittradebin.com/product...d362/tower.html"> HP ML Tower Server</a>. During May and September, you works on finishing the AMCAS, which is the actual program. The AMCAS contains two main sections: 1) a area for your perform and extracurricular actions, and 2) a area for your individual declaration <a href="http://www.teamuniformssoccer.com">Soccer Customized Jerseys</a>.

The Peoria Pathways to Prosperity team and its partners completed a pilot manufacturing pre-apprenticeship and are scaling it to engage approximately 40 students across four school districts and multiple manufacturing employers for AY 2018.
Also, Illinois Central College’s Industrial Maintenance apprenticeship is launching a pilot cohort of 15 students in fall of 2018, and new apprenticeships in Manufacturing, IT, and Health Sciences are being readied for following semesters. Pathways have been sequenced in Health Sciences, Manufacturing, and Information Technology across six unique school districts. The master template/framework was adopted, and a regional pathways dashboard is currently being constructed with sequencing. The team is also planning work to engage more regional districts this fall.
September 2017 — In Peoria, the initial success of Peoria Pathways to Prosperity has drawn attention as a promising demonstration of the community’s capacity to embrace change to meet the challenges ahead. This success was highlighted recently in Peoria Magazine: Read more
June 2017 — In AY 2016-17 Peoria Pathways to Prosperity placed sixty interns at 16 unique employers. Peoria is on track to launch a Criminal Justice Pathway in AY 2017-18 and an Education & Training Pathway in AY 2018-19. They are also refining their Career Pathways guide for the upcoming year. Finally, the American Federation of Teachers is offering a third year of funding to sustain and expand the Pathways work in Greater Peoria. You can learn more about the funding here.
The Greater Peoria region renewed its efforts to study economic development including the region’s talent ecosystem that includes many pipelines formed by elementary, secondary, post‐secondary, and business‐centric talent development organizations. In the Spring of 2015, the Mayor of Peoria invited executives from Peoria Public Schools, Peoria Federation of Teachers, CEO Council, Peoria Chamber of Commerce, Illinois Central College, Illinois Student Assistance Commission, Illinois Pathways Initiative, and Greater Peoria Workforce Alliance to participate in conversation with George Letavish, Illinois Governor’s office to consider the possibility of joining the Pathways to Prosperity Network. The participants (stakeholders) agreed to bind together to form a Peoria Pathways to Prosperity (PP2P) team to study education to careers challenges facing students matriculating through the Peoria Public Schools and to recommend improvements.
The teams findings revealed a greater need for alignment of curriculum leading to occupations, between Peoria Public Schools and Illinois Central College, as well as need for private sector businesses to work with education to create career-development opportunities for Peoria’s youth. To move on these needs, in June of 2015 the Pathways team applied for, and received a grant through the American Federation of Teacher’s Innovation Fund. This grant allowed the Pathways team to hire a full-time coordinator, Brent Baker, dedicated to creating new opportunities for Peoria Public Schools youth. Most recently, the Pathways team has been provided a second year of funding through the AFT to continue the Pathways work well into 2017.
Created, embedded, and aligned seven new dual-credit healthcare and manufacturing courses beginning AY 2016
Established a standing committee comprised of Peoria Public Schools and Illinois Central College administrators dedicated to expanding college access
Saw the launch of our first Community Initaitive Center of Excellence for Secure Software (CICESS), secured software apprenticeship cohort of seven students, began the program

May 2, 2018, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic – Sister Margarita Ruiz, OP, presented a book on the history of 22 congregations of women religious in the Dominican Republic during a public assembly April 12 in the auditorium of the Dominican Institute of Theology in Santo Domingo.
She was chosen to present the book – Memoria Histórica de la Vida Religiosa Femenina en República Dominicana: 1959-1999 (Historic Memory of the Life of Women Religious in the Dominican Republic: 1959-1999) – because of her leadership in coordinating the histories of the congregations and helping to compile and edit the unique history.
Memoria Histórica was the result of a proposal by the Latin American Religious Conference (CLAR) that women religious congregations in Latin America write and share their histories. CLAR sought to commemorate the 40 years of the organization’s existence; make visible the presence of women religious in the nations represented by CLAR; and guide consecrated women in their efforts to re-found their congregations to meet the needs of the world.
Sister Margarita said she experienced “great joy” in writing the history of the Adrian Dominican Sisters and Associates who have ministered in the Dominican Republic. “It really was a group project,” she said, explaining that all of the Sisters who had ministered in the Dominican Republic were involved in gathering the information, evaluating their accomplishments, and judging their response to the challenges they had lived.
Recently, the 22 congregations that had written their history in the Dominican Republic saw the benefit of compiling their histories into one book so they could learn from the events, changes, and reflections of one another, Sister Margarita said. “Everyone is eager to read the book and to be able to recognize the presence of God in the midst of the different spiritualities of the religious who worked in the Dominican Republic during the years when the history was written.”

The Models Contrasted. In actuality, "the" theory of evolution is a misnomer. There are several different, competing models (Darwinian evolution, Punctuated Equilibrium, Gaia, life from extraterrestrial sources, etc.). In general, they share some common predictions, including the introduction of new genetic material via mutations, migration of one "kind" of life into another", an "old earth", etc. On the "creation" side, there are also several different models ("literal Genesis", Gap Theory). In general, they include the introduction of various "kinds" of life via supernatural intervention, no migration of one "kind" of life into another, a global cataclysmic flood that devastated the planet, etc. In addition, there are various models under the umbrella of "theistic evolution" that combine aspects of both natural evolution and supernatural intervention.
Evidence from Biology. While both evolution and creation models attempt to describe things that happened in the distant past that cannot be reproduced today, there is laboratory evidence that can contribute to the "plausibility" of a model. From a biology perspective comes evidence associated with mutations and a concept called "irreducible complexity". Genetic mutations are the only known source of new materials to increase genetic variability. Those observed today tend to be harmful, not helpful. As suggested in numerous fruit fly and E. coli bacteria experiments, the genetic code is observed to deteriorate or degrade over time, not get better. There are fatal or harmful effects with some variation, but always within a bounding limit of viability and never any new organs.
Most evolutionary models indicate that "natural selection" or "survival of the fittest" is the mechanism that filters out the many "bad" mutations in favor of the few "good" mutations. However, the observed evidence from biology shows numerous organs, systems, and functions that function only when totally complete. Having only a portion of the whole conveys no evolutionary advantage to the individual. In fact, in some cases, the organism cannot survive without all the proper elements working together. Per Darwin: "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modification, my theory would absolutely break down."
Examples of this "irreducible complexity" include single-celled life, vision, the immune system, blood clotting, circulation system, reproduction, flight, metamorphosis, and many others.
Regarding single-celled life, there is the mutual interdependence of DNA and protein-based replicating machinery that requires at least several hundred different specific biological macro-molecules. To that must be considered the required combination of DNA, messenger RNA, ribosomes, cell membranes, enzymes, lipids, amino acids, etc. into functional cellular structures, energy systems, long-chain proteins and nucleic acids.
Regarding vision, consider the various layers, nerves, muscles, and other cellular mechanisms that permit the eye to sense light, adapt to different light levels, focus near & far, integrate two separate images into a perceived 3-D scene, be self-cleaning, be self-repairing, and so on. As Darwin said, "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree."
Regarding the metamorphosis of certain caterpillars into butterflies, consider not only the silk gland & instinct for spinning a cocoon, but also the complete disintegration of most internal organs and reintegration of the resulting "goo" into completely different structures (mouth, eyes, wings, antennae, legs).
Regarding the supposed transition of a land mammal into a ocean-dwelling whale, how would the transitional form survive for "millions" of years with a partial tail fluke that was too weak to swim, legs too weak to walk, partially formed blowhole, partial ability to drink sea water, etc.?
Evidence from the Fossil Record. For events that happened in the distant past, the fossil record is the only source for evidence of geological and biological activity on the planet. Most evolutionary models would predict numerous transitional forms throughout the fossil record as various "kinds" mutation into other "kinds" and a fairly orderly sequence of simpler organisms in deeper deposits gradually becoming more complex in shallower deposits. The creation model would predict a lack of transitional forms with the sudden appearance of fully mature & stable "kinds". The geologic record would be somewhat disorderly based on the cataclysmic events surrounding the Great Flood. The evidence from the fossil record generally shows a lack of transitional forms and a lack of order.
The "Cambrian Explosion". Between the youngest geologic strata without life signs ("Precambrian") and the oldest strata with life ("Cambrian") is a figurative explosion of life, over 5000 fully formed and distinguishable kinds of animals, including single cell, multi-cell, invertebrates, vertebrates/fish), over 95% of the roughly 30 known living phyla present. Where did they come from? Where are the expected innumerable transitional forms?
Living "fossils". During the time that early reptiles were evolving into man, some kinds appear relatively unchanged for millions of years (per evolutionary dating methods). Examples include the coelacanth fish (80-100 M years), dragonflies (170 M years), cockroaches (300 M years), squid (400 M years), and starfish (500 M years).
Troubling inconsistencies. The geologic column is not as pristine as some textbook illustrations would have the reader believe. In the field, there are numerous examples of layers being out of the expected "sequence", layers that are "missing" at a given location with multiple million year gaps that show no signs of weathering, fossils that extend through multiple strata that allegedly took millions of years to deposit, and more complex fossils in strata that predate their simpler "parents".
As Darwin says "Why, if species have descended from other species by fine graduations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined? Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology surely does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain. And this is perhaps the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory."
Evidence from Physics. From the world of physics come the various dating methods. The evolutionary models require many millions of years for life to evolve. The creation models are generally more consistent with a younger earth.
Evidences for a young sun. According to some sources, there are some observed anomalies with the sun that are more consistent with a much younger star. These include its rate of shrinkage, a relatively light core, an unexpected low neutrino flux, and other evidence that suggests a young star being powered mostly by gravitational contraction rather than nuclear fusion.
Evidences for a young earth. Likewise, there are some observed anomalies with the earth & moon that are more consistent with a much younger planet. These include a relatively thin layer of accumulated meteoric dust, the rate of earths magnetic field decay, insufficient sediment on the ocean floors and sodium in the oceans based on present-day accumulation rates.
Problems with radioactive decay methods. Such methods generally measure the relative ratio of various elements related by the decay of "parent" elements into "daughter" elements. However, the reliability of these methods depends on several unverifiable assumptions: no daughter element must be present when the sample was formed and no addition or loss of parent and daughter elements can occur throughout the life of the sample. The first assumption can be easily disproved by the dating of modern lava flows (within the last 200 years) that produces 10s to 100s M year "ages" because of daughter products already present.
Many of the uniformitarian assumptions underlying various dating methods are having to be reexamined in light of recent observations, especially associated with the eruption of Mount St. Helen. 200-600 feet of sorted layers deposited by catastrophic mud and ash flows with 140 foot deep canyons cut in a day point to the potential cataclysmic effects of short-term phenomena that produce "old" looking deposits.
Summary. Many would claim that any sort of creationism and/or young earth model belongs solely in the realm of religion. But does a closer look at the available evidence from biology, the fossil record, and physics indicate strong correlation with the predictions of the various evolutionary models? Or are there major areas that evolutionary theory does not have the ability to explain and that a creation model better accounts for? Weigh the evidence and decide.

I was 13 years old when the events of Semptember 11th, 2001 unfolded. I was a middle schooler at the time. While walking out of my 1st period French class, I heard bits and pieces of different conversations from other students. The only things I could pick up were that a plane had hit The Pentagon, and The Twin Towers. I exchanged my books at my locker and then proceeded to my 2nd period math class. From this point on, everything is blurry, every detail runs together, and it is from this point on that I begin to lose understanding. I took my seat in math, and there, our teacher told us what she knew, which was very little. The only thing I remember is her saying there were pictures of smoke coming from The Pentagon, but they didn't what exactly had caused it.We proceeded to have class as normal, and as that period ended, another began. This, I remember, was the only part of the day that would shed any clarification. This was the only class that actually let us see what was happening, and it was only for five minutes. I can't remember if I saw the 2nd tower fall live, or if what I saw was a replay.To this day, I still don't know. it was after that the tv was shut off and we proceeded on with class. I remember being so angry at not being let see what was happening to our country, happening to our other fellow Americans. I wanted to understand, I wanted to process what was happening, but I wasn't allowed. I was supposed to carry on as if it were a "normal day." That is how the school decided to handle it. Treat it as a normal day. We all knew it wasn't a normal day, so why treat it as one! I am angry at that still. The day proceeded on. I can't remember much of it. I can't remember what classes we spoke of the day's tragedies, or who I personally spoke of them to. The next bit of the day that I can clearly see is coming home from school, and sitting in front of the tv. A plane flew over our house producing sonic booms. Me and my sister dove behind the couch, cluthcing eachother in fear. We thought we were being bombed. I only remember bits and pieces of most the days to follow that day. I remember feeling scared to death and confused. I remember watching the tv coverage for 3 plus days more before we finally had the courage to change the channel. And I remember how wrong we felt when we did. I remember how from that day forward America united together, and showed the terrorists that they could not break us. That day, and the days to follow, every American became bound to one another, forever sharing a bond. And that's how we showed them they could not, nor would they EVER break us. Millions of people, strangers, people I will never even know exsisted, every single one of us are tethered. We are bound forever, and remain stronger forever.
I am 23 years old now. To this day, I still am not fully able to grasp the events that took place that day, and even the days, months, and rest of 2001 that followed. To this day, I still don't understand everything that happened, and I am afraid I never will. I watch documentries, read stories, and anything else I can to try to process it. I remember I had set my VCR to record a show of mine that day, and it instead recorded footage. I have watched some, but for some reason, have never been able to finish it. Maybe some day I will. I still have anger at my middle school for not allowing us to watch and absorb what happened. I think if we had been allowed to I might have a clearer understanding of that day, and maybe a better memory. But I dont know. Maybe some day I won't have anger anymore for something I can never change. Now, ten years later, I can try to bring myself to grasp ahold of that day. I will honor those who sacraficed their lives to save someone else, and honor those innocents who had their lives ripped away from them much too early. I will pray for their families, and for those who survived. Those who relive it every day of their life. Now, ten years later, I will remember everything I can from that day, and never forget it. Maybe some day I will understand it, and maybe I won't, but remembering is the best step I can take towards understanding.

An Investigation on Strength and Transport Properties of Self-Consolidating Lightweight Concrete Containing Polypropylene Fibers
The development of new types of high performance concrete such as self-consolidating concrete (SCC) and lightweight concrete (LWC)responds to some of the urgent needs of the construction sector. The use of lightweight aggregates in the production of SCC combines the favorable properties of LWC and SCC in self-consolidating lightweight concrete (SCLC). However, there are few studies on properties of SCLC up to now. In this study, the effects of polypropylene fibers on strength and transport properties of SCLC were investigated. Two types of polypropylene fibers, 6mm and 12mm long, were used in SCLC mixtures at different contents of 0%, 0.025%, 0.05% and 0.1% by total volume of concrete. The fresh properties of SCLCs were observed through slump flow time and diameter, V-funnel flow time and J-ring tests. Unit weight, compressive strength, flexural strength, pulse velocity, water absorption, and sorptivity were measured in all SCLC mixes and compared with that of the control mixture. It has been found that using polypropylene fibers in SCLC can lead to improvement in both strength and transport properties of concrete
The Hague is the seat of the Dutch government and parliament, the Supreme Court, and the Council of State, but the city is not the capital of the Netherlands which constitutionally is Amsterdam.
With a population just over 500,000 inhabitants (as of 1 November 2012) and more than one million inhabitants including the suburbs, it is the third largest city of the Netherlands, after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The combined urban area of The Hague and Rotterdam, with a population of approximately 2.9 million, is the 206th largest urban area in the world and the most populous in the country.
Located in the west of the Netherlands, The Hague is in the centre of the Haaglanden conurbation and lies at the southwest corner of the larger Randstad conurbation. King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands plans to live at Huis ten Bosch and works at Noordeinde Palace in The Hague, together with Queen Maxima.
Most foreign embassies in the Netherlands and 150 international organisations are located in the city, including the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, which makes The Hague one of the major cities hosting the United Nations, along with New York, Geneva, Bonn, Vienna, Tokyo and Nairobi.
The Hague is the Netherlands' largest city on the North Sea, in the southwest of the South Holland province, and forms the centre of a conurbation called Haaglanden. Westland and Wateringen lie to the south, Delft and the Rotterdam conurbation to the southeast, Nootdorp, Pijnacker, Rijswijk and Voorburg to the east, Zoetermeer and Voorschoten to the northeast and Wassenaar and Leidschendam-Voorburg and the Leiden conurbation to the north.
The conurbations around The Hague and Rotterdam are close enough to be a single conurbation in some contexts. For example, they share the Rotterdam The Hague Airport and a light rail system called RandstadRail.

With legislation giving students decision-making power over their student media comes questions about roles, purpose and standards. If the school cannot make content decisions who is responsible? What is the role of the adviser? Of students? If the adviser cannot control content, what guidelines will students follow and why?
The Student Press Law Center has said its goal for supporting free expression legislation is to approach the various New Voices Acts as comprehensive educational legislation that will benefit students at each stage of their development, while recognizing the differences between each educational environment.
“A core value of being a journalist is to understand the role of the press in a free society. That role is to provide an independent source of information so that a citizen can make informed decisions. It is often the case that this core value of journalistic independence requires a journalist to question authority rather than side with authority. Thus, if the role of the press in a democratic society is to have any value, all journalists – including student journalists – must be allowed to publish viewpoints contrary to those of state authorities without intervention or censorship by the authorities themselves. Without protection, the freedoms of speech and press are meaningless and the press becomes a mere channel for official thought.”
The Talking Points below, and the other materials in this package, might help clarify the importance of legislation protecting free speech and what the various terms – legal and educational – mean.
Points are used with permission from the Student Press Law Center, the Journalism Education Association’s Scholastic Press Rights Committee and JEA’s Principals and the Press initiative.
State legislation trumps Hazelwood because it adds to Constitutional guarantees of the First Amendment for all citizens, including students. In effect, it restores Tinker by rolling back Hazelwood.
A student editor of a school-sponsored publication in a state with these laws is entitled to both the protection of The First Amendment and the protection of the state law. To put it another way, Hazelwood establishes the minimum level of high school press freedom that the First Amendment requires. No government official — federal, state or local — may act in a way, nor may lawmakers pass a law or policy, that provides individuals with less free speech protection than that required by the First Amendment, as interpreted in Hazelwood. Nothing, however, prevents state lawmakers from passing a law that requires school and government officials in their state to provide student journalists with more rights than the constitution requires.
No. This legislation reverts to Tinker standards and unprotected speech: libel, material and substantial disruption, unwarranted invasion of privacy and obscenity.
Responsible student journalists strive for accuracy, completeness and balance to achieve and maintain credibility. The new legislation gives them a greater chance to achieve this practice.
Responsible scholastic journalists thoroughly gather and deliver coherent, accurate and complete content that serves their audience and its need to know – no matter what media platform they use.
Responsible students avoid unprotected speech — libel, unwarranted invasion of privacy, copyright infringement and obscenity – and language that causes a material and substantial disruption of the school day or advocates illegal use of drugs.
Students learn to pursue and act on those standards by making final decisions of content, without review or restraint by adviser or those outside the student media staff.
Administrators can improve their schools’ learning environment by providing open access to information and the freedom to choose topics and sources essential to communities’ various audiences. Responsible administrators empower their teachers to educate students on legal and ethical responsibilities, making prior review and censorship counterproductive and unnecessary.
As Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel say in “The Elements of Journalism,” journalists’ first responsibility is to the truth, and their loyalty is to the citizens they report for.
“Journalism provides something unique to a culture,” the authors write. “Independent, reliable, accurate and comprehensive information citizens require to be free.”
• What if the school has existing policy and school administrators say the law does not apply to existing policy?
New legislation would likely win out over existing policy if the policy were contrary to the wording and intent of the legislation. Prior review, however, might still be allowed so long as administrators or school officials just reviewed and did not demand change or make changes. Prior review, though, would have to be severely limited in terms of time. Read and return by the end of the school day is reasonable.
The SPLC’s Frank LoMonte said, “The (Illinois) legislation doesn’t say speech can be prohibited if the speech violates school policies – it says you can prohibit speech that incites students to violate district policies. I’m sure what they had in mind was stuff that incites people to violate disciplinary rules (truancy, tardiness) that are not actually ‘illegal.’” If a school were to ever actually say, ‘We have a school policy against criticizing the principal’ and tried to override HB 5902 on those grounds, we would gladly challenge it.
• What happens if an adviser is ill-prepared to properly guide students to make the “right” content choices?
We would urge advisers to make use of the myriad of materials available to them from multiple sources. The Student Press Law Center, The Freedom Forum, the national and regional scholastic press associations and the Journalism Education Association all have teaching and background resources. The Scholastic Press Rights Committee also urges advisers to work with students to design a journalistically and educationally sound mission statement for student media, an editorial policy designating student media as public forums, journalistically responsible ethical guidelines that have clear processes students will follow.
All this is not just adviser and student responsibility. School boards and administrators also have an obligation to ensure advisers have adequate access to teaching materials and educational opportunities, including professional organization membership and workshops for teacher/adviser and students.
The reason we have professional organizations like JEA is to better prepare teachers, who may not be trained in journalism, for this important work. Just as some coaches may not have formal training to coach, student media advisers sometimes must learn on the job. This is not a reason to deny students the opportunity to have their voices heard by imposing administrative control over content, which only suppresses critical thinking and halts civic engagement; rather, it is a reason to encourage excellence and to support student responsibility by providing access to resources and training.
Absolutely nothing. In fact, it might save districts money in the long run by protecting them from legal liability.
• Why shouldn’t students be subject to censorship? After all, commercial journalists are subject to editing.
Editors of commercial media news are not employed by the government; the work they edit is work-for-hire. Student journalists are not employed by the school. School administrators are, in fact, government officials. The First Amendment was crafted to protect U.S. citizens from government censorship. Student speech is protected by the First Amendment, as long as it is lawful and does not cause a “substantial disruption” of the educational process.
The Student Press Law Center provides the legal definition of what is considered, by law, to be “unprotected speech.”
Commercial journalists do not seek permission from their primary sources to publish information and, in fact, have a longstanding tradition of not letting sources see stories before publication. Administrators are primary sources for student journalists. The temptation to censor can be irresistible for administrators, especially in cases when they do not agree with the subject matter or fear that content might reflect poorly on them and their schools.
• Why should we limit the censorship authority of administrators over student media produced on school time with school resources?
Allowing genuine student media outlets that provide students with a meaningful voice on issues that truly matter to them can be a threatening idea to those used to controlling the message. However, we have a First Amendment because, as a nation, we decided that free and independent media play a vital role in our democracy – even if they sometimes are messier than state-controlled media. The fact that student media is produced using school resources does not empower administrators to dictate content. Advisers and administrators are responsible for teaching students so they can make informed content choices.
Fortunately, a number of administrators don’t look upon their student media as adversaries or threats. Instead, they view independent student media as important school assets. They see the value in providing students with forums to express their concerns, and recognize the educational opportunities provided by strong, well-supported student journalism programs.
There has never been a reported court decision where a public school or school district has been held legally responsible for content in student media. This legislation ensures that school districts and school administrators are protected from lawsuits. With this law, students would be legally responsible for content in their media – not school officials or school departments.
No. This law does not protect unlawful speech – the same categories of speech that every journalist must avoid (libel, material that invades a person’s legal right to privacy, obscenity as to minors, etc.). The law also imposes an additional category of speech restriction specific to schools: High school students cannot publish speech that would materially and substantially disrupt normal school activities. This establishes a meaningful balance between administrative authority to maintain a safe and effective learning environment and student free speech rights.
Such incidents have occurred, but they are certainly the exception rather than the rule. The majority of student media outlets practice journalism in a responsible manner.
The ability to cover important issues without censorship, promotes a safe and healthy school environment. Students don’t just complain about the cafeteria food. They confront real issues, especially those which are relevant to teens. While it may make administrators uncomfortable, students often cite real safety concerns in their schools. They may cite the need for repairs that have been ignored, especially those that are outside the public view to which students have access, such as locker rooms, student bathrooms and most classrooms. They often bring about change as a result of their vigilance, courage and honesty. The greater good of the students and staff superaedes the reluctance of administrators to hide the truth. They need to be held accountable by the public for not securing a facility properly. Often, board of education members will discover something that they all have read only in the school newspaper, and will investigate the matter once the conditions are exposed.
School communities need and deserve stories that reflect the authentic student experience. Giving students a voice actually can help guard against disruptive and potentially dangerous behavior by shedding light on issues of concern and empowering the powerless. In fact, coverage of sensitive and important issues often can effect positive change.
Yes. The First Amendment does not cover all forms of speech. According to the First Amendment Center, there are essentially nine types of unprotected speech: obscenity, fighting words, defamation (includes libel, slander), child pornography, perjury, blackmail, incitement to imminent lawless action, true threats, solicitations to commit crimes.

Lindsay Lohan Responds to ‘Speed-the-Plow’s’ Negative Reviews and Criticisms; ‘Mean Girls’ Star Did Well on Her Second Night; Receives Praises on Twitter
Lindsay Lohan’s first night on the West End stage wasn’t at all great after the “Speed-the-plow” star messed up her lines multiple times throughout the entire performance.
Following her first show, thousands of fans and critics weighed in on her performance negatively and Lohan was left with no other choice but to defend herself.
Mirror, the 28-year-old actress said, “It could have been a disaster – but it wasn’t by far. I respect people who have an opinion, but I’m doing the best I can and will for the duration. I’m doing this because working makes me feel happy and this is a new venture for me.”
Thousands of people criticized Lohan for fluffing her lines and several other things. On Twitter, one user named Steve wrote, “Lindsay Lohan needed line prompting 5 times, after the interval, but hiding behind 1 preview nerves is a great performance.”
Twitter user Clare tweeted, “So Lindsay Lohan had her lines written down in a book & also got fed a line. Total car crash.”
NY Daily News reviewed Lohan’s performance and said, “Looking pale and nervous, Lohan managed to hang on through her small but critical role as Hollywood secretary Karen – but only with the aid of some crew members offstage who shouted lines at her when she blanked on what she was supposed to say.”
Meanwhile, Lohan’s second day on stage was much better than her first. Not only did she remember her lines throughout the entire show, Lohan also gave justice to her character, Perez Hilton noted.
Twitter users commended her for her second night performance. @markh999 wrote, “A great @lindsaylohan in #speedtheplow tonight. No cues or flubbed lines that I saw. Theater should never be reviewed on opening night.”
Twitter user @VampireSoup wrote, “She’s here. She’s acting. She knows her lines. Ha! YOU WERE WRONG. #SpeedThePlow.”

I was hurt in the past. I have been betrayed. I made mistakes. Am I good enough? Am I worthy? Will I ever feel safe? Am I doing the right thing?
But then, a sight like this: a splendor of light greeting me at sunrise, and all I had to do was open my eyes.
And suddenly, it’s game over for the ping ponging of the I against what is, even if only for this moment.
What is this elusive I that thinks it’s separate from life? What am I, if not a ray of light that temporarily forgets, over and over again, its untethered nature and unity with the sun?
May this elusive I surrender and surrender deeper yet to the immutable wellspring of power and beauty that’s within and without and everywhere, for it is all that is and ever was.
Enlightening Post. Yes, I know what is feels, when we are depressed and lonely. Those who are suffering from depression and anxiety face lot of problems to overcome it. They generally start hurting them-self, whenever they are depressed. But you can’t be totally dependent on medications, because it works rarely. So basically, we have to work on ourself itself, we should try changing our behavior, our physical activity, lifestyle, and even our way of thinking. You may also go for some kind of consultation if you are facing a lot of problems to overcome your issue. You may once check out here for more information about it http://www.martine-voyance.com/qui-suis-je/. They can provide proper guidance to individuals and move there life towards positive direction.

I’ve been thinking about writing a food diary for a while now, but with running a busy design studio, keeping fit and being diagnosed with Graves disease (not a very pleasant name!), I guess life had gotten in the way.
After finding out about my illness (an autoimmune disorder that affects thyroid function & metabolism), I’ve begun to realise how important fresh, natural foods are to a healthy lifestyle. That’s when ‘Jennifer Makes’ seemed to fall into place.
At first, the idea of ‘eating well’ sounded quite vague but I’ve discovered it actually just means eating wisely, something we can all do pretty easily when we know how.
Swapping out processed ‘junk’ food for naturally tasty ingredients, means that you can choose exactly what you’re feeding your body and know that it’s thanking you for it.
I love discovering new recipes, and learning how easy it is to make lots of nourishing meals all from a few simple ingredients. Jennifer Makes is a place for me to share my thoughts and recipes with you, and I hope you enjoy!

Hi! I'm Cath. I have an amazing daughter, Srey, born in 2003, and an action-packed son, Cheyyo, born in 2004, both adopted from Cambodia. Our family has been active at AFA events over the last 5 years, and so I thought it was time to help out a little more with the hard work which goes on behind the scenes to make these events possible!
We've loved attending AFA events. My kids have had fun while building friendships with kids with similar backgrounds to their own. And I have had the opportunity to get to know other adoptive and permanent care parents, to ask their advice and to learn from their experiences....and to lend a sympathetic ear to others in return. I'm keen to see AFA continue to provide a range of opportunities for kids and parents to get to know each other, learn from each other and support each other. I hope to see you at an AFA event soon!

In order to have your desired printers available when using VMware Horizong from a Linux computer, you have to create a login script that adds the printers when you login. Keep in mind that the more printers you add, the longer this process will take so it’s recommended that you only add the printers you need.
Create a file called $netlog.bat in your U:\public space on a Bucknell Windows computer. The contents of that file should look like this:
You can add or change the printers you want to add by modifying or copying the lines that start with rundll32. The name of the printer appears at the end of the line (e.g. \\pharos-ps1-prd\BUBWPrint). If you don’t know the path to the printer you need, please contact ecst@bucknell.edu with the location of the printer and we’ll help you identify the printer name/path.

Adrienne Shelly was a one-of-kind person. Funny, silly, smart, cool and a naturally gifted actor, writer and director. A kind, generous, beautiful soul whose infectious smile illuminated everything around her.
Adrienne’s film career launched in 1988 with her starring role in director Hal Hartley’s acclaimed The Unbelievable Truth, followed by the classic Trust two years later.
She appeared in over twenty other films, including 2005’s Factotum with Matt Dillon. She wrote, directed and starred in three feature films, Sudden Manhattan, I’ll Take You There and Waitress, which premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, was purchased hours later by Fox Searchlight Films, and went on to critical acclaim and box-office success. It is now being developed as a Broadway musical. Another of her scripts, Serious Moonlight, directed by Cheryl Hines and starring Meg Ryan and Timothy Hutton, was released in theaters December 2009. It is now being adapted for the stage.
Adrienne’s passion in life was to make movies. She lived for her art, and she never compromised her integrity or commitment to her vision. It is in this spirit that The Adrienne Shelly Foundation was established following her tragic death in 2006.
Our mission is simple yet critical: Supporting Women Filmmakers. We’ve partnered with the finest academic and filmmaking institutions, including the Sundance Institute, AFI, IFP, Women in Film, Tribeca Film Institute, Nantucket Film Festival, Boston University, Columbia University and Rooftop Films, to provide scholarships, production grants, finishing funds and living stipends, and have granted over fifty awards to-date. This group includes Cynthia Wade, who won an Academy Award in 2008 for her documentary Freeheld, which ASF helped fund, as well as other notable filmmakers Dee Rees, Maryam Keshevarz, Ana Lily Amirpour, Ondi Timoner, Annie Sundberg/Ricki Stern, Nanette Burstein, Stacie Passon and Lucy Mulloy.
With your generous tax-deductible donation, you can honor Adrienne’s legacy and help other very talented women achieve their filmmaking dreams. We thank you for your support.

Real-time PCR probe assay designed for gene expression analysis. Probe assays consist of unlabeled PCR primers and a dual labeled fluorescent probe.
Gene-specific synthetic DNA template designed to give a positive real-time PCR result when used with the corresponding probe assay.
Specificity Amplicon sequence validated with next generation sequencing (NGS). Minimal primer dimer formation and genomic DNA cross reactivity.
These DNA primer pairs were designed by prioritizing the gene regions most commonly found in transcript variants. Strict design criteria were used to ensure optimal real-time PCR results for each target:
Every PCR primer pair was experimentally validated using Bio-Rad’s iScript™ advanced cDNA synthesis kit and SsoAdvanced™ SYBR® Green supermix. PrimePCR assay design and validation are fully described in the following publication.
Thomson Reuters provided interactive pathway maps for 260 canonical pathways. Each pathway belongs to one or more general biological categories such as cancer. The pathway maps illustrate protein interactions and regulation to provide a comprehensive picture of signaling and disease processes. The selected pathways were used to design panels of real-time PCR primers tailored for the top-ranked genes for differential gene expression analysis. Each gene target within a pathway was assigned a score based on the frequency of differential expression and its research significance. The resulting scores were used to select the assays included in the corresponding real-time PCR pathway panel.
Control assays and synthetic DNA templates were designed to facilitate the assessment of the key experimental factors impacting your real-time PCR results.
Use the PrimePCR DNA contamination control assay to determine if genomic DNA (gDNA) is present in a sample at a level that may affect PCR results. This assay may also be used to compare relative levels of gDNA contamination present in different samples to determine if PCR results may be affected.
Use the PrimePCR positive control assay to qualitatively assess the performance of a PCR reaction associated with a single sample. This assay may also be used to compare the relative performance of PCR reactions associated with different samples.
Use the PrimePCR RNA quality assay to determine if RNA integrity may adversely affect PCR results for a single sample. This assay may also be used to compare relative RNA integrity among different samples to determine how PCR results might be affected.
Use the PrimePCR reverse transcription control assay to qualitatively assess the performance of the reverse transcription reaction associated with a single sample. This assay may also be used to compare the relative performance of the reverse transcription reactions associated with different samples.
Reference genes are used in relative gene expression analysis to normalize for variation in the amount of input messenger RNA (mRNA) among samples. To ensure accurate quantitation, it is important to include one or more reference genes exhibiting constant expression levels under the experimental conditions. To streamline reference gene selection, we offer PCR primers for a set of commonly used reference genes that can be used individually, easily screened using our preplated 96-well and 384-well reference panels or added to custom-designed plates.

It's something of a birding hot spot in the country. I passed more than one tour in progress with lecturers discussing the different sorts of swans and herrings they were looking at. There's an informative sign that talks about the more exotic birds on the list, which the birds had shat on, along with my car.
Just on the other side of the dunes there is a sandy beach with droves of seaside goldenrod planted for the Monarch migration. That's the reason I went down there but the day proved too cold and windy for butterflies to fly.
The day wasn't a total bust, as I found a few ants to photograph. This is the common Lasius neoniger, or Labor Day Ant, who's nuptial flights typically happen around Labor Day and in the afternoon no less, sometimes ruining BBQ's and the sport of golf across the US. They're otherwise a rather plane and common sort of ant that make small mounds wherever the soil tends to have some amount of sand to it and in full sun locations.
Also found, and slightly more interesting, was the population of Dorymyrmex bureni. This is a species at home to the state of Florida and South Carolina, but in recent years, it's worked its way up the coast and can now be found in New Jersey!
I believe it was first noticed by someone back in 2011 according to Bug Guide. Curiously the Citizen Science website School of Ants doesn't have a dot there yet, though I may have to fix that. Now that it's 2015 I can say the population there seems to be thriving as I found dozens of nests which outnumbered the indigenous Lasius neoniger. In past years though I've never known the beach line of Cape May to be abundant with ant colonies so this probably isn't an issue to worry about. Simply climate change allowing a species to push its range north.

What do I suggest by 'play the industry'. Well for instance, if you desire to be successful in your lovemaking after that you likely need to be willing to play the area. This might consist of attempting to satisfy bunches of potential suitors, taking place great deals of dates (great and also bad ones!), and also filter via many frogs until you meet your princess or royal prince. Presume exactly what? Getting a lot purchasing automobiles is virtually no various! Don't merely ring/look at 1 or 2 automobiles and when you have your low offers knocked back as well as think "Oh gee, well I had a go and also it really did not work, I guess it's just difficult" THAT 'S LOSER TALK! The factor people succeed is by doing exactly what others won't or do not. So don't check 5 cars, ask concerning 50 of them and also determine the difference! (While you're at it, why not go ask 50 eye-catching girls/guys for their contact number and also I wager you'll have some success in that area also!).

I'll say it once more. MONEY! Now you claim it ... Take place, state it. CASH!! It might seem unpleasant the very first few times you say it aloud with vigor and also exhilaration. Get used to claiming this word, because the a lot more you state it the more it will function to your advantage. Exactly what do I suggest.? The word cash is something people love hearing as well as love to have. If you're severe regarding getting a bargain consistently take money with you so -ought to you make a decision to- you could get the vehicle instantaneously, on the area from the seller. Let's claim a person is asking $3000 dollars for their auto. You've done your research and you believe you could re-sell the car for more than that any type of method. In this scenario they desire to offer as well as you wish to acquire, so it's your phone call! They desire $3000. So you state "I like your vehicle, but it requires some job like the [insert reason below] (more on this symphonious 3). What amount would certainly you be satisfied with to obtain it off your hands?" They might respond "To be truthful I really did not desire a lot less than $3000 however I intend I can market it for $2600 if you really want it" That's when you act disinterested -also if you will hop at that cost!- as well as say "hmm, tell you just what, I have exactly $2200 (or whatever) CASH if you really want to obtain rid of it as well as make a sale today". It may function first attempt, it could not. They key is to stay with your weapons and utilize your best judgement on just how to continue. Never ever pay too much as well as don't be scared to walk away.

Whatever it is, I am eternally grateful. I have the most incredible, unique, and beautiful human beings in my life.
* numbers beside words represent the amount of times I have used them to describe my trip in the last 7 days.
The trip started out in Manchester. I visited my good friends Nicola and Richard - two of the goofiest people I've ever met and, together, a couple that is worth admiring. Their relationship is a partnership, this perfectly balanced duo that base's everything off of respect, love, and laughter. This beautiful couple educated me on life, love, and the vegan lifestyle, and then sent me on my way!
From Manchester we made our way to Edinburgh, Scotland. Over a year ago I fell in friendship with Michelle. I met her at work in Vancouver and we very quickly became inseparable. Soon after I met her she moved to Scotland and I had been planning ever since to visit her. Edinburgh was beautiful - it was rain and rainbows, cobblestone and stumbles, comfort food and ginger beer.

"China has prepared for the 2022 Winter Olympics. I believe it will host it very well, because China has the experience to host the Olympics. I think Beijing 2022 Olympic Games will reach a higher level. I have seen some plans of hosting Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. I’m surprised. The workload is very large and the responsibility is very high. I believe China will certainly do a great job in the Winter Olympics. As a reporter, I will promote Beijing 2022 winter Olympics a lot. The responsibility of hosting such a big event is very big. We hope China can share many experiences about hosting the Olympics to other countries."
"As for the SCO Qingdao summit, I mainly focus on the economic development. Chinese government has given large investments in Tajikistan, including infrastructure, electricity and logistics. Thanks to the investment of China, now China has become the second largest trade partner of Tajikistan. People from all walks of life in Tajikistan who come to China hope China can expand the investment."

The most current Tacoma generation go back in 2015. It is difficult to think that Japanese producer is preparing the brand-new one. Nevertheless, a variety of modifications on each model state it might occur. Even if this holds true, 2020 Toyota Tacoma would not bring many developments for a brand-new generation. Lastly, modifications are modest, and the business is not getting anything extreme. Specialists think the 2020 year edition will be a test automobile for upcoming trucks, so do not be amazed if you see something uncommon on it. However, the appearance of the Tacoma is going to recognize, and there are TRD bundles coming when again for sure.
It is possible to see the much lighter truck. With it, 2020 Toyota Tacoma might acquire 2 or 3 miles in each gallon. When we speak about this series of lorries, this huges an enhancement.
However, another factor will be tuning of the engine. Reports are stating that 2.8-l I-4 diesel will be the primary choice. With a turbocharger, this system can drain 190 horses and 350 lb-ft of torque.
Toyota is preparing a gas truck, however there is no info about its displacement and output. A carry-over from the existing pickup is the most likely result.
The business will absolutely revitalize the appearance of the truck. Headlights and grille might be brand-new, however other parts are bring the old appearance.
Interior will suffer some modifications. Infotainment system gets updates, and there might be some brand-new parts. Safety is an emphasize. Toyota has actually constantly been among the leading makers in this location, and it continues with 2020 Tacoma.
When it concerns the marketplace, 2020 Toyota Tacoma will have primarily the very same competitors as constantly.
There are Chevy Colorado and Honda Ridgeline with comparable updates. It looks like all leading factories are waiting on a relocation from among the others to introduce brand-new generations and many modifications.
Rates are likewise just like base designs, and 2020 Toyota Tacoma will begin with $27,000. Naturally, with more choices, specifically with TRD bundle, the expense will raise.

A winning case for beefing up the quality of arts education in the United States appears this week in OpinionJournal (WSJ). The article by Dana Gioia, chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, is a condensation of his commencement address at Stanford earlier this year.
We need to create a new national consensus. The purpose of arts education is not to produce more artists, though that is a byproduct. The real purpose of arts education is to create complete human beings capable of leading successful and productive lives in a free society.
If you don't believe me, you should read the studies that are now coming out about American civic participation. Our country is dividing into two distinct behavioral groups. One group spends most of its free time sitting at home as passive consumers of electronic entertainment. Even family communication is breaking down as members increasingly spend their time alone, staring at their individual screens.
The other group also uses and enjoys the new technology, but these individuals balance it with a broader range of activities. They go out--to exercise, play sports, volunteer and do charity work at about three times the level of the first group. By every measure they are vastly more active and socially engaged than the first group.
What is the defining difference between passive and active citizens? Curiously, it isn't income, geography or even education. It depends on whether or not they read for pleasure and participate in the arts. These cultural activities seem to awaken a heightened sense of individual awareness and social responsibility.
If this statement described an American inner-city public school system, the story would already have made headlines. Outraged parents would be asking hard questions of the mayor at the next press conference. If it described undergrad athletes at your local collegiate sports factory, the NCAA would already be leaning on the program to change something.
But this statistic is not about those students. It describes students enrolled in American Ph.D programs.
This dirty secret, long known to officials at universities, is gradually becoming public. For decades, half the students who begin doctoral programs at American universities have been walking away.
But why call this secret 'dirty'? Doesn't it makes sense that high number of people would fail? Aren't doctoral programs supposed to be rigorous? demanding? elite?
The secret is dirty because the students who walk away are not failing. They are successful. The grades non-completers earn are as high as those of their colleagues who complete their degrees. Recent research shows the undergraduate GPAs of female students, in fact, to be higher among the walkoffs than among their colleagues who finish. The secret is dirty because these are adults who have already completed at least two college degrees just to get where they are. Their competence for academic work, and their willingess to follow through, is established. The secret is dirty because these are adults who have invested enormous amounts of time and personal resources into the very programs they decide to abandon.
Finally, the secret is dirty because it's a secret at all. Why aren't prospective students given information about attrition rates at schools where they may enroll? Why aren't attrition rates factored into US News and other magazine rankings? Isn't education about supplying people with knowledge? Why are students denied information, from educational institutions of all places, about a phenomenon that has a direct bearing on their chances of success at that school?
Yet a secret it has been. American university officials typically run from discussions of attrition rates. When pressed, many shift blame onto the students who leave. 'Some people are not cut out for academic work,' they say. Remember, these officials are speaking of degree-holding persons they screened and chose to admit into their own programs. When pressed, officials also reveal, very quickly, that they rarely have any contact with the walkoffs at all. They don't know why their students leave. They haven't asked.
The blame shift just doesn't hold up to examination. The truth is that an attrition rate of 50% represents an enormous vote of No Confidence in a system. As one pair of researchers observes: 'many students who depart are conducting a referendum on the departmental culture; they are voting with their feet.'
University officials suspect as much, of course. They simply prefer denial over action as a coping mechanism. How else to explain the widespread lack of curiosity, on the part of people who make their living conducting research, about a phenomenon happening right in front of them?
Fortunately, a number of people are getting curious. One result of that curiosity is the Council of Graduate Schools PhD Completion Project, a seven-year research program supported by Pfizer Inc and the Ford Foundation. Statististics released by the CGS on Monday are summarized this week in Inside Higher Education.
One pattern that emerges: humanities departments have a great deal to account for. Across the board the humanities doctorates take longer to finish, require more borrowing to fund, and are more likely to be abandoned than the same degrees in any other area of study.
Respondents to surveys report that the most important factors in their completion of degrees were (1) availability of funding, (2) a capable mentor, (3) advance knowledge of the environment. A high percentage of the walkoffs, though, also possess (1) funding and (3) advance knowledge. The greatest predictor of completion turns out to be (2) a capable mentor. Students invest in the schools where faculty invest in them.
Barbara Lovitts and Cary Nelson, veterans of research in this area, have noted candidly that 'the real problem is with the character of the graduate programs rather than with the character of their students. Yet most faculty assume that the best students finish their degrees and the less talented and qualified depart.' They go on to observe:
Everything about the way students depart reinforces this conviction. Most leave silently; they simply disappear, without communicating any reservations about the program to faculty or administrators. Exit interviews or follow-up contacts with departing students are rare. Moreover, students are effectively discouraged from voicing complaints while they are still actively enrolled. The 'successful' student is 'happy' and compliant; such a student is more likely to receive financial support, good teaching assignments, and strong letters of recommendation. A student who criticizes the program is a problem. Of course this reasoning is circular and self-fulfilling, since complaining students may well be turned into problem students by neglect or discrimination. Meanwhile, the accumulated silence of previous 'dropouts' reinforces the view faculty prefer to hold: the problem is with the student, not the program.
Many faculty thus conclude that the way to improve student success is to admit better students. Yet our evidence and that from other studies suggest that students who persist and students who leave are equally well qualified. The Lovitts survey found no meaningful difference between the undergraduate grade point averages of the students who did complete the Ph.D. and those who did not. The only notable difference in grade point averages surfaces when the students are separated by gender: female-completer, 3.57; noncompleter, 3.62; male-completer, 3.52; noncompleter, 3.49. In other words, women who abandoned graduate study had a somewhat higher undergraduate grade point average than those who stayed. What's more, women leave in higher numbers, thus suggesting once again that attrition is due to something other than ability.
Devising and implementing solutions to such systemic problems will take years. Inertia is a huge factor here: American universities are just now waking up to the fact that a problem exists. So what do you do if you are holding a degree or two and are considering enrolling in graduate school for another one?
A good first stop would be to read 'Straight Talk about Graduate School' by Dorothea Salo. She explodes a number of myths about graduate school. She offers a very smart series of questions prospective students should ask of schools where they apply. Salo notes that a number of good sources of 'grad school tips' may be found out there, but nearly all share the same optimistic, and flawed, assumption. They all talk as if completion of a graduate degree is something under your control. Such 'positive thinking' only gets you so far in graduate school. Most of the time it is a recipe for prompt disillusionment. Success in graduate school depends on much more than your ability to be a good student.
Today marks the twentieth anniversary of the lifting of martial law in Taiwan. That period--thirty-eight years--still represents the longest official imposition of military rule anywhere in the world.
First imposed by Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists, or Kuomingtang (KMT), in May 1949, martial law remained in effect in Taiwan until 15 July 1987 when it was officially lifted by the dictator's son, Chiang Ching-kuo. Caroline Gluck describes the situation in a BBC report.
The media was tightly controlled, outspoken academics and others were blacklisted and even hundreds of songs were banned.
The secret police, called the Taiwan Garrison Command, had wide-ranging powers to arrest anyone deemed to be critical of government policy.
"It was obvious how militarised this place was," said Linda Arrigo, who was a teenager in Taipei in the 1960s. "There were military police all over the streets, signs saying 'Communist spies turn yourself in.' You would go to the post office and you would see them unravelling films, to look at every frame of the film. Even as a child, I met people who told me about students, people disappearing."
But by the 1980s, increasingly emboldened opposition forces and citizen protest movements had begun to challenge the existence of martial law.
The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) - today's governing party - was illegally established in September 1986, before martial law restrictions were revoked.
Antonio Chiang was the publisher of a weekly opposition magazine, The Journalist, which began publishing before the lifting of martial law and was regularly suspended, banned and confiscated.
When people get old, some get stubborn, some get wise; we were lucky Chiang [Ching-kuo] got wiser," he said. "He realised his time was numbered; he had no hope to go back to China. To survive, the party had to identify with this land, this people - so democracy was the only way for Taiwan to survive. If Taiwan didn't reform enough, there would be no difference between Taiwan and China - and then, why would the US, the western world, support Taiwan?"
Older people educated under Chiang Kai-shek still experience cognitive dissonance when it comes to 'identifying with this land' and accepting that the KMT, as a party, now enjoys no special privileges. For Taiwan's young people, of all political stripes, this is simply reality. They live in a free country.
Opening up to China had the ironic (and unintended, on both Kuomintang and Communist sides) effect of building Taiwanese identity. The seminal moment was the removal of Taiwan's ban on travel to China in months after lifting of martial law.
Initially, it was a measure applied only to those with close relatives there - many of them elderly former KMT soldiers desperate to see their homeland and sweep their ancestors' tombs.
"Coming to Taiwan was a painful experience," said 78-year-old He Wen-De, a former KMT soldier from a poor peasant family in China's Hubei province. "At that time, life was difficult. We missed our families and we had no opportunity to return," he said. "I didn't get a single letter from them after living in Taiwan for more than 20 years; the KMT withheld the letters. If I hadn't gone back to China, I wouldn't even have known about them."
But when they were finally allowed, these visits brought a range of emotions, and there were also social changes following the Chinese cultural revolution. Many came back to Taiwan disillusioned, with heartbreaking stories of giving all their money and possessions to poor relatives, yet happy to return to Taiwan - a place they now saw as home.
The effect was reinforced as young Taiwanese students and professionals travelled internationally. They increasingly encountered colleagues from China and were obliged to notice how their culture differed from China's and explain their nationality to foreigners. The experience reinforced a sense of distinct Taiwanese identity.
As a society today, Taiwan is still dealing with the legacy of its martial law period, and is grappling with how to right the wrongs many suffered during that time. Even so, analysts agree that democracy is fully-entrenched.
"It's 100% democracy. People are not happy, but they are not desperate to go back. They have no nostalgia for the bad, old past. They want a good future," said sociology professor Michael Hsiao.
"It's immature, lousy, chaotic... But we have a democracy," agreed Mr Chiang. "We have a vital media, a strong opposition, lively party politics and judicial independence is on the march. It may be chaotic, but there's no way to turn it back."

On this date in 1887 the world became a richer, more vibrant place. Here is how The Columbia Encylopedia (courtesy of Answers.com) summarizes the visionary career of Marc Chagall, born in Belarus on July 7:
In 1907, Chagall left his native Vitebsk for St. Petersburg, where he studied under L. N. Bakst. In Paris (1910) he began to assimilate cubist characteristics into his expressionistic style. He is considered a forerunner of surrealism. After some years in Russia, Chagall returned to France in 1922, where he spent most of his life. His frequently repeated subject matter was drawn from Jewish life and folklore; he was particularly fond of flower and animal symbols. His major early works included murals for the Jewish State Theater (now in the Tretyakov Museum, Moscow). Among his other well-known works are I and the Village (1911; Museum of Modern Art, New York City) and The Rabbi of Vitebsk (Art Institute of Chicago). He designed the sets and costumes for Stravinsky's ballet Firebird (1945). Chagall's twelve stained-glass windows, symbolizing the tribes of Israel, were exhibited in Paris and New York City before being installed (1962) in the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center synagogue in Jerusalem. His two vast murals for New York's Metropolitan Opera House, treating symbolically the sources and the triumph of music, were installed in 1966. Much of Chagall's work is rendered with an extraordinary formal inventiveness and a deceptive fairy-tale naïveté. Chagall illustrated numerous books, including Gogol's Dead Souls, La Fontaine's Fables, and Illustrations for the Bible (1956). A museum of his work opened in Nice in 1973.
You can do a lot worse in life than collaborate on a song that is one of the most recorded of all time--a song that says what it has to say simply and directly and allows singers and listeners alike the room to make it their own.
A day after musicians the world over are feeling the loss of Beverly Sills, the Associated Press reports a departure from the world of commercial music: Hy Zaret, lyricist for 'Unchained Melody.' The song, with music by Alex North, has become one of the most recorded songs in the world since its launch in 1955. Renditions of 'Unchained Melody' have been made by Al Hibbler, Les Baxter, U2, Elvis Presley, Lena Horne, Joni Mitchell, Guy Lombardo, The Righteous Brothers, Il Divo, Vito & The Salutations, Gareth Gates, The Lettermen, Barry Manilow, Robson Green and Jerome Flynn, Cyndi Lauper, Roy Orbison, The Manhattan Transfer, and LeAnn Rimes.
Here in Taiwan 'KTV' outings--karaoke parties with friends--are hugely popular. KTV evenings feature a generous helping of songs in Mandarin, Taiwanese and Japanese. Yet even here, on the other side of the world from where Hy Zaret plied his trade, no evening of song is complete without a rendition, in the original English, of 'Unchained Melody.'
NPR reports today on the death at age 78 of soprano Beverly Sills. Affectionately known as 'Bubbles,' Ms Sills gave a silvery voice to Baby Doe and Cleopatra and a genial, smiling face to American opera, especially the New York City Opera. NPR offers links to audio and video files that document Ms Sills career and the story by Tom Huizenga. Comedienne Carol Burnett, a friend of Sills, offers a personal remembrance.

Recently, I synched my Apple TV with my Flickr account so that when the screensaver comes on, all of my pictures on there–over 28,000–dance across the screen. And, wouldn’t you know it, most of those pictures are pictures of food. In fact, when I open my iPhoto and try to find pictures of me and Craig or me and my family, I have to fight my way through a tangled web of food imagery; portraits of dinners and lunches and breakfasts past. Recently, though, as I watched these images scan past on the TV in my living room, I began to have a thought: these pictures of the food that I make actually reveal something about me. But what, exactly?
Today’s my grandma Ronnie’s 85th birthday. And though she doesn’t have a computer, my grandfather gets my blog on his Kindle; so hopefully he’ll read this to her tomorrow morning when she wakes up.
For most of my life, my grandmother has been a major presence. Legend goes that just as I started speaking, she sang “You Are My Sunshine” to me from the front seat of her car and from the back seat I started singing back. We spent a lot of time together, when I was growing up. Her second husband (she’s been widowed twice), my grandpa Joe, owned a pickle factory on Long Island called Stern’s Pickles and when I was very young I’d go with her to the Roosevelt Field Flea Market where she sold them. She was quite industrious with her pickle stand; eventually, after he died, she started selling splatter art t-shirts. I remember being in her yellow wallpapered kitchen on East Lexington, in Oceanside (where I’d ride my bike almost every day), and she’d offer me a diet chocolate soda with some milk in it and we’d lay white t-shirts on the table and decorate them with puffy paint and little mirrors. She was always keeping busy.
In that house, she’d often boil vegetables and sprinkle them with Mrs. Dash. They tasted pretty great to me. In the guest room upstairs, she kept bags of Hershey’s samplers (maybe leftover from Halloween?) and I could have all the Krackel I wanted.
Eventually, she married my Grandpa Roy (the one with the Kindle) and we all moved to Florida where she and I would frequent The Olive Garden, Bagelworks, and another bagel shop called Bagels With next to Ross Dress For Less, where I’d go with her after my onion bagel with whitefish salad and raw red onions. Those raw red onions were a prominent part of my childhood; my mother and grandmother would always ask for them with their egg white omelets. We all had terrible breath, but who cared when we were mostly talking to each other?
Grandma had no qualms about taking me to slightly inappropriate movies. With her, I saw Single White Female and Legal Eagles and whenever there was a sex scene, she’d give me quarters to go play video games in the lobby. When Grandpa Joe died of a brain tumor, I took her to a movie to cheer her up. My pick? Beaches, the least cheerful movie you could possibly pick in that situation. But she was a trooper and I secretly loved it.
Grandma Ronnie (who gave herself that name because she didn’t like “Rebecca” or its derivative “Becky”) is a force of nature. If the world is a battleground, she’s General Patton. And she’s charged through her life with so much fortitude and verve, it’s easy to forget what a good heart she has underneath all that armor. When she and grandpa went to see Craig’s movie, she said: “Tell Craig I think he’s a genius. You’re very lucky to have him and he’s very lucky to have you.”
There’s a new restaurant trend afoot, one that takes the form of a casual, shoulder-shrug of a sentence, usually uttered by a server after he or she takes your order. It’s the sentence in the title of this post: “Just so you know, food arrives when it’s ready.”
It’s a sentence I heard last night at Alimento, a terrific new restaurant in Silverlake where I had some of the best pasta dishes of my life (more on those in a moment). It’s a sentence I heard last week at Republique with my parents, when they were here for Craig’s premiere. It’s a sentence we also heard at Bar Ama, where we went for lunch with both of our families (pictured above) after scoping out our secret wedding venue downtown. It’s a sentence that didn’t really bother me at first or even, really, grab my attention; but now that it’s becoming more and more common, it’s making me wonder: what’s it all about? And who does this really benefit: the restaurant or the diner?
The original plan was for me to take my shirt off. I know, you’re all drooling on to your keyboards at the thought, but settle down! I needed a goal, something to motivate me to get into shape. This was in February. I rejoined my old L.A. gym, Crunch, which makes absolutely no sense because it’s really far from where I live in Atwater Village; only, I really like that gym and when I was a member, I went regularly. I had friends there. So I rejoined and ever since February, I’ve been going four days a week. That’s almost six months of regular gym-going and if I had to take my shirt off now on my blog, I’d be a lot less freaked out than I would have been six months ago (OK, maybe I’ll show you my biceps).
The question for me, though, was never really a question of exercise. We all know that exercise is good for us; there’s not much to think about. You go, you do it, you look better, you feel better, etc. The harder question was a question of diet: how do I change what I eat to maximize my efforts? If I wanted to see changes (and I did want to see changes) what did I have to do?
Modern food blog convention would dictate that this post should begin with a picture. In fact, it’s a bit of a suicide mission to write a post without one. I went on to Google images (a risky proposition, because you can get sued for using someone else’s image) and then thought against it. The whole picture-at-the-top-of-a-post instinct is a byproduct of the very phenomenon I’m here to decry: the death of food blogs as food blogs and their reemergence as newfangled newspaper food sections and magazines.
Last week, Martha Stewart caused something of an uproar in the blogger community when she said, in an interview with Bloomberg TV: “Who are these bloggers? They’re not editors at Vogue magazine…I mean, there are bloggers writing recipes that aren’t tested, that aren’t necessarily very good, or are copies of everything that really good editors have created and done. So bloggers create kind of a popularity, but they are not the experts.”
She’s since backtracked; a wise move considering that her empire includes an entire network of bloggers with MARTHA STEWART plastered prominently on their pages. At first I was offended by her off-the-cuff remarks, now I’m mostly amused. This was a telling, unguarded moment for Martha and one that reflects the vintage, bespoke bubble she’s living in with her dogs in Connecticut.
You can divide coffee shops, these days, into two categories: those pushing the sugar (Starbucks, The Coffee Bean, Dunkin’ Donuts) and those scorning the sweet stuff. Most of us start out in the former camp–I began my coffee-drinking habits with Frappuccinos–and migrate to the latter camp, the independent coffee shop where the beans are of the finest quality and the baristas glare at you if they see you shaking Sweet N’ Low into your iced macchiato. That glare, though, isn’t necessarily encouraged by coffee shop owners: at most of the indy coffee shops I frequent in New York and L.A. (Joe, Gorilla, Commissary, Intelligentsia) sweetener is offered up in a myriad of forms: blue, pink, white little packets and a big bottle of simple syrup to address your iced coffee drink needs. Last week, however, I visited a coffee shop that L.A. Weekly just named Best Coffee Shop 2013–Handsome Coffee–and discovered that sweetener isn’t offered in any of its forms. No pink packets, no blue packets, no sticky syrup bottle. If you want sugar in your coffee, you’ve got to go somewhere else.
As with all Tweets like this, it had its share of supporters and detractors. Though I was being tongue-in-cheek, I was also sort of being serious. I hate dealing with artichokes. For my cookbook, the terrific chefs Alex Raij and Eder Montero taught me how to make a gorgeous spring vegetable confit with fava beans and asparagus and lots of green things including the dreaded artichoke. In their kitchen at Txikito, Alex showed me how to cut through the top of the plant, how to trim the stem, how to cut out the choke. When we were done, what looked like a bowling ball suddenly looked like a ping pong paddle. Did it taste good after it was confited? Yes. But was this something I’d really want to do in my own kitchen? Not really. When it comes to artichokes, I’m happy to eat them. But prepping them is the pits.

Does this sound familiar? It's rude that nobody answers? Right? After all, somebody should know the answer. It's not like your question is difficult. Right? You are asking something relatively straightforward that certainly somebody must know. If they won't tell you, how do they expect knowledge to spread? How can you ever become knowledgeable on these subjects if others outright refuse to answer your questions? Right?
Knowledge is not created by people asking questions and waiting for others to provide answers. Knowledge is gained by people who do things. Instead of asking somebody else to provide the answer for you, think what you can do to find the answer yourself. In fact, first spend a moment to come up with the most likely answer. And then validate that answer, proving yourself right or wrong. Try it, you'll be surprised how quickly you can try certain things. Heck... it may well be faster to try it then to ask again and again. And even if it's not faster, you will almost certainly gain a better understanding of the thing you are working with. In addition to getting an answer to your question, you'll also have a better understanding of the why around that answer. You'll have gained knowledge and understanding.
Yet many people seem to prefer asking a question over trying to find the answer themselves. Instead of building knowledge they are trying to get other people to give them the knowledge. And while I don't mind showing off my knowledge about a topic, mine is often built from doing things - not from asking others. So ask yourself: do you want to be a knowledge sink? Or do you want to be a knowledge source?
This situation is so common that an entire subculture has arissen. When somebody asks a very open question on Stack Overflow, someone almost always comments with: "what have you tried?". Matt Gemmell even put his original blog post to that effect on a separate domain: whathaveyoutried.com. Have a look around Stack Overflow and see what type of questions solicit the "what have you tried?" response. The phenomenon has spread quite far. Often I feel bad for the person asking the question, because they clearly have no clue what they've done wrong.
Now, how would it fit into this plan if every time someone rolls around with a question they are confronted with
I am all for organic learning, but sometimes you just need a quick, good, canonical answer with no BS. Many Stack Overflow users provide just that for no reason other than saving others the trouble of learning it "the hard way".
If someone asks a quick, good, canonical question then those in the know are typically quite willing to give that answer.
Ludum Dare 31 was last weekend, the theme was “Entire Game on One Screen”. My entry is called “Scan Lines”. This was my 6th official Ludum Dare entry. It placed 47th overall out of 1365 entries and 15th in the innovation category. Postmortem and download after the jump.
When the theme was announced Friday night I was at my company holiday party. I was fairly distracted throughout the night with social interactions and alcohol. At that point I wasn’t officially sure I would participate, but I thought about the theme and discussed it with some friends. Some of the game ideas I pondered were…
A reverse Katamari Damacy where you start big and get smaller as the screen zooms in. Going with the theme, you can see everything on the initial screen but some of it is so small that you don’t know what it is until you get to that point.
A game where you can somehow change in size to explore small areas, with the entire world visible when you are full size.
A fast paced action game where the world is being rapidly rebuilt front a fixed camera as the player navigates around the changes.
The main idea that kept coming up was something with the world changing like the Pokemon Stadium level in Smash Bros. I also remembered this game called Minimalismism another Ludum Dare game, that was a really cool idea but froze the player in place when the level was changing. I started thinking about how the level could change while the player was still moving around and interacting with it. By the time I went to sleep well past 2 am I had a rough concept of a scan line building the level and how the underlying tech would support it. All other aspects of the game were still pretty vague.
I started by implementing the scan line idea I had from the night before with my open source game engine The Frank Engine. The engine is not really designed for this kind of game so I had to make a few low level changes to support it. For compos like this I always create a separate branch so I can make any crazy changes I want to get it working as quickly as possible. Eventually it came together and by mid afternoon the level transition scan line effect was mostly working.
I spent the rest of Saturday working on the platforming mechanics. I’ve implemented that kind of thing many times now, but it is always a challenge getting everything properly tightened up. I also drew up a sprite for the main character with a basic run and jump animation. I wanted at least a little bit of sprite work to push it more into the surrealist territory rather then pure abstraction and give it some personality. Making a snowman just seemed like the right thing to do, though it took a few iterations before I decided to introduce more classic snowman features.
I ended up spending a bunch of time working on stuff that didn’t ultimately matter. For example I had planned to have the player have a weapon that could shoot enemies and also destroy tiles. I also wrote functionality to show many levels ahead with decreasing alpha, but ultimately decided to show a preview of only the next level to simplify level design and reduce player confusion. I also played around with an idea that would show tiles differently if they were going away on the next level, as a warning to players that they would be removed, but again it was too complex or not presented well enough to work. It would have been better to focus on proofing the fundamentals before adding extra stuff.
First thing Sunday I implemented save points. I knew these would be essential for focusing the level design and helping to show players where to go. I was still experimenting with the player having a weapon similar to Mario’s fireball before I made the decision to cut combat for scope concerns. I think it could be cool to have a weapon that destroys the level only to have it rebuild by the scan line, but there wasn’t enough time to explore that.
Most of Sunday was spent creating the level design. I found it very challenging to make a smooth flow with the way the primary mechanic works. I played around with things for a few hours before I had large enough idea pool to start building the full world. Also I ran into several weird bugs that needed to get fixed. By the end if the day I was running out of time and had to stop it at 30 levels. In the last hour I scrambled to add sound effects with BFXR and attempted to add music but had problems recording from line in. There really wasn’t much time left at that point though.
Should not have waited until the last minute to add music. Also before the comp it is important to check that your music production pipeline is ready to produce.
At first I was play testing with keyboard but than on Sunday I started using a 360 controller to play. Then I introduced a bug with the keyboard controls and didn’t notice it until well after the deadline. I should have play tested more with keyboard because that’s what the majority of people play with.
This was a successful Ludum Dare for me because I tried out a fun idea and didn’t spend every minute of the weekend working on it. Overall not my most polished entry but I’d rather have fun experimenting with a new concept. I think I will continue to work on this one a little more and polish up the level design. There are many other awesome and weird games for Ludum Dare 31, check them out on the Ludum Dare compo site!

The Windermere Foundation has raised $1,611,802 so far this year, bringing the total amount raised by the Foundation to over $37 million since 1989. Through the third quarter of 2018, $1,214,576 has been donated to local non-profits and charity organizations that provide services to low-income and homeless families.
It’s that time of year again! As families prepare to send their kids back to school, Windermere agents have been out in their communities raising money to support programs that provide school supplies and scholarships to students in need.
Thanks to the generosity of Windermere agents, staff, franchise owners, and the community, the Windermere Foundation has proudly donated a total of $920,351 so far this year to non-profit organizations that provide services to low-income and homeless families. This brings the total amount of money that the Windermere Foundation has raised since 1989 to over $36 million.
Recent research from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) found that more than 13 million children in the U.S. experience food insecurity. That’s one in six children who live in households where they do not have enough food to eat on a regular basis. And over 20 million children rely on free or reduced-price school lunches for their meals during the school year.
Thanks to the generosity of Windermere agents and the community, the Windermere Foundation collected over $330,000 in donations during the first quarter of 2018. Individual contributions and fundraisers accounted for 58 percent of the donations, while 42 percent came from donations through Windermere agent commissions. So far, we have raised a total of $35,869,961 in donations since 1989 when the Windermere Foundation was started.
For the past 29 years, the Windermere Foundation has been helping those in need in our communities through donations to local organizations that provide services to low-income and homeless families. In 2017, the Windermere Foundation raised over $2.4 million in donations, bringing the total to over $35 million raised since we started this effort in 1989. The following infographic details exactly how these funds were dispersed in 2017 and the types of organizations that benefited from them. For more information please visit windermere.com/foundation.
The Windermere Foundation had another banner year in 2017, raising even more than it did the prior year thanks to the continued support of Windermere franchise owners, agents, staff, and the community. Over $2.4 million was raised in 2017, which is an increase of eight percent over the previous year. This brings our total to over $35.5 million raised since the start of the Windermere Foundation in 1989.
Every year, Windermere offices throughout the Western U.S. host events to help make the holidays a little brighter for our neighbors in need. From food drives to fundraisers, here are just a few examples of how our offices are giving back this holiday season.
Thanks to the generosity of Windermere agents and the community, the Windermere Foundation collected over $1,537,000 in donations through the third quarter of 2017. This is an increase of nine percent compared to this time last year! Individual contributions and fundraisers accounted for 62 percent of the donations, while 38 percent came from donations through Windermere agent commissions. So far, we have raised a total of $34,643,324 in donations since 1989.
As you can see, a picture of the proposed book cover for The Sign of the Eagle, painted by Katrina Hughes Brennan is on the home page.
The picture does not do the portrait justice and I hope to have a better copy in the future. Nonetheless, Katrina did an outstanding job and I am grateful for all the time and hard work that she put into to this wonderful piece of work.

Managing your personal finances is a vital skill in today's fast-paced, digital money era. Unless you pay attention to where your money is going, you will end up losing it. This article is full of helpful tips to keep you focused on what you're spending your money on and how to manage that spending.
Improve your personal finance skills with a very useful but often overlooked tip. Make sure that you are taking about 10-13% of your paychecks and putting them aside into a savings account. This will help you out greatly during the tough economic times. Then, when an unexpected bill comes, you will have the funds to cover it and not have to borrow and pay interest fees.
Get a checking account that is free. Paying fees to access your money can cost you quite a bit in the long run. Many banks are doing away with free accounts, but a little leg work will help you find what you are looking for. Avoid losing hundreds of dollars to fees every year.
Don't get talked into quick money making schemes. It can be very tempting to give up your savings account to someone who promises to double or triple your money in a short period of time. Take the safe route, and realize that nothing is free. You will be better off slowly and steadily growing your savings rather than risky moves to get more faster. You could end up losing it all.
In order to stay on top of your personal finances, make use of one of the many website and apps out there which let you record and track your spending. This means that you'll be able to see clearly and easily where the biggest money drains are, and adjust your spending habits accordingly.
Make sure you're not overspending on luxury items that you can't actually afford. The most common problem people have is that they're spending more than they're bringing in. If you don't have the money for a luxury item, don't buy it. Instead of putting in on the credit card, put a bit of money aside toward the item each week. It'll save you more in the long run.
If you come across extra money, whether you got a bonus at work or won the lottery and you have debts, pay the debts first. It's tempting to use that money to splurge on such things as, new gadgets, eating out or other luxuries, but you should avoid that temptation. You'll do yourself more favors, if you use that money to pay your debts. If you have money left after you pay your debts, then you can splurge.
If you have not started putting away any money for retirement, no matter how old you are, now is the time to start. If you have already started, try boosting up your contributions. Every year people find that they are having to support themselves more in retirement as social security goes down, and may one day disappear.
Paying off any credit cards that have high interest rates should be your priority as you seek to pay down your debt. You may be tempted to make payments on all of your accounts, but it is far more cost-effective to eliminate those debts which carry high interest rates. With rates expected to increase, this is a very important tip.
Find your own financing when buying a car. You will have more negotiating power than if you are relying on the dealer and their banks to get you financed. They will try to talk to you into monthly payments rather than the actual cost of the car. If you already have your loan in place, you can concentrate on the cost of the car itself, because you already know what your payment would be.
If you're a responsible credit card holder who always pays balances on time and in full, it is a good idea to consider rewards credit cards. There are tons of different rewards that are available, so you should be able to find one that appeals to you. By doing this, you'll be able to make a bit of money off purchases you normally make anyway.
To find areas where you can save money, track your spending carefully. Get a little notebook to take with you and write down everything you spend. Track cash, check and credit card expenses. Also write down what you spend to pay your bills. This is just like a check ledger. Write down the date, place, purpose and amount. At the end of the month, review your expenses. You will quickly see areas where you are wasting money.
One of the easiest ways to save a little money every month is to find a free checking account. Because of the financial crisis occurring, it is getting harder to find banks that still offer free checking. Oftentimes, banks charge ten dollars or more per month for a checking account, so you end up with a savings of over one hundred dollars a year!
As mentioned above, the current trend of credit and debit cards makes it easy to spend your money, without even realizing where it might be going. Managing your finances and being aware of your spending are vital skills. With the advice from this article, you should be better prepared to manage your spending the right way.
I needed to thank you so much again. I do not know the things I would've handled in the absence of the actual pointers revealed by you over that problem. It was a very traumatic case in my opinion, but observing the very professional fashion you handled it took me to weep with delight.

And lastly, I am just usually satisfied with your astonishing principles served by you. Some two points in this post are absolutely the most suitable I've ever had.
Throughout this great design of things you receive a B- just for hard work. Where you actually lost everybody was first in the facts. You know, as the maxim goes, details make or break the argument.. And that could not be much more accurate at this point. Having said that, permit me say to you what did deliver the results. Your article (parts of it) can be pretty persuasive and this is possibly why I am taking the effort in order to comment. I do not really make it a regular habit of doing that. Secondly, even though I can certainly notice the jumps in reasoning you come up with, I am definitely not certain of just how you appear to connect the ideas that help to make the conclusion. For the moment I will subscribe to your point but trust in the foreseeable future you link your facts better.

Extremely happier for the information and in addition expect you comprehend what an amazing job you are undertaking teaching many people all through your web blog. Most probably you've never come across all of us.
I am commenting to make you know of the wonderful encounter my friend's girl found checking your blog. She even learned many things, which included how it is like to have a great coaching spirit to have many others without problems comprehend several hard to do subject areas. You actually surpassed visitors' desires. I appreciate you for showing those interesting, safe, revealing.
Throughout the awesome pattern of things you'll receive a B- just for hard work. Where exactly you misplaced me was on the details. As as the maxim goes, details make or break the argument.. And that couldn't be much more correct right here. Having said that, allow me inform you just what did deliver the results. The article (parts of it) can be highly convincing and this is possibly why I am making an effort in order to opine. I do not really make it a regular habit of doing that. 2nd, although I can easily notice the leaps in reasoning you come up with, I am not necessarily convinced of exactly how you seem to connect the points that make the final result. For now I shall subscribe to your point but trust in the near future you link your dots much better.

Your own experience and the wisdom of your insights can help the Alzheimer Society amplify the voices of people like you – ensuring that these voices are heard and action is taken. I hope you will join the conversation.

Betty and her daughter Eileen have worked side by side at their rural Ontario bakery for 30 years, singing and dancing as they knead dough and glaze cinnamon rolls. When Betty, 81, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease seven years ago, her daughter knew the best treatment for her mom was to keep working. “Like everyone, people with Alzheimer’s want to be productive, and boy do we have that covered,” says Eileen. Her mom cuts granola bars by the hundreds –…
When Moira was diagnosed with young onset dementia at the age of 51, she and her family had some difficult decisions to make. She had to take early retirement from her job as a high school math teacher in Brampton, Ontario, designate her oldest daughter and husband as primary caregivers, and enrol in a day program for people with dementia while her family is at work. But there was at least one easy decision: joining the MedicAlert® Safely Home® program,…
As a biomedical engineer, I don’t have your typical background for someone researching Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. In fact, if you had told me 18 years ago that dementia would be my main field of research, I’d be surprised. Back then, I was most interested in diagnostic radiology—the field of medicine that uses imaging exams to aid in diagnosis—for the planning of epilepsy surgery.
It’s been four years since my dad, Denis, passed away after living with dementia for 11 years. My family and I did everything to make sure Dad enjoyed life, first during the early stages, and later when he lived in a care home. My experiences with my father inspired me to help others learn to appreciate quality time with a family member with dementia.
Who would I be without my memories? I consider the treatment of dementia to be one of the greatest current and future health challenges, and I am keen to find ways to protect the brain from the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s disease. However, there’s a lot we still don’t about this disease. I think a key step is to try to diagnose the disease as early as possible before a lot of damage occurs in the brain, so you’re able…
It was a cold, rainy December morning in Vancouver when paramedics spotted a woman in wet clothes, looking out of place at a bus stop. Kathryn had been missing for 27 hours by then. Her daughter had dispatched a small army of friends to look for her after she failed to come home from her walk the previous morning. “It was brutal. I thought she was dead. The paramedics brought her to the hospital and they admitted her,” recalls her…
Imagine if someone you love goes missing. The worry can be agonizing. When the person has dementia, it takes it up a notch or two. That’s why MedicAlert Foundation Canada partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Canada in 2013 to help people living with dementia who are at risk of getting lost. MedicAlert’s service—along with its well-recognized engraved bracelet—was launched in 1961 to help emergency responders treat people quickly and effectively when they couldn’t speak for themselves. .
Among the many ways to give back to society, donating is one of the simplest and easiest. However, you may find yourself hesitant to donate.

Michelle joined BIU in 2008 after working as a Project Business Analyst, testing software for British Gas in both the UK and India; and later as a Quality Assurance Manager for traffic information company ITIS Holdings, which took her to Tel Aviv and Belgium. A chemistry graduate from Manchester Metropolitan University, Michelle is a qualified PRINCE2 Practitioner and Six Sigma Greenbelt Trainer. Since joining BIU Michelle has made huge progress, both in her career and in terms of developing the company’s bespoke systems.
“When I first started at BIU my major focus was working with our System clients to assist them in the direct utilisation of our bespoke software Empire and BIU247. I later developed our CRC compliance service and assisted our customers to provide mandatory environmental reporting to the Environment Agency. This involved analysing site portfolios and associated electricity and gas consumption from energy supplier invoices. This allowed me to verify carbon usage and associated financial obligations. I then went back to my roots in project management, creating conceptual system designs using agile project management methodology, managing our internal developers’ workload for the project lifecycles.
My day begins by checking our internal helpdesk to ensure new issues are analysed and prioritised into the developers’ workloads. No day is the same as development and maintenance requests will differ from day to day. I work with stakeholders to specify their requirements to ensure accurate development. So I don’t have a typical day but I will usually be working on either designing upcoming systems, drawing technical diagrams for backend systems or creating test plans for system rollout to ensure the developers have as much information as possible in order to deliver to the highest standard. One of the core things about BIU is the development of all of our systems in-house. This means we can work with our customers to create bespoke solutions that fit their needs within their required timescales and are not constricted by any third party.
It was working directly under a Master Six Sigma Black Belt at ITIS that inspired me to qualify in PRINCE2 and Six Sigma training. Therefore it was a natural progression to come to BIU – my technical qualifications combined with my energy background enable me to create systems tailored for this sector as I understand the specific needs of the industry.
I enjoy the fact that I can work on specific, defined requests, but also receive projects that have more autonomy for developing a creative solution.
The colleagues I work with at BIU are amazing, the IT team and developers are really easy to work with and their intelligent solutions are inspiring. Also as a busy mum of three the flexibility here enables me to balance a career around my family.”

Point of No Return: Jewish Refugees from Arab and Muslim Countries: Turkish synagogue vandalised after re-opening
One-stop blog on Jews from Arab and Muslim Countries and the Middle East's forgotten Jewish refugees, updated daily
Vandals spray-painted hate graffiti on the historic Istipol Synagogue in Istanbul just days after a one-time prayer service was held, the first in 65 years, the Turkish publication Today’s Zaman (picked up by the Jerusalem Post) reported. (With thanks: Eliyahu)
Vandals wrote “Terrorist Israel, there is Allah,” on the external walls of the structure in white paint, in the largely Jewish neighborhood of Balat.
“Writing anti-Israel speech on the wall [outside] of a synagogue is an act of anti-Semitism,” Ivo Molinas, editor-inchief of the Jewish community’s weekly newspaper Salom, said in an interview with the Turkish newspaper.
“There is widespread anti-Semitism voiced in Turkey and it gets in the way of celebrating the richness of cultural diversity in this country,” he added.
Molinas was upset at the linkage made between the Jewish community in Turkey and Israel, emphasizing that the Turkish Jewish community is not connected to Israeli policy.
In just 50 years, almost a million Jews, whose communities stretch back up to 3,000 years, have been 'ethnically cleansed' from 10 Arab countries. These refugees outnumber the Palestinian refugees two to one, but their narrative has all but been ignored. Unlike Palestinian refugees, they fled not war, but systematic persecution. Seen in this light, Israel, where some 50 percent of the Jewish population descend from these refugees and are now full citizens, is the legitimate expression of the self-determination of an oppressed indigenous, Middle Eastern people.
This website is dedicated to preserving the memory of the near-extinct Jewish communities, which can never return to what and where they once were - even if they wanted to. It will attempt to pass on the stories of the Jewish refugees and their current struggle for recognition and restitution. Awareness of the injustice done to these Jews can only advance the cause of peace and reconciliation.
(Iran: once an ally of Israel, the Islamic Republic of Iran is now an implacable enemy and numbers of Iranian Jews have fallen drastically from 80,000 to 20,000 since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Their plight - and that of all other communities threatened by Islamism - does therefore fall within the scope of this blog.)

Following the success of the first Startupper of the Year Challenge, held in 2015 in more than 30 African countries, Total is bringing it back this year across the continent. The 2018-2019 Startupper of the Year by Total Challenge will support and reward young local entrepreneurs in any business sector with a project or business less than two years old. In each participating African country, a local jury comprised of experts from Total, specialists from incubators and accelerators, business leaders and local community stakeholders will select three winners.
Total is thrilled to announce the launch of the #StartupperOfTheYearChallenge ��. We are looking for innovative young entrepreneurs who are willing to make things happen in their country. Registration is open until November 13 at https://t.co/EBWolu3RH3
Each winner will be awarded the Startupper of the Year by Total label and receive financial support of at least R150 000, plus professional coaching and extensive publicity to advertise their project.
New for this year in support of women entrepreneurs, the jury will also designate a Top Female Entrepreneur in each country. This special award, which is in addition to the other awards, is Total’s way of encouraging more women to take part in the Challenge.
A grand jury will meet subsequently to select three Grand Winners for the entire continent, from among the first-prize winners in each country.
More than just a business challenge, the 2018-2019 Startupper of the Year by Total Challenge also reaffirms Total’s commitment to capacity building in the countries where it operates, worldwide. By helping innovative young entrepreneurs to realize their projects, the Challenge strengthens the local social fabric.

Bjerkely menighet	> 17.Juni – 4.søndag i treenighetstiden – Matteus 16.24-27 – Morten Askjer (23 minutter)
Mt. Kilimanjaro is Africa's highest mountain, and the highest free standing peak in the world, rising to 5895 meters from a semi-arid plain. Because of its rare and endemic flora, which includes over 1800 species of flowering plants and 700 species of lower plants, it has been designated a World Heritage Site and a Biosphere Reserve. Addtionally, it is part of the ecosystem comprising the Easteren Afromontaine Biodiversity Hotspot, as designated by Conservation International.
It is said that mountains are the water towers of the world, attracting rainfall and sequestering moisture during wet seasons to slowly dispense into surrounding lowlands when the weather turns dry. Their ability to attract and retain moisture is vitally dependant upon the health of their forests. In Africa, where water is scarce and soil is often thin and deficient, mountains are crucial. In many countries they are the primary agricultural areas because of their rich soil and abundant rainfall. In Swahili, the very words for mountain and agriculture derive from the same root. With the widespread deforestation now occurring throughout the world, rivers and streams that are dramatically decreasing in flow are giving us an ominous hint that we should take another look at the ill-effects of deforestation. The loss of water sources affects large populations of mountain residents, as well as farmers and townspeople living downstream, who need the water for domestic uses and farm irrigation. Additionally, hydroelectric plants located on mountain-fed rivers depend on a steady flow and cease to produce when water slows to a trickle.
Kilimanjaro lies just 3 degrees south of the equator. Early European explorers were astounded to see snow on a mountain in the tropics and the veracity of their claims was doubted for many years within Europe. In modern times it is one of Africa's most popular tourist destinations, with about 100,000 tourists, porters and guides a year attempting the climb to the summit. But Kilimanjaro is more than a destination for the mountain climbers of the world. What most people do not know about the mountain is that it is one of the most productive agricultural areas in Africa. Over a million people live on its lower slopes, taking advantage of its rich volcanic soil and abundant rainfall. Over the centuries people of the Chagga lineage, who live on its slopes, have evolved a unique multi-storied farming system, growing a variety of food crops and hardwood trees on the same plot of land, combining plants, such as coffee, which need shade and wind protection, with banana and overstory trees that protect the coffee and reduce vulnerability from crop failure by offering alternate food and livelihood sources. Since colonial times, a cleverly constructed irrigation furrow system has served to deliver water to the smallholders who live on the mountain.
When Europe laid claim to most of Africa in the late 1800's its settlers on the continent particularly sought out the most productive areas for their own uses and Mt. Kilimanjaro was considered a prize. Because the climate is ideal for growing coffee, large areas of its southern (rainy) slope were converted to coffee plantations and coffee quickly became a primary export crop in the region. The local Chagga were forbidden by the Europeans to grow the crop for fear of competition, but because they are an industrious and resourceful people, some of the Chagga determined that they would themselves share in the monetary gain from coffee production, and so smuggled in seeds and started plantations of their own. In 1924 they formed Africa's first international marketing cooperative, the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union (KNCU), which specifically seeks out markets for Kilimanjaro coffee. It still operates today, with 92 local coops and over 80,000 members. This cooperative became a highly successful venture leading to the development of a cash economy among the local people.
Yet in a nation in which over 80-90% of the populace are farmers, and in which irrigation, mechanization and chemical inputs are costly and sparingly used, it can be a risky strategy converting to non-food crops and entering into a cash economy. During the late 1960s and 70s, the Kilimanjaro Region (and Tanzania as a whole) suffered a succession of severe declines and outright disasters. Coffee trees were getting old and also becoming prone to Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) and Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR), resulting in losses of 50-90% of the crop. The world market price for coffee also declined, leading to multiple woes for coffee farmers. In 1972-74 a severe drought led to widespread poverty, child malnutrition, and starvation. In addition to this, the oil shocks of the 1970s and Tanzanias war against neighboring Ugandas dictator Idi Amin, depleted national wealth and increased levels of poverty throughout the young country (independence established in 1961).
As a result, people turned to alternate means for gaining the cash income upon which they had come to rely, primarily land clearing for growing alternative crops and tree harvesting. Many important commercial tree species grow on Kilimanjaro and harvesting of these with no programs for replanting has led to widespread deforestation, causing a multitude of attendant problems, such as widespread erosion and loss of topsoil, decreased water flow in rivers and streams and loss of wildlife habitat. Pesticides that were introduced to attack CDB, have introduced large amounts of chemical pollutants into the ecosystem, causing loss of biodiversity and soil fertility, and affected water users on the mountain and downstream as well.
Today the people of Kilimanjaro Region are suffering the results of these misfortunes and unsustainable environmental practices. Some all-season streams are dry part of the year and other seasonal streams have dried up completely. This, of course, has negative effects on agricultural activities all over the mountain, from coffee production to individual vegetable gardens. Firewood on Kilimanjaro is increasingly difficult to procure. Since over 90% of energy use throughout Tanzania is based on wood products, trees are crucial to maintaining lifestyle. Women, who traditionally collect firewood, are having to spend longer hours to secure the same amounts of wood and many people are now having to use their precious hard-earned cash to purchase wood. And additionally, the population increase that is happening all over Africa is similarly on Kilimanjaro putting added pressure on available natural resources and arable land.
The mountain is important, not only to the tourists who visit and the farmers who live on the slopes, but to many downstream users. Runoff from Kilimanjaro supplies the Pangani River, which flows over 200 miles to empty into the Indian Ocean. Water from the Pangani is an important and widely competed-for commodity in this rain-poor region. Usage of the river water by smallholders, large scale farmers, high-usage rice farmers, and domestic users along its length decreases river flow.
Besides farm and domestic users, the Pangani also fuels a major national industry: electricity production. It is one of only two rivers in Tanzania that provide electricity to the country's national grid. Three hydroelectric stations on the Pangani operate downstream of Nyumba ya Mungu, a dammed reservoir south of Kilimanjaro constructed in 1965 by the government. They provide 17% of Tanzania's hydroelectricity and depend on adequate water flow in the Pagani Basin. During the dry season, depletion of reservoir water can often reduce electricity production, resulting in blackouts and energy rationing. Scientists have noticed lessening flow during the past 15 years and during extreme drought conditions in the dry season the Pangani has been known to completely dry up.
The ABCP has contributed to reforestation efforts on Mt. Kilimanjaro, because of its vital importance to the ecology of the surrounding region. ABCP trees are being planted by people around their farms and homes for ecosystem protection and livelihood improvement. Fast growing fuel wood trees are helping women conserve time and energy. Food, medicine and lumber producing species are protecting families from spending money on these domestic products. Valuable commercial trees that have been over harvested are being replaced. We are also supporting efforts to provide fuel efficient stoves that reduce the use of firewood.
Many of our educational programs are in schools on the mountain, such as this group of students in a Malihai conservation club shown with Mt. Kilimanjaro in the background. There students are being taught that conservation of biodiversity, control of pollutants, and sustainable use of natural resources affect a larger group of people than merely their own family and neighbors. They are being made aware that they are caretakers of one of the nation's most fruitful ecological treasures. Through ABCP funded tree nurseries, thousands of Kilimanjaro volunteers, both youth and adult, are learning horticultural skills and taking direct action by replanting and widely distributing species that will help solve multiple problems in the life-sustaining watershed. They are organizing field days to plant large numbers of trees along stream banks that have been denuded to protect them from excessive runoff, and in burned out and overcut areas to stabilize soil and prevent further erosion. One special project in 1996 was the planting of 15,000 trees along Mweka route, one of Mt. Kilimanjaro's most popular mountain climbing routes, which has suffered from excessive tree cutting because of the large numbers of hikers that use it. All of these efforts are contributing as well to the international movement to plant trees for carbon sequestration in order to offset the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. By June of 2004, Kilimanjaro area groups had planted 1,000,000 trees on and around the mountain. Sebastian Chuwa estimates that within 5 years, they will have planted another million.

An FPV system (First Person View) is a unique addictive and almost surreal flying experience! After years of dreaming about being able to do this, we can finally fly from a pilot’s perspective!
Affordable FPV systems have appeared within the last decade. FPV system flying is a rapidly growing trend in the various RC hobbies, and for good reason; it takes the beauty and energy of flying, driving, piloting a boat, and packages it in a relatively safe and less costly package. For many, this is the draw of flying rc models.
Until recently, however, setting up an FPV system has been very time consuming and required a lot of technical skills. Now we have companies such as DJI bringing a ready to fly, FPV multirotor to the masses, requiring no prior knowledge. While it may be more convenient to buy a phantom, plug in your tablet, and fly, it is still crucial that you know how these FPV systems work.
The current technology boom keeps this subject alive and forever interesting! Screens, goggles and glasses continue to evolve. Video transmitters and receivers have improved and become more reliable. Antennas and antenna tracking systems have improved. GPS accuracy has improved.
There are heads-up display systems, head tracking capability and return-to-home features. There are apps that work in conjunction with your equipment to view video and GPS information.
It’s the holiday season once again this year so I want to take a minute to point out our recent article on Drones for Cyber Monday 2018, check it out!
No matter what FPV system you get, they all have the same basic components. Even the DJI phantom with its completely self-contained setup has these components, you just won’t be able to see them or fix them.
The three basic components of the best fpv system are, in no particular order, the camera, the video transmitter (VTX), and the video receiver (VRX). The camera connects to the transmitter, which sends the signal on a radio wavelength determined by either the manufacturer or you, which is then picked up on the receiver.
How you then view it is based on your setup. Sometimes it’ll be through goggles, others it’ll be on your phone. While most of the times, this signal is analogue, in the case of the DJI phantom or other similar setups, its actually done using a digital WiFi link. There are various pros and cons to this, which we’ll get to later.
Now that you know roughly how FPV goggles work, and have decided that you want to try flying in first person, you need to know where you want to start. Really, you need to start not flying with FPV glasses at all. Flying Line of Sight (LoS) is a crucial skill.
Before even buying a Phantom or building yourself a plane, you need to know how to safely fly without goggles on.
First Person View signals can fail, and if they do you need to know how to fly without them. Not only that, but LoS flying helps you learn how to fly and control your aircraft while seeing everything, not just what’s in front of it. Once you can fly Line of Sight you can start looking into the best FPV drone goggles setup.
Figuring out what you want to fly using FPV goggles, after you can fly line of sight is actually fairly simple. When reading through FPV goggle reviews, pretty much anything with a nice camera on it that uses a tablet for a screen (like the DJI phantom line) will be fairly laid back and easy fpv setup while anything with a thin carbon fiber body and racing plastered on it will be agile for an fpv setup.
And if you’re looking for VR goggles (a consumer-level category for a similar product) we have a separate article for that.
Before we jump into the bulk of the reviews, Black Friday 2018 is coming up and we want you to be prepared check out our new Black Friday 2018 article here.
Here are some helpful definitions that will leave you with a bit more understanding of the terms that may be thrown around quickly when people are referring to FPV racing.
FPV(First Person View): Incorporating the use of a screen, monitor, or goggles to visually experience what the camera on the uav is gleaning in real time.
Line of Sight: The term referring to being able to see your drone the same time you are piloting it.
FPV Racing: The quickly growing recreational activity during which pilots select a pre-defined track, and race their small quads around it for sport.
RTF (ready to fly) racing drones: These are the drones made for FPV racing that you can race right out of the box, without worrying about assembly.
FPV camera: Special kind of drone camera used for first-person view racing, photography, piloting, or the capturing of videography.
Racing drone camera: any camera on a drone that is built for fast FPV racing. Usually built into the drone and these days they’re almost always available in high definition.
FPV goggles: A special set of goggles used to views exactly what the uav’s camera is seeing in real time.
Head tracking: An FPV goggle modification that allows you to adjust the angle of the camera mid-flight when the pilot tilts their head up or down.
Interpupillary distance: This is the term for the distance from the center of the pupils to the lens of the goggles being worn.
LCD monitor: A screen, usually attached to the controller, used to view what the drone’s camera is seeing; in most cases an alternative to goggles.
Receiver: Accepts the camera’s feed and sends it to the other screen or viewing device of pilot’s choice.
Frequency: The radio frequency FPV equipment runs on. Usually allows for multiple channels, so pilots do not cross signals with each other.
FPV system: The all-inclusive and entire drone setup. This usually includes the multirotor itself, the controller, connecting parts, and the video display.
On Screen Display: Gives you specifics such as altitude, battery life, current speed, and other necessary elements to assure smooth flight.
TVL (Resolution): The resolution of the camera which helps determine the clarity and overall feed quality of the video.
CCD camera type: This is the camera that uses a specific image sensor that is charged by a coupling device, and is typically more suitable for FPV.
CMOS camera type: This is a camera that uses a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor image sensor. These usually cost less then CCD cameras, but are not as suitable for the job.
Video Latency: This is the lag involved into what your camera sees, and when it transmits to your screen or viewing goggles. It can lead to problems with flight, the maneuvers you want to accomplish, and trouble with aerial shots.
Jello: This is the vibration that occurs in the video that is caused by the running of the multirotor inside the uav.
The quads that are flown during these races are able to hit 50 MPH, and sometimes even faster. They may fly through obstacles such as hoops, around trees, and others like brightly lit bars. Some of the biggest and baddest races are so challenging, that you may have to know how to do some pretty fluid maneuvers just to get through the track.
Understandably, spectators can get very excited during these races, as they look a bit like what would happen if slot car racing was set up in mid-air. When you take a look at a very professional track, you realize that a beginning drone pilot would simply not stand a chance.
For the most part, there are 3 major types of races that you’ll find when you begin to engage in or watch this sport:
1. Time Trial: This is the test where competition is had to see how fast each drone can make it through a specific course.
2. Drag Race: Race that is held on a very straight line, and takes place over a short distance. Not geared to obstacle handling, this has much more to do with acceleration, and how a pilot handles a drone at top speed.
3. Rotorcross: This is a traditional competition during which the drones race through an obstacle course, and see who can cross the finish line first.
Much like the racing that takes place in the automobile realm, pilots are broken up into different teams, and there are different criteria for the teams that are out there. Some teams are all about flaunting a specific design that they may have had a hand in creating, and some are more focused on gaining attention for their ability to complete difficult maneuvers and stunts.
To check out a variety of teams that are out there, you can look at this link to see some specifics from all around the nation.
You can use the search engine of your choice to find out where the leagues and championships in your area are: the popularity of the sport is rising all of the time, and we guarantee that you will see many different types of leagues popping up this year alone.
The Drone Racing League: The season for this action-packed league has various races, where pilots accumulate points for standing. The pilots who are skilled enough to get the highest number of points eventually qualify for the very thrilling World Championship.
The MultiGP Drone Racing League: This one has chapters worldwide, and is known for having classes and events for many different categories of racer. Considered a leader in the drone industry for sure, they are considered at the front of the pack as far as high-profile events and races in the drone world.
The World Drone Racing Championship: Last year the star-studded finals were held in beautiful Hawaii for this league, which had pilots from over 30 nations trying their luck on four different courses. There was $100,000 in cash, prizes, and trophies, and they did a great job of creating a very high-profile and action-packed event.
The Phantom is by far the most popular quadcopter available today. If someone mentions aerial photography, it wouldn’t be unusual to think of the DJI Phantom. There’s no denying that DJI have done a great job designing a plug and play system, which requires little understanding of the technology, capable of capturing pictures and videos, and all with minimal training! They are leading the way in making this technology accessible to everybody.
The original Phantom was good, but the new improved Phantom 2, 3 and now the P4 series are even better, with better flying characteristics, significantly longer flight times as well as an optional additional racing drone camera and Phantom 4 FPV features.
To use FPV goggles with the DJI Phantom 3 pro or advanced or Phantom 4, you need to adjust your setup a little bit. One of the best ways to do this is with the adapter released by DJI that connects to your remote and allows you to push the video out to your goggles or another screen. Here’s an image of this adapter. This can be used to connect your Phantom 3 pro or advanced easily to your fpv drone goggles.
DJI Adapter that allows for direct connection to your fpv goggles for DJI Phantom 3 pro and advanced
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsTo use this setup you simply connect it to your Phantom 3 pro or advanced remote and then connect the hdmi cable out to the fpv goggles of your choice. This long range fpv system supports a double-screen display, and uses 720p video via HDMI and USB connections. The adapter has mini-hdmi output, micro usb, usb and CAN expansion ports. The video export includes flight information such as battery levels, flight controls, level and return home direction all into your fpv goggles or screen. The module can be attached directly onto the remote of the DJI Phantom 3 and will connect via HDMI to your drone racing goggles.
A great option for connecting your DJI Phantom 2 with fpv drone goggles is to use this adapter. The setup is relatively easy to follow and is your best bet for fpv goggles for the dji Phantom 2.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsThis setup allows you to add wireless the fpv experience to older models of DJI Phantoms, powered directly from the DJI quadcopter and outputs into composite SD analog video. This fpv setup comes with two antennae, a transmitter and a receiver. No additional energy sources are needed, and it is manufactured by DJI so that makes it a no brainer for the choice of best fpv setup for the Phantom 2.
The included antennae do work fine at average ranges, but it is recommended to look into specialty “long range fpv antannae” if you’re in search of longer distance FPV flight. The included antennae and fpv feed started breaking up around 100 feet altitude or 900 ft distance. Use existing documentation that comes with the fpv kit for installation instructions, but I can vouch for the fact that it is an easy fpv headset setup.
These drones are probably the most iconic models in the current hobby scene, and for good reason; you can take them out of the box, charge them, and be flying within an hour without even touching a screwdriver. This of course does have its drawbacks. Repairs are a pain and if anything needs replacing, even a motor, it’ll cost you quite a bit. Most of the individual components are all on the mainboard, so you can’t replace a receiver if it fails either.
The Arris FPV 250 Mini RC Racing Drone is a very tough contender for nearly any kind of punishing competition that you put it through. It comes completely assembled, and one thing that racers love about it most is the included CC3D flight controller: it is a top-notch means of piloting, and is very customizable to assure the best means of control during a tough race.
You do need your own radio set and battery for this drone, and the frame is made of carbon/glass fiber composited material, not pure carbon fiber. It’s appearance is pretty awesome: some of the exposed electronics on the top give it a custom vibe, and it appears as though it is ready to dip, flip, zip and race its way to immediate victory.
The customer needs to buy the radio set and battery to have it fly: this is not an all-inclusive package in that aspect. Flight time is right at ten minutes, and the 700TVL racing drone camera is known to be a high-quality number without too much delay.
Here are some important stats about this zippy and mean contender, that will help you make up your mind if you are somewhere in the pit stop or on the fence about purchasing it.
• Drone is assembled BNF, customer needs to have own transmitter and battery to make it fly after delivery.
• Uses High quality 2300KV motor and BL Heli 20A ESC; this assures the user can attain a very high speed.
What’s better than a powerful racing drone that boasts speed, stability, and durability? A racing drone that supports FPV, of course! The EACHINE Wizard X220S FPV Racing Drone is a definite force to reckoned with. Paired with the BF3.1.5 Omnibus F4 V2 flight controller and you’ve got an unstoppable combination.
Even though you’re going to need to provide a couple of things yourself, like a battery, for example, it’s actually a good thing for those who want a powerful FPV racing drone starter kit that lets you customize most of the rig yourself.
We recommend, based on the recommendation by EACHINE, that you pick up a 1500mAh 4S 14.8V 75C LiPo battery to start with.
This FPV Drone Racing Kit W/DVS DCR220 RTF FPV drone is a great choice for the racer who wants to get everything in one fell swoop, transmitter and all. The drone is built with top racing spec motors that allow you to reach very high speeds, without having equipment safety as a concern.
There is a range of nearly 3000 feet on the ground, and 5000 feet in the air with the unit, and its brushless motors make for a very powerful propulsion system. Those who have used it for many hours claim that it is one of the lightest on the market, and the adjustable camera angle hard shell protects the equipment while allowing customization in camera angle.
The fact that you get the goggles with this setup as well is a big plus for those that are seeking to obtain everything in one package, and want to be ready to hit the track immediately.
Here are some vital stats on this drone for you to look over: you’ll be pretty impressed by the punch it packs.
• The top racing spec motors included allow you to reach very high speeds without fearing equipment damage
• High-quality goggles included have a very large, crisp screen for maximum viewing experience, and they provide smooth real-time video transmission
• Uses integrated electronics, powerful motors, and low profile frame to keep you in the air for optimum lengths of time
• The 2.5mm HD CCD camera is very lightweight, and offers better color and lighting adjustments than other racing drone cameras
• 9-channel functionality and customizable switches makes for a very powerful and above-average controller
The ImmersionRC Vortex Race Quad 5.8 Ghz 350mW drone has been touted by a few big players in the industry as truly “the fastest yet” when it comes to a racing drone. The foldable mini quad frame is a plus feature when it comes to being easily accessible, and this unit comes with a 5.8 GHz video transmitter that feeds the signal to FPV units without interfering with standard 2.4 GHz signals.
The pilot can also have added fun controlling the LED’s sitting on the tail of the Vortex, and the camera mount on this one supports an HD camera and a flight cam. If you opt to use a flight cam, it is protected well from impacts and is suspended from a carbon-fiber plate.
Battery size that is recommended for the ImmersionRC Vortex Race Quad is the Lumineers 1300 mah, 60c, and fatshark goggles have given users the best results. Some users have been just a little disappointed with the video quality, but the speed and maneuverability still have this one ranking pretty high on any racer’s list.
Here are some vital stats on this drone, which may encourage you to make this one your next purchase.
• The joined flight controller is already programmed with CleanFlight, and will allow for supporting future updates with a USB port on the back of the quad
Hubsan is a major micro drone producer and has a major following. Hubsan offers a few off the shelf, drone racing goggles ready options. How about a mini FPV quadcopter for less than $140.00?
The Hubsan fpv drone offers a control distance of up to 100 meters, but I can attest that you can push that limit. I have flown my Hubsan VR drone over 100 meters without trouble, however the fpv system is more limited in terms of range, I often have the video link cut out well before I lose control of the actual quadcopter.
The Hubsan vr drone comes with a screen built into the remote control, for quick and easy to use straight out of the box FPV goggles fun. Be careful to always keep extra batteries with you because I’ve found the LCD screen drains the controller batteries faster than normal. This is the best fpv system setup for beginners as you have to do no customization and can just plug and play your goggles directly into the controller. This is, for the price one of the best fpv drones on the market.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsThe Hubsan H107D FPV X4 Mini FPV drone is a complete FPV system, coming with a reasonably sized LCD screen built in to the transmitter! A great, inexpensive introduction to quadcopters and VR drones.
Another option is the Eachine Racer 250 FPV Quadcopter. This out of the box fpv solution is a great opportunity to purchase a faster, longer range fpv drone without going through the hassle of building your own setup. The flight time is also longer than the Hubsan, at 10-14 minutes, this is a fantastic choice for an fpv drone.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsThis fpv goggles ready drone is setup and easy to use. The benefits of this over the Hubsan fpv drone are longer distance range, more detailed controller with higher sensitivity and with a built in monitor (larger screen size than the Hubsan). The max range of this fpv setup is around 250-300 meters which is 2-3 times more distance than the Hubsan.
The downside is that you’re going to pay $360.00 for the Eachine drone with FPV compared to $130.00 for the Hubsan. This is actually one of the best fpv drone racers built today and you can’t go wrong if you’re looking for a higher end version of the Hubsan fpv drone with greater capacity for distance and flight time.
If you’re just getting started with FPV drones, the 818 Hornet is a great choice for beginners. It’s cheap (only about $160 at time of writing) and is incredibly easy to fly thanks to ease-of-use features like Heading Hold Mode, multiple speed settings, and a controller with a very simple design.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsIf you’re interested in the FPV features, the Hornet can stream live first-person footage from up to 60 meters away to a phone, tablet, or other mobile device using the UDIRc app. We’ve flown this drone several times and the picture’s always remained clear and steady at 720p high definition. You can see some examples of this here. And the Hornet is also designed to be used with virtual reality goggles instead of a screen, if that’s your preference.
It may not have all the features of some of the other options on this list, but this is a near-perfect FPV drone for beginners and a drone that’s just really fun to fly in general!
Most FPV drones let you stream video to a screen but require you to buy goggles seperately. But there’s a few that come with goggles right out of the box! Here’s a couple of our favorite FPV racing drones with goggles:
The Bebop 2 adventurer pack currently only costs about $400 and usually fluctuates somewhere between that and $600 USD. This is easily the best racing drone with goggles available. It can shoot videos in full 1080p HD and photos in 14 MPx in RAW, JPEG, and DNG formats, has a 25-minute battery life, and comes with a headset and a backpack to carry everything in.
The goggles aren’t as good as the goggles we’ll talk about below – they’re really just a head sleeve for you to put your phone into. But they’re comfortable, sturdy, and a good option for anyone who just wants to make one purchase and have everything work right out of the box. Plus the drone itself is phenomenal – we wrote about it in more detail here.
This beginner racing drone with goggles lacks many of the Bebop 2’s features. The camera only streams HD FPV video in 720p, it only has about 5 minutes of flight time per battery, and it’s not very durable if you get into too many crashes. However, all of this is reasonable when you consider the fact that the drone only costs $125 USD.
It’s no powerhouse, but this is the cheapest drone with goggles available that’s actually worth your time. It’s surprisingly fast, quite fun (with several built-in stunt modes), and is overall a fine if not spectacular choice for a racing drone with goggles. It’s especially good for kids or beginners who are just learning how to fly and don’t want to spend a bunch of money on a brand new high-end drone!
When you first start out looking into this hobby, I’m sure you’re asking yourself “What are the best FPV goggles on the market?” We’re going to go over the top options available today.
Another question you may have is whether to choose FPV glasses vs goggles? For me personally, I like to be fully immersed and therefore have always flown with goggles. For some, being fully immersed makes them feel uncomfortable and they would rather have a screen, giving them the ability to be able to switch between ‘line of sight’ and camera view, quickly.
Now there are glasses available, giving you a screen and line of sight, simultaneously which I can see as a great alternative for many. It all depends on your application and comfort level.
Let’s go over some technical advice about purchasing FPV drone goggles before we get in to reviewing the different goggles on the market.
It’s important to choose goggles that are going to give you an adjustable level of IPD. IPD is the inter pupil distance. This is the distance between the center of the pupils in each eye. This type of tech is very important because if your pupils are not centered properly in each goggle you’re going to have a diminished experience with your goggles. There are fixed and adjustable IPD goggles, make sure yours are adjustable.
Another important concern is to choose fpv drone goggles that have VGA or SVGA resolution as that gives the best (reasonbly priced) resolution available for sale today. SVGA is 800 x 600 pixels and VGA is 640 x 480 pixels. You can get FWGA as well but you’re really going to pay for it, it comes in at 854 x 480 pixels. If you can afford it definitely go with this resolution.
Digital Head Tracking is the tech that keeps track of how your head is moving and passes those signals through to your drone. The camera on your drone is tied to these movements of your head. Swivel your head side to side or up to down and the racing drone camera is going to move in the same direction as your head does.
Finally another important characteristic of good drone goggles is the range of Field of View they have the (FOV). Typically these fpv glasses will have a range of Field of View between 25% and 45%. The more expensive goggles are going to give you a higher range of view.
Keep these important things in mind when comparing the reviews of different models of drone glasses.
Goggles have been around for a while. For a long, time there have been systems offering 320×240 QVGA & 640-480 VGA resolution. I’ll start with the lowest resolution with Fat Shark’s Spektrum Teleporter V4 FPV Goggles.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsThe Flysight FPV goggles come with a 5.8 GHz receiver, 40 channels, a RP-SMA antenna and is able to support HDMI 1.3 digital input. The maximum input it can support is 1920×1080 with 60 channels.
It’s decently priced right now for about $289.99, especially because you’re getting a wide-angle front camera on top of everything else.
You can select larger or smaller screen sizes at 200×150 and 320×240 using the button. You can also switch the secondary image’s position using the same button, as well.
It comes with the HDMI cable, but make sure that your drone is able to support an HDMI connection. Otherwise, you’re wasting your time with these FPV goggles. Some drones are able to be modded to have to be HDMI compatible but be careful all the same.
It’s been said that these are a good alternative to Fat Shark FPV goggles, so if you like what they have but want something different these are a good choice. Bright lights and using them on sunny days can be a problem, however.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsThese FPV goggles come in super cheap at about $59.99, but they are not cheaply made or have garbage quality. They have an upgraded receiver with frequency display and a power indicator.
It comes with a built-in 5.8 GHz automatic search receiver with 40 channels. Anyone with myopia below 400° don’t have to worry about their glasses not fitting underneath them because it has customized eyeglass.
They also reduce the amount of pressure to your head when you wear them for longer periods of time because of the settled three-point fillet. It’s made of environmental sponge that fits your face, making it an affordable, comfortable option for FPV goggles.
It has a decent 480×272 resolution, making it a decent option for racing drones. The quality isn’t all that great but they are a good entry pair of FPV goggles for anyone who wants to try it out. I don’t recommend them for those experienced with FPV goggles, you won’t like them right away.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsThe DJI FPV Goggles will set you back wallet wise, but for anyone who wants to spend extra on something they know will have good quality, this is what you’re going to want to buy. It’s compatible with the Mavic Pro, Phantom 4 series, and the Inspire series.
It’s good for up to 6 hours and has a great frame rate of 720p at 60 FPS or 1080p at 30 FPS. The HD screens have a head tracking feature and a resolution of 1920×1080. It also has 110ms of least latency and the built-in antennas make sure you get 360° of coverage all around for around $450.00.
It does work with the Spark but you need a Micro USB OTG cable to be able to use it. The Inspire 1 series needs a Type A Female HDMI to a Type C Male HDMI adapter, so keep that in mind if you have either drones before you make your purchase.
Some of the features it has don’t work with anything other than the Mavic, so if you have anything else and want the full features you may want to avoid it. Some users have said that some of the software causes problems, especially when the drone’s battery is low.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsThis bundle is great for someone who’s into FPV and set it up how they want. You get the FPV goggles, an HD full panel viewer, battery holder, and a power extension cable. You don’t get the battery, the antenna, or the charger though.
It costs about $249.00 and we don’t recommend it for people who are just getting into FPV, don’t have their own spare parts they can add, or don’t know much about FPV in general because you’ll need some extra parts that don’t come with it.
You get 720p resolution with a screen that isn’t too big or too small. They’re not all that uncomfortable to wear but they could definitely be upgraded from the stock foam that they have in them at this time.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsFat Shark started with their Base model giving a wide 35º angle field of vision. What this means is that when wearing your goggles, the edge of the screens are at a 35º angle from the center point of your eyes, this is a fairly wide viewing angle especially at an entry level price of $199.00.
These have been around for a while and are still not a bad option. People say they offer a good immersive experience despite the quality not being quite as good as some of the more modern models.
They work fine, except the lower resolution 320×240 QVGA is disappointing by today’s standards. They come with a 5.8 GHz wireless receiver, the Spironet RHCP antenna and digital head tracking for Spektrum FPV cameras.
Make sure if you’re purchasing FPV goggles you read through this entire post to understand the different receiver and transmitter connections.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsOne of the most popular FPV drone goggles start-up kits from Fat Shark is the Predator V2 system. The goggles come with a built-in 5.8 GHz receiver.
You get a 25mW or 250mW transmitter, a camera, and a plug and play system. It’s still my current system and it works very well. Still 640×480 VGA resolution, but with a narrower 25° field of vision.
The image from these drone goggles is going to be more clear and sharp compared to the Spektrum model. The batteries will last a long time before they need charging and there is a warning alarm that sounds when the charge is running low. This kit includes everything you need to set up a customized drone FPV system.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsThe next step up offers better screen size and field of vision, which are the Fat Shark Attitude and Dominator goggles. Again, offering the 640×480 VGA resolution, but with bigger and better quality screens. Both variants of these models are very popular.
The Fat Shark Dominator model has great HDMI connectivity which supports 720p video at 16:9 WVGA image format. They don’t weigh very much and are very comfortable. The adjustable lens width is fantastic and the fan will keep you cool while you wear them. You will need a separate charger for the LiPo batteries, but that should be something you already have if you’re into drones.
The receiver for these goggles is not included, so be aware that you will need to source a Fat Shark receiver, as well. The Fat Shark Dominator goggles are for those fliers who already have experience using FPV goggles and want an upgraded better quality image wise. I wouldn’t recommend this level and expense for someone new to FPV. Instead, try the Predator or Spektrum models.
High-end goggles like the Zeiss Cinemizer 1909-127 OLED will set you back a fair amount of money. This particular model has been out for a while. The OLED screens offer clear 800×600 SVGA resolution. I’ve yet to get my hands on a pair and try them, but they’ve received good reviews!
Here’s a video of the Zeiss Cinemizer glasses with details to help you get an introduction on these glasses.
If immersion isn’t important to you and you want to maintain line of sight of your model and see a screen, than combine the two! Glasses such as Epson’s Moverio BT-200 overlay streaming video into your field of vision and allow you to maintain line of sight of your model.
It’s cool idea that will no doubt appeal to many. Unlike other systems that stream video directly to your glasses, the Moverio glasses use an Android app installed on the glasses to view the video. I have now have personal experience with the Moverio and have to say that I would not recommend it at this point. The video experience is not stunning at all, but could say is decent. At the same time, navigating in apps and manipulating the device via the trackpad is really cumbersome.
From a form factor point of view, the trackpad itself has a sort of indented knurled surface which is not pleasant at all to tap around on. I admire Epson’s effort trying to create the device and there surely will be an appeal for this approach, but I believe we will have to wait for the next generation to arrive before we can opt for this product. The current price of more than $550 is also discouraging.
Flying with a screen can be pretty good, too. Maybe not as immersive as goggles, but to have the ability to look up and see where your model is when flying, is useful. With any of these options, it comes down to personal preference and application.
There are a number of easy to use and cheap tablets out there you can find to use as a screen for your fpv system. It’s almost impossible to go over them all because of how many cheap options are available now for LCD screens so let’s talk a little about what type of screen you’ll want to use.
The smaller the screen you use it’ll be a less immersive experience. Screens really are going to provide less of an in the moment feel no matter what you do and are always going to have a problem with sunlight. You can use a screen hood to block out the light and that will help a little. A lot of folks already have tablets or ipads lying around and if so I suggest giving that a try before you purchase anything dedicated to use for fpv.
I was reading a forum the other day and someone mentioned buying an old 20 inch lcd monitor from a local neighbor and using it to share the fpv experience with people around you, so they don’t have to look over your shoulder while you fly. The problem I see with using a giant screen for fpv like that is going to be powering it, perhaps a long extension cord?
Some great options include the RMRC Black Pearl 7 inch, which uses 32 channel 5.8GHz diversity receiving, it comes with all the connection cables you need, including a build in battery and tripod mount. The 7 inch screen size isn’t that great for the price but it’s ready to use out of the box. This retails for around $200.
Another great option is the RMRC Pro-1200 5inch with DVR (digital video recording) which allows you to easily record your flight videos. This is a smaller screen, it’s going to be somewhat similar to just using your phone. The recording feature is great though and the price starts at $150.00.
ReadyMadeRC basically has you covered for easy to use screens for FPV. These are not affiliate links, I just think these guys do a great job at providing what you need if you’re looking for an FPV screen.
Where do you start? There are now so many options available. The most common you’ll come across today are 5.8GHz systems. There are other frequency bands used but it is important to be aware of the legalities when using them. Laws vary from country to country. I’ll use the UK as an example for each band.
Offers brilliant range and great penetration. Unfortunately, shares the band used by mobile phones making it illegal in the UK. Being the lowest frequency, wavelength is longest and therefore the antennas can be quite large! Legal in the USA only if you have the proper permits, you have to pass a test to get a license to use this band. More info here.
Offers great range and good penetration. Band is used by other sources in the UK and therefore illegal. In the USA it is possible to use this frequency and is becoming more popular especially for video feeds.
Offers great range and good penetration. In the UK, this is a clear band. Unfortunately still illegal to use. In the United States you can use 1.3 similar to 1.2, this is used a lot by FPV flyers. It does require filtering though so make sure you look into the exact setup.
Offers good range and equipment is cheap. Unfortunately, most RC systems now operate on the 2.4Ghz band, along Wi-Fi equipment, Bluetooth, etc. This can be a difficult band to use for FPV it doesn’t stand up to distance, there’s too much noise on this band in the United States, be careful trying to use this for FPV.
Offers good range if setup correctly. Equipment is cheap and compact. The band is free of other interference but suffers from low penetration. 5.8 is great for FPV racing especially. It is used a lot by FPV pilots, it is the easiest to use and setup of all the bands. This is getting noisier in the USA all the time due to use in and around the home by tech like baby monitors.
Please be aware of the systems you choose and consider the legalities. Power limitations apply! I know that in the UK you’re limited to only 25mW! Other countries aren’t quite so strict.
Other Notes Great choice except for antenna. The license is easy to get, but does create a hurdle. Lots of potential interference. Also do not use it if your drone already runs on a 2.4GHz transmitter. Most common for FPV racing, even with lower range and lower penetration, most people find this to be the best bet.
If you own a GoPro than you already have a seriously good FPV camera. However, for some applications, a GoPro simply isn’t practical. It’s just too big. Instead you may want to purchase one of the many smaller CMOS or CCD cameras, of which there a many to choose from. Some perform better than others and prices vary.
When digital cameras first appeared they used CCD sensors. They’re made through a special manufacturing process. The process creates a high quality sensor, which can produce excellent images. Thanks to the high quality manufacturing process, they also produce less noise than their CMOS counterparts. The downside to CCD sensors is that require far more power than a CMOS sensor.
These sensors are less expensive than CCD sensors because they’re much cheaper to manufacture. They do have their main advantages is considerably less power consumption.
NTSC is the analogue television system used throughout the American continent and parts of Asia. NTSC video is lower resolution than PAL but appears smoother due to the slightly higher frame rate (29.97 vs. 25 frames per second).
Used throughout Europe and many other parts of the world. Higher resolution than NTSC but with a lower frame rate.
Some people prefer the smoothness of NTSC and some prefer the resolution of PAL. Once again, all down to personal preference.
An important decision to make when flying is whether to run off a dedicated FPV racing drone camera, or to use the live video out functionality available with many common cameras like the GoPro and Mobius Actioncam.
When I started out, I used my Hero2’s video out to fly FPV for quite some time. All I used to do was hover up high and fly about carefully, so it wasn’t ever a problem. The video filled my goggles quite nicely too.
Once I got into mini quads and higher speed, close proximity flight, I tried a dedicated FPV racing drone camera, and since then I haven’t been able to switch back. The main problem is that there is a noticeable amount of lag (delay) on the video feed from the integrated solutions, because their internal circuitry has to resize and process the digital video from the sensor into an analogue signal.
This processing can also introduce problems – the Hero3 suffers from a fairly low frame rate and variable quality in most modes when you use the video output, and the Mobius video has a black border around it, preventing it from filling your vision, as well as severe lag.
Dedicated cameras are generally designed specifically for FPV – so they can compensate for rapid changes in brightness very quickly, which is essential for fast flying in variable light conditions. You can also fly in very dark conditions with them, much moreso than with a GoPro feed.
So basically, if you’re on a budget, and don’t want to fly fast, you can get away with using your video recorder output, but if you want to race, a dedicated camera is the go.
Obviously you need your transmitter and receiver to match in frequency, but you also need to make sure the two are compatible.
For example, Fatshark and Boscam both support 5.8ghz, but use different frequencies and are generally incompatible (some newer receivers, and goggles like the Skyzones can pick up both types).
The next big thing to note is that you can’t use the same frequency bands for RC control and video. RC control is all digital, and can tolerate a lot of interference, but it can’t deal with a whopping big analogue video transmitter sitting right next to the sensitive receiver on the copter itself. Think of a sensitive microphone listening for a gentle bird song far away, sitting right next to a big stereo belting out Iron Maiden. The noise floor is just too high, so you have to choose differing RC and video frequencies.
Why choose one or the other? Well, lower frequencies penetrate solid objects better, but require physically larger antennas, and external receivers (higher frequencies are said to have a slightly sharper picture too, but in reality the difference is often negligible).
If your goal is to trundle around the park, or fly up high within visual range of your craft, 5.8ghz is fine, and will provide the easiest setup.
Lower frequency bands like 900mhz and 1.2ghz are much better for flights where object penetration is important. Your 5.8 system will go through a few trees, but stick a big one in between you and the transmitter, and your video will fuzz out badly. On 1.2ghz you can comfortably cruise around your entire local area, well below the tree line. Think of the difference between AM and FM radio when you drive through a tunnel; the principle is the same.
You might have noticed that I skipped over 2.4ghz. There are a few things to talk about. First of all, the signal penetrates better than 5.8ghz, but not as well as 1.2ghz. This means that your radio control can potentially drop out before your video feed does, and this is Bad. 2.4ghz is also a harmonic of 1.2ghz, and so is more prone to interference. For this reason, many people who use 1.2ghz or 2.4ghz also use UHF control systems for their RC control (typically around 400mhz). As you can see, things get complicated quickly.
The DJI Phantom Vision is a special case. They use 5.8ghz for RC control. Why? Because they wanted to use the 2.4ghz band to send back video from the quad via Wi-fi. So, be very aware of this when flying around people who are using the reverse frequency combination. Always check your frequency bands before flying! Also be aware of the increased lag you’ll get with Wi-fi transmission, and the fact that your RC control can drop out suddenly if you fly behind something solid.
If you’ve done any research into FPV, you’ll have seen some funny looking antenna designs, with lobes like clover leaves.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsBecause FPV video is generally sent as an analogue signal, any interference is immediately obvious. Digital RC controls, on the other hand, don’t need to worry about interference so much. It’s like the difference between digital TV, and the older analogue system that is now a distant (bad) memory for many of us.
Cloverleaf antennas are much better at rejecting certain types of interference, generally caused by the signal reflecting off solid objects (radio waves bounce around just like light does when it hits the right surface).
Because lower frequencies have a physically larger wavelength, antennas designed for 1.2ghz are physically much larger than those tuned for 5.8ghz. This makes them much more fragile, and so if high speed, fast proximity racing is your goal, you’re much better off with 5.8ghz, even if you get some interference from the trees.
The popular FPV goggles (Fatshark, Boscam and Skyzone) have built in receivers, but if you want the very best reception, or you prefer to use a screen or other goggles, you’ll need a standalone receiver. This will require its own battery and cabling to the goggles or screen.
The racing of drones is a very fun sport, and many young ones interested in science and engineering will benefit from participating. Every once in awhile, you may want a drone that will capture beyond awesome images for you, but not necessarily be a full-blown racer.
You can still enjoy the view from goggles on these two drones, known for their superior cameras and image-gathering ability. As you watch the terrain that you are flying over, you can eventually become a better pilot, and learn how to position your craft as well as capture images.
Having an alternative to all-out racing is the choice that many make: they may not have the ultra-competitive edge, or simply just may want to enjoy their aerial trip in “solo mode”.
The Dji Phantom 4 is the powerhouse drone that has quickly become the standard for many who are looking for a high-quality image gathering and altitude-cruising machine. It is fairly easy to fly, but heralded by many experts as revolutionary, due to the advancements in gimbal stabilization technology, and its ability to capture 4k video.
The flight time is approximately 28 minutes, and the maximum speed is 44mpg. Real estate pros, surveyors, and many others who have the need for a drone from the “big leagues” that flies reliably praise the Phantom 4 for its f/2.8 lens, auto takeoff and auto return home features, and intelligent power management system. Known as the easiest Phantom to navigate, and the one loaded with the most features, it will be quite popular for some time to come.
Here are some stats and features on the Phantom 4: this has always been one of our top pics for ease of use and quality of performance.
• Dji director software has a built-in video editor to add text, music, and other rich elements to your finished videos
• When capturing 12MP still photos, they are in either DNG RAW or JPEG, and you can choose from single shot, HDR, burst, and time-lapse modes
The Yuneec Typhoon UDH 4k Hexacopter drone is very high-powered, ready out of the box contender, complete with collision avoidance and 4k video quality. This drone was the winner of the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show for “Best in Class”, and has 8 smart flight modes including auto takeoff and landing.
You can even select a subject and the Typhoon will orbit around it, while also keeping the camera fixated on a point of interest of your choice. This makes it an awesome drone for filming anyone participating in action sports, or soaring above many different types of landscapes. This drone comes with the Android-based ST16 controller, which has a large 7-inch integrated display, and 720p video downlink for reception.
Here are some stats on the Yuneec Typhoon H UDH Hexacopter: this is one Uav that has definitely turned our heads, and would be a great choice for anyone needing a high-quality image-gathering drone.
• 6-rotor safety with 5-rotor fail-safe keeps the drone in the air even if you experience motor failure
• Innovative new “Safe to Fly” feature includes ultrasonic proximity detection to assist in avoiding very large obstacles
• Quick disconnect propellers allow for speedy removal: each individual arm easily folds down from its flight position to an optimum resting position against the drone
• Carbon Fiber is used extensively in design to decrease weight while increasing longevity and durability of the craft
• Android-based ST16 Controller has a large 7-inch integrated display, and HD 720P video downlink for real-time video reception
Some systems, like DJI’s Lightbridge, are designed to be plug and play. Others will require basic soldering skills.
Click To Shop or Read ReviewsA typical installation will always require power for the transmitter. Similarly, dedicated FPV system racing drone cameras need power – and you need to be careful about what voltage you feed them. Some run off of 5v or 12v only, and some can handle a wider range. You may wish to power your FPV subsystem with a secondary, smaller battery as well, to make sure it keeps on tracking if your main battery fails (at least you get to see where you crash).
Standalone cameras like the GoPro can run off their internal power – but make sure they’re charged up before flying as the last thing you want is to lose your feed mid-flight.
Ready to fly FPV packages are becoming more and more common with DJI being one of the pioneers of this trend. With their Inspire One, they offer a completely integrated FPV system using their own proprietary video transmission system. With a system like this, all you need to do is download an app on your ios or android phone and plug it in to your controller.
Unlike other video systems out there, the video signal you receive is digital rather than analogue. This has a few pros as well as cons, the higher resolution video is a major plus for framing a shot, but being a digital signal being transmitted after the video is processed leads to there being quite a bit of latency (a delay between when something happens, and when you can see it on the screen). For flying in the air with nothing to hit, its fine, but if you were flying a miniquad 4ft above the ground, it’d be disastrous.
More specific installation instructions are beyond the scope of this article – but tons of help is available from web forums like RC Groups, and often a simple Google image search is all that’s required to find a diagram showing how to hook up a given system.
The elusive goal of FPV fliers is the ability to receive 1080p or even 720p video without latency. While this isnt anywhere near practical for the average consumer or enthusiast with lots of money to burn, Connex has released an HD transmitter which claims to be able to push 1080p, uncompressed, video at 60 frames per second with 1ms delay. The catch is that you have to sacrifice your first born it costs $1600, and that doesn’t include goggles, camera, or anything else you may need.
Its impressive that this is even available but until the price goes down, it is only an option for the exceptionally wealthy. What this does show, and why I’m so excited for it, is that it shows that hd FPV is possible.
Only 10 years ago a modern smartphone would have outperformed a full sized computer costing thousands of dollars. Technology gets less expensive as time goes on and perhaps someday soon, we’ll be able to fly in full hd for a reasonable price.
It cannot be stressed enough that we need to fly responsibly, or this hobby will quickly get shut down.
FPV drone racing system based flying presents some unique new risks over traditional RC aircraft, because you can fly a long way away very easily.
If there is any chance of people coming into your flying space, having a second person acting as a spotter is a very good idea. This is especially important if you are flying with immersive goggles. Remember that you can’t see behind yourself, and the cameras give you severe tunnel vision.
Remember also that many systems have a bit of lag in them. In particular, anything that involves digital processing will be delayed. This can include RC control in the case of tablet-controlled drones. So maintain an appropriate distance at all times!
Hopefully this article has helped clear up some of the basic details of FPV video. As always, there is a lot of information available out there, and I’ve just skimmed the surface. Do your research, don’t rush, and make an informed decision when you pick your gear.
Thanks for reading our FPV post and hopefully we’ve been able to help you find FPV drone racing details for whatever drone you’re working with from Parrot Bebop FPV to Phantom 4 FPV drone racing kits.
Drone racing is exactly what it sounds like – a competition where pilots see whose drone can fly around a set course the fastest. Almost all drone races involve First Person View systems, or FPV. FPV footage is filmed from the perspective of the drone and streamed to a monitor, screen, or goggles so that the pilot can feel like they’re flying from the cockpit of the vehicle.
Like most things, drones can usually be purchased at a good price from Amazon. However, sometimes the drone manufacturer will have a better deal on their own website (you can buy a Parrot Bebop 2 from the Parrot Store Official, for example.) It’s usually good to check both places and see which has a better price.
The best racing drones are usually built or at least modified for extra speed. That’s not really the focus of THIS article, which is a buyer’s guide, but we have more information on this subject available here.
It depends on the quadcopter. Most of the vehicles we list here come with a transmitter but you might have to buy goggles or a larger monitor seperately. The two Ready Made quadcopters we list are ready to connect directly to goggles, but you’ll have to buy a receiver seperately to use them. In addition, a few FPV drones can only be controlled with a mobile device, which you’ll obviously have to buy seperately (but which you probably own at least one of anyway!)
It varies wildly depending on the vehicle. A beginner FPV drone like the Altair Aerial Hornet probably has about 60-100 feet of range, while the $500 Parrot Bebop 2 has 1.24 MILES of flight range. We list the range of every drone along with its mini-review in this article.
Seperate action cameras, like the GoPro line, usually produce the best footage but are bad for FPV flying because they have lag. Racers usually prefer built-in FPV cameras even though they have worse quality. High-end drones with an FPV system like the Phantom 4 and Parrot Bebop 2 try to combine most of the best of both worlds by having built-in cameras that are also very high quality, but those come at a steep price. Usually you have to choose which camera is right for you specifically.

DroneDeploy has worked with hundreds of companies to set up drone programs since the passage of the FAA’s Part 107 Rule. During that time, our customers have asked for help with key operational questions:
Which drones should we use?How should we handle compliance?What should our standard operating procedures be?How do we train our team on the drones, software and processes?
Along the way, we’ve accumulated answers to those questions by working directly with customers as they built out drone operations using DroneDeploy. And now we’re ready to provide your company with access.
Today, we’re announcing our Professional Services offerings. These new service are designed to help customers navigate the challenges of taking a drone program to scale.
After seeing hundreds of organizations develop in-house drone programs, we’re kicking off our Blueprints service. Our expert team will take time to learn about the unique needs of your organization, and develop a bespoke set of documents, processes and protocols to ensure that your drone program takes off without turbulence.
As well as more custom process mapping and change management to better leverage drone data and decisions across your organization.
We will work with you to understand the unique workflow and needs of your team, and blend it with DroneDeploy best practices.This service includes in-person trainings and access to an online training center that houses custom content unique to your organization.
Using the oversight dashboard, you can track who in your organization has completed internal certification, making it easy to ensure your team is always up to date with the latest procedures.
Some customers choose to outsource their drone operations instead of investing in an in-house program. We’re now opening this service to all our enterprise customers.
Through a single contract with DroneDeploy, we will ensure fulfillment of your data capture needs no matter the complexity, ranging from Ground Control Points to thermal imaging to operating in restricted airspace.
First, our team members will work with you to deeply understand your requirements. Then — leveraging our existing partnerships with Drone Service Provider Networks — we will identify the perfect partner to meet your needs. But it doesn’t stop at finding the partner. Our team will also work with them to ensure that data is captured according to your specifications.
We know that the data doesn’t end at DroneDeploy, that’s why we built the DroneDeploy Platform and SDK. We also understand that you may not have the resources available internally to connect the pipes from DroneDeploy to provide seamless and automated transfer of data to your backend system. That’s why in 2019, we’ll be launching a service to assist in customizing, extending and automating elements of the DroneDeploy platform to better suit your organization, from apps to APIs.
During DroneDeploy Conference 2018, the crowd erupted when our CTO, Nick Pilkington, demonstrated real-time detection and labeling of hundreds of thousands of solar panels live on stage. Since then, we’ve received requests for Machine Learning to find cars, combiner boxes, and even cows (among other things).
To satisfy this demand, we will be launching a service in 2019 to develop custom Machine Learning models to help identify, count, and track the things you care about the most. We will work with you to ensure adequate data collection, data labeling, model training, and deployment to automate all stages from upload to report.
With these five new services, we’re aiming to reduce the barriers to entry so that you can get the most from your drone data. We want to help your team decrease risk, increase safety and productivity, and generate valuable data to drive smarter decisions.

Announcing DroneDeploy’s Suite of Professional Services was originally published in DroneDeploy's Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.
On September 28, 2018, a major earthquake struck Sulawesi, an Indonesian island. The powerful quake triggered a tsunami that reached an estimated height of 6 meters (18 feet) along the shores of Sulawesi’s Gulf of Palu. The damage was catastrophic. In need of outside assistance, the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management asked Team Rubicon Australia to provide support. The nonprofit disaster-relief agency used drones to help Indonesian authorities assess damage and plan recovery operations.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake that shook Sulawesi immediately flattened buildings and caused liquefaction, leading to mudflows in two neighborhoods in Palu (population 330,000) that ripped apart houses, swallowed roads and buried people alive. The earthquake also set off a tsunami that sped down the horseshoe-shaped Gulf of Palu. Tall waves battered fishing villages along the way, reaching the city of Palu in about 3 minutes.
Government officials and first-responders faced a large-scale, time-sensitive challenge. They needed to assess damage, plan evacuation and other emergency responses, conduct search-and-rescue missions, and provide medical care and other aid to survivors as quickly as possible. However, the devastation caused by the two natural disasters had left Palu and surrounding areas extremely difficult to access.
Roads were clogged with debris, bridges were destroyed and the airport’s runway was severely damaged. Using ground crews to survey the widespread damage would take a significant amount of time and expose them to a variety of hazards. The government needed to find a speedier, safer solution.
The National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure, or BNPB, turned to Team Rubicon Australia (TRA) for help. The nonprofit group is part of Team Rubicon Global, an international global disaster-response organization network powered by more than 80,000 well-trained volunteer military veterans who step in as first-responders to disasters worldwide. When they got the call, a TRA volunteer UAV Strike Team rushed to Palu.
Once on the ground, the The TRA team used drones to take aerial photos and videos given the destruction and inaccessible landscape. Led by Richard Adams, a highly skilled drone pilot with extensive military and civilian UAV experience, the drone crew concentrated on four key areas: two neighborhoods in Palu that had suffered the most earthquake damage and two settlements that the tsunami struck.
To carry out its mission, the TRA team used DroneDeploy’s software platform. It made all aspects of the project — flight planning, flying, image processing and map analysis — easier, faster and more reliable. The platform was particularly helpful because the earthquake had knocked out internet service. The team was able to fly entirely offline and then compress the imagery and upload it later using a mobile hotspot and DroneDeploy’s turbo uploader feature.
The images captured by the drone flights enabled the TRA crew to create aerial maps showing damage to buildings, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. The team then analyzed photographs and mapping data and cross-referenced them against existing satellite images and data. “Drone data provided higher resolution imagery than the satellite data, which was very useful when completing the analysis,” said Adams. With real-time maps in hand the team was able to provide insights when the local authorities needed them most.
The team’s work helped drive relief efforts. Using TRA’s information, officials assessed damage quickly and made data-informed decisions the recovery process. By providing data-based estimates of destroyed housing, TRA’s data also helped to provide a clearer picture of how many displaced people were affected. TRA’s drone team is no longer in Palu, but its contribution is still producing results. Scientists and seismologists continue to use the team’s data to better understand the extent of the damage and the impact of the earthquake on the landscape.
As an added benefit, the TRA team was able to collect data safely in the wake of the disaster. Neither TRA volunteers nor ground crews had to enter the damaged zones to make assessments. “We were able to access areas that were not accessible, from a safe distance,” said Adams.
The Palu earthquake and tsunami resulted in more than 2,000 fatalities and thousands of injuries, and they destroyed homes, businesses, government buildings, houses of worship and schools. It created a humanitarian crisis that needed immediate and effective emergency response. Drones played a vital role in the government’s response to the disaster.
UAVs and software applications like DroneDeploy are increasingly viewed as useful tools for industrial and commercial tasks. But as Team Rubicon’s experience in responding to the Palu disaster shows, drones also have an indispensable role to play in making the world better. Team Rubicon crews have incorporated drones into their relief missions and will continue to use them to provide vital images and data in disaster zones.

The construction sector plays catch up as it races to implement the latest technology on the job site.
As Charles Darwin famously observed, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.”
Evolutionary pressure has helped fuel the implementation of new technology solutions on the job site. While the construction industry has been slow to change, contractors are now under pressure to address chronic problems, such as finishing jobs late and over-budget.
“The pressure to act is rising,” according to McKinsey. “Demand is soaring. The scale of players and projects is increasing, making a more productive system more viable.” Meanwhile, the price of technology continues to fall, making solutions that can dramatically improve productivity much more accessible. This is leading to a spike in tech adoption as builders race to implement solutions that can help them compete, and catch up with other, more digitized industries.
Read about the top tech leading the job site into the future in our eBookDigitization is Now Underway
The economic imperative to change has finally reached the tipping point. What’s more, the benefits of embracing new technology are clear. They include increased safety, lower costs, and greater efficiency.
Construction currently ranks among the least digitized industries according to the Harvard Business Review.
The rise of mobile devices, cloud computing, and big data has opened up a new frontier for construction. And today the digitization of the job site is well underway. McKinsey cites three main clusters where digitalization is happening: onsite execution, back office integration, and digital collaboration. But the transformation won’t happen without its challenges. For larger companies, identifying and implementing new technology can’t be done overnight. It takes time to make technology purchases, train workers, and integrate new field solutions with the back office.
The good news? If construction productivity—lead by technology adoption—can match the total economy, the sector could be looking at $1.6 Trillion in added value worldwide. So there’s a pretty good case for companies to make the investment.
Drones are one of the must-have tech tools for monitoring projects of all sizes.A New Era for Construction
As the race to digitize the built world continues, contractors have begun integrating everything from smartphones and tablets to AI-powered software into their daily workflows.
If you’re on the job site every day, you know how software and devices can help builders connect, collaborate, and make smarter decisions — faster, more efficiently and, yes, more cost-effectively. One of the most promising technologies to hit the construction site may even be flying over your head right now. You guessed it: drones. With the costs of drone hardware bottoming in the last few years, and the advent of easy-to-implement software, many companies see ROI the moment the digital bird completes its first flight.
But it’s not just drones that site managers, surveyors, superintendents, and BIM coordinators now use to jumpstart workflows and eliminate friction. Smartphones and cloud-based apps are also helping transform workforce silos by facilitating better collaboration and efficiency between contractors. These tools also enable teams to move faster, work smarter, and keep clients in the loop every step of the way. And while we’re just beginning to see the results of these technology investments, we expect big things on the horizon for the industry as it sheds its past and emerges in a more productive, digitized form.
There are a whole host of integrated tech solutions used on construction sites today. But there is still a long way to go. For example, your mobile device can be used to communicate with key stakeholders, access drawings in the cloud, measure the impact of your decisions, and even fly your drone.
As you no doubt have figured out, we think drone technology is mandatory in the modern construction company’s equipment arsenal. But, drones are just one of five important technologies that we think you can’t live without. Read our new eBook, The Connected Job Site, to get a better idea of how technology is reshaping the industry in 2018 and beyond.
Read our eBook to learn the top five technologies reshaping the future of construction.Staying Competitive in a Changing Environment
Construction companies that want to be competitive in today’s marketplace need to be using technology for everything from real-time site monitoring to mission-critical decision-making. That means you need to be thinking about how technology factors into your business ecosystem.
Remember, it’s all about survival of the fittest. Now is the time to make sure your company is among the fittest in the industry.

Last week, DJI announced its latest quadcopter for industry: the Phantom 4 RTK. This product marks a major investment by DJI in the future of aerial mapping, and we couldn’t be more excited about the impact it will have on our community of drone operators.
While DJI frequently releases new drone models each year, the Phantom 4 RTK isn’t your average drone. It’s a huge leap forward and will undoubtedly have a significant impact on aerial mapping for years to come. Why? The advent of a quadcopter with built-in RTK capabilities means highly accurate drone data is now accessible to anyone. And we’re happy to announce that Phantom 4 RTK data can be processed with DroneDeploy.
Until now, gathering highly accurate RTK drone data required a large hardware investment on your part. You either had to shell out upwards of $25,000 for a fixed-wing drone with built-in RTK, add an additional PPK kit to an existing drone in your fleet, or create a custom RTK quadcopter.
You can now buy a drone that comes ready to produce survey-grade maps off the shelf at a 3X discount to previous RTK systems. And it is compatible with the batteries and other accessories you already own with your Phantom 4 or Phantom 4 Pro.
The Phantom 4 RTK produces high-resolution drone maps (hello, 20MP sensor!) and 3D measurements that are accurate within a few centimeters — all without using ground control points (GCPs). We were able to test the Phantom 4 RTK in advance of its release, and our preliminary testing produced accurate measurements within 1–3 centimeters in X&Y, and 5 centimeters in Z.
Not only will you gather more precise data, but your map exports from DroneDeploy will align perfectly to BIM models and other software. And when you compare maps over time, or side-by-side, each map will line up for more efficient comparisons. Why? Because each photo location taken with the Phantom 4 RTK is effectively an aerial GCP. That’s a huge win for pros comparing job site progress, crops, or even measuring aggregate stockpile volumes.
Before the Phantom 4 RTK, if you wanted to use a complete RTK mapping system out of the box, it required a fixed-wing aircraft. While these are great for some industrial uses, they are difficult to maneuver and fly in urban and residential areas. If you want to inspect a building or take a quick survey of your site, you’d have been hard-pressed to do so safely with fixed-wing craft. With the Phantom 4 RTK you can take off, hover, and land on a busy construction site with ease, or inspect a roof in a residential neighborhood while avoiding trees and structures.
Simplified Workflows and Greater Efficiency in the Field The Phantom 4 RTK simplifies previous workflows with flight control built into the controller.
The Phantom 4 RTK also simplifies previous workflows with flight control built right into the controller. And you no longer have to spend time setting GCPs every single flight. Though, we do recommend you continue to use some GCPs as checkpoints to ensure your data is accurate. While the Phantom 4 RTK doesn’t always eliminate the need for GCPs, it does reduce the number required — especially when flying smaller sites.
On the processing side, photographs can be uploaded as normal to DroneDeploy. Images captured with the Phantom 4 RTK carry highly accurate location data and can be processed by DroneDeploy as is. This means faster workflows for your team without sacrificing precision.
Each photo captured with the Phantom 4 RTK can be uploaded and processed with DroneDeploy’s Map Engine.
We hope you’re excited for this announcement. And while DroneDeploy does not yet support automated flight for the Phantom 4 RTK, we’ll be working closely with DJI in the coming months to make this a reality.
This drone will accelerate drone adoption in industries like construction, surveying, and mining and we’re excited to be along for the ride.
The latest drone technology from DroneDeploy and DJI— like aerial mapping, thermal imaging, and digital terrain modeling — gives you a rich set of data to streamline your workflows and generate real-time, accurate insights.

Aerial imagery enables environmental services firm TSC to lower client’s potential clean-up costs by 90%.
Thousands of miles of pipelines stretch out across the U.S., carrying oil and gas from wells to refineries. With any pipeline, corrosion can cause leaks and constitute a significant risk. Not only is a leak potentially catastrophic to the environment, but it can also cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to remediate and take years to clean up. Inspecting pipelines is a necessity that’s challenging, time-consuming, and expensive for O&G companies.
Environmental, engineering, and construction services company Trinity Services and Consulting, LLC (TSC) frequently works with O&G companies to monitor pipelines, conduct soil testing, and, in the case of a spill, provide clean-up services. Instead of relying on ground crews and manned flights to monitor and detect leaks, it uses drones to map extensive pipeline networks to protect the environment and to keep client inspection and remediation costs down.
Instead of relying on ground crews to detect leaks TSC uses drones to map extensive pipeline networks.Saltwater Leaks Can Spell Disaster for Properties and Farms
Not all pipelines transport oil or gas. Saltwater is a common byproduct of oil extraction. Also known as produced water, wells pump it up along with oil. Producers must separate the saltwater from the oil and then dispose of it properly. Nationwide, thousands of miles of pipeline transport saltwater to disposal points.
For one of its clients, a large O&G company, TSC used drones to perform vegetation indexing to identify possible saltwater leaks along two separate sections of the client’s pipeline in northern Oklahoma. In this region, produced water has a particularly high level of salinity. A leak from an underground pipe can spell disaster for nearby farms and properties. Saltwater kills vegetation, including row crops. Produced water leaks usually aren’t detected until there is plant kill-off.
Saltwater contamination is much more difficult to remediate than oil. Clean-up costs from a single spill can soar into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and eliminate an entire harvest for local farmers. Over the past two years, TSC’s client had experienced three saltwater leaks that resulted in more than $1.5 million in total clean-up costs.
For the project, TSC used Phantom 4 Pro drones to fly over 180 miles of pipeline to make a map and use a vegetation index to identify areas where potential leaks may be occurring. The project offered many challenges. The team used DroneDeploy’s Linear Flight Plan app to plan the flights in advance. TSC’s UAS pilots, aided by visual observers for Part 107 compliance, made hundreds of flights to cover the many twists and turns of the client’s two pipeline networks.
“DroneDeploy’s flight app is my favorite, and the linear mapping was great,” said TSC aerial services manager Shane McKinzie. “The ability to do all the processing online without tying up computers here at the office is another huge plus.” The team used DroneDeploy’s Linear Flight Plan app to plan the flights in advance.
The app made a big difference: Shane was able to fly the drone until the battery was depleted, resulting in fewer flights and a 30% time savings. The drones captured more than 50,000 photos, which were processed in DroneDeploy. Using the ArcGIS integration, TSC technicians exported maps from DroneDeploy to create a single map in ArcGIS with indices and mark-ups.
Examining the vegetation index, TSC identified specific areas of concern. TSC tagged about 90 regions of interest along the pipeline and delivered high resolution, up-to-date imagery to the client, so it could analyze the photos and follow up with ground crew inspections, if necessary. If the client detects a single leak, it will see a significant ROI.
By using drones, TSC will be able to help its client monitor pipeline more often, at a much lower cost. Without TSC’s drone services, the client would have to deploy foot patrols or manned aircraft to search for potential leaks. By using drones and aerial imagery to monitor pipelines, leaks can be caught early, saving up to 90% on clean-up costs and preventing farmland from being damaged.
“DroneDeploy was the right tool for this particular project because it was easy to use, cloud-based, fast, and had no hardware requirement,” said Shane.
Even better, this initial map will serve as the foundation for continued surveillance of the pipeline. Comparing future maps to it will allow the client to detect vegetation changes over time and identify patches that are getting worse.
TSC is working to transform the pipeline inspection process from reactive to proactive. This approach is crucial with produced water pipelines because no regulation mandates inspections, so they’re inspected less often than oil and gas pipelines.
Using drone imagery and plant health analysis with DroneDeploy, TSC offers more efficient and frequent monitoring of produced water pipelines, so the client no longer has to wait until a landowner or farmer complains about plant kill-off to take action. This approach will limit environmental damage, preserve American farmland, protect crops, and save its client millions of dollars in remediation costs over time.

Arunalchal Pradesh, the northeastern state of India borders the states of Assam and Nagaland to the south and shares international borders with Burma to the east, Bhutan in the west and the People’s Republic of China in the north. Majority of its part is claimed by China as part of South Tibet.
China’s proposal to build dams on the Brahmaputra’s Tibetan stretch is threatening to kill the tributaries of one of the biggest rivers of South Asia. The river drastically loses its height when it enters India, creating several waterfalls and rapids, making the white waters ideal for rafting. This effort’s of China to generate more hydroelectricity is sure taking the charge away from India’s adventure tourism.

Shayd grew up on Vancouver Island in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. He was fortunate to grow up in the outdoors and from a young age, learned how to scuba dive, surf, canoe & camp. A few short trips to Los Angeles after high-school lead him into the creative market where he developed his passion for photography. When he is not shooting, Shayd enjoys barbecuing, cycling, craft beer and beach fires. He has a creative loft space in Vancouver, but tries to escape the city whenever possible.

'Getting out there' inspires me to think in a different way, at this point I don't need motivation to go exploring, but I guess what pushes me to get outdoors is firstly a love for nature & wildlife, but also for keeping my spirit grounded. It's easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the city, but when you reach a point in the outdoors where all you can hear is the sounds of the waters and forest, you can actually start to let go and open your mind to new creative possibilities.
I usually find inspiration when i'm out of my element. I can easily find it when i'm travelling, just from seeing something new, or a new angle or a new colour tone, but being inspired in my element is much harder, when you are consistently seeing the same things, it's hard to find new perspective on them, I guess that ties in to why i'm motivated to go exploring.
I missed the ages of darkroom by a couple of years growing up, so when I started shooting, I was using a digital SLR. I didn't pick up film until about 2 years ago, and since then for most of my personal work I have been shooting film.
My most memorable photo is this portrait I shot in a wheat field in Oregon. It's tough to choose just one memorable photo, but I just love the mood, lighting & tone of this image.

A three-person crew from Woodland traveled to Cincinnati, OH to participate in a World Changers/P2 Missions experience. During the week, they partnered with Jason McKinney, a church planting pastor who is leading ONE Church, a brand new church in the heart of Cincinnati.
Knowing some of the challenges and struggles of church planting, the Woodland team approached this mission as an opportunity to both encourage and serve the church planter. While the team was eager to walk around the city, meet people, and share the Gospel, they also recognized the value of working behind the scenes and assisting with some of the day to day, less glamorous tasks of ministry. By God's grace both the team and Jason where blessed to have ministered together. Our group was able to learn from Jason, work behind the scenes, and still have time to meet and minister to people of Cincinnati.
"When I come to these things I’m surrounded by a family, one body in Christ and it really makes me feel empowered to take what I learn here back home."
At the end of an amazing week, the team is excited to take the impact of this experience home with them. They will seek to both grow in faith and maintain a missional mindset. We must all live as missionaries in the everyday stuff of life, knowing that every interaction could be a divine appointment from God.
World Changers and P2 Missions exists to serve churches in their mission of making disciples by providing missions experiences that develop the heart of students for serving others and sharing the gospel so they can change the city…change the world.

Paul (Pappy) Haines was born January 30, 1932, in Cedar County, Missouri, to Reuben and Kate (Berning) Haines.

Imagine what it was like in 1948 to have this NHS pamphlet through your door. Free health care for “Everyone – rich or poor”.
Britain’s health care system, pre-1948, did not work well. It was a patchwork of institutions which were not accessible according to need. Lack of access to hospital care and lack of access to health care for dependants – the families of working men – were common. Many people couldn’t afford health cover and had to use self-medication or medicines bought over the counter from the local pharmacist. As a result, an illness, or paying for medical attendance at a birth, could cause major financial problems for families across the country.
Today’s changes are as radical as in 1948. But, unsurprisingly, the Coalition Government won’t be sending you a leaflet to tell you about them:
With Caroline Lucas MP, Dr Lucy Reynolds (health economist) NHS campaigners and health care workers.

In all times of emotional disturbance or indecision, we can pause, ask for quiet, and in the stillness simply say: "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. Thy will, not mine, be done."
Besides being a great surgeon, Dr Nazarian carries a line for PREGNANT women called Spa Momma which is made-in-the-USA with no lead, phthalates, formaldehyde, propylene glycol, and no pregnancy-contraindicated aromatherapy oils!!!!!! I am obsessed with the body oil and the body scrub! I was having some major itching issues and I tried everything but nothing really helped. Then I tried the itchies body oil and it was the first relief I had had in months and I have no stretch marks!!!!!!!! Dr Nazarian is so up to date and science based and is willing to take time and help you out no matter what you issue is!!! I love her professionalism and recommend 110%!
Muscles tend to grow when they have been outright fatigued by the overload of work. To put it simply, it means that the workload put on the muscles should be more than it can take. This will allow the muscles to fatigue out which is the foundation for strength training. The muscle fibers are broken down through repetitive exercises and eventually, grow stronger with passing time.
Issues. They are very busy in the evenings, which is the best time for me, and clearly everyone else to go. This often leads to long waits for machines and equipment, also for the showers. As someone that doesn't gym often, I find gyms intimidating, with no staff to turn to for help, pure gym can be a little scary and confusing if you haven't planed what you are there to do in advance. Also some of the clientele can be boisterous, especially if you look a little lost! There is often issues with things being stolen in the locker rooms, I would advise keeping all your belongings locked up and out of sight just to be safe.
I'm pretty new to gyms, and well still slightly scared by the whole thing. But this place had a pretty relaxed and friendly atmosphere and the staff are really nice. There is a great selection of equipment and a lot of each machine, so even at the busiest of times you're pretty much sure to get on what you want to use. Being open 24hrs is great too as it makes avoiding the busiest times pretty easy. The price is excellent too, £17.99 per month at the moment. The only drawback is, with being the but cheaper there aren't paper towel machines about to wipe down machines after use, and for a pretty big gym it only has 1 drinking fountain and so queues can be a bit annoying when youre a knackered and parched it feels like hours!

While contouring tones down the whole body according to your requirement, body sculpting focuses on specific body parts to be treated. For instance, if you have excess fat on your skin under your arm, you can get it removed through body sculpting without the need for any surgery. Other body parts which can be focused upon to treat with body sculpting include but is not limited to, inner thighs, outer thighs, abdomen, sides and flanks, large, broad areas of fat etc.
Half time instructor just read from stuff we got sent second time guy was only interested in himself and first course only got 5 classes second course I gave up after first one hubby made it end which had to be extended as trainer n...ever turned up!

CoolSculpting is a gentle, 40 to 75 minute treatment (depending upon which applicators are used) during which you may watch movies, TV, read, listen to music, nap, or work on your laptop. The Coolspa specialist will outline your target zones with a surgical pen, and then apply a soothing gel. Next, the cryolipolysis applicators will be placed strategically over your skin, drawing the target areas inside. Each applicator is computer monitored to ensure its proper temperature at all times.

The treatment courses are as your doctor recommends. You will start seeing the changes in a few months; however, to maintain that perfect body shape and structure of muscles is more difficult that it seems. You must take proper care to follow a nutritional diet, and also have an exercise regimen that will help you maintain. Maintaining muscle tone of your body is absolutely pertinent for the overall shape of your body.

PureGym is a British low-cost, no frills gym chain that offers cheap membership without a contract in one of over 170, clubs around the UK. The gyms are opened 24/7 and offer cardio equipment, fixed and free weights and various exercise classes led by professional fitness instructors.

Dr. Nazarian is the a 5 star plastic surgeon! I had a growing scalp mass above my left ear, kinda like a cyst, she told me it was called lipoma. Anyway she removed the cyst in her office even when I was told by other doctors that it had to be done at a hospital which is more cost full and inconvenient for your wallet. She’s a great doctor and definitely recommend anyone to visit her office, her receptionist is on point and is very kind, helpful, and welcoming when visiting the office or calling about your appointment.
"PureGym offers a highly attractive and flexible proposition and its popularity is evidenced by continued strong growth in both members and sites. This transaction will give users of Soho Gyms access to the largest network of gyms in the UK. I'm confident that our members will benefit from the combination and that PureGym's investment across the estate will further enhance the services our sites deliver."
As of 24/09/18 PureGym has taken over what was once Soho! In Lewisham where I have been a member of for years! And was very happy with the level of service and facilities. Launch day there was pure gym staff everywhere in the gym but no one to assist those of us that had problems getting in with the new pin method! Before it was just a finger print! Once in the gym... I always wipe down the machines before and after I use them only to find all the tissues and hygiene sprays h...ad all been removed! When asked a member of staff I was told they don’t provide it and I need to bring my own!!! How unhygienic!
CoolSculpting works by taking advantage of the fact that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the other cells around them. This basic scientific fact was first discovered in 1970 by doctors observing children who sucked on popsicles for hours, and ended up having first soreness, and later dimples, caused by loss of fat cells! Fast forward about 20 years, and Harvard scientists revisited this fact, and realized that they could turn this science into a system for aesthetic sculpting of fatty bulges. The key was to find the ‘sweet spot’ of time and temperature, which would kill some fat cells but not damage surrounding structures such as skin. They called the public company that makes the systems Zeltiq. The proof of the success of this concept and treatment: Zeltiq was bought out by Allergan in 2016 for whopping 2.5 billion! This was the largest sale of a single medical device company in history.
Meanwhile, all Gold and Diamond Marco Polo Club members regardless of their country of residence will now be eligible for one-day access passes to any Pure Fitness centre, or enrolment in any class at a Pure Yoga studio in Hong Kong.

You just have to take it as it is. It isn't great, but you're paying at least £30 less than other city centre gyms. Unfortunately, this means that less 'nice' people frequent, and the changing rooms are pretty awful. The machines are also usually littered with well, litter, and aren't that clean. If I could afford to go elsewhere, I really think I would. But I can't. *sigh*.

There are no side-effects to a body sculpting procedure which must be reason enough for anyone who wants to try the treatment. Unlike traditional surgeries which pose a risk of infection due to going under general anesthesia not to mention the risk of post-surgical allergies. Apart from that, there is no indication of pain anywhere in the body sculpting procedure. Patients might experience a mild discomfort and that is only due to the initial focusing of light on their designated area. There’s no other sign of discomfort throughout the whole procedure. Plus, none of the patients have reported any type of infection that occurred as a result of the body sculpting procedure.

The International Resilience Project (IRP) aims to develop a more culturally sensitive understanding of how youth around the world effectively cope with the adversities that they face. The IRP uses a unique cross-cultural approach that employs both quantitative and qualitative research methods to examine individual, interpersonal, family, community and cultural factors associated with building resilience in youth around the world. In particular, the study has helped to develop the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM) and a tool box of qualitative research techniques.
The transition from high school into educational and occupational pathways is a bewildering process for many young people and their parents. From the time they start kindergarten to the day they graduate from high school, most youth travel down a relatively straightforward path. They proceed systematically from one grade to another. Everyone their age is doing pretty much what they are doing school-wise, and career decisions are something for the distant future.

Briefing with the Director of the Customs Administration on Authorized Economic Operators October 12, 2018
On October 9, in cooperation with the Customs Administration, the American Chamber of Commerce in Macedonia organised an informative session where more than 20 member companies attended. The members had an opportunity to discuss with the Director of the Customs Administration Gjoko Tanasoski about the newly-introduced status of Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) as a new trend in customs operations, challenges, experiences and simplification of customs operations. Mr. Tanasoski explained the concept of Authorized Economic Operator focusing on the criteria laid down in the Customs Law and the procedure for becoming an “Authorized Economic Operator” registered in the customs area of the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the benefits from facilitation in terms of safety and security related to customs controls and / or simplifications laid down by the customs related regulations.

Clickbait, spam, memes, adverts, brochures, classifieds, surveys or self-promotion will likely be removed. Egypt, land of mystery. Inexperienced treasure within the harsh North African desert. For millennia this mysterious land has drawn guests to its shores, to experience the magic that is Egypt! The mighty Nile, bringer of life and key to the very survival of the Historic kingdoms of Egypt and Nubia, has been the magnet, which has lead guests down to Higher Egypt (Southern) and generally as far south as Nubia.
The Bestek set consists of eight adapters that match grounded shops in dozens of countries and settle for nearly any plug, too. Even though the adapters use the identical plastic housings as the Ceptics adapters (our former decide), the Besteks stood out for cosy and secure connections, even after we tried them with a heavy power brick. It was additionally much tighter than the all-in-one items we examined (and much less cumbersome). That is crucial as a result of when a plug droops and loses contact with an adapter, it will possibly create a doubtlessly dangerous scenario—suppose sparks, hearth, locusts, and frogs. We broke the Besteks open to see what set them apart from the looser adapters and found barely stiffer steel brackets than these of the Ceptics.

The mud and rain have operated wonderfully against runaways of late, but yesterday evening they broke out all of a sudden again. George Pearson of near Westport drove a 2-horse wagon into the city loaded with corn. After disposing of the contents he left the team unhitched at the corner of Eighth and Main streets. Presently the horses started, and when they reached Ottawa Street they were going like a young hurricane. The furious pace of the horses started Mr. George Bummers's buggy into a panic also, and a milk wagon had a wheel taken off evenly, the contents of the can inundating the streets of the square.
On next Thursday evening Horace Greely lectures at Frank's Hall on the subject, "Self-Made Men." The price of admission has been fixed at $1 for the entire body of the hall and at seventy-five cents for the gallery. Sale of seats will commence at 10 o'clock this morning at Weikert & Co.'s book store, corner of Fifth and Main streets.
Frank's Hall was literally packed last night -- all of the seats were sold and the galleries crowded. No wonder -- the far famed troupe of Dupres & Benedict was there, and those present joined in laugh after laugh at their comicals, until the sound was almost a continuous roar. It is impossible to particularize when everything rendered was so near perfection.
Mr. Mallowe announces that the census of the City of Kansas will be completed tomorrow evening. If anyone has been slighted he will take great pleasure in correcting the error.

Christian Devotions Speak UP! with Dianne Barker 11/06 by Christian Devotions Speak UP | Religion Podcasts
Dianne Barker began writing as a college student, working afternoons at the Johnson City Press-Chronicle, simply following a desire God put in her heart. After graduating, she accepted a full-time position at the newspaper, living her journalism dream and earning much acclaim as a news and feature writer. Her weekly column, “Of Cabbages and Kings,” was widely read, and her story on the death of a local soldier in Vietnam won the prestigious Associated Press Managing Editor’s Award.
An opportunity exceeding her dreams came when the newspaper assigned her to cover Billy Graham’s historic Knoxville crusade, which claimed national headlines when President Richard Nixon attended. She was chosen by the crusade’s executive committee to write a book commemorating the event, Billy Graham in Big Orange Country—her first book at age twenty-four.
After leaving the newspaper to be a stay-at-home mom to their two awesome children (now grown), she co-authored several books, including Twice Pardoned with Harold Morris, which quickly rose to number one on the national Christian best-sellers list. Discover more about Dianne and her books at www.diannebarker.com.

Join us this week on Christian Devotions SPEAK UP! as host Scott McCausey speaks to Scott Brown about the priority of Christ, recognizing the importance of leadership within the walls of homes and abroad through God’s mandates.
Scott T. Brown is a pastor at Hope Baptist Church and the director of the National Center for Family-Integrated Churches, spending his time as an expository preacher and helping people think through the two greatest institutions God has provided — the church and the family. Scott graduated from California State University in Fullerton with a degree in history and received a Master of Divinity degree from Talbot School of Theology.
The heart of his message is that Scripture is sufficient to address any subject. That is why his driving passion is to study the Bible for answers to all of life’s questions, whether they be about the church, the family, leadership, or anything else.
Scott views his job as a speaker not as a means to communicate his own innovative ideas, but to simply apply the Word of God to the issues of today. His greatest desire is to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ, to explain the beauty of His Kingdom, and to call everyone to understand and recognize the power of the gospel.

In this news we would like to explain to you what is the project crew members are, what tasks they fulfill and how easy or cumbersome it will be for them later in the game.
In total, the project will have a maximum of 90 planning positions (PS), which will be occupied by different PCMs during the day.
Accordingly, regardless of the number of PCMs, the project will only provide equipment for these 90 PS.
Similarly, it will run for the rest of the PS, so a technician, known from the Crucible, receives repair equipment.
Team leaders, division managers and area managers will have a fixed budget, which will allow them to order equipment, arrange repairs, or issue blackboard missions.
The first task of a PCM is the registration in the crew planner, which is currently being developed by one of our members for the personnel planning of the project.
During this registration, the player can fill out specific information to represent his / her interests and experience.
According to its rank within the project crew, a PCM can use different features of the crew planner.
In addition, it will be possible to record special deeds, which took place during the event, in writing.
For this to be done quickly, we will have the possibility to make a pre-selection by means of filters, according to the information within the profile of the individual members.
In order to speed up the whole system, the system will give the PCM the opportunity to apply to a large number of planning positions on its own drive.
This possibility exists as long as the relevant position has not yet been assigned otherwise. In this way, players can give more emphasis to their own interests.
The only drawback, there will be no networking of the crew planner with the e-mail address, except for the registration confirmation.
The result is that when a player is invited for an position, he sees it only when he or she logs in.
The reason for this limitation is the fact that many players feel more bothered by such notifications. In particular, if several person want to invite a player for different events.
The Babylon 6 project is designed for groups of 3 people + leader. In this way, we want to make the groups dynamic and familiar. Accordingly, the hierarchy within a team is very clear.
The team leader has the task of coordinating and assembling the team as well as coordinating the activity with the department leader.
The personnel manager monitors the equipment, the activity and the condition of the team. Within the SEC, he is also responsible for the treatment of injured parties.
The specialist is the ace of the team and should be able to advance the team with his ability and experience.
The Rooki is the novice and is used as a support, at the same time he is to learn from the upper ranks and develop into one of them.
Some teams within the project will initially consist of a team leader and a rookie. In the future, we hope to change this and increase each team to four people.
In the case of a Polaris which requires more than 4 persons, we will assign the tasks on board in groups of 4, which will then be operated in individual teams.

As my arms float out to the sides I begin to draw in a deep breath, but by the time my arms have reached shoulder height I realize I'm holding it, the inhalation has petered out. My breath is completely held as I make my way up to urdhva hastasana, or upward salute. I begin the exhale as I fold forward and it seems that the breath can go out forever, like there's no limit to how long I can exhale. I play with the inhale again as I extend into half forward fold, but the same thing happens. My in-breath starts out strong, like a flood, then midway through there's no more room to expand and take in. My deep exhalation as I fold into uttanasana, or standing forward fold, confirms it:
From a physiological perspective, there's nothing 'wrong' with the breathing I've just described. The lungs do their job whether we are conscious of it or not, and the body and brain will get the oxygen they need just because the human body is an incredible system. But the writer in me couldn't help but notice the analogy here.
I'm less than two weeks away from graduating from 10,000 Small Businesses, the small business education and support program I've participated in for the past few months. Since January, in addition to my regular work load and family obligations, I've been fortunate enough to participate in fantastic business education modules that have encouraged me to think about Bloom in a new way, to come up with better systems to keep the studio running well, and to consider a variety of ways to help Bloom to continue to grow and flourish in the future. It has been nothing short of an incredible gift and an opportunity I'm endlessly grateful to have had.
Because I've had to sacrifice on sleep and self-care in order to get all my work done these past few months, I've actually become quite comfortable in that mode. For the first month or so I was surprised to find myself voluntarily signing up for additional commitments - 'Sure, I can head up that sub-committee!' or 'I should volunteer at both kids' schools this month!' I realized that to some degree it felt safe to put my own well-being last. If something had to give, I knew I was tough enough. That something could be me.
It's easy for me to short the inhalation, like it's easy to short self-care and that which nurtures me. This morning when I was on the mat it seemed as if my exhalations could go on forever, like I could just keep giving, keep putting energy into external projects without any thought of recharging or nourishing myself in order to do so.
But though I can sustain the movement of my arms up overhead without breath to accompany it, it feels much more satisfying to slow down the breath and let it accompany the movement all the way up. While I can use dark chocolate to fuel work sessions that last until 2am, I'd rather spread out the work as best I can, play with the kids after dinner, work for an hour or two once they've gone to bed, then get myself to bed at a reasonable hour.
As my graduation date nears, I'm as excited to usher in a change of habits as I am to celebrate the completion of this big project.
For now, I'm satisfied to be on my mat for even a few minutes, glad for the chance to explore the connection between breath and movement. With my next breath I slow down the inflow, allow it to sustain the full motion instead of forcing the air to rush in up front, and the breath is still coming in as my arms pass shoulder height and reach overhead. The pinnacle of my inhale syncs with the press of palms together, then I begin the exhale, dive forward, and release into what comes next.

Estimados miembros de la manada. Continuamos trabajando para el foro. Les hago conocer un pequeño detalle de la reunion mantenida
We all know life can be a rollercoaster for both adults and children. One minute things are going great, the next minute, we’re thrown a curve ball that can set us back. Making us feel unhappy, stressed or worried, and sometimes affecting our physical well-being and our sleep.
It’s no surprise then that more and more people are choosing alternative strategies for overcoming life’s challenges, with Hypnotherapy becoming a popular choice.
Hypnotherapy is a very natural technique, using relaxation, positive suggestion and visualisation. In a very relaxed state, the emotional area of our brain becomes less aroused, allowing the intellectual regions to focus on solutions. The trance state also releases neurotransmitters; chemicals that help us cope better, feel motivated and more positive.
Adults may work with a Hypnotherapist for a number of sessions for a range of issues, from Anxiety, Low Mood, Sleep Problems, Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Migraines. Not forgetting reducing obsessive behaviours and overcoming phobias.
Elizabeth Newton of Fresh Leaf Hypnotherapy provides a free initial consultation to all clients and offers condensed Hypnotherapy sessions with children. ‘Children over the age of about six can respond very well to Hypnotherapy. There are no negative side effects. Consequently increasing numbers of parents are seeking out a natural intervention for common issues such sleeping problems, anxiety, self-esteem, bed-wetting (nocturnal enuresis), fears of Doctors and Dentists and nervous habits like nail biting and thumb sucking. It can also be a useful technique in helping children overcome academic exam and performance nerves, including driving tests.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:
For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes.
If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources.
In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval.
In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases.
In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing.
Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source.
The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature.
No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money.
In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party.
Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.

After unveiling the cover and track listing of their forthcoming Survival debut album (6/30/17), Reggae band EarthKry kicked off their SUMMER 2017 TOUR dates in support of SURVIVAL album.
Priding themselves in building their brand the organic way, Legacy Music is the quartet’s pursuit as they trod on the footsteps of those who have inspired and nurtured their musical formation. From Bob Marley and The Wailers to Peter Tosh, Jacob Miller, Black Uhuru and Steel Pulse, EarthKry‘s mission to voice the grievances of the downtrodden through the vibrations of their music.
Keyboard player Phillip Mcfarlane , drummer Kieron Cunningham, bass guitarist Kamardo Blake and vocalist/guitarist Aldayne Haughton have pen to paper, and delivered “Philosophy“, the lead single from their upcoming album. Produced by EarthKry, the melodious reasoning sings of fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence.
“Philosophy song is basically about controlling your own destiny with the seeds you plant now. All that a man wants in life is down to the philosophy he applies to himself through the different stages of life. If our people can be more aware of the importance of life philosophies and how it can shape our future, then I think better days are ahead. However, when we speak of philosophy we speak of the positive ones. The ones of discipline, righteousness and positivity. So will you build your house on the sinking sand like the foolish man? So what perspective do you build dreams to reality? Cause for every action is a equal reaction. Children, know philosophy!“
The band released unpretentious visuals (see video ) giving viewers a taste of their summer 2017 tour dates.
* more dates to be announced” SURVIVAL songs were written by experiences, these are our daily stories. Ours meaning mankind, it’s that human thread worldwide that give us endurance to make it through financial hardships, personal struggles, health issues, war crisis, abuse, we all survive. From Syria to Chicago, Ukraine to Jamaica, we endure, we survive. We documented our stories while delivering messages of survival through music..” – EarthKry

Does anybody remember this bulletin-board? Once, around 1990, this was used as a news magazine for myrmecologists. But after a few years it disappeared.
Years ago I started to ask about it in the U.S.A. on a forum and Americans started an electronic version. On the pages of that e-version they also putted pdf's of the original paper versions (8 in total!). Copies of those pdf's I still have. In one number of the electronic version I originally putted the revision of Taber's "Fire Ants." ( viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1471#p12675 ).
After a few years this electronic version stopped also but stayed online. History is sad: The pages of the electronic version disappeared after a few years and later the originals (as pdf's) also! Sad but true.
Now my question: Is it worth to put the originals back online? Somewhere on this forum? And who can help with that? I will send the pdf's to the helping hand!

Oleg Mitvol, Deputy Head of Rospriradnadzor, looks to be on the way out, perhaps for stepping on too many toes
In the first days of aerial warfare, during World War I, pilots had no tactical guidebook to help them plot their offence or defence. Attackers could fly unexpectedly out of the blinding light of the sun. Or they could lurk in cloud banks, waiting for an ambush. Those who survived describe their learning experience as akin to an animal instinct. In anticipating what the enemy might be likely to do, they imagined where and how they would conceal themselves for the attack. To defend themselves, they would then watch the sky for their alter ago.
Oleg Mitvol, deputy chief of Rospriradnadzor, Russia’s environmental protection and resource inspectorate, has been flying blind since he took his post several years ago. He has no alter ego, but he hasn’t lacked for enemies waiting in ambush. In the short history of post-Communist Russia, Mitvol is the first, and the only, federal government official to pursue the major and junior mining companies working in Russia for licence violations. He has also attacked major metal producers, like the steel group Evraz, for waste water violations, imposing the largest individual fine in the brief record of Russian environmental enforcement.
Two years ago, Mitvol was also the target of abuse in the western media, which took the side of Royal Dutch Shell, during its attempt to defend its management of gasfield and pipeline operations at the Sakhalin-2 project, in the Russian Fareast. Mitvol’s findings of violations by Shell were widely interpreted as having been requested by the Kremlin as a tactic to pressure Shell into selling its stake and operational control of the project to Gazprom.
If Mitvol has been flying under Kremlin orders, that hasn’t been obvious lately. For a month now hehas been under intense bureaucratic pressure to resign. He himself describes the unusual position, telling Mineweb: “There is nobody in particular behind my ouster. I think I am just too active and trying to do something that nobody wants me to do here – my job.”
On June 18, the state newsagency Itar-Tass reported that Mitvol “has been stripped of his water, forest and ecological supervision powers, which have constituted most of his competences”. An anonymous source was cited. It was also reported that “according to the source, the Rosprirodnadzor
chief, Vladimir Kirillov, has no intention of submitting a motion to Natural Resources Minister Yuri Trutnev for re-appointing Mitvol as his deputy.” Itar-Tass confirmed Mitvol as saying: “As far as I know, in a future staff list, yet to be authorized, the position of a fourth deputy, that is, of yours truly, is absent.”
Almost a month has elapsed, and Mitvol has been forced to vacate his corner office at the Ministry of Natural Resources, overlooking the Moscow zoo. His secretaries have been reassigned. He is contactable only by his personal mobile telephone.
A list of new appointees has been released, but the spokesman for Rospriradnadzor, Anna Khitrova, said no details of their career background or experience can be released, as the data are not public. Ostensibly in Mitvol’s place, Vladimir Leonov has been named. A Russian press report claims he has been the editor in chief of a St. Petersburg newspaper called Outrage, and then a member of the legal department of the Leningrad regional administration. In charge of ecological control Lyudmila Plyush has been named; she reportedly graduated from a St. Petersburg mining faculty in 2000.
Mitvol says that the Russian law on the federal service requires the appointment of ranking officials at Rosprirodnadzor to be done by an open competition. He charges there was no competition to replace him. According to Itar-Tass, Kirillov has asked Mitvol to resign of his own accord, but that Mitvol has refused.
Kirillov was asked about this, and the reappointment procedure. His secretary said he was travelling, and referred the questions to Kirillov’s spokesman, Marat Khairulin, new press secretary of Rosprirodnadzor. . He told Mineweb: “Im not aware if competition is required, or if it was done or not in Leonov’s case. I will try to check.” About the circumstances of the request for Mitvol’s resignation, he added that Kirillov is the only person who can respond, and since he is away, there can be no comment.
A Ministry source, who asked not to be identified, told Mineweb it was obvious to everyone that Mitvol is being ousted, but that, since he will not go voluntarily, he has been reduced to a rank without duties.
Mitvol’s position as the activist and highly public chief inspector, while formally serving as deputy head of the inspection agency, has led repeatedly to clashes with his nominal superior, the head of Rosprirodnadzor; and also with officials in charge of licensing of mine projects under Minister Trutnev. When major US investment funds wanted to clarify Russian licence compliance regulations and enforcement policy last year, they invited Mitvol to visit New York and Washington to explain.
It looks like Mitvol has flown too close to the sun. He told Mineweb that he recently met Trutnev. “He told me that I am working well. We shook hands. I was not able to report to him about all that has been happening. Formally, I am still the deputy head, but now without my own room.” Asked whether Trutnev is helping him to stay, and if so, who is behind the efforts to oust him, Mitvol responded: “I am not sure what this help means. He [Trutnev] appointed [former Rosprirodnadzor chief Sergei] Sai with whom I had conflict, and now he appointed Kirillov. I am too active and persistent to become Rosprirodnadzor head. That would never happen. We have very good relations with Trutnev. He told me that I am working well. That’s it, the end of the story.”

Chatting with notorious war criminal Charles Taylor on the lawn of his presidential mansion as ostriches and armed teenagers strut in the background. Landing in snow-covered Afghanistan weeks after the fall of the Taliban and trying to make sense of a country shattered by years of war. Being held at gunpoint by young soldiers amid the tragedy of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Standing in the middle of a violent riot in the streets of Kathmandu. Having hushed conversations with the widows of Europe’s largest massacre since World War II. These are all scenes from The Disaster Gypsies, a compelling personal memoir by a relief worker and conflict specialist who has worked on the ground in a host of war-torn countries.
“John Norris is the rare individual who has worked on all sides of the front lines. He has done so both as a U.S. government in-house emergency responder and, more recently, as an influential, roving critic of U.S. foreign policy. But what makes Norris truly rare is that he is both a doer–a dispenser of food aid, a demobilizer of soldiers, a negotiator of life-altering deals–and he is a writer. Disaster Gypsies is a highly readable tour of the sights, scares, and moral tradeoffs that Norris encountered in the earth’s most troubled places. With a meticulous eye for detail, he offers a kind of ‘biography of a humanitarian,’ casting insight on democracy promotion and nation building at a time when we desperately need his hard-won wisdom.” —Samantha Power, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and Pulitzer Prize winning author of A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide
“The book is an engrossing read, providing a vivid memoir of John Norris’s stints—for the United States Agency for International Development, the International Crisis Group, and the UN—in a number of the world’s most difficult humanitarian emergencies and civil wars over the past two decades… Even as the book is about these itinerant humanitarian workers, Norris does an exceptionally good job of encapsulating the political context of each of these conflicts and emergencies in a few short pages… authentic and authoritative.” —Political Science Quarterly
This book offers seminal insight into the negotiations that took place between the United States and Russia in an effort to set the terms for ending the Kosovo conflict in 1999. This study in brinksmanship and deception is an essential background for anyone trying to understand Russia’s uneasy relations with the West. From smoky late-night sessions at dachas outside of Moscow to meetings in the White House Situation Room, Norris captures the feel of a war that repeatedly threatened to spin out of control. He offers a vivid portrait of some of the larger-than-life characters involved in the conflict, including U.S. president Bill Clinton, General Wesley Clark, Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, and Russian president Boris Yeltsin. New information includes backstage efforts to open a direct negotiating channel between Milosevic and Washington at the height of the conflict. The book reaches a dramatic crescendo against the backdrop of the war’s final days, when Russia unleashed a secret plan to push its forces into Kosovo, ahead of NATO peacekeepers.
“The definitive book on one of the most important American military actions since the end of the Cold War. Norris has told the story with a cinematic eye for details of a roller coaster, high-stakes, ride – climaxed by the astonishing confrontation that almost led to fighting between NATO and the Russians.” —Richard Holbrook

Captain Kim, Wan – Hee, a member of The Republic of Korea Air Force's aerobatic team Black Eagles died earlier today, when his T-50B jet aircraft crashed into the mountain in Hoengseong at about 10:28 a.m. Two of the team's planes took off at 10:23 a.m. together from Black Eagles' home air base Wonju. Five minutes later, the Captain Kim's aircraft falling down, smashed to the mountain, and burned in flames. Both planes were at training mission.
The investigators found a parachute near the crash site but the pilot apparently failed eject, as the pilot's body was at the cockpit.
I have almost no internet tonight! Definitely can't watch any livestreams :cry: I just tried the UK Bandwidth Test (with nothing else running) and I have a download speed of 360 kbps. I know those tests aren't very accurate but if I run that one when everything's working properly I get about 6,000. No idea what's wrong :cry:
then after that its really down to your isp its possible they are having problems their end always worth a call to them as at if it happens frequently you have grounds to complain to them and your calls will be logged
That didn't work. But it's OK, it's suddenly come back and now I'm watching Dolly v Djoko! Ran the bandwidth test again and strangely it's now saying 9,500 - it's never shown that high before.
Can anybody help me with this problem? To do with computer. Since yesterday when I log in to here, facebook or twitter the page is to the right of my screen as I look at it. Have tried in vain to centre but it moves the tiniest way and no more. Also at the top right where you have a box to maximise and minimise suddenly I have two superimposed on each other and the one box symbol has disappeared. This means that I can't log out/sign out as the symbol is no longer visible to the right of my screen. Also cannot move easily from top to bottom or, on here successive pages. as arrows (top and bottom) are hidden. Never had this problem before, don't know what has caused it and have no idea how to rectify it. Hope some computer wizard reads this and gets back to me. You know how I hate having problems because I don't know how to solve them!!!
Awww crumbs SG - sorry I can't help - not a techy but sure someone will. Was it that extra glass at wine o'clock that caused you to hit a wrong button? Probably just about to do the same myself! Bring on the next DC!!!!!
I know you've almost certainly tried this, but I have to go wth the simplest option to begin with - have you tried rebooting your PC?
Unfortunately, from what you describe, if that doesn't fix it the most obvious answer would be that your monitor is knackered, but hopefully that's not the case. If a reboot doesn't help, do you know how to take a screenshot? If so, send me one and Dave & I will have a look and see if we can suggest anything.
SG, it might help computer wizards to solve your problem if you tell us what browser you are using - Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome or something else? And have you tried just closing the window, as it sounds as though there may be another one behind it?
One further thought occurs - it's not just something as simple as the window having been dragged partly off the edge of the screen is it? If so, you could try right-clicking on an empty spot on your taskbar at the bottom, and choose "cascade windows" - if you have lots of windows open, it might take you a few minutes to get them all moved and resized back where you want, but at least you'll be able to get at them all....worth a shot.
Thanks so much...you are a genius. I right clicked and chose "cascade windows" and it was sorted on everything I've logged into. And thanks for all the help offered by you and Dave. Much appreciated. x
Something which might interest people who want to access their computers, MPs players, iplayers, etc via the internet from any where in the house without using cabling. It is called a Home Plug Adapter. You need two to start with, put one plug into an electricity socket near your router then connect, with the cable provided, between the plug and router. Place the second plug in a electricity socket anywhere in the house and connect the plug again with the cable provided, to any piece of equipment you want use access to the internet. It worksa treat and you can add more plugs but then need to connect as a network (disc provided), or turn offother plugs as it will always work with just the two plugs with building a network connection.
Sorry if everyone already knows this but it was new to me and I wanted to get iplayer on my freesat viewer and didn't have an internet connection to the lounge.

Would you like to help animals in need but don't have the time to keep visiting numerous forums, blogs, websites etc?
Animal Lifeline UK is an animal rescue organisation run by a group of volunteers who work closely with rescues all over the UK to help with fostering, home checking, rehoming, transport and more. We also help find rescue placements for pound dogs to ensure they have somewhere safe to go at the end of their seven day stay, with the hope of a forever loving home rather than being euthanasied. We also work with owners who, through unforeseen circumstances, have no choice but to rehome their beloved pet. We also help to match up people looking for a new pet to animals in rescue thus freeing up much needed rescue space for other pets in need.
To do this we use an automatic e-mail system which saves time and enables us all to help even more animals in need.
Would you please consider being on the Animal Lifeline UK automatic e-mail list? Your details are kept for our own use only and NEVER passed on to any other organisation.
When a new member joins and registers on our forum they are asked to enter the area where they live plus additional areas, by county, where they are able to offer help. If we require assistance in a particular area then all members in that county are sent an e-mail alert to notify them in case they, or someone they know, are able to help. Members can opt-out of this e-mail notification service at any time.
Being on our automatic e-mail list doesn't mean we expect you to help all the time, or even that we expect you to reply to every e-mail. It is all completely voluntary, so you are welcome to join in and help as little or much as you would like to. All we ask if that if you are able to help please do reply as soon as possible, either by e-mail, telephone, or on the forum itself to let us know what help you can give and when so we can co-ordinate rescue efforts.
We are often asked to help animals that are in real danger or often at risk of being put to sleep. Our automatic e-mail list means we can contact members quickly and directly and potentially save an animal's life.
We do not expect our members to post daily on the forum. In fact you never even have to post on the forum if you choose not to. As a busy organisation we simply use the forum as one of the many tools to help us in our work.
Please remember that we are all volunteers and may not be able to be on-line 24 hours a day. However we do always aim to reply to anyone who contacts us within 24 hours.
You could help transport an animal to the safety of their rescue or rescue foster home. We NEVER expect anyone to do a whole transport run; we know how expensive fuel is! If you could drive even just a short way to meet someone else en route, rather like a relay so a 'chain' of volunteers covers the whole route, you will genuinely help save that animal's life.
You could home check possible foster or permanent homes to help rescues rehome animals in their care and enable them to take in more animals at risk.
There is no cost to becoming a fosterer as rescues normally pay for all food and vets bills linked to the foster animal.
Occasionally we will e-mail members if we receive an urgent request to help, such as if a rescue animal goes missing or an injured animal needing urgent veterinary attention is sighted.
Despite the large number of forum members more often than not finding someone available to help in a particular area, time or for a specific species can be really, really challenging and try as we might we sadly can't always help.
We are in desperate need of more volunteers so if you know anyone who may be able to help, or can help us spread the word to recruit more volunteers we would very much appreciate it.
So many animals are put to sleep (or arguably worse) every day because there are not enough people to help these animals in need so please get on board and help us to help more animals.
