Spray drying is one of the most complex methods for fruit juice drying. Fruit juice is very sensitive and affected the different drying parameters. These parameters should be tested and determined before the design of the dryers. With laboratory spray dryer the basic parameters for drying of orange juice with 65% concentration was studied. The investigated parameters include: drying agent material, feed flow rate inlet and outlet air temperature and sticky point temperature. Tests were performed without and with agent materials and studied the different operating condition of spray drying and the sticky point temperature for orange juice powder. The results of statistical analysis of experimental data show that the parameters of inlet air temperature and feed flow rate have significant effect on the dryer yield and wall deposit of spray dryer individually and jointly. Also with the addition of liquid glucose, the optimum conditions have been obtained with feed flow rate of 15 ml minG , inlet air temperature of 130Â°C and outlet air temperature of 85Â°C. For the orange powder containing 2% moisture, the sticky point temperature was 44Â°C.
solid product from a melt, from a solution or from a vapour. As for all thermalseparations, nonequilibrium conditions are required as a driving force for the process. Here, evaporation of solvent or temperature reduction (cooling) are the most frequent means employed to establish the required non-equilibrium conditions. Pressure can, in principle, also be used to enforce the non-equilibrium state necessary for a phase change.
Allen (2001) proposed the â€œGetting Things Doneâ€ (GTD) method for personalproductivity enhancement, and reduction of the stress caused by information overload. This paper argues that recent insights in psychology and cognitive science support and extend GTDâ€™s recommendations. We first summarize GTD with the help of a flowchart. We then review the theories of situated, embodied and distributed cognition that purport to explain how the brain processes information and plans actions in the real world. The conclusion is that the brain heavily relies on the environment, to function as an external memory, a trigger for actions, and a source of affordances, disturbances and feedback.

However, the system may include data and control signals and hence may be thought of as a multimedia
system. Various network technologies find use in the digital television production and transmission of digital television signals. All transmission media are analog channels, but binary digital signals are so tolerant of channel characteristics that they are easily handled. The capability of most communication channels is much greater than what binary transmission requires. Many methods are available for digital television
The Drinking Water Standards and Health Advisories Tables are revised periodically by EPAâ€™s Office of Water in order to update RfD and Cancer values so that they are consistent with the most current Agency assessments of chemical contaminants that may occur in drinking water and to introduce new Health Advisories.
The task of designing and configuring large Computer Networks most suited to a certain application and environment is difficult, as it requires highly specialized technical skills and knowledge, as well as a deep understanding of a dynamic commercial market. Current expert systems have made solid achievements in supporting decision makers, they use prior experience to solve problems in different domains. Hybrid fuzzy expert systems have appeared all over the world proving that integrated fuzzy expert systems/neural networks methods replaces classical hard decision methods and providing better performance.
The gas turbines are generally used for large scale power generation. The basic gas turbine cycle has low thermal efficiency, so it is important to look for improved gas turbine based cycles. The inlet air cooling helps in increasing the performance of gas turbines. Another method for increasing the performance has been to introduce a high amount of water or steam at various points in the cycle. There are several methods suggested and some are already in operation. All of them offer increased performance and increased specific output compared to a dry
gas turbine cycle. The water addition in the gas turbine cycle also helps in reducing exhaust emissions.
+02,MF02, MWA +03]. We consider distributed environments in which remote data sources continuously push updates to a central stream processor, whose job is to evaluate multiple continuous queries over the streamed data [BW01, CDTW00, LPT99, MSHR02]. In these environments, significant communication overhead is incurred in the presence of rapid update streams.
Natural products have been used for combating human diseases for thousands of years, since they exhibit a wide range of biological properties that can be exploited for medical application. Naturally occurring substances play an increasing role in drug discovery and development. In fact, themajority of anticancer and antiinfectious agents are of natural origin. The antitumor activity of natural products has been linked their ability to trigger cell death pathways including apoptosis in cancer cells.
Apoptosis or programmed cell death is the cellâ€™s intrinsic death program that plays a pivotal role in
Dysregulation of normal apoptotic mechanisms provides a growth advantage to cancer cells [1]. In breast cancer, dysregulated apoptotic pathways include down-regulated death receptor pathway function, p53 mutations, and abnormal bcl-2 pathway function [2-4] Furthermore, breast cancer treatments including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and hormone therapy induce apoptotic mechanisms to cause cancer cell death [5]. Therefore, activation of specific apoptotic mechanisms in breast cancer cells could be an effective means to treat breast cancer.
Microsoft Access is powerful software designed for PC. It allows you to create and manage databases. A database is an organized body of related information that is arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval. Some of the examples of databases are: Jerome Library online catalogue, telephone directories, address books, cookbooks, tour books, etc. Most BGSU offices and departments work with Access as their database application. The examples in this tutorial present common features of databases used on campus.

Design engineers are reminded that during detailed design stage, sufficient space should be allowed for the erection of noise barriers. Without sufficient space, design options for noise barrier will be limited. As laid down in the WBTC 19/98 and 19/98A, the noise barrier design proposal should be submitted to ACABAS for consideration of its aesthetic acceptability.
Difficult computations and fancy pictures are, of course, not ends in them-selves. We must understand the underlying mathematics if we are to know which

The main objective of this paper is to present the impacts of information technology (IT) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in business process renovation and to discuss selected aspects of the business processes and information modelling. This study presents the results of research conducted on
reengineering business processes in Croatian companies, together with the results of analysis of the status and characteristics of ERP systems in Croatian companies. The results of this study were used to form hypotheses, which were then analyzed and compared against the results of a case study conducted by the authors on business process reengineering and the implementation of the SAP software solution in PLIVA pharmaceutical industry, Incorporated (PLIVA pharmaceuticals, Inc).
The use of shared control techniques has a profound impact on the performance of a robotic assistant controlled by human brain signals. However, this shared control usually provides assistance to the user in a constant and identical manner each time. Creating an adaptive level of assistance, thereby complementing the userâ€™s capabilities at any moment, would be more appropriate. The better the user can
do by himself, the less assistance he receives from the shared control system; and vice versa. In order to do this, we need to be able to detect when and in what way the user needs assistance. An appropriate assisting behaviour would then be activated for the time the user requires help, thereby adapting the level of assistance to the specific situation.
In recent years the topic of infertility has received much public attention. This can be traced to rapid progress in New Reproductive Technologies (NRTs), legal issues concerning the biogenetic production of life and the transformative possibilities of family and relative relations (Inhorn and Balen2002:5). Similarly
some studies have been made on Infertility in the field of Anthropology. However their concern is mainly on the Reproductive Revolution, like the influence of NRTs on family systems and traditional gender relationships (Strathern1992, Inhorn 1994, 2003), and the practices and perceptions of medical doctors, patients and
people such as gamete donors and surrogate mothers who are involved in these technologies (Ginsburg et al.1995, Franklin1997, Tsuge 1999).
Despite continued dialogue over such legal, social, biological and ethical concerns, little attention has been given to the most basic tenet in this matter, namely, Love. In particular, little focus has been dedicated to love and intimacy within marriage arrangements in non-western societies, such as India. Love is generally considered as an emotional bond which is belonged to personal sphere. What I would like to deal with is the political aspect of â€˜loveâ€™ in marriage. As I will discuss in detail later, a womanâ€™s situation becomes very critical when she is not able to conceive. The main concerns in this paper are how women manage and survive the crisis of marriage and what their agency is within that. Human emotions such as love and intimacy related to infertility has been neglected so far, however the politics of love among couples, families and kinship plays a crucial role as motivation for seeking specific behavior concerning infertility. Over the course of sixty interviews with infertile couples, this paper tries try to examine how people construct social relationships based on the body, gender, and sexuality and to consider the possibility of womanâ€™s agency in Indian society through the politics of â€˜loveâ€™.
Gert argues that the prospects for an account of how children could learn an expressivist semantics for moral words are not encouraging. Veryroughly,Gert argues that the fact that expressivism is not widelybelieved means that parents are not disposed to correct their childrenâ€™s speech when that speech is infelicitous according to expressivism. Without such correction, Gert argues that children could not learn expressivist meanings for moral words. Since children obviouslydo learn the meanings of moral words, Gert

The volatility of the stock market index return is an indicator of market-wide risk, and the CAPM predicts that it is a determinant of the market equity premium. Recent studies by Ang, Hodrick, Xing and Zhang (2006) and Adrian and Rosenberg (2008) also demonstrate that contrary to the CAPM intuition, market-wide volatility risk is priced in the cross-section of stock returns. Given these findings, and given the overwhelming evidence in the literature that market-wide skewness and kurtosis are important indicators of market-wide risk, and that those risks do not co-vary perfectly with volatility risk, an investigation of higher moments of the market return as pricing factors in the cross-section of stock returns seems worthwhile.
We extend the investigation of Ang et al. (2006) and examine how market skewness and kurtosis risks affect the cross-section of stock returns within the context of the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) of Merton (1973). Our hypothesis is that the market volatility, skewness, and kurtosis are all state variables reflecting the future investment opportunity set. The ICAPM then predicts that innovations in market volatility, skewness, and kurtosis must be priced risk factors in the cross section of risky asset returns.
We empirically test this hypothesis using moments of the market return implied by S&P 500 index options, extracted using the methodology of Bakshi and Madan (2000), Carr and Madan (2001) and Bakshi, Kapadia, and Madan (2003). These moments are thus forward looking.
The moments are computed every day, so the resulting estimates are also genuinely conditional. This approach avoids the traditional trade-off problem with estimates of higher moments from historical returns data, which need to use long windows to increase precision, but short windows to obtain conditional rather than unconditional estimates.
A sleep disorder disrupts and disturbs your overall quality of life. It can affect a child, teen, single adult, parent or senior citizen. More than 70 million people in the U.S. have a sleep disorder. Most of those who have one are completely unaware of it. Many of those who are aware of it never choose to seek the help that they need.
Due to advances in the science of Sleep Medicine, help can be found for those who suffer from bad sleep. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Second Edition documents 81 official sleep disorders. While some of these are very common, most of them are found in only a small portion of people. Take some time to find out more about these disorders and the treatments that are commonly used to combat them. By doing so, you can help yourself, and others, live a happier and healthier life.
Where there are clashes between policies between neighbouring LPAS, this may be a situation in which the Inspector may be expected to arbitrate between competing policy aims to ensure that the overall approach is sound.
For modified LPAS such as St-AA, VAc-AA and VAc-AA-IA possess better compatibility with UP, which is responsible for the higher final curing conversion than in PS and PVAc systems.
Effects of molecular weight and molecular structure of low profile additives on the properties of Bulk Molding Compound (BMC)
So this is how it comes to pass that--the very afternoon I have arrived in Bali--I'm suddenly on the back of a motorbike, clutching my new friend Mario the Italian- Indonesian, who is speeding me through the rice terraces toward Ketut Liyer's home. For all that I've thought about this reunion with the medicine man over the last two years, I actually have no idea what I'm going to say to him when I arrive. And of course we don't have an appointment. So we show up unannounced. I recognize the sign outside his door, same as last time, saying: "Ketut Liyer--painter." It's a typical, traditional Balinese family compound. A high stone wall surrounds the entire property, there's a courtyard in the middle and a temple in the back. Several generations live out their lives together in the various interconnected small homes within these walls. We enter without knocking (no door, anyway) to the riotous dismay of a some typical Balinese watchdogs (skinny, angry) and there in the courtyard is Ketut Liyer the elderly medicine man, wearing his sarong and his golf shirt, looking precisely the same as he did two years ago when I first met him. Mario says something to Ketut, and I'm not exactly fluent in Balinese, but it sounds like a general introduction, something along the lines of, "Here's a girl from America--go for it."
Ketut turns his mostly toothless smile upon me with the force of a compassionate fire hose, and this is so reassuring: I had remembered correctly, he is extraordinary. His face is a comprehensive encyclopedia of kindness. He shakes my hand with an excited and powerful grip.
"Come, come," he says, and I'm ushered to the porch of his little house, where woven bamboo mats serve as furniture. It looks exactly as it did two years ago. We both sit down. With no hesitation, he takes my palm in his hand--assuming that, like most of his Western visitors, a palm-reading is what I've come for. He gives me a quick reading, which I am reassured to see is an abridged version of exactly what he said to me last time. (He may not remember my face, but my destiny, to his practiced eye, is unchanged.) His English is better than I remembered, and also better than Mario's. Ketut speaks like the wise old Chinamen in classic kung fu movies, a form of English you could call "Grasshopperese," because you could insert the endearment "Grasshopper" into the middle of any sentence and it sounds very wise. "Ah--you have very lucky good fortune, Grasshopper . . ."
I wait for a pause in Ketut's predictions, then interrupt to remind him that I had been here to see him already, two years ago.
Ketut says to me (and I'm not sure what this has to do with anything), "I am not so handsome anymore, lost many teeth. Maybe I will go to dentist someday, get new teeth. But too afraid of dentist."
He opens his deforested mouth and shows me the damage. Indeed, he has lost most of his teeth on the left side of his mouth and on the right side it's all broken, hurtful-looking yellow stubs. He fell down, he tells me. That's how his teeth got knocked out.
I tell him I'm sorry to hear it, then try again, speaking slowly. "I don't think you remember me, Ketut. I was here two years ago with an American Yoga teacher, a woman who lived in Bali for many years."
"That's right. Ann Barros is the Yoga teacher's name. But I'm Liz. I came here asking for your help once because I wanted to get closer to God. You drew me a magic picture." He shrugs amiably, couldn't be less concerned. "Don't remember," he says.
This is such bad news it's almost funny. What am I going to do in Bali now? I don't know exactly what I'd imagined it would be like to meet Ketut again, but I did hope we'd have some sort of super-karmic tearful reunion. And while it's true I had feared he might be dead, it hadn't occurred to me that--if he were still alive--he wouldn't remember me at all. Although now it seems the height of dumbness to have ever imagined that our first meeting would have been as memorable for him as it was for me. Maybe I should have planned this better, for real.
So I describe the picture he had made for me, the figure with the four legs ("so grounded on earth") and the missing head ("not looking at the world through the intellect") and the face in the heart ("looking at the world through the heart") and he listens to me politely, with modest interest, like we're discussing somebody else's life entirely.
I hate to do this because I don't want to put him on the spot, but it's got to be said, so I just lay it out there. I say, "You told me I should come back here to Bali. You told me to stay here for three or four months. You said I could help you learn English and you would teach me the things that you know." I don't like the way my voice sounds--just the teensiest bit desperate. I don't mention anything about the invitation he'd once floated for me to live with his family. That seems way out of line, given the circumstances.
He listens to me politely, smiling and shaking his head, like, Isn't it so funny the things people say?
I almost drop it then. But I've come so far, I have to put forth one last effort. I say, "I'm the book writer, Ketut. I'm the book writer from New York."
And for some reason that does it. Suddenly his face goes translucent with joy, turns bright and pure and transparent. A Roman candle of recognition sparks to life in his mind. "YOU!" he says. "YOU! I remember YOU!" He leans forward, takes my shoulders in his hands and starts to shake me happily, the way a child shakes an unopened Christmas present to try to guess what's inside. "You came back! You came BACK!"
It takes even me by surprise. It's like this--it's like I was in a car accident, and my car went over a bridge and sank to the bottom of a river and I'd somehow managed to free myself from the sunken car by swimming through an open window and then I'd been frog- kicking and struggling to swim all the way up to the daylight through the cold, green water and I was almost out of oxygen and the arteries were bursting out of my neck and my cheeks were puffed with my last breath and then--GASP!--I broke through to the surface and took in huge gulps of air. And I survived. That gasp, that breaking through-- this is what it feels like when I hear the Indonesian medicine man say, "You came back!" My relief is exactly that big.
"I so happy!" he says. We're holding hands and he's wildly excited now. "I do not remember you at first! So long ago we meet! You look different now! So different from two years! Last time, you very sad-looking woman. Now--so happy! Like different person!"
The idea of this--the idea of a person looking so different after a mere two years have passed--seems to incite in him a shiver of giggles.
I give up trying to hide my tearfulness and just let it all spill over. "Yes, Ketut. I was very sad before. But life is better now."
"Last time you have too much worry, too much sorrow. Last time, you look like sad old woman. Now you look like young girl. Last time you ugly! Now you pretty!"
He tells me I can start helping him right now and hops up nimbly, gnome-like. He bounds into his little house and comes back with a pile of letters he's received from abroad over the last few years (so he does have an address!). He asks me to read the letters aloud to him; he can understand English well, but can't read much. I'm his secretary already. I'm a medicine man's secretary. This is fabulous. The letters are from art collectors overseas, from people who have somehow managed to acquire his famous magic drawings and magic paintings. One letter is from a collector in Australia, praising Ketut for his painting skills, saying, "How can you be so clever to paint with such detail?" Ketut answers to me, like giving dictation: "Because I practice many, many years."
When the letters are finished, he updates me on his life over the last few years. Some changes have occurred. Now he has a wife, for instance. He points across the courtyard at a heavyset woman who's been standing in the shadow of her kitchen door, glaring at me like she's not sure if she should shoot me, or poison me first and then shoot me. Last time
I was here, Ketut had sadly shown me photographs of his wife who had recently died--a beautiful old Balinese woman who seemed bright and childlike even at her advanced age. I wave across the courtyard to the new wife, who backs away into her kitchen.
He goes on to say that he's been very busy with his Balinese patients, always a lot to do, has to give much magic for new babies, ceremonies for dead people, healing for sick people, ceremonies for marriage. Next time he goes to Balinese wedding, he says, "We can go together! I take you!" The only thing is, he doesn't have very many Westerners visiting him anymore. Nobody comes to visit Bali since the terrorist bombing. This makes him "feel very confusing in my head." This also makes him feel "very empty in my bank." He says, "You come to my house every day to practice English with me now?" I nod happily and he says, "I will teach you Balinese meditation, OK?"
"I think three months enough time to teach you Balinese meditation, find God for you this way," he says. "Maybe four months. You like Bali?"
I promise to. He doesn't say anything about my moving in with his family, so I don't bring it up, stealing one last glance at the scary wife in the kitchen. Maybe I'll just stay in my sweet hotel the whole time, instead. It's more comfortable, anyway. Plumbing, and all that. I'll need a bicycle, though, to come see him every day . . .
I offer up my first English lesson. I teach him the difference between "happy to meet you," and "happy to see you." I explain that we only say "Nice to meet you" the first time we meet somebody. After that, we say "Nice to see you," every time. Because you only meet someone once. But now we will see each other repeatedly, day after day.
He likes this. He gives it a practice round: "Nice to see you! I am happy to see you! I can see you! I am not deaf!"
This makes us all laugh, even Mario. We shake hands, and agree that I will come by again tomorrow afternoon. Until then, he says, "See you later, alligator."
"Let your conscience be your guide. If you have any Western friend come to Bali, send them to me for palm-reading--I am very empty now in my bank since the bomb. I am an autodidact. I am very happy to see you, Liss!"

Midfjardara, known in Iceland as “The Queen of the Rivers” this stunning river with its gin clear water has over 200 named pools, and with only six to ten rods that rotate over five beats it ishard not to feel that you have this cracking river to yourself.
The main river also has three tributaries, the Nupsa which is perfect for finding pots and pools, the Vestura and the Austura thatfeatures the famous canyon section which, although a hike, is well worth it asit is a beautiful part of the river. The joy of the Midfjardara is that there is so much water to fish that even if one opts out of the canyon section on the Austura there are numerous different pools to fish.
The Midfjardara is perfect for those that like to use single or small double-handed rods with floating line and smallflies or hitch-tubes. The main run of the river is predominantly made up of grilse but in the early season the majority of fish tend to be multi-sea-winterfish in the 10 to 18 pound range. Professional english speaking guides will take the anglers in a 4WD vehicle to the river every day for a new experience.
The lodge has 10 bedrooms with ensuitefacilities, so a full rod will ensure a private room. The lodge is well managedand has one of Iceland's finest chefs in the kitchen. Also featured is a diningroom, lounge, bar, wader room and outside Jacuzzi for those that want to unwindat the end of the day.
Permit for one rod covering four to sevendays fishing noon to noon giving 3 to six full days fishing; fullaccommodation, board and lodging for one person based on single occupancy;guide fee ( 1 guide pr 2 rods ).

TIP! Take care of your lips, as they are very sensitive almost all of the time. Keep your lips protected by frequently applying Chapstick or lip balm.
By learning about skin care, you can ensure you remain youthful looking. Taking the time to nurture your skin in your younger years will pay off in a big way as you progress in age. The advice contained here will give you all the tools you need to establish a good skin care routine.
TIP! If you want skin that glows, use a facial mask at home. Form a smooth paste out of olive oil, raw almonds, and milk.
The best method for getting glowing, healthier skin is by exfoliating. Exfoliating gets rid of dead skin, allowing newer, healthier skin to come up. Regular exfoliating also helps clear up your pores. This prevents oil from accumulating on your face, which causes acne.
TIP! Consider skin treatments that contain alpha-hydroxy; these can help your skin maintain your skin’s beauty. You will find these acids in dairies and fruits.
If you want to improve acne and other skin problems, get as much fresh air and sunshine as possible. An easy way to get enough sun is to make a little outdoors time part of your daily schedule. Eat lunch at the park. Exposure to the sun encourages vitamin D production, and vitamin D is essential for maintaining skin health.
TIP! Warm your moisturizer before applying it. When the lotion is warm, it’ll be absorbed quicker by your skin.
Use treatments and products with alpha-hydroxy acids for glowing skin. These alpha-hydroxy acids are derived from fruits, wine or milk. The mild acids help to remove dead skin cells by breaking down protein bonds. After theses bonds have been broken, the lingering dead skin cells can be easily scrubbed away, revealing new, healthy skin.
TIP! Everyday items, such as baking soda, can become skin care staples. Apply baking soda mixed with water on pimples, as they will vanish overnight.
Use hypoallergenic skincare products that are unscented since artificial ingredients can harm the skin. One ingredient that is quite prevalent in commercial creams and lotions is alcohol, which is very drying for the skin. Make sure to read all labels before buying. If you see that it contains alcohol or a fragrance, try something else.
TIP! Use a makeup sponge to apply your sunscreen. This way you don’t have to touch the sunscreen, and you can apply it more evenly.
Try exfoliating in the shower around three times every week. There are scrubs that are specifically made for facial skin. If you have sensitive skin, use a moisturizing exfoliant. Exfoliating is great for a number of things, like washing off dead skin and keeping pores unclogged. Just don’t overdo it!
TIP! Avoid drinking alcohol if you want healthier skin. You can still drink, but make sure to do it in moderation.
Keep your skin healthy by drinking alcoholic beverages in moderation. Too much alcohol can enlarge your pores and make your skin oily. This means that you’ll have larger pores that can get clogged more easily and that causes breakouts.
TIP! If you have oily skin, select a foundation that is oil-free or even a mineral powder. Once applied to the skin, these foundations will soak up any oils on the skin and look smooth.
It’s easy to think of the skin as just a thin outer shell but it is actually an extremely important protective barrier. It’s an organ! The largest you have. For this reason, the health of your skin reflects the health of your entire body. You’ll make both your doctor and your dermatologist happy if you improve your overall health.
TIP! Your lip’s skin is extremely sensitive. You can protect and treat your lips using lip balm. In order for your skin to continue looking young and fresh, you must have a skin care regimen. […]
TIP! You should never shave skin that is dry. In addition, make sure you work up a good lather before you shave Shaving skin while it is dry can cause razor burn and ingrown hairs. […]
TIP! Exfoliating can help you get great skin. Exfoliating takes away the dead skin cells from your body, so that new, healthy skin can surface. When you have decided to take better care of your […]
I really don't like the way Myspace compresses your mp3's, so I don't use their music player, I use reverbnation's music player instead [sound's awesome!]. The only problem is, with reverbnation's music player, you can't add single songs to a profile or playlist, only an entire player can be added or shared. Well, praise god for imeem! Here ya' go! click on the appropriate "add to" button, and you'll be all set!
MYNISTA has been saved, healed and delivered from a life of drugs, alcoholism, womanizing and crime by the power of the Holy Spirit!

My uncle IS Santa Claus...as he'll tell you. He sells heavy machinery parts and equipment in the suburbs of Chicago. He has a family...a loving wife (who plays Mrs. Claus) and two boys. When he was growing up his father WAS Santa Claus...for over 30 years. Ten years ago, the title was passed to my uncle. And, as he learned at Santa School, it's more than just "playing" Santa...it's BEING the character. Santa is a lifestyle. As we talk, he figures he hasn't shaved in 6 years. His beard, nearly 8 inches long at this point, is dyed white...his hair, dyed white, both quite preemptive to the natural progression of male graying. He is a middle-aged man living the life of Santa...in the suburbs of Chicago.

Mostly I find myself constantly amused by how far into tropes and caricatures the characters get. They could play everything straight, and with Apollo they get dangerously close to doing so, but then Hades will physically back away quickly if anyone gets too close to him, everyone strips at the beach to flowery backgrounds and borders, and Zeus changes the seasons at the snap of his fingers. We literally go from spring to summer to fall in one episode. Everything's so ridiculous and over the top that you can't help but laugh.
Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, individuals who can only survive by eating human flesh, live among the normal humans in secret, hiding their true nature to evade pursuit from the authorities.
Ken Kaneki, a normal college student who, after being taken to a hospital, discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul after being attacked by his date, Rize Kamishiro who reveals herself to be a ghoul. This was accomplished by transferring Rize’s organs into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to survive. Struggling with his new life as a half-ghoul, he must now adapt into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions.
Right now, greedy corporations are being helped by governments to grab land from communities around the world, taking thousands of hectares away from people that rely on their land to grow food and support their families.

Head over to our table of action cameras which list every single spec and feature of them for you to compare.
ActionCameraFinder is run by geeks. We use action cameras every day, in work environments and as hobbyists, we run, dive, fly and live with our cameras.
For each camera, we spend hours to research technologies, upgrades, read user and expert reviews around the web and use the cameras ourselve's. To stay unbiased, we never include our personal opinion.
To make things simple, each action camera gets a score from 0-100 called the Camscore. The higher the score, the better the reviews. We allow blogs, photographers and online retailers to add their own Camscore, as well as the specs, price and other camera information, all of this helps us to create the overall score.
The best way to support us is to buy cameras through our links, and to add ratings of the action cameras that you have yourself.

Things I learned: seven months pregnant during the recording of the previous (first) album, bipolar (could probably have guessed, though), helped Shane MacGowan kick his heroin habit (huge win!).
It's a cool album, with songs in a lot of different styles (from the break-beat infused version of Gaelic poem I Am Stretched On Your Grave there's a total 180 into the orchestrated Three Babies) it could have been easy for Sinéad to lose herself in the mix, but she manages to keep the whole thing in line by just being effin' great. Her voice has a good range and she can go from a whisper to a scream of rage in a heartbeat.
A couple of things though: The Emperor's New Clothes is a bit too eighties-produced for my taste (somethingg about the guitars) and the closing title-track actually lost attention after a while and that's never a good sign.
But then of course there's the monumental hit, the cover of Prince's Nothing Compares 2 U, a success which she's never managed to repeat (but then again: there's not that many who's managed something like that even once). Along with Black Boys On Mopeds, You Cause as Much Sorrow and, well, the rest of the tracks this album's well deserving of a placing on the must hear-list.
Heavily political and heavily headstrong (among a lot of other things refusing to accept the Grammy she'd won as well as the three other nominations for this album) O'Connor's a force to be reckoned with.
For the first two and a half minutes there's just a hypnotizing repeating squealing organ pattern and congas backed by drums.
And the wierdness continues like that for the rest of the album. 52 Girls is a recounting of girls names (although just 25 or so of them) and Rock Lobster is an encounter at the beach with a rocking crustacean. With semi-minimalistic riffs with shouted vocals and an impeccable sense of kitch, I guess this is what the movie Mars Attacks would sound like if it was just a little bit more eccentric.
And while not all tracks are as great as Rock Lobster (like the cover of Downtown that's, well, I guess the less said about it the better, but I kept waiting for it to end), they're still very B-52's and very cool.

God gave mankind freedom and liberty. God never controlled mankind’s minds. Only Satan and his supporters wanted to control mankind’s minds. Nazis were the first to develop the mind control weapons. With the help of Satan, they even wanted to conquer the whole world. Even though the world had destroyed Nazis, People had not been able to prevent the proliferation of mind control weapons, and prevent such weapons from falling into the hands of followers of Dragon and Beasts. More followers of Dragon and Beast started to research and develop mind control weapons. The Dragon, Beasts and their followers wanted to control their followers and also used their mind control weapons to abuse and torture God’s people secretly.
Mind control technologies are weapons which use drugs, electronic microchip implants, nanotechnologies, microwaves and /or electromagnetic waves to subvert an individual's sense of control over their own thinking, behavior, emotions or decision making by attacking the brain and nervous system.
Nazi researchers used concentration camp inmates to test a cocaine-based "wonder drug" they hoped would enhance the performance of German troops. （http://peacepink.ning.com/forum/topics/mind-control-drug）
There is an overwhelming body of evidence that confirms the existence of Mk-ultra, America's Central Intelligence Agency mind control project. (http://peacepink.ning.com/forum/topics/proof-mkultra-exists)
Many Researchers, using nanotechnologies have developed implantable electronic chips that establish new nerve connections in the parts of the brain that control movement or even alter emotion and thought. (http://peacepink.ning.com/forum/topics/information-about-brain)
In 2002, the Air Force Research Laboratory patented precisely such a technology: Nonleghal weapon which includes (1) a neuro-electromagnetic device which uses microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation; and (2) a silent sound device which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals. NOTE: The sound modulation may be voice or audio subliminal messages. One application of Voice to Skull is use as an electronic scarecrow to frighten birds in the vicinity of airports. Many mind control victims also have claimed to be harassed by Voice to Skull technologies.
It is possible nowadays to read someone's mind by remotely measuring their brain activity, researchers have shown. This technique can even extract information from individuals that they are unaware of themselves. (http://peacepink.ning.com/forum/topics/information-about-mind-reading)
It is sometimes hard for victims to find evidence of microwave or electromagnetic mind control technology. However, some news articles are starting to report the development of government mind control weapons. (go to replies of this discussion to read more articles introduce electromagnetic/microwave mind control technologies )
Recently, scientists also found that fungi could control ant's brain, will fungi become new mind control weapons in the future?

I was controlled by remote Voice to Skull technologies and Mind Control technologies, and I was brought inside US Embassy in Hong Kong
Book “Twelve Years in the Grave - Mind Control with Electromagnetic Spectrums, the Invisible Modern Concentration Camp”, authored by Soleilmavis Liu, provides the sound facts and evidence about the secret abuse and torture with remote voice-to-skull and electromagnetic mind control technologies.
We can “see” by our eyes; we can “hear” by our ears; we can “smell” by our nose; we can “feel” by our skin. Sense organs receive many information everyday.
Electromagnetic weapons can directly stimulate our neurons to let us “see” “hear” “smell” or “feel” by our brain. Victims also feel that information is “transferring” to their brain.
I am not talking about the sounds around us, but the radio signal itself. We don't "hear" that signal as sounds or voices around us, but as sounds generated inside our heads by the signal.
They also can stimulate our neurons to cut off the connection between neurons and visual sense system; sense of hearing system; sense of smell system; or sense of feeling system, and let us can not “see’; can not “hear”; can not smell” or even can not “feel” pain.
If the electromagnetic weapon’s frequencies are same with our brainwaves frequencies, and both frequencies creative resonance, the electromagnetic weapons can affect our human activities.
Electromagnetic waves can reach everyone through satellite, Radio, TV or Mobile phone signal towers. (See this website to learn some knowledge of satellite surveillance)

Over the past decade or two ultracapacitors force their way to the market through the strong competition from advanced batteries. Today NiMH and in particular Li-ion batteries demonstrate the power density as high as 0.6-1 kW/kg (though at the expense of lower energy density, shorter cycle life and overheating). Therefore, to become competitive, ultracapacitors must demonstrate the power density much higher than 1 kW/kg providing at the same time the long cycle life. The best of our competitors and ultracapacitor manufacturers demonstrate 1-3 kW/kg at 95% efficiency, while our prototypes demonstrate 5-6 kW/kg.

Another obstacle for ultracapacitors on the path to the market is cost of carbon. Nanoporous carbon, which is used as electrode material in supercapacitors, is rather expensive, and it typically contributes about 35% to the total cost. APC has utilized carbon, which is 4 times cheaper than that used by its major competitors.
APC middle and large devices can demonstrate the same performance being 2 or 3 times smaller (due to much higher power density), this means that APC uses 2-3 times less material than competitors.

In 1991, the Danube Delta, the largest marshland in Europe, famous for its biodiversity, became a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Due to this designation, new regulations concerning local use of the environment have been imposed by the Romanian government and the European Union. Relying on participant observation, in-depth interviews, oral histories and archival work as main research methods, this paper scrutinizes from a cultural anthropologic perspective the changes in the local patterns of natural resource use before, (1880s-1950s), during (1960s-1980s) and after communism (1989). The findings discuss how the resource exploitation of fish and ecologic management of Danube Delta has been under constant transformation, from capitalist system, to communist one, and back to capitalism combined with “green” policies today. The second part of the research focuses on the present practices pointing to the locals’ perceptions of the changes occurred over the past century and the problems they face today in the context of resource depletion and climate change. Moreover, considering the fact that it seems that personal agenda of the authorities weights more than the rule of law, locals from the Danube Delta see democracy and environmental protection rules as a means for people in key positions to have a monopoly over the highly valued resources of the protected areas, which they profit from in illicit ways. Consequently, this research argues that due to new environmental policy-making, that systematically ignored the local participation, and due to the weak law enforcement in the context of post-communism, the fishing communities in the Danube Delta experience an acute social and environmental degradation today.
Subaqueous gravity flows (SGF) including sediment-laden turbidity currents are quite common in nature and are important both in transporting land materials into lakes, oceans and also in shaping the subaqueous morphology. By checking the flow thickness versus specific energy curves of SGF undergoing from 0.5° to 10° seven slop transitions for the first time, it is surprising to find that: i) contrary to popular thinking, SGF on most part of the slope with Froude number larger than unity are not supercritical; ii) there are two inflection points on the thickness-energy curves, indicating SGF are supercritical only in short regions around the inlet and slope transitions, something like open channel flows undergoing a sluice gate; iii) the critical Froude number of those SGF are well above unity corresponding to weaker internal hydraulic jumps than their cousins in open channel with unity critical Froude number; iv) the higher the slope transition, the wider the supercritical flow region. These findings may assist us in understanding the mechanisms of some subaqueous topography relating with subaqueous gravity flows.

Located in the southern part of Santa Clara County, Morgan Hill's beautiful hillsides, peaceful atmosphere and wonderful climate have made the town one of the most desirable and fastest growing communities in the Bay Area. Originally populated by ranchers, farmers and orchardists, the city has evolved into a bedroom community for the high-tech professionals of the Silicon Valley. Property choices are almost endless, from condos and suburban homes to country estates and ranches. Amenities for residents abound, including a cutting edge sports complex and new community and aquatic centers. In the heart of the city is Morgan Hill's vibrant downtown, which is home to a wide variety of eateries and shops. Annual events, including the 4th of July Parade, Poppy Jasper Film Festival and Mushroom Mardi Gras, evoke a strong sense of community, as do the town's street festivals, including the summertime Music in the Streets. Residents and visitors can take advantage of the numerous riding trails, parks and lakes spread throughout town, including Anderson Lake, a popular destination for boating and fishing. Renowned wineries and award winning restaurants are also a draw for locals and tourists alike. The town's inviting nature, coupled with its outstanding climate and location, have made it a wonderful place to live.
Mid-September marked a somewhat historic event in the state of Texas when the Federal Aviation Administration issued a license for the Midland International Airport to build a commercial spaceport. This will be the first time a primary commercial service airport will also be cleared to host spaceships.
XCOR Aerospace will relocate its headquarters and flight test operations center from Mojave, California, to Midland where it will run suborbital tests of its Lynx rocket plane. XCOR President Andrew Nelson said the company hopes to provide rocket plane rides up to 38 miles in altitude by 2015 or 2016. Another year or two after, they plan on offering trips to outer-space altitudes.
This is the kind of thing we’ve been anticipating for a while now – commercial rocket trips available to the public for a high price. Leonardo DiCaprio already purchased a seat on a trip to the moon on Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo. The same vehicle has already booked more than 500 seats on a flight that will loft passengers to an altitude of 360,000 feet at an initial price of $200,000 per ticket.
Space travel tends to come with a taboo of irrelevancy. Maybe it’s because some think we should be spending our money on existing earthly problems instead of seeking them out on Mars. Or maybe it’s because the high cost doesn’t seem to be worth it for the majority of humans who could never afford to travel to space.
Though it’s obvious normal people like us won’t be buying tickets to space anytime soon, there are other reasons to support the industry, even beyond the adventurous spirit that has always accompanied space travel. And even though it’s a seemingly random location, the Midland spaceport will kick-start a plethora of benefits to West Texas and the aerospace industry.
NASA is already proposing to contract with private aerospace companies to build and rent spacecrafts. NASA believes it will be less expensive to get crews into space if it rents rather than owns the vehicles to send them there. This means private companies will not be solely dependent on people with $200,000 to burn, but will have the government to keep them in business, too. NASA might not be sending its crews out of Midland, but the spaceport will be a factor in helping private companies grow and compete for those big contracts.
Finally, the economic benefit that the spaceport will bring along with it is undeniable. It’s not like Midland needs help boosting its economy with the current oil boom that has taken over. But an industry like aerospace with constant research and technology poured into an infinite frontier makes it seem more sustainable than the non-renewable resource industry we’ve seen go dry before.
This is an investment that will carry West Texas further into the future than we can begin to imagine.

Startle displays are, now I hope you can follow my logic because it's apparently difficult for you, are meant to startle. Birds can be highly neophobic, and thus a startle display can give them enough pause for a snake to escape. This is likely a target for birds as they are sensitive to long wavelengths (reds, oranges, yellows), which you'll note, is what the ventral colors of ringnecks are.
Your logic is incomplete. You failed to take into account or do not understand all the behavioral aspects of the snakes that employ the discussed defense strategy.
Snakes that use the tail flashing defense use it any situation where they feel threatened. They do not always simply flash their bright colors to buy time and then try to run. They display these colors often times with tail wagging or little movement and patiently maintain the pose until the perceived threat is determined to be gone. The predator is not distracted or startled while the snake escapes. The snake holds it ground. The predator questions the safety of latching on to its potential meal and abandons it. Its a behavior that would be more useful against a predator that stalks its prey as opposed to visual quick strike from above predator in which case the snakes cryptic dark top coloration would be of more value. This behavior also cast serious doubt on the "Disruptive coloration. It's possible, for sure" theory as it was categorized.
That is smart of you because Grizzly Bears don't inhabit coral reefs. But again the analogy falls flat because the members of the mammalian taxon I listed are voracious snake predators to be sure, coexist in the same habitats and have life styles that would allow them to have frequent interaction's with "Tri color snakes". The use of these mammal's as a model for mammalian tri color snake predation encounters makes perfect sense. Grizzly Bears eating reef fish not so much.
In a pervious post you made the same mistaken assumption. Snakes that use the tail flashing defense use it any situation where they feel threatened avian or otherwise. They do not always simply flash their bright colors to buy time and then try run. They display these colors often times with little movement and patiently maintain the pose until the perceived threat is determined to be gone. A behavior that is indicative of a deliberate warning defense and not a flash and run startle defense. This behavior would also cast serious doubt on the "Disruptive coloration. It's possible, for sure" theory.
Another startle display is one often shown by silkmoths where they have eye spots on their hindwings that are hidden by their forewings. When disturbed, they lift up their forewings to display these spots. That's often the only thing they do. It's still a startle display. The moths are completely edible. It's meant to give predators pause because a lot of predators (like birds) are very neophobic. It falls under a startle display. You also haven't demonstrated the second component necessary for aposematic signaling to work. A secondary defense. Yes, ringnecks have pretty potent saliva, but the reality is that they 1) rarely bite and 2) have mouths so small that they're not likely to deter even moderate sized predators. So where, again, is your evidence of aposematism?
As for disruptive coloration, the purpose of this is to break up an individual's shape, which this would do, so I do not see how whatever you said casts doubt on it. You're obviously just arguing to argue. It typically is used with cryptic coloration, but there's no reason why this couldn't fit the definition.
Grizzly Bears eat fish, but I'm not about to use them as a model of coral reef fish predation. That is smart of you because Grizzly Bears don't inhabit coral reefs. But the analogy falls flat because all the mammalian taxon I listed commonly predate on snakes, coexist in the same habitats and have life styles that would allow them to have frequent interaction's with "Tri color snakes" . The idea of their defense strategies is to prevent them from being an important part predators of a predators diet.
Really. Australian marsupials, of which your citation was referencing (Honey Possum and Fat-Tailed Dunnart - both are so small that they're more likely to be snake food than prey upon snakes), not only overlap with tricolor snakes but also prey upon them. That's one serious range extension.
It was very EASY for me to pick out MonarchzMan as a grad student from the form and content of his responses. What they reveled about him. Strange wrongful analogies ranging from grizzly bears to cardinals and dogs, the unexplained implied response that I had lied. The broad sweeping comments about what think and understand etc. Are greater indicator of a persons true knowledge level then boastful comments about their expertise.
The cognitive dissonance here is pretty astounding. I am an expert in color evolution and aposematism. There's no point in denying it. I ask again, how much experience do you have? You're pretty remarkably light on your citations supporting your positions.
This was a cool discussion, but now its all lost in the rants. I had some thoughts but I'll hold off on sharing them.
Ernie is the same guy that claimed its impossible to model reptile populations. In Ernie's mind, if you can't explain it all, yoU caN'T exPLAIN NOTHIN'!
It's all too true. I hope those interested are gleaning information from my posts because this topic is quite interesting. It's just too bad that Ernie can't admit ignorance and deference to someone who actually knows what they're talking about. Could be so much more productive a conversation.

So where, again, is your evidence of aposematism?
I have to demonstrate the second component necessary for aposematic signaling to work in this instance? You cant figure out the very simple answer. Especially since you actually know what your talking about. They musk.
There is a another possibility in addition to aposematic signaling and startle display as to the purpose of the snakes tail waving display that has been studied but not discussed here. Since your an expert I don't need to tell you what it is. Google save me.......
What I said . Members of the mammalian taxon I listed are voracious snake predators to be sure. Taxon not species. Probably not the right term but none the less. It is more encompassing to the point. My posted citations included statements involving vision traits of species found within a family. Specie's found in families such as the listed Mustelidae and Marsupials share similar traits. These families are wide spread over the regions occupied by "Tri color snakes".
"Tri color" is a loose generic term mostly used to describe snakes having a banded pattern made up of three colors and is not well suited or accurate to the point of discussion as it marginalizes the complete picture. Many snakes that fall squarely into the main point of the topic are not "Tri color" as the loose generic term is commonly thought of. That should be clarified for the people that aren't experts.
And what you said is pretty stupid, to put it bluntly. You're going so broad as to be useless. That's like saying since humans are eutherian mammals and have trichromacy vision, then all eutherian mammals are capable of trichromacy, which simply is not the case. Please do tell me that you understand that mustelidae (a family) and marsupials (infracass) are vastly different scales. The fact of the matter is that your citations looked at honey possums (Tarsipedidae) and fat-tailed dunnarts (Dasyuridae). Both Australian marsupials. To extend trends so far beyond them is quite foolish. That would be like looking at a coral snake and a viper and saying, they're both venomous, so all (or even most) must be venomous.
Just because I know you won't do it, I looked up the Virginia Opossum which is basal to Australian marsupials. It does not have color vision. Shocker. Trichromacy in Australian marsupials is a derived trait, not an ancestral one, as you suggest.
I am still waiting for any evidence at all that supports your assertions. Like I said, your insistence is not evidence. I'd like to see that mammals are avoiding the tricolor phenotype because of the colors, not because of the contrasts, as you are asserting.
Having good instincts is a great thing. Being able to use your instincts in your life's work, is the greatest most satisfying way to live. We use our instincts along with building our knowledge - it gives us valuable discernment to absorb or discard information. Over time our applications and their results create an interior mental laboratory. It is tempting to become enamored with our own laboratories, especially in eclectic genres.
This subject has concentrics that go beyond what a person can observe, or read unaccountably about or remember stuff we know, without prerequisite overview.
If we are sincerely interested in any topic when someone else has some tools we dont have we should check it out. There are sanctums of evolutionary genetics, biochemistry, advanced mathematics and more to this subject that I will probably never fully grasp, but i am actually interested enough try, and thankful enough that someone who has learned it, has taken the time to talk with me just because I asked.
The above statement was a response to a point raised about tail flashing defense and its use in snakes. The purpose of disruptive coloration in a defensive context is to break up an individual's shape. True. The predator loses track of the prey. The animal disappears. There is an obvious reason why it does not fit the definition in this case. Tail displays are meant to be seen. When snakes use tail displays they are not trying to disappear from the predator's view. Snakes use tail displays as a visual deterrent until the threat is gone. The snake does not slip away due to distraction (losing sight of the prey), the predator rejects it because of the visual deterrent and aborts the attack.
I used ringneck snakes because its common and familiar example of a species that uses a tail flashing defense with contrasting top and bottom colors.
There is a another possibility in addition to aposematic signaling and startle display as to the purpose of the snakes tail waving display that has been studied but not discussed here. Can any resident expert tell us what it is? Another expert level question. Within the realm of predators for "Tri color" snakes what would the top predator be? And can we be sure that this is the top predator of these snakes.
You just don't know when to give up. Disruptive coloration is meant to break up an animal from a predictable shape. Tail flashing, as in ringnecks, provides a markedly different pattern from the dorsum, thus would break up a shape. As I said, it is possible, but like aposematism, it has not been looked at, to my knowledge. And you've provided no evidence to the contrary. Just your uninformed and inexperienced opinion.
Now who is arguing just to argue. You didn't know that ringsnakes musk you probably shouldn't calling someone else uninformed and inexperienced. Any answers for my expert questions ? You are an expert.
I'm not arguing. I'm lecturing a particularly dense student who doesn't know or understand even the most basic concepts in the course he is taking.
If anyone would like to offer some comments or answers to the presented information and questions in the post below, have at it.

Serious question. Why do you expect someone to answer your questions when you refuse to answer theirs? More cognitive dissonance.
The second component necessary? It sounds like you are talking about robots, not animals in an almost limitless array of scenarios and stimuli.
Aposematic signaling has two parts to it, the signal (primary defense) and the secondary defense (often chemical, but really anything that conveys unpalatability or unprofitability). That said, I am skeptical of musk being a sufficient secondary defense, however. Natricines, for example, musk, but by and large lack conspicuous coloration (at least in the US, I'm hard pressed to think of one).
The perpetual paradox with aposematic signaling is that you need each for the defense to work. If you just have a conspicuous signal, you increase visibility and risk of predation. If you just have a secondary defense, you risk that predators will not be able to remember to avoid predation on future encounters. It's been quite a perplexing phenomenon.
I did not understand how musking fit in as a secondary, the way Ernie set it up to a drum roll, as all snakes have cloacal glands, and musk is composed of fats and various non injurious chemistry depending on species and even sex, and to my knowledge no animal has ever been poisoned by it, sometimes snakes do not excrete it, or excrete very little or predators can be impervious to it.
I have handled ringnecks that didnt musk at all but had tendency to flip the last quandrants of their very long bodies in my hand (oddly long proportionately, if you really look and compare to other small ground dwelling snakes)
I have had rock pythons vigorously musk me. And many others. I find the small of human scalps sitting next to me on the bus much more unpleasant.
Noxious smell can serve as a secondary defense for an aposematic signal. Skunks have been shown to be aposematic, for example. But as you say, lots of snakes musk, but coloration doesn't seem to correlate with it.
I've handled a number of ringnecks too, and have never been musked. They are quick to show that ventral coloration, though.
Ah I get it. The skunk gives a really vivid illustration. I was off point focusing on stressor variables inciting the employ of accessories like toxic extrudate and stingers and things.
Tail-coiling behavior has been discussed in scientific literature for 100 yrs. The possibility that tail flashing / tail coiling is used as a form of disruptive coloration is a slim one when all the factors surrounding the behavior are taken into account. Nowhere in scientific literature is the idea that disruptive coloration might serve as a function of tail flashing mentioned. I used ringneck snakes as a common example but tail coiling is seen in many species of snakes. Many do not have a markedly different dorsum pattern. They look the same top and bottom.
For all species that use tail-coiling as a defense fleeing is the first option. Tail-coiling is used when the animal is unable to escape. Some snakes use sound (loud cloacal popping) in conjunction with tail-coiling to alarm potential predators. A defensive ploy that is based on the predator knowing where the snake is.
Other defenses associated with tail-coiling all involve the snake warding off the attack while being in view of the predator. It has been studied that tail-coiling might be a decoy mechanism diverting the attack from the head to the tail. Findings from this study examining if tail-coiling in ringneck snakes is used as a flash display or decoy (it could be both) suggests that tail-coiling is employed as a decoy, displacing predator attack to the tail. This defensive strategy again is based on the predator knowing where the snake is.
Ringneck snakes also release a musky contrivance of liquid feces and uric acid that is smeared upon its attacker (Ernst and Barbour 1989; Fitch 1975).
Ernie you mentioned other tail coiling guys of uniform color, it struck me as an obvious reminder that predators do not only perceive contrast, but mass.
Ernie I think you should know from someone who has actually tried to like you, and wanted to talk to you, that there is an emotionally fueled stubbornness that comes off in your posts that gives off the impression that you have chosen your views and composed them purely to engage with MonarchzMan in an opposing spirit.
I dont think you really even have the views you have of this topic but are winging it as you go along.
I actually had to be careful writing this post, to leave out anything about tails, musk, colors, contrast and feces so as not to provide you with new material to create more unnecessary creative dissent.
Feature detection and image processing in the vision of predators has been achieved in research - I mentioned the Neuroethology of Toads study. So it can and has been done, just not in enough species. So there is no need to argue, just explore our views, and I think if we are really interested we can learn from the stewardship of someone who has studied the data - for instance - the second component that Monarchzman described. That was just one of many solid points I had no knowledge of.
I have found a kind of converse ring to this topic that reminds me of things I have explored in practice of my own explorations in food recognition, reticent feeders, prey specialists and habituation/food item conversion of captive reptiles.
I have found that combined cues work together to incite acceptance the best, even in the absence of a very significant cue, like movement, for an example.
And Ernie your many of your points have strong merit - snakes seem to operate on an instinctive per the expendability of the tail, even an injury to the hemipene can be survivable, and severe injuries to the tail that breach blood nourishment can necrose and demarcate in a gradual narrowing of eventual fall off.
Snake tails interest me, its the most expendable portion of a linear body, yet a snake's tail is fully innervated, with complete sets of muscle fibers and bone all the way to the tip.
Mimicry is one of the most studied aspects of snake ecology and behavior. Joe Slowinski was one of the worlds foremost EXPERTS on the subject. Joey ended up taking a dirt nap courtesy of a bite he received from a snake he thought was a harmless mimic, Oops.
The most common form of mimicry studied involves colouration and behavioural traits seen in over fifty species coral snakes (Leptomicrurus, Micrurus and Micruroides ) and the more then a hundred species of various Aniliidae and Colubridae that imitate them (Batesian mimicry). There are precise resemblances to coral snakes in coloration and behavior seen in sympatric harmless species but one study concluded that mimicry complexes may not rely upon perfect signal matching and distributional overlap. Almost 20% of all New world snakes are considered by experts to be coral snake mimics. Coral snakes use a combination of coloration and behavioral traits to form a aposematic defense. Brightly colored patterns (particularly ringed/banded) are considered an effective antipredator strategy against both avian and mammalian predator's. But some species like the Laughing Falcon (snake specialist) do not seem to be deterred. Mertensian mimicry (another idea) was first proposed as a reason behind Coral Snake mimicry. In this scenario a mildly venomous species is the model for a highly venomous species. Another type of mimicry (Mullerian) has also been associated with snakes. This time two dangerous species copy each other with mutual benefits.
Snakes sometimes only adopt certain aspects of the mimicked species. Striped swamp snakes for example do not strike as a defense but will exhibit a gape and sway behavior (deimatic display) when threatened. Mimicking more noxious sympatric species like the venomous cottonmouth. Deimatic displays are secondary defenses that are only triggered by tactile predatory stimulation. Tail-Coiling a kind of unkenreflex action (a term generally associated with amphibians) revealing aposematic coloring. Has been potentially linked to caudal pseudoautotomy in addition to commonly associated defenses such as musking and decoying. Tail Coiling / flashing has been documented in over 70 snake species and essentially falls into three category's. Other common deimatic displays such as flatting and triangulation of the head and inflation of the throat are often seen in harmless species that are sympatric with venomous species that share the same behaviors.
File comment: The striped swamp snake doesn't bite but will gape and sway to startle predators or mimic more noxious (e.g., water snakes, Nerodia spp.) , or venomous (e.g., cottonmouth) sympatric snakes that do bite. It will also coil its body into a ball, concealing its head and laterally flatten its body. Like most natricines, they commonly discharge cloacal contents or anal gland.
File comment: Mud snakes use tail-Coiling and aposematic coloring when they get in a jam. The tail also ends in a sharp pointed scale that they use to poke.
You know everything there is to know about the topic of mimicry. Nothing more to see here, or to think about.
Why even bring this up? I'm not sure how its at all relevant, especially because eye witness accounts describe him reaching into a bag that he was told contained a harmless Dinodon sp., he didn't see the snake before it bit him.
Ernie you are too easily offended. I have repeatedly commented on your experience on these forums, and have always remembered a kind comment you made to me once, years ago. I dont get many.
You made some interpretive commentary that struck a chord of unfamiliarity with some terms and concepts that Monarchzman described. Only an observation here, but I dont think you have the background to explain some of this stuff. Its not a crime, it doesnt mean you arent knowledgeable, but its detectable and that is what I meant by winging it.
And no, Im not going to court about it with quotes + message board dissection of sentences, complete with belittlement and insults. Not because Im afraid to engage with you, but because I dont want to like that. I have been caught up before like that here and it made me feel lousy after. But, Feel free to insult me, as I would be in good company.
I am pretty sure of one thing, and that is you know more about this topic and its tangentials from participating in this thread, than you did before it.
Not to mention I looked at his recent papers before he passed. He was a phylogeneticist. That does not mean he was an expert on mimicry. It means he was an expert on analyzing genetic patterns among taxa.
And I've said it before and I'll say it again. Bright colors do not necessarily make something aposematic. There are two components to aposematism. And I've not seen strong evidence that "musking" is a sufficient defense to be considered a secondary defense for aposematic signaling.
'Musking'.. along with evacuating the cloacal vault, which often accompanies it is at an energy expense and electrolyte loss.
This is why I have avoided inciting it when I can, keeping ministrations and restraint expedient with sick, injured or ship shocked snakes. One reason of many. I have always kept in mind the prey status of snakes and the awareness that input is happening.
Its a panic response, and one that is not uncommon with other animals under intimate physical duress.
Typically I don't think that secondary defenses have a high metabolic costs, but that said, there are some secondary defenses that are likely costly. Snake venom, for example. But also skunk musk. While I don't know the metabolic cost, but I imagine that the secretions from Ladybugs are probably costly. Most secondary defenses are passive (i.e., the predator has to attack to experience the defense - like poisons).
Yeah, the expulsion of fluids - which can be quite substantial - is a lapse of smooth muscle tension. It isnt specific to snakes whatsoever. I sometimes have wondered if fluid loss could impact translocation in some cases - leading the snake to seek recovery however mild, to hydration. Whether that is a pos or neg in trek.
Why do You care? Did you know Joe? I brought it up as a point of irony because of Joes storied background in the world of herpetology and his unquestionable all around expertise, his intense field knowledge of snakes and their behavior's and the mistake that ended it for him. The discussion is about mimicry in snakes. Joe assumed and....he bought it because he believed the snake to be a harmless mimic. There is a lot more to the story. Everything went wrong for Joey that day. Only an internet For-on would question his all around expertise. Now some mimicy snake stuff, I'm sure everyone already knows this but,
The genus Scapkiodontophis are familiar, common and widespread and sort of unusual coral snake mimics. They show geographic variation in coloration but all have components that in someway mimic coral snakes. What is commonly seen (not always) in these snakes is that the aposematic pattern is only present on the anterior part of the body and on the tail. Even this partial pattern is effective especially when the snakes foraging habits are taken into consideration. These snakes also display tail thrashing and head twitching. Another element to the snakes defense is a very long and fragile tail that could be linked to specialized pseudoautotomy. There is no evidence to support that the tail thrashing or the incomplete aposematic pattern is meant to direct predator attacks to the tail. What is thought is that the snakes were once unicolored snakes that developed specialized pseudoautotomy and the mimetic coloration in this genus came about much later.
Urotheca is a group that contains two species of coral snake mimics, U. elapoides and U. euryzona (I'm guessing that's where the taxonomy still stands). Elapoides and euryzona display color variation that closely resembles local color variation seen in sympatric species of coral snakes . Most notably the redtail coral snake. Urotheca are distantly related to Scapkiodontophisshares but share the same characteristic of a very long and disproportionately thickened and fragile tail as seen in the Scapkiodontophis coral snake mimics.
File comment: The Blanding's tree snake is not a perfect Boomslang mimic but when threatened it puts on a convincing display. Protecting it from generalizing predators having innate or other triggered responses to boomslang behavior.
Did you actually post a picture of a Cottonmouth, a venomous snake, and call it "This harmless water snake is quite convincing"?
A more a, nuanced confusion is Ernie mixing up the term Disruptive Coloration with Outline Disruptive.
Outline Disruptive Pattern In snakes, chevron markings, blotches, can melt into the shades and irregularities of ground features. Geckos - especially guys that repose on bark do it great, with webbing, skin flaps, fringes and tubercles.
Although I have known about Outline Disruptive patterns. I have been interested in how snakes will accentuate it with a ripple type rectilinear crawl. But I have only thought of Disruptive Coloration conceptually, as part of a delay/confusion tactic. I have always leaned on that in my interior belief system, which has been altered positively by the input of Martti and Monarchzman.
If you have a basic understanding of snakes and their behavior's. You will already know this but some are clearly novices in this area. They confuse and mix-up various defensive strategies and fail to understand the sequencing and predator prey relationship as it applies to the snakes that are the point of discussion.
During periods of activity. Coloration in its various forms along with fleeing are the snakes first line of defense. Only when the snake "feels" trapped do other secondary defenses come into play. Deimatic displays such as tail-coiling / flashing are secondary defenses initiated only when the snakes primary defenses (disruptive coloring / disruptive patterning for example) have failed. The snake has been discovered and fleeing is not an option. The snake must now activity defend itself. Other included defenses such as musking, bleeding from the cloaca, striking, etc. also are not utilized until the snake "feels" its primary defenses are no longer an option. These are active last line defenses.
Aposematism and cryptic coloration are opposing concepts but not always mutually exclusive. Snakes such as ringneck snakes or we can use Leptomicrurus scutiventris as the example if that is more familiar. Use a combination of the two ideas. If their cryptic coloration fails they have a deimatic secondary defense that includes revealing aposematic coloring. This display could work as both a deimatic (startle) against inexperienced animals or as a aposematic (a warning signal) against animals that are aware. Once engaged deimatic displays as they apply to the snakes that are the point of discussion are active defenses meant to be clearly seen.
I guess this thread is over now. I have always had an interest in this topic so thanks to all who participated in a sincere desire to explore it.
I see you've been reading up on something you didn't really know anything about. Deimatic displays is a really cool subject and I've actually worked with someone who does work with katydids that perform deimatic displays. Congrats. I'm glad you're attempting to educate yourself and that I apparently am motivating you to do so. I'm doing my job, and that pleases me.
There is plenty of evidence that crypsis and aposematism are not clear cut. Some friends of mine actually showed that the Dyeing Poison Frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) can actually be cryptic depending distance they're viewed from and my own research shows that they're aposematic close up. But this isn't really a revolutionary concept. Many animals use the crypsis and aposematism. Newts, Bombina, etc. all use it. My own research on Pseudophryne has suggested that the conspicuous yellow and orange displays are effective against birds while the black-and-white venters are effective against mammals (you know, since we established that a high contrast signal is more effective than a color signal for mammals since many of them cannot perceive color well).
But I'm glad you're learning about deimatic displays. Glad I could motivate you to educate yourself.
I did know Joe, I spent time in the field with him and almost went on his ill fated expedition but I got married instead. Had he survived the trip he would have been my graduate advisor. FYI, he didn't assume anything, he was told by his field assistant that the snake was a Lycodon and he reached in the bag before looking closely. I spoke with several people who WERE on the trip and the story is the same. He made a mistake but not because he was fooled by mimicry...

He assumed it was harmless a mimic in the bag if he didn't he would not have grabbed it the way he did. He was told the snake bit the field assistant the day before. He did not double check carefully or maybe fatigue got the best of him. It should have been obvious that I didn't mean Joe assumed because he could not make a proper ID. Joe got screwed. I would not call Joe a friend (I don't loosely use the word as some do) but.......... In a world filled with intellectually stagnate read and repeat literary parrots posing as experts. Joe was one of the few that got it.
File comment: That's the snake that was Slowinski's last (not my pic). Those are his initials on the tag. Its easy to see why it could be mistaken for a wolf snake. Joe gave a lot of lethal injections to snakes. It turned out to be a two way street.
File comment: Natricines use laterally flattening the body and triangulation of the head to fool predators or some of my trolls into believing they are dangerous pit vipers.
You wouldnt be his friend because he most likely wouldnt have wanted to be yours. I know this the way I know other things I cant explain.
Many theories I have pondered and constructed myself and only found out they already existed after I research. Refinement and revision with data I welcome because I am not insecure.
On November 2nd 1698, the first landfall was made by Scots at Darien in Panama. Two years later, after over a thousand deaths, the colony, New Caledonia, was abandoned. Seven years after that, bankrupted by the venture, Scotland signed the Act of Union and the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, which exists as the United Kingdom to this day.
As the decisive event that ended the Kingdom of Scotland’s independence, the Darien scheme has become a touchstone for Scottish nationalists. The deliberate barring of English companies from investing, they claim, is proof that England long had designs to dominate Scotland. If only English companies had been allowed to invest, so the argument goes, then New Caledonia would have survived, and with it Scotland’s independence. The English, so it is implied therefore, knew that the venture would fail and bankrupt Scotland, leaving it with no choice but to enter a political union with England.
Like many, many nationalist arguments, however, this image of a cackling, moustache-twirling Perfidious Albion guiding Scotland towards English domination simply does not hold water. Geography and geopolitics brought about the failure of the Darien scheme, not dastardly English chessmasters plotting Scotland’s obliteration. Even with English investment and support, the settlers at New Caledonia would still have perished, if not from disease and starvation then before the guns of a Spanish fleet.
Scotland’s economy was not in a good way by the 1690s. A succession of poor harvests had led to widespread famine, its exports were extremely limited, and the Navigation Acts froze Scottish shipping out of trade with England’s colonies in America. Now, it will no doubt be tempting for Nationalists to argue that the Navigation Acts were just another part of England’s grand design to eventually absorb Scotland, but nothing could be further from the truth. Protectionism and mercantilism of that sort was simply how trade was done in the 17th and 18th century. Similar legislation existed in France, Spain, Portugal and Holland. If England had not reciprocated in kind, its economy would only have been harmed.
The solution seemed to be colonies of Scotland’s own. The Company of Scotland was established in 1695 to trade with “Africa and the Indies”. However, the original aim was swiftly abandoned when a banker, one William Paterson, presented to them his plan to colonise the Isthmus of Panama.
Paterson’s Darien scheme was a bold plan, but on paper, the potential returns were enormous. A Scottish colony there could be used as a link between the riches of the Pacific and the trading nations of Western Europe. Ships would no longer have to make the long, hazardous journey south around Cape Horn. Goods could instead flow much more quickly across Panama and through New Caledonia into the Atlantic, bringing untold riches from import duties to Scotland.
A seed of disaster lurked in Paterson’s plan however: the Spanish Empire, the largest and richest empire in the world, claimed the territory as part of New Granada. It was this that led to William III to bar Englishmen from investing in the Company: England was at that point embroiled in the Nine Years’ War with France and had no desire to provoke Spain into switching sides. Again, there was no long-term plan to bankrupt Scotland into agreeing to a Union. As with protectionism, political realities required it.
Undaunted by the prospect of awakening a sleeping giant, Paterson began fundraising in Scotland. If nothing else, he was an excellent publicist: within a few weeks, he raised £400,000 (equivalent to nearly £44 million today). It was a truly national undertaking. Almost every Scotsman who could put his name to five Pound Scots invested. The investment ultimately totalled about a fifth of the wealth of Scotland.
Paterson advocated settlement in Darien with utter disregard for the Indians already living there. I am baffled by those nationalists who endlessly disdain the colonialism of the British Empire yet insist that the English should have invested in and supported New Caledonia. The colony and the settlers’ intentions towards the Indians there were no less imperialist than future British conduct in India and Africa.
Five ships set sail from Leith in 1698 and landed on November 2nd. It soon became clear that Paterson had made only the merest glance at a map before advocating the expedition. The colonists were horrendously unprepared and ill-informed about life in the colony they called New Caledonia. The colony was a jungled, malarial swamp that defied cultivation and farming. Even today it remains a grim place: the Pan-American Highway, which connects Alaska in the north to Argentina in the south, is forced to break for the Darien Gap.
The idea of trade, upon which the colony’s hopes had been built, foundered immediately. No attempt was made to trade with the few passing merchant ships and the local Indian tribes had no use for the crates of wigs, mirrors and combs the colonists had with them. Food was poorly stowed and spoiled quickly once the oppressive Panama summer came round. The colonists were wracked by malaria and dysentery and by the beginning of the summer they were each trying to live on a pound of maggot-infested flour a week. After eight months the colony was abandoned in July 1699, apart from six men who were too weak to move. Only 300 of the 1,200 settlers survived and only one ship managed to return to Scotland. This was only the first expedition. A second expedition of 1,000 people had set out before the scale of the disaster became known. They were besieged by the Spanish and were finally allowed to abandon the colony for good in February, 1700.
No amount of English investment and support could have saved Darien. The colonists would still have died from disease or been evicted by the Spanish. The money would still have been lost. The entire Darien scheme was ill-conceived, over-optimistic, and poorly-executed. A charismatic man seduced the Scottish people into supporting his scheme, from which he promised enormous benefits, despite having no idea how to put this scheme into practice, and the benefits being non-existent. It was, if you will, an excellent metaphor for the current Scottish nationalist movement. I once saw a Scottish nationalist describe the Union as a “sentence” for Scotland, as if it is an unjust punishment. If the Act of Union was Scotland’s punishment for the Darien scheme, then it is one that it richly deserved.
So named by his comrades in the GSUOTC, Field Marshal Bean is an Edinburgh-born student currently studying History and Politics at Glasgow University. When not studying or running around a muddy field in camouflage, he spends his time studying military history, discussing Scottish independence, and watching My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.
A persistent theme in criticisms of the commemoration of the start of the First World War is that it is a celebration of an “unjust war”. Even if this is not widely believed and there is acceptance that the Great War is something to be remembered, there is still a general perception that the immense casualties of the war were such that the justice of whatever cause Britain and the Entente was fighting for is somewhat irrelevant in comparison.
In his monumental history of the First World War, John Keegan called it a “tragic and unnecessary war”. In how it began, with civilised nations giving themselves over to suspicion and violence in the July Crisis, it was certainly tragic. In how it ended, with hundreds of thousands of men dead in the mud and millions more maimed or shellshocked, it is even more tragic. It is tempting to believe that this alone makes the war unnecessary, but the nature of warfare is violence, and with this in mind, I believe that the Entente’s participation in the war was not just necessary, but also just.
What of the war itself? To take a bleak view of history, all but a few wars are unnecessary, if we judge “necessary” to mean “in a nation's interests to fight”. What cannot be gained cheaply in peace will only be vastly more expensive in war, and there are only a handful of “short, victorious wars” throughout history in which this is not true. All too often the gains are transient: the Franco-Prussian War, the archetype of rapid, decisive victories, bred such enmity in France for Germany that the German gains were reversed at ghastly cost to each in the Great War. Yet the unique success of the Franco-Prussian War was what encouraged Germany to seek another lightning victory over France in 1914, and has only inspired others who believe they can have their short, decisive war and be “home before the leaves fall.”
Yet when those nations that begin unnecessary wars in the delusion that they will be victorious, it is often necessary for other nations to go to war and pay that terrible price, lest the peace be even worse. In the Second World War, it was hardly in Britain or the Soviet Union's interests to shatter the flower of their manhood and their imperial wealth to defeat Nazi Germany, but the price of peace, a Europe dominated by Hitler, was too much to bear.
This is the obvious example to give. It might be argued that it is the only example, but I believe the same may be said of Britain and the First World War.
In the case of France and Belgium, it is obvious that their war was a necessary one: they had to defend themselves from German aggression. But what of Britain, guarded by her Navy with a great overseas empire? Could we not have sat it out and avoided its terrible destruction?
To this I say no. It is utterly unrealistic to believe that, even if every single man that died or was injured in her service stayed alive, Britain could have sat out the war and be enhanced. Firstly, her international credibility would have been destroyed. She was committed by principle, if not treaty, to stand by France, and by solemn international covenant to defend Belgian neutrality. While the Foreign Office had noted in 1906 that the Treaty of London did not oblige Britain to aid Belgium “in any circumstances and at whatever risk”, in practice Belgian neutrality was such a core component of the strategy for European peace that had she abrogated her treaty obligations, Britain’s integrity in international relations would have been shot. French fears of la Perfide Albion would have been totally confirmed. In the words of Sir Edward Grey in his speech to the Commons on the eve of war:
If, in a crisis like this, we run away from these obligations of honour and interest as regards the Belgian Treaty... I do not believe for a moment that, at the end of this war, even if we stood aside, we should be able to undo what had happened, in the course of war, to prevent the whole of the West of Europe opposite us from falling under the domination of a single power... and we should, I believe, sacrifice our respect and good name and reputation before the world and should not escape the most serious and grave economic consequences.
Grey’s last point is particularly important. There is not a single scenario where a German victory is beneficial for Britain: without the assistance of the British Expeditionary Force at Mons and the Marne, it can be argued that France may have been forced to seek a compromise peace. Likewise, the British attacks on the Somme and Passchendaele were vital to relieving a French Army nearly broken by Verdun in the first case and torn by mutiny in the second. A German offensive in the west after the disaster of the Nivelle Offensive could have conceivably broken the French Army. Thus Britain’s involvement was necessary to hold back a German victory, but what would such a victory entail?
Fritz Fischer, Barbara Tuchman and Gordon Corrigan all considered the Septemberprogramm to be the blueprint of a German peace, and it makes for sobering reading: in particular, France would cede the Channel coastal strip down to Boulogne and Belgium would become a German vassal state. The Kaiser suggested that the border area with Germany be cleared and this new lebensraum be used to lodge retired veterans. Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz demanded that Antwerp be annexed and used as a naval base.
Since Germany never won, the Septemberprogramm remained purely speculative, but the experience of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk shows that Germany was prepared to demand immense concessions from totally defeated enemies: Russia was forced to yield Poland and its Baltic provinces to Germany, as well as pay six billion Marks in reparations. In its response to Woodrow Wilson’s December 1916 peace proposal, Germany made not a single concession at all. It is not unreasonable to believe that in the event of France capitulating, Germany would have demanded something very like the aims of the Septemberprogramm, which would include the possession of the Channel ports. A German Empire possessing these, and in particular the Rhine delta that gave access deep into the continent, would be in a position to strangle Britain’s continental trade if it so chose to do so, and so demand from Britain any concession.
But are these – Britain’s reputation and its trade – really worth the loss of so many lives? It will no doubt be argued that these are elite concerns and that their pride and wealth was not worth the bloodletting. Unfortunately this is not true: the quality of life of Britain’s poor had improved dramatically over the past century, mostly thanks to the establishment of free trade, which by 1914 Britain clung to as an article of faith. The repeal of protectionist legislation permitted the import of cheap foreign food and so improved the diets and lives of Britain’s poorest. In 1909 the People’s Budget of David Lloyd George dramatically redistributed wealth and brought about new welfare programmes. Old Age Pensions and National Insurance followed. The well-being of Britain’s people was thus intrinsically tied to the wealth of the nation, which was brought about by foreign trade. German domination of Europe had the potential to catapult everyone from the lowliest labourer to the mightiest captain of industry into destitution.
Thus, the potential impact of non-intervention is difficult to reconcile with the idea that Britain’s Great War was unjust or unnecessary. The “poets’ view”, that the horrific struggle rendered irrelevant the merits of the Entente cause, was not shared by those in the trenches. Any sane combatant recoils from the horrors of the battlefield, but this does not mean that they would acquiesce to their enemy’s victory. They would have been rather poor soldiers in that case. It is worth noting that despite the horrors of the trenches, the British Army was the only army on the Western Front not to suffer a serious mutiny or collapse in morale, and the fact that they believed in the justice of their cause played no small part in this. In 1978, veteran Henry Mellersh wrote; “I and my like entered the war expecting a heroic adventure and believing implicitly in the rightness of our cause; we ended greatly disillusioned as to the nature of that adventure but still believing that our cause was right and we had not fought in vain.” To summarise, Britain’s involvement in the Great War was very much justified and very much necessary, yet the horrifying cost that had to be paid for his does indeed prove Keegan right and makes the war all the more tragic.

ADEOLA AKERELE (°1979, Lagos, Nigeria) is an artist who works in a variety of media. By demonstrating the omnipresent lingering of a ‘corporate world’, AKERELE tries to approach a wide scale of subjects in a multi-layered way, likes to involve the viewer in a way that is sometimes physical and believes in the idea of function following form in a work.
His artworks directly respond to the surrounding environment and uses everyday experiences from the artist as a starting point. Often these are framed instances that would go unnoticed in their original context. With a conceptual approach, his works references post-colonial theory as well as the avant-garde or the post-modern and the left-wing democratic movement as a form of resistance against the logic of the capitalist market system.
His works demonstrate how life extends beyond its own subjective limits and often tells a story about the effects of global cultural interaction over the latter half of the twentieth century. It challenges the binaries we continually reconstruct between Self and Other, between our own ‘cannibal’ and ‘civilized’ selves. ADEOLA AKERELE currently lives and works in LAGOS.

Three juveniles were arrested Wednesday and Thursday and were charged with burglary for allegedly breaking into a local restaurant and stealing money from a safe.
Lt. Luis Barrera, in charge of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Alice Police Department, said Thursday that Danny's Restaurant, located on Main Street in Alice reported a break-in on Jan. 4.
The break-in occurred on the night of Jan. 3, Barrera said, when three individuals threw a brick through a glass door. The three individuals were observed on a security camera entering the building, and taking $2,000 from a safe in the restaurant, Barrera said.
An investigation conducted by Sgt. Michael Jaramillo led to the identification of one of the individuals in the video, a 15-year-old Alice High School student.
After his family was contacted by investigators, he turned himself in to the Alice Police Department on Wednesday, Barrera said.
Further investigation led to the identity of the two other suspects, both 16-year-old boys. Those two boys were arrested at Alice High School by investigators Thursday.
Barrera said investigators were given permission to search the residences of the boys and located clothing worn in the burglary, as well as a small amount of cash. Much of the cash, however, had already been spent, Barrera said.
"Apparently, the kids had gone on a shopping spree in Corpus Christi, where they bought clothing and other items using money from the safe," Barrera said.
All three suspects are being held in a juvenile detention facility and await a hearing expected on Monday. They have all been charged with burglary of a building. Barrera praised the work of investigators Thursday, and said the department is particularly concerned that the burglary was committed by individuals who were so young.
"It's a shame - these are students and they're ruining their lives by committing these crimes," Barrera said.

This is another in a series of posts about men from history who have either achieved great things in one form or another by pushing boundaries: either in themselves or in society or science or exploration of some form. Boundary pushing and growth is what men do, it's their nature: to grow and push outwards. We, as men, are the frontiers men, the first to discover/uncover new territory, in a metaphysical sense (i.e. including both material and the immaterial) that is later colonised and 'civilised' by the rest of humanity.
John Fitch; (1743-1798), American inventor, who designed and built the first operable steamboat. He was born in East Windsor, Conn., on Jan. 21, 1743, the younger son of a farmer. Fitch left school at the age of eight, proved to be physically unfit for farm work, and after unsatisfactory apprenticeships to two clockmakers, set up a brass shop. He failed in this business, and after serving in the Revolutionary War (during which he had charge of a gun factory), he invested his money with little success in the Northwest Territory.
In 1785, Fitch turned his attention to a steamcoach project and later in the same year tried vainly to get congressional support for operating steamboats on the Mississippi River. During 1786 and 1787 he secured 14-year steamboat monopolies, first in New Jersey and then in Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Helped by Henry Voight, a clockmaker, he built a boat with rows of side paddles that were powered by a steam engine, and demonstrated it at Philadelphia before members of the Constitutional Convention in 1787. It moved at a speed of about 4 miles (6.4 km) per hour.
In 1790, Fitch built a larger boat with a more powerful steam engine and a stern paddle wheel. This steamboat traveled at a speed of 6 miles (9.6 km) per hour in regular service on the Delaware River. Fitch obtained a patent for the steamboat in 1791, but the passenger and freight business was insufficient for commercial success.
In 1793, Fitch went to France, and although he had a French patent, he was unable to secure backing for his ideas. After his return to the United States he exhibited a small steamboat with a screw propeller, for which he failed to get backing. Lacking the ability to make his inventions pay, he died disappointed and destitute in Bardstown, Ky., on July 2, 1798.
While living in Kentucky, Fitch continued to work on steam engine ideas. He built two models, one of which was lost in a fire in Bardstown. The other was found in the attic of his daughter's house in Ohio in 1849. The model still exists at the Ohio Historical Society Museum in Columbus.[7] In the 1950s, experts from the Smithsonian Museum examined it and concluded that it was "the prototype of a practical land-operating steam engine," meant to operate on tracks – in other words, a steam locomotive.[8]
In 1802, the Englishman Richard Trevithick invented a full-size steam locomotive that, in 1804, hauled the world's first locomotive-hauled railway train, and within a short time the British invention led to the development of actual railways. Americans began importing English locomotives and copying them.[9]
His legal dispute over state monopoly rights with fellow steamboat inventor James Rumsey and others helped bring about the enactment of the first Patent Act of 1790. He is mentioned in the personal letters of several historical figures including George Washington,[10] Benjamin Franklin,[11] Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison.[12]
John Fitch, proving that well known old saying: 'If first you don't succeed, then try, try, try something else...'. He was unsuccessful as a farmer, unsuccessful as a clockmaker, unsuccessfully working in a brass shop, and then unsuccessful as an investor. Eventually, aged 42, he stopped copying/imitating other peoples devices/occupations and tried inventing and making his own contraptions, and became successful at it. Some people (innovators, inventors and that kind of ilk) are better suited to making what they want to make rather than making what other people want. In the case of John Fitch he excerised his creative spark, his Will, in the form of steam engine powered vehicles: the steam-powered boat and the steam-powered locomotive/railway engine.

Does the fact that children of color consistently score below Caucasian children in standardized tests concern you? Do black and brown students in your high schools and college drop out in greater percentages than white students? Do students of color in your schools have more limited access to advanced or accelerated courses in your schools? Are they suspended or punished at greater rates than the white students in your community? If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions, you’ll want to attend this panel discussion. Three experienced educational leaders (the former superintendent of Chicago public schools; a vice provost from a historically black college; and a professor from Columbia university) will lead a discussion surrounding closing the achievement and opportunity gaps which exist in secondary and post secondary education.
This is something I'm adding to my blog (The Mongrel Dogs Who Teach). It's a lot like the old Doomsday Clock published by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and -- just like theirs -- it's set essentially arbitrarily, according to my mood. It reflects my estimate of how much the current United States of America lives up to its own ideals.
You're free to disagree with me as to what the number should be, or indeed what those ideals are, or what events inidicate motion of the bar. Just don't expect me to do anything about your disagreement -- get your own darn progress bar!
The Congress of the United States passes a "fix" to FISA that expands domesitc wiretapping; reduces the threshhold for electronic surveillance; and grants retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies that aided the Bush Administration's illegal wiretapping operations.
Military prosecutors seek a blanket order preventing defense counsel from discussing the identity of prosecution witness with anyone ... including the defendants!
The President makes a vast, unprecedented play for unchecked power: He claims that he can order the Justice Department to ignore writs of contempt of Congress, as detailed in this Washington Post article.
The Health of the Republic bar hasn't moved in several months not because Washington has been asleep but because for every boneheaded jackass decree by this Administration, there has been at least signs of a reinvigorated Congress. But this latest affront is so significant it drags the bar immediately. If Congress does not forcefully and immediately respond -- preferably by citing the President for his clear contempt of Congress -- then we will watch the health of the American experiment sink even lower.
Denial of clearances to DOJ investigators into whether the warrantless wiretapping program violates federal law
The drop is a surprisingly low 4% because (a) the clearance issue is oldish and (b) these three stories have had considerable traction due to careful use of the subpoena power by Congress -- an unexpected sign that the rule of law might be rebounding somewhat after the unhealthy six years we've been through.
The President issued a decree mandating that each federal agency create a "regulatory policy office" (a politcal appointee) to review any new statement or policy guideline; that the agencies must compute the aggregate effect of all regulations before issuing new ones; and that the agnecies demonstrate a specific "market failure" in conducting regulation. It's a surprisingly small shift only because, compared to the loss of habeus corpus and the protection from warrantless surveillance -- and, you know, obedience by the executive to the clear laws of the United States -- this Kremlin-esque sweeping of political power over economic regulation is a minor thing.
During a signing statement, President Bush asserted his power to open physical mail without a search warrant or other legal constraint. The bar dropped 3% because this marks the death of yet another centuries-old civil protection. But it dropped only 3% because it really isn't anything more than the warrantless wiretapping and because, hey, today the Democrats returned to the majority and oversight returned to Washington. Let's hope they rein in this nut before too long.
Setting the initial value is tricky. I've been pretty depressed these past six years and it's tempting to set the number low. On the other hand, there needs to be somewhere for it to go. In light of the recent election I'm tempted to put the number at 50%, meaning that we have about a half-chance of the Republic persisting. But then I remember that I would, in effect, be counting on the Democrats to save us, and that just plunges me back into despair. Prior to the election, I'd have put the number around 20-25%.
Little Deming Guo was a child who had experience with abandonment. He was born in New York to an undocumented Chinese immigrant, Polly, who fled China for a better life. After a year of struggling to survive as a single working mother, Deming was sent back to China to live with his grandfather. Deming was about five when his grandfather died and he was returned to his mother in New York, having to reacquaint himself with a mother he didn’t remember. He learned to love his mother again and his new life in the Bronx with its ethnic diversity. However, things took another turn after Polly headed to work one day and never returned. The Chinese family Deming and his mother were living with could no longer afford to keep him and arranged for adoption. Deming was sent upstate to a wealthy and very white community, where his name was changed to Daniel Wilkinson and he, at 11 years old, was forced to cope with the loss of his mother and try to fit in with this new family.
This story deals with immigration and racial issues and how this affects each family member. It tells of the great costs and hardship experienced by those who choose to immigrate illegally. It also tells of how people learn to live with the mistakes of the past and how to forgive.

Polaroid 42" UHD 4K screen appears cracked on the inside is this a fast cheep repair model #de416t1n4au-pa4
Bought tv used worked at his house very carefully and softly moved to my house hardly and movement at all to the tv now when I turn on at my house for the first time it looks like a hammer hit the middle only when on. Parts of the bottom of the screen looks fine just midway and up is all distorted and crazy colors.
Possible this is a loose connection issue - but usually that make the whole screen go wacky. Would take a TV Repair guy to tell for sure - but if the screen itself got pushed against or hit something or bumped into the side of the car or such in transport, then could be the screen is toast - which is commonly about half or more of the replacement cost of the TV for that size range.
You can find a LOT of previous similar questions about damaged screens in the Home > TV Repair link in Browse Projects, at lower left with some comments on typical costs. Be sure before talking with a repair shop that you know the price of a new equivalent TV - because it is not uncommon for newer TV's to cost little to no more than the repair on on older one as the price of TV's keeps getting driven down by box stores. It is not uncommon today for a few year old TV to have cost twice or more what the current model for the same screen class does - plus remember with a new TV you get probably a 1-3 year warranty with it, so don't overspend on a repair which might have only a 30 day warranty, and on the repaired part only at that.

The Abyss - a part of the universe (i.e. the universe in which Titan resides), not taken up with the other Planes of Existence, in the sense that is used in Slaves of the Abyss.[2]
↑ Queries section of The Shrine of Hamaskis In this section the webmaster addressed the definition of "The Abyss" as used in the book Slaves of the Abyss. He wrote:
“ On the subject of the abyss, it looks to me like a bit of the universe in which Titan resides which was not taken up with the other planes of existence. You have to think in 5+ dimensions for this, but imagine the universe like a hypercylinder with the corporeal plane across the whole width at the "bottom", with the spirit. ethereal, magical, ..., planes "above" it and filling the cylinder, except for a "flat" (i.e. 4-dimensional) sliver of space at the side, where the planes are not quite flush with the edge of the universe. This is the space, with no prior structure on it, and outside the influence of the gods or anyone else in the universe proper, which could hold the abyss. ”
According to the webmaster this was the response from the author of Slaves of the Abyss, Paul Mason: That, of course, was what I _meant_ to write, but the starveling wretch who functions as my secretary got it all wrong. That's less unhusked millet for you for the next month, scoundrel! I'll have to tighten his earclamps a bit too. "The above explanation clearly explains how the abyss could be both a place of incarceration or, to the right person, a source of extraordinary power."

This is the second set of ten songs of 2013. We acknowledge the fact that it is difficult to rank the tracks. If the process were repeated sometime next month, some shuffling would certainly occur.
11. "All the Days" by Haerts (Their song "Wings" seems to be getting more attention, but "All the Days" shows the power for their vocals.)
12. "Dreams of Cannibalism" by Typhoon (Seemingly, this is multiple songs in a single song container.)
13. "The Good and the Mean" by TAPE JUNk (Is there a better song from Portugal? And we love the lyric, "I'm anchored on sobriety, but my boat's gonna float away.")
16. "Fire" by Bipolar Sunshine (This song wasn't on an EP until 2013, so it qualifies here - it was available as a single in 2012.)

In a session on advancing technology solutions to make intelligent energy management mainstream, self-confessed ‘techno dummy’ Hogarth will weave together a non-expert’s guide to the ‘Get Smart’ revolution for electricity at All-Energy 2015, taking place October 7th and 8th in Melbourne.
“I am a full throttle techno-optimist, and sadly a policy pessimist, in my belief that we will see technology rather than politicians lead us to a near zero carbon and lower cost energy system within two decades,” says Hogarth, who is Director – Community Energy Networks with Sydney-based digital energy company Wattwatchers.
“The old energy paradigm was big, centrally-located baseload power stations pumping electricity down the line, and grid managers trying to balance supply with demand without much idea of what was going on.”
“That’s the old model and so-called ‘smart meters’ are only a limited improvement. The Internet of Energy is where all of the energy players are talking and responding in useful and coordinated ways, and the Internet of Things is similar but even bigger, covering all devices, machines and databases.”
Not so smart ‘smart-meters’, costly sub-metering and energy monitoring, technical difficulty in achieving device interoperability and general market confusion will be among the challenges discussed by Hogarth that stand in the way of consumer uptake of intelligent energy technologies.
“Real-time, accurate and comprehensive energy generation and consumption monitoring data will become vital for homes with solar PV, especially if they add storage and EV’s,” said Hogarth.
“Better data will allow consumers to control their own energy flows and the most efficient time of use, or have it done for them by automated systems or outside experts. Our focus needs to be on simplifying navigation through the confusing and complex array of technology possibilities to move to a smart system via software based solutions.”
Murray Hogarth will be presenting at New Technology 1: The Internet of Energy at 1.20pm on 7 October alongside Regional Manager Asia Pacific, Energy & Renewables Advisory DNV GL Mathias Steck, Head of Smart Grid Applications APAC Siemens, Merten Foerster and Director of Product Management Enphase Energy Management System Enphase Energy Ilen Zazueta-Hall.

Hello, I am Miss Young. I received the following email. It is a socalled "Advance Fee Fraud" letter, where I am promised millions for my assistance. These stories are all lies, and if I respond, sooner or later I will be asked to pay a fee. If I pay, another fee will quickly come up, and it will continue that way until I give up or run out of money. I will never see the millions, because they never existed.
In response to your mail; I am contacting you concerning our customer and, an investment placed under our banks management 5 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed about this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In 2006, the subject matter; ref: bb/boc/bank/0012 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He (Adelard Raymond) informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35 million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.
I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings.
The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first month of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.
In mid 2007, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm. I informed him that the bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges.
He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in and had the funds available.
I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations.
In line with instructions, the money was deposited. He told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 9th October, 2007.
In January last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.
I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of the bank of china. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently he was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Canne, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed.
The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin.
In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died intestate .
The investigation did not ever yield any result. My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to Bank of China (BOC), failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to BOC. This will result in the money entering the BOC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have my way.
What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. .
About my business proposal of ($8,370,000.00 USD) to you. Please check your spam or junk folder always if you do not find my messages in your inbox. The subjects of the messages are: " INFO ONE & INFO TWO"
I am sorry to encroach into your privacy in this manner. I find it pleasurable to offer you my partnership in business, I only pray at this time that your email address is still valid. I am contacting you because my status would not permit me to do this alone.
I want to solicit your attention to receive money on my behalf. Can I trust you to do business of $8,370,000.00USD?
I will send you the full details and more information about myself and the funds when I receive your reply.
In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died intestate.
There is US$ 8,370,000.00 deposited with the security firm as i said earlier, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so.
I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as Bank of China (BOC) is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward.
This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end.
My proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position to give instruction for the release of the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you. 60% for me and 40% for you. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 60/40.
I would have gone ahead to ask the funds been released to me, but that would draw a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a week. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer. I will then officially communicate with the firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions.
I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you should not be vindictive and be destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career if you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector.
I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once, I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. So let's share the blessings.
If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through my Email. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project.
I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.

If you want your kid to develop up having the very best lifestyle and great recollections childhood, then let them grow up physically powerful and emotionally wholesome. If you fall short to discipline your child, you will see that your hope for them getting the best possible lifestyle will be diminished. You must ask your self these days why you are permitting your child to do certain issues. Is it because you always wanted to do them or is it because you think that your child can make their own choice for themself?
This anime is very fun but I can't enjoy it 100% because Sakamoto looks like too much like Bayonetta.
How come when two females are naked they always start groping each other but males don't do the same?
I'm thinking of dropping the show because this little piece of shit is the most annoying, obnoxious faggot I've seen in a long time.
No, it doesnt mean anything that the author 'wants' him to be disliked, he's flat-out dragging the show down with how much time they waste on his half-assed obsession with becoming STRONGER THAN ANYBODY
If I see another shot of his ugly fucking face up close and his annoying ass bitch shrieks I swear to god.

How can people continue to watch these shitty Shonen/moe/highschool/harem/ or "le quirky violent waifu" shows? I really don't understand, you have to have some kind of mental retardation to get any enjoyment from it.
I just watched a few episodes of Dagashi Kashi and I found it unbearable to watch, with forced references to "otaku culture" every 5 minutes and borderline retarded humor. Currently watching JoJo cuz it's the only worthy anime for me this year.
the only time i hear the song is when they play during a scene in the show or when the ost comes out

The Lovely Bones fills the dubious position of being a film that centres on the act of a child’s brutal murder, directed by Peter Lord of the Rings Jackson. Beloved of fanboys the world over, Jackson is responsible for epic blockbusters such as 2005’s bloated King Kong remake and, of course, his stellar adaptations of Tolkien’s cherished trilogy. Throw in a few lesser known offerings from his back catalogue, such as 1992’s low-budget cult bloodbath Braindead, and Jackson cuts a somewhat flamboyant figure.
While his directing credentials are firmly established, you’d be forgiven for thinking such sensitive material as The Lovely Bones would be safer in the hands of a Fincher or even a Cronenberg, rather than a filmmaker renowned for his devotion to eyeball-juddering visual spectacle.
But you’d be wrong. With Jackson at the helm of this adaptation of Alice Sebold’s bestselling 2002 novel, The Lovely Bones hangs together as a taut psychological thriller that is crammed with accomplished directorial flourishes on both a stylistic and thematic level.
The twist in the tale comes via the fact that it is Suzie s spirit that is narrating the events, as it languishes in the metaphysical limbo inbetween Heaven and Earth. In an inventive nod to literary magic realism, Suzie’s character is fully integrated into the plot while only being physically present for around a quarter of the film itself. Her family’s tortured pursuit of her killer in the years following the murder is paralleled by Suzie’s own attempts to help them from her spiritual plane, and her eventual desire for closure.
One of the movie’s unique stamps of character is the ease with which it slides between violently opposed sensations and ideas. Through the collision of the innocent and the malign, the mundane and the magnificent, The Lovely Bones proves to be an unlikely masterclass in the handling of varied emotional states on screen. The ecstasy of Suzie’s youth and nascent romance with lust object Ray Singh (an unimpressive Reece Ritchie) is interweaved remarkably well with Harvey’s lurking horror as he meticulously plans her slaughter, with Jackson clearly relishing the broad palette of moods at his disposal.
The film’s stunning depiction of the Inbetween provides the best example of this artistry, as the director leads us back into the lush CGI territory that made his name. An overwrought oil painting it may be, but as one divine vista melts into another the visuals are so heart-rendingly gorgeous you can’t help but be impressed.
Back on Earth, the 1970s context of the story provides an ideal platform for a critique of prevalent social and sexual mores. The recurring motif of containment is drawn by ships in bottles, dolls houses, even a hat on a head, bringing the theme of protection and its evil twin control to the surface. A pleasingly bold feminist undercurrent holds Sebold’s influence intact in the body of the film.
In addition to the precocious Ronan, The Lovely Bones is blessed with an excellent cast, with Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weisz and Susan Sarandon all vying for attention even when the movie’s pace lapses in the second half.
Tucci deserves special praise as the abhorrent, flesh-crawling Harvey, bringing real flair to an unexpected role. Instantaneously flipping between disarmingly affable persona and repellent reality, his scenes positively crackle with pitch dark, menacing intensity.
After slumping towards its end, the film’s decisive encounter between Harvey and Suzie’s younger sister Lindsey marks a startling escalation in tension, delivering one of the most emotionally riveting scenes in recent memory. Aside from the breathtaking visuals, if Jackson’s signature rests anywhere in The Lovely Bones it is in these cold sweat, desperately uncomfortable cat-and-mouse moments that pepper the script.
Unfortunately, the movie falters again at its finale, lapsing into a sentimentality it very much resisted previously. However, in spite of a weak ending Jackson’s adaptation is ultimately a compelling blend of abstract romanticism and earthy emotional turmoil, all strung together with a wonderfully deft touch.

I am no Grinch, I love the movie, and love the holidays but often worry about staying healthy through the holidays. Last year a nasty stomach bug managed to catch us and it definitely took away from enjoying family time.
Obviously, some things cannot be helped, but just taking simple steps through the holiday season will result in a stronger immune system and a healthier body overall.
Taking VitC on a daily basis helps keep your immune system strong and healthy. As an antioxidant it also helps neutralize toxins and free radicals, especially working in the stomach to help properly digest potentially carcinogenic foods such as meats high in nitrates (think Christmas ham).
This is the Vitamin C we currently take. It’s non-gmo and contains ascorbates rather than ascorbic acid, we tend to do better with that. Not the best out there I’m sure, but we are happy with it and the price is really good.
A 2010 study suggests that Vitamin D is effective in fighting off the flu. VitD is often called the “Happy Vitamin” since it affects energy levels and boosts one’s mood. It stands to reason that a happier, more energetic person is far less likely to become ill, than one who is tired and lethargic all the time.
Winter offers far less sun than summer does, so take advantage of the sunshine. Sit with bare arms, legs and face in the sunlight streaming in your windows and enjoy a book, or a cup of coffee while soaking up those warm rays.
Drink organic milk and use butter from grass-fed cows as a natural way to increase your VitD intake. A good Vitamin D3 supplement is also important.
However I cannot currently recommend a supplement for VitD. Most VitD supplements are derived from Lanolin (sheep’s wool) and sheep are often sprayed with pesticides before shearing. Thus I’m looking into an organic vegetarian Vit. D3 supplement but have yet to decide which one is best.
If you have researched VitD supplements and believe you have found the best, please share it with me!
Yes, I know that fresh air in the winter is COLD but indoor air is often stale and polluted. Just getting out for 5-10 minutes a day is a great way to fill your system with fresh, clean air and feel refreshed and invigorated!
When the day is warm… -er, like 50 degrees in the middle-of-winter warmer, I will open windows for a few minutes. Yes the house gets chilly but it really helps freshen the air.
If you are in a large gathering of people, go outside for a few minutes of fresh air every hour or so. All those warm bodies mean warmer air and more moisture in that air, making it easy for germs to thrive.
Diffusing oils is another great way to clear the air at home. Especially when it’s been far too cold to get some fresh air inside. YL’s Purification blend is great for this, but I also like the dT On Guard, if you have a favorite, go for it!
Keeping your body hydrated helps flush germs from your system. It especially keeps your mucus membranes hydrated and helps them achieve their full potential of filtering out germs and bacteria.
At a party or gathering, keeping a cup of water in your hands, or nearby helps overcome “the munchies”. Drinking water is far better than overindulging in snacks and sweets.
Avoid processed and quick foods on a daily basis. You cannot avoid what is served at parties or gatherings, and there are always a few Christmas treats to be enjoyed.
While at home you are the one in control of your food, so make sure it’s food the way the Good Lord intended it. How your food was raised, directly impacts the nutrients it delivers to your system. Look for non-gmo sustainably raised foods first, with organic being an option if you can afford it.
Making your own treats to bring to gatherings is also helpful. I made these gingerbread men to take and give to our son who is gluten-free. He will get a treat, but one that won’t make him sick.
All things in moderation, but these two are necessary. I struggle with this a bit because lately blogging can only happen when a very busy toddler is sleeping. Aiming for 8 hours of sleep a night is good as it gives your body an optimal amount of time to “reset”.
I don’t “exercise” not in the traditional way at least! But when you are always moving around, it keeps your blood flowing and the lymphatic system moving like it should. I try to spend at least 75% of my awake time moving around.
But pregnancy fatigue has kicked in and some days it’s easier to just lie down and let the toddler romp all over you. 🙂
Yes, you read that right. With colds and flu running rampant the first thing we want to do is sanitize. But before you grab bleach, lysol or hand sanitizer, consider this:
Certain chemicals in common household cleaners are linked to fertility issues, autoimmune disorders, asthma, allergies, and cancer.
We currently do not know just how many chemicals are out there as hundreds of new ones are created and released each year.
It is my opinion that in the “survival of the fittest” we are creating super bugs and stronger viruses by using chemical like this.
Cleaning without chemicals is something I’ve had to do for years (health issues). I know first hand how hard it is to always get something clean without chemicals.
About 3 weeks ago I learned of “silver cloth”. Silver is a natural antibacterial and antibiotic. We’ve used colloidal silver for years to treat bacterial infections like pink eye, and strep. Now, just NOW I’m learning that silver can also be bound to fibers in clothing (called X-Static) and cleaning cloths!
What I discovered was Norwex, a microfiber cloth WITH silver in it! I was going to try to use words to explain all about it, and then discovered the following video. It’s pretty long, but the first part was so interesting that I’m embedding it below for you to watch. Absolutely incredible!
With just one cloth you can eliminate most chemical cleaners in your home! And think of the $$$ you will save. 🙂
Like the consultant in this video stated, the hostess rewards are pretty awesome, and that’s why I’m hosting a party. I had a few friends over last night that were very excited to learn about this chemical free way of cleaning. Now I’m sharing it with you. 🙂
Visit Norwex.biz to see all the latest products available. Use the site to find a consultant and shop under her, OR… make my day and order through my party! (seriously it would mean a lot to me!)
Thank you so much for helping make my party a success! Consider booking one of your own and discovering the hostess rewards for yourself 🙂
Choose one or two favorite treats and take a small amount. Savor that flavor, enjoy each little bite and make it last. You will find yourself satisfied and full by doing so.
Great tips to keep healthy! When I was in college, I always got sick right after Fall finals and it usually lasted through Christmas. That’s what you get for treating your body badly!
This list is super helpful! It’s so hard to get outside when it’s cold out, but I need to be better about doing that!
I am working on the whole exercise thing and we just recently started making home cleaners with essential oils. Love them!
These are such good tips, which reminds me I should go to be right now ;O). And I recently just received my first order for Norwex. I am excited to see how it performs.
Awesome! I’m so excited to get mine 🙂 If you decide you want more, I’m not closing until the 10th and would love to add another order! hehe 😀

Over the last half century, discourses and practices connected to the idea that violent or dictatorial pasts should be marked as criminal have proliferated. A variety of actors – from victims groups to social movements, to expert groups such as lawyers, museums specialists and even economists – have contributed to the emergence and circulation of the notion that political violence could only be overcome through its criminalization in courts, lustration procedures, history writing, activism or memorial sites. Produced across different fields of action and expertise, this assumption has become dominant in the political and judicial sphere at a global level and has permeated many political cultures and everyday life practices. Even where decriminalisation (amnesties, pardons, closure of archives) prevailed, debates worked within the set of assumptions about the past established through this globally expanding paradigm.
Despite its dominance, we still lack a truly international history of its roots. This is in part because modern day practices of criminalisation often play down their own historicity. Coming of age at the so-called ‘end of history’, their promoters came to see their application as a natural end point in the achievement of human rights, democracy or good governance. When histories are offered, they too often provide a rather linear narrative that links these developments to – mainly Western – political processes established to address the legacies of Nazism after World War Two. Such accounts have also commonly resisted incorporation into broader frameworks supplied, for example, by histories of globalization, neoliberalism or postcolonialism. Only recently have a few authors sought to make sense of the emergence of the modern criminalisation paradigm in new ways, connecting it, for example, to the rise of the homo economicus and a concomitant individualistic approach to human rights.
This conference seeks to explore the history of the (often forgotten) pathways and contested visions through which the criminalization paradigm developed. This conference welcomes contributions that explore the emergence of multiple, potentially competitive visions of criminal pasts. Taking as its starting point the moment of an acceleration of decolonisation, globalisation and de-Stalinisation in the 1950s, we encourage papers that explore the variety of actors, activisms and political projects that lay behind the global expansion of such ideas. Human rights organisations, international legal associations, post-colonial and Communist states, all variously developed the idea of overcoming criminal pasts as they sought, to legitimate new political projects, reconceptualise the relationship between the individual and the state, or seek collective or socio-economic justice for past wrongs. We welcome papers that, for example, address the complexity and interplay of these ideas in different arenas and seek to connect these phenomena to wider literatures. We are also wary of easy teleologies, and are as interested in the histories of the marginalization of some visions, as in the growing dominance of others.
Historicisation. How did processes of criminalisation/decriminalisation of fascism, authoritarianism, colonialism, communism, and other violent historical episodes evolve over time? What were their political/ideological roots and consequences, and how did they influence each other? Which particular paradigms of criminalisation were internationalised or globalised from the 1950s? What turning points can we identify in the shift of these paradigms at international and regional levels (e.g. decolonisation in the 1960s, the end of Cold War)?
Rethinking Paradigms. Are there new historical frameworks into which the history of criminalising violent pasts could be written? The history of neoliberalism? Or postcolonialism? Should it bring together traditions of scholarship, which have often remained separate? (e.g. postcolonialism and communism; histories of the ‘semi-periphery’ with those from ‘the West’).
Rethinking ‘Third Wave Criminalisation’ (1980s-). How might these multiple histories help us understand the values and practices of ‘third wave criminalisation’ in new ways? Which groups and alliances helped produce this? Were alternative visions of historical culpability marginalised, or did they survive? Does such a historicisation enable us more fully to appreciate the variety of visions and practices that constitute this recent criminalisation paradigm?
Rethinking Actors. How did states, social movements, peace keepers, or experts produce ideas about what should be criminalised and in which ways? How did actors generally unrecognised – such as socialist and other authoritarian states, or professional groups such as economists –produce and globalise new paradigms? Do we over-privilege the role of western actors in this account? How do relevant actors change over time? (e.g. from states to non-state actors including private individuals and companies)?
Rethinking Chronologies. How did the meanings, relevance and objects of criminalisation shift over time? How were specific crimes selected as subject to criminalisation at particular moments, which were sidelined, and why? How are the processes of criminalisation linked to processes of politicization or de-politicisation of past conflicts and violence? Was there a move from collective/ systemic criminalisation to one based around the idea of individual crime and responsibility?

Looked around your city on October 10, 2017? There's a good chance you might have seen someone from the McCann Worldgroup agencies in MENA, roaming the streets asking people questions (with their consent, of course) about their shopping habits and local cultures.
On October 10, 2017, for Truth About Street, a global research initiative by McCann Worldgroup, roughly 20,000 employees, in 100+ countries worldwide, left their desks and headed to the streets. In teams of five, they met people, across a cross-section of society, on the streets, and through face-to-face conversations (following a defined guide), they collected truths about culture, shopping behaviour and topical sentiments. All learnings will feed the next wave of McCann Worldgroup’s Truth About Global Brands.
In MENA, over 300 employees hit the streets across 10 countries. It was a historic, first-ever, global local truth hunt in MENA and across the world.
FP7/MENA’s CEO, Tarek Miknas, says, “As the voice of the MENA region, we’re constantly focused on knowing our part of the world better than others. And we take pride in our global network for doing the exact same thing across the world. Knowing our region and its people, better than others, enables us to remain at the forefront of our industry when it comes to work that makes a meaningful difference for our brands.”
Beyond being a proprietary study, unlike anything done by any company in MENA or for that matter anywhere in the world, Truth About Street is an intelligence program involving employees across disciplines (strategy, business management, creative, technology, finance, admin, HR), in mining all that embodies the essence of each city and its people.
Tarek adds, “What’s fantastic is that our entire employee base from countries across MENA (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Lebanon, Turkey, Bahrain) has participated. Truth About Street is enabling every employee to understand behaviours, anxieties and trends on the streets, in the real world, and it’s helping them apply these insights to impact our client’s brands and businesses, along with contributing to a very switched-on and curious agency culture.”
Tahaab Rais, Regional Head of Strategic Planning and MENA Director – Truth Central, FP7/MENA, notes: “With Truth About Street, we are engineering ourselves to do what all of us should always do by default - consciously and constantly hear people. Uncovering their unbridled hopes, joys, perspectives, aspirations, needs and anxieties. And developing creative products, content and experiences around them; instead of simply pushing content and campaigns, based on generic insights in our briefs, that we’ve conjured up sitting at our desks, looking at just desktop research.”
The agency has heard its people talk about how when we observe the city like a tourist, the city and its people seem much more interesting. One team in Dubai met a tourist from Saudi Arabia, whom they hesitated contacting, but upon approaching him, they uncovered their most favourite and most insightful conversation; he even treated them to coffee and refreshments!
Tahaab adds, “To learn the truth about street, I went off it for a couple of hours, taking eight Abra rides in Dubai and having more insightful conversations in those two hours than I’ve had over days with focus groups.” The program stands as proof of the unprecedented connectivity of McCann Worldgroup globally and in MENA. It’s helping the agency be more in sync with people in the real world, which is key to enabling creation of more meaningful work in this constantly evolving world. And have a whole lot of fun and create new friendships while at it!
Launched in 1986, ArabAd is the first and oldest advertising and communications magazine catering to the MENA region.
Distinguished in its coverage of advertising, marketing, branding and everything in-between, ArabAd maintains a watchful eye on the pulse of this industry to bring the latest and greatest from the communication world.

Do you have a grip on your business, or does your business have a grip on you? All entrepreneurs and business leaders face similar frustrations—personnel conflict, profit woes, and inadequate growth. Decisions never seem to get made, or, once made, fail to be properly implemented. But there is a solution. It’s not complicated or theoretical. Based on years of real-world implementation in more than 100 companies, the Entrepreneurial Operating System® is a practical method for achieving the business success you have always envisioned. In Traction, you’ll learn the secrets of strengthening the six key components of your business. You’ll discover simple yet powerful ways to run your company that will give you and your leadership team more focus, more growth, and more enjoyment. Successful companies are applying Traction every day to run profitable, frustration-free businesses—and you can too. For an illustrative, real-world lesson on how to apply Traction to your business, check out its companion book, Get A Grip.
Shows entrepreneurs and business leaders how to gain control of their companies with the Entrepreneurial Operating System, a system based on years of real-world implementation in more than one hundred companies. Offers specific advice, examples, and illustrations on how to strengthen the Six Key Components of a business for greater focus, growth, and enjoyment.
You’re a Visionary. That’s the problem. You’ve already founded a successful business and have clear ideas for the future of your company. This has worked for you so far, but now business has stalled, and you’ve become overwhelmed, stuck, and frustrated. You may have a hunch that something or someone is missing – and you’re right. A great Visionary is only half of the equation for launching a company toward success. A solid partnership is the key to helping your business soar, and you need someone else to play a crucial role in taking your business to its maximum level. Enter the Integrator. This is the Visionary’s complement who has a talent for moving ideas forward: keeping varying tasks and schedules aligned, creating focus and accountability, and ensuring cohesion of people and processes. In other words, the Integrator takes a vision and executes it. From the author of the bestselling Traction, Rocket Fuel details the integral roles of the Visionary and Integrator and explains how an effective relationship between the two can thrive, and even offers advice to help Visionary-minded and Integrator-minded individuals find one another. Rocket Fuel also offers assessments so you’re able to determine whether you’re a Visionary or an Integrator so you can recognize your needs and then find the best partner to suit them. Without an Integrator, a Visionary is far less likely to succeed long-term ,and realize the company’s ultimate goals—likewise, with no Visionary, an Integrator can’t rise to his or her full potential. When these two people come together to share their natural talents and innate skill sets, they have the power to reach new heights for virtually any company or organization. Rocket Fuel is here. Time to ignite the booster for your next level. This explosive combination is the key to getting everything you want out of your business. It worked for Disney. It worked for McDonald’s. It worked for Ford. It can work for you.
Most startups don’t fail because they can’t build a product. Most startups fail because they can’t get traction. Startup advice tends to be a lot of platitudes repackaged with new buzzwords, but Traction is something else entirely. As Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares learned from their own experiences, building a successful company is hard. For every startup that grows to the point where it can go public or be profitably acquired, hundreds of others sputter and die. Smart entrepreneurs know that the key to success isn’t the originality of your offering, the brilliance of your team, or how much money you raise. It’s how consistently you can grow and acquire new customers (or, for a free service, users). That’s called traction, and it makes everything else easier—fund-raising, hiring, press, partnerships, acquisitions. Talk is cheap, but traction is hard evidence that you’re on the right path. Traction will teach you the nineteen channels you can use to build a customer base, and how to pick the right ones for your business. It draws on inter-views with more than forty successful founders, including Jimmy Wales (Wikipedia), Alexis Ohanian (reddit), Paul English (Kayak), and Dharmesh Shah (HubSpot). You’ll learn, for example, how to: ·Find and use offline ads and other channels your competitors probably aren’t using ·Get targeted media coverage that will help you reach more customers ·Boost the effectiveness of your email marketing campaigns by automating staggered sets of prompts and updates ·Improve your search engine rankings and advertising through online tools and research Weinberg and Mares know that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution; every startup faces unique challenges and will benefit from a blend of these nineteen traction channels. They offer a three-step framework (called Bullseye) to figure out which ones will work best for your business. But no matter how you apply them, the lessons and examples in Traction will help you create and sustain the growth your business desperately needs. From the Hardcover edition.

"I raced through RADICAL CANDOR--It’s thrilling to learn a framework that shows how to be both a better boss and a better colleague. RADICAL CANDOR is packed with illuminating truths, insightful advice, and practical suggestions, all illustrated with engaging (and often funny) stories from Kim Scott’s own experiences at places like Apple, Google, and various start-ups. Indispensable."--Gretchen Rubin author of NYT bestseller THE HAPPINESS PROJECT "Reading Radical Candor will help you build, lead, and inspire teams to do the best work of their lives. Kim Scott's insights--based on her experience, keen observational intelligence and analysis--will help you be a better leader and create a more effective organization."--Sheryl Sandberg author of the NYT bestseller LEAN IN "Kim Scott has a well-earned reputation as a kick-ass boss and a voice that CEOs take seriously. In this remarkable book, she draws on her extensive experience to provide clear and honest guidance on the fundamentals of leading others: how to give (and receive) feedback, how to make smart decisions, how to keep moving forward, and much more. If you manage people?whether it be 1 person or a 1,000--you need RADICAL CANDOR. Now."--Daniel Pink author of NYT bestseller DRIVE From the time we learn to speak, we’re told that if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all. When you become a manager, it’s your job to say it--and your obligation. Author Kim Scott was an executive at Google and then at Apple, where she developed a class on how to be a good boss. She has earned growing fame in recent years with her vital new approach to effective management, Radical Candor. Radical Candor is a simple idea: to be a good boss, you have to Care Personally at the same time that you Challenge Directly. When you challenge without caring it’s obnoxious aggression; when you care without challenging it’s ruinous empathy. When you do neither it’s manipulative insincerity. This simple framework can help you build better relationships at work, and fulfill your three key responsibilities as a leader: creating a culture of feedback (praise and criticism), building a cohesive team, and achieving results you’re all proud of. Radical Candor offers a guide to those bewildered or exhausted by management, written for bosses and those who manage bosses. Taken from years of the author’s experience, and distilled clearly giving actionable lessons to the reader; it shows managers how to be successful while retaining their humanity, finding meaning in their job, and creating an environment where people both love their work and their colleagues.
The U.S. dollar's dominance seems under threat. The near collapse of the U.S. financial system in 2008–2009, political paralysis that has blocked effective policymaking, and emerging competitors such as the Chinese renminbi have heightened speculation about the dollar’s looming displacement as the main reserve currency. Yet, as The Dollar Trap powerfully argues, the financial crisis, a dysfunctional international monetary system, and U.S. policies have paradoxically strengthened the dollar’s importance. Eswar Prasad examines how the dollar came to have a central role in the world economy and demonstrates that it will remain the cornerstone of global finance for the foreseeable future. Marshaling a range of arguments and data, and drawing on the latest research, Prasad shows why it will be difficult to dislodge the dollar-centric system. With vast amounts of foreign financial capital locked up in dollar assets, including U.S. government securities, other countries now have a strong incentive to prevent a dollar crash. Prasad takes the reader through key contemporary issues in international finance—including the growing economic influence of emerging markets, the currency wars, the complexities of the China-U.S. relationship, and the role of institutions like the International Monetary Fund—and offers new ideas for fixing the flawed monetary system. Readers are also given a rare look into some of the intrigue and backdoor scheming in the corridors of international finance. The Dollar Trap offers a panoramic analysis of the fragile state of global finance and makes a compelling case that, despite all its flaws, the dollar will remain the ultimate safe-haven currency.
What are the underlying handful of fundamentals that haven't changed for over a hundred years? From Harnish's famous "Mastering a One Page Strategic Plan" process that has been a best-selling article on the web to his concise outline of eight practical actions you can take to strengthen your culture, this book is a compilation of best practices adapted from some of the best-run firms on the planet. Included is an instructive chapter co-authored by Rich Russakoff, revealing winning tactics to get banks to finance your business. Lastly, there are case studies demonstrating the validity of Harnish's practical approaches.
The author shares a series of tests along with insights from entrepreneurs on how to investigate the viability of a new business idea before trying to launch the business.
It's been over a decade since Verne Harnish's best-selling book Mastering the Rockefeller Habits was first released. Scaling Up: How a Few Companies Make It...and Why the Rest Don't is the first major revision of this business classic. In Scaling Up, Harnish and his team share practical tools and techniques for building an industry-dominating business. These approaches have been honed from over three decades of advising tens of thousands of CEOs and executives and helping them navigate the increasing complexities (and weight) that come with scaling up a venture. This book is written so everyone -- from frontline employees to senior executives -- can get aligned in contributing to the growth of a firm. There's no reason to do it alone, yet many top leaders feel like they are the ones dragging the rest of the organization up the S-curve of growth. The goal of this book is to help you turn what feels like an anchor into wind at your back -- creating a company where the team is engaged; the customers are doing your marketing; and everyone is making money. To accomplish this, Scaling Up focuses on the four major decision areas every company must get right: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash. The book includes a series of new one-page tools including the updated One-Page Strategic Plan and the Rockefeller Habits ChecklistTM, which more than 40,000 firms around the globe have used to scale their companies successfully -- many to $1 billion and beyond.Running a business is ultimately about freedom. Scaling Up shows business leaders how to get their organizations moving in sync to create something significant and enjoy the ride.
The definitive playbook by the pioneers of Growth Hacking, one of the hottest business methodologies in Silicon Valley and beyond. It seems hard to believe today, but there was a time when Airbnb was the best-kept secret of travel hackers and couch surfers, Pinterest was a niche web site frequented only by bakers and crafters, LinkedIn was an exclusive network for C-suite executives and top-level recruiters, Facebook was MySpace’s sorry step-brother, and Uber was a scrappy upstart that didn’t stand a chance against the Goliath that was New York City Yellow Cabs. So how did these companies grow from these humble beginnings into the powerhouses they are today? Contrary to popular belief, they didn’t explode to massive worldwide popularity simply by building a great product then crossing their fingers and hoping it would catch on. There was a studied, carefully implemented methodology behind these companies’ extraordinary rise. That methodology is called Growth Hacking, and it’s practitioners include not just today’s hottest start-ups, but also companies like IBM, Walmart, and Microsoft as well as the millions of entrepreneurs, marketers, managers and executives who make up the community of Growth Hackers. Think of the Growth Hacking methodology as doing for market-share growth what Lean Start-Up did for product development, and Scrum did for productivity. It involves cross-functional teams and rapid-tempo testing and iteration that focuses customers: attaining them, retaining them, engaging them, and motivating them to come back and buy more. An accessible and practical toolkit that teams and companies in all industries can use to increase their customer base and market share, this book walks readers through the process of creating and executing their own custom-made growth hacking strategy. It is a must read for any marketer, entrepreneur, innovator or manger looking to replace wasteful big bets and "spaghetti-on-the-wall" approaches with more consistent, replicable, cost-effective, and data-driven results.
Based on in-depth interviews with more than 200 leading entrepreneurs, a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business identifies the six essential disciplines needed to transform your ideas into real-world successes. Each of us has the capacity to spot opportunities, invent products, and build businesses—even $100 million businesses. How do some people turn ideas into enterprises that endure? Why do some people succeed when so many others fail? The Creator’s Code unlocks the six essential skills that turn small notions into big companies. This landmark book is based on 200 interviews with today’s leading entrepreneurs including the founders of LinkedIn, Chipotle, eBay, Under Armour, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, Spanx, Airbnb, PayPal, Jetblue, Gilt Groupe, Theranos, and Dropbox. Over the course of five years, Amy Wilkinson conducted rigorous interviews and analyzed research across many different fields. From the creators of the companies ranging from Yelp to Chobani to Zipcar, she found that entrepreneurial success works in much the same way. Creators are not born with an innate ability to conceive and build $100 million enterprises. They work at it. They all share fundamental skills that can be learned, practiced, and passed on. The Creator’s Code reveals six skills that make creators of all kinds of endeavors breakthrough. These skills aren’t rare gifts or slim chance talents. Entrepreneurship, Wilkinson demonstrates, is accessible to everyone.

Kaizen is a Japanese word that means "change for the better," as popularized by Masaaki Imai in his 1986 book Kaizen: The Key to Japan’s Competitive Success and through the books of Norman Bodek, both of whom contributed introductory material for this book. Winner of a 2013 Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award! In 1989, Dr. Donald M. Berwick, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, endorsed the principles of Kaizen in the New England Journal of Medicine, describing it as "the continuous search for opportunities for all processes to get better." This book shows how to make this goal a reality. Healthcare Kaizen shares some of the methods used by numerous hospitals around the world, including Franciscan St. Francis Health, where co-author Joe Swartz has led these efforts. Most importantly, the book covers the management mindsets and philosophies required to make Kaizen work effectively in a hospital department or as an organization-wide program. All of the examples in the book were shared by leading healthcare organizations, with over 200 full-color pictures and visual illustrations of Kaizen-based improvements that were initiated by nurses, physicians, housekeepers, senior executives and other staff members at all levels. Healthcare Kaizen will be helpful for organizations that have embraced weeklong improvement events, but now want to follow the lead of ThedaCare, Virginia Mason Medical Center, and others who have moved beyond just doing events into a more complete management system based on Lean or the Toyota Production System. It’s often said, without much reflection, that people hate change. The experiences shared in this book prove that people actually love change when they are fully engaged in the process, get to make improvements that improve patient care and make their day less frustrating, and when they don’t fear being laid off as a result of their improvements. Mark Graban explains why his new book Healthcare Kaizen is a great resource for healthcare organizations looking to make improvements on the frontlines.(www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4JdaH03Dbo&feature=youtu.be) Check out a recent entry about this book on the Virginia Mason Medical Center Blog, Could this new book help drive your Lean journey?

Bring Your Human to Work: 10 Surefire Ways to Design a Workplace That Is Good for People, Great for Business, and Just Might Change the World
The secret to business success? Get REAL and be HUMAN! As human beings, we are built to connect and form relationships. So, it should be no surprise that relationships must also translate into the workplace, where we spend most of our time! Companies that recognize this will retain the most productive, creative, and loyal employees, and invariably seize the competitive edge. The most successful leaders are those who actively form quality relationships with their employees, who honor fundamental human qualities—authenticity, openness, and basic politeness—and apply them day in and day out. Paying attention and genuinely caring about the effects people have on one another other is key to developing a winning culture where people perform at the top of their game and want to work. As a workplace strategist and business coach, Erica Keswin has spent over 20 years working with top business leaders and executives to build successful organizations that honor relationships. Featuring case studies from top brands such as, Lyft, Starbucks, Mogul, and SoulCycle, to name a few, Bring Your Human to Work distills the key practices of the most human companies into applicable advice that any business leader can use to build a “human workplace.” These building blocks include: •Understanding your company’s role in the world, beyond financial profit •Encouraging employees to be healthy in body and spirit •Running your meetings with clear purpose •Making space for face-to-face interaction •Building professional development into company culture •Inspiring your workforce to give back to the community •Simply saying “thank you” A human company is real, genuine, aligned, and true to itself. A real company flaunts its humanity, instead of hiding it. It’s what the most successful, sustainable companies are doing today, and there’s no reason yours can’t be the same. Keswin’s leadership lessons foster fairness, devotion, and joy in the workplace—all critical elements of a successful business. By bringing your human to work, you can design a workplace that is good for people, great for business, and just might change the world.
Physician and popular New York Times Upshot contributor Aaron Carroll mines the latest evidence to show that many “bad” ingredients actually aren’t unhealthy, and in some cases are essential to our well-being. Advice about food can be confusing. There's usually only one thing experts can agree on: some ingredients—often the most enjoyable ones—are bad for you, full stop. But as Aaron Carroll explains, these oversimplifications are both wrong and dangerous: if we stop consuming some of our most demonized ingredients altogether, it may actually hurt us. In The Bad Food Bible, Carroll examines the scientific evidence, showing among other things that you can: ·Eat red meat several times a week: The health effects are negligible for most people, and actually positive if you're 65 or older. ·Have a drink or two a day: As long as it's in moderation, it will protect you against cardiovascular disease without much risk. ·Enjoy a gluten-loaded bagel from time to time: It has less fat and sugar, fewer calories, and more fiber than a gluten-free one. ·Eat more salt: If your blood pressure is normal, you should be more worried about getting too little sodium than having too much. Full of counterintuitive lessons about food we hate to love, The Bad Food Bible is for anyone who wants to forge eating habits that are sensible, sustainable, and occasionally indulgent.

Toshiba’s new generation Super Digital Inverter (SDI) is A+++ rated for light-commercial air conditioning. With low global warming potential R32 refrigerant, the Japanese manufactured unit features a totally new chassis design with new high efficiency heat exchanger and highly efficient DC fan motor. These enhancements combine with Toshiba’s advanced DC twin-rotary compressor and vector-controlled inverter technology to offer premium levels of efficiency and comfort anytime from -27 °C to +52 °C outdoor temperature. With industry leading SEER & SCOP and an impressive return on investment, the new SDI is available in 1ph configuration in 5.0 – 6.7 – 10.0 and 12.0 kW, capacity ratings. The unit is easily adapted to a wide range of installations and is complemented with a new 4-Way Smart Cassette indoor unit and a new remote controller that when used together offer innovative features including energy monitoring.
Toshiba’s SDI is the new premium flagship model for small shops, offices and restaurants that builds upon previous generation outdoor units, raising the bar with industry leading SEER ratings up to 9.40 and SCOP to 5.51 for the 3 HP unit. To achieve this high level of efficiency Toshiba is using the latest generation inverter to precisely control every parameter and provide smooth regulation in any conditions without waste of energy. Also contributing to the high system efficiency, standby power consumption has been reduced by 50%. With the ability to operate down to a 10% load, users can expect important savings in milder mid-seasons where full capacity heating or cooling is not required. Toshiba estimates that full-load air-conditioning is required only for 5% of all operational time, whereas part-load use is by-far more prevalent. Furthermore with no energy-depleting on/off switching as well as efficient, smooth and precise heating or cooling at moderate fan speeds, the SDI consumes much less energy - for an overall ROI which far outstrips lower priced and energy wasteful alternatives.
Toshiba has successfully manufactured R32 refrigerant systems in Japan since 2014. This means a proven technology for the new outdoor unit. With similar operational, safety and equipment requirements as R410A but with up to 14% reduction in refrigerant charge, the SDI offers a 70% reduction in equivalent CO2 emissions. Thanks to the considerably lowered GWP, the environmentally oriented outdoor unit provides a significantly improved offer for the customer and a zero change commissioning effort for the installer. The SDI can be equally used for new installations or as part of energy efficient and eco-friendly upgrades, or complete cost-effective replacements for old and outdated air conditioning systems (old R22, R407C, and R410A pipes can be reused). For maximum installation flexibility the indoor units are compatible with R32 as well as R410A refrigerant.
The scope and flexibility for installation is also made more straightforward with the SDI’s ability for single- or twin-split configuration with indoor 4-way cassettes ceiling, high wall,, slim duct & concealed ducts. With a generous pipe length of 75 metres and installed height up to 30 metres, the SDI truly adapts to all types of project demands for optimal air-to-air circulation efficiency.
Toshiba has also launched its new 4-Way Smart Cassette that harnesses the advanced features of the SDI and offers improved operation, plus increased efficiency and comfort that will greatly benefit commercial and retail installations. Its many new design features include an efficiency-optimised DC fan motor, enlarged vents with a new flap shape and an improved heat exchanger design that all contribute to the market leading SEER and SCOP ratings with the SDI.
With four models that match the SDI, heating capacity is up to 14 kW and cooling capability to 12.5 kW for the largest unit (in combination with 5 HP SDI outside unit). The heat exchanger module features a ‘magic coil’ which prevents dirt and oil adhering to its surface, and a self-clean operation inhibits dust and mould accumulation over time. The cassettes’ flat design and elegant appearance will complement any decorative style. Individual and directional louvre control plus an optional occupancy sensor help to optimise air diffusion and cut wasteful energy usage.
The new remote controller for the SDI has been updated for optimal use enabling installers and users to realise enhanced performance levels, minimise energy wastage and monitor system reliability. As well as flexible date, time and comfort settings in multiple languages, the controller also has the capability to track and compare energy consumption day by day or months by months and reports a first-level predictive maintenance function for leak detection.
RAMALLAH, West Bank: From corner fruit stalls in Hebron to chic Ramallah ballet studios, Palestinian women are making their mark in business, some out of necessity and others looking to break the gender mould and pursue a dream.
For Shyrine Ziadeh, a 24-year-old Birzeit University graduate, that dream was to open a dance studio.
Now the proud owner of the Ramallah Ballet Center, the first in the West Bank, her sunny, top-floor studio is flooded with classical music and mirrors stretching from wall to wall. Little girls plie in pink ballet shoes and jump over fairy wings.
"I want to develop girls," she said. "Ballet helps develop their point of view in life. We need such things in Palestine."
Latest statistics from the International Labor Organization estimated that in 2008-2009, women headed just 5 percent of West Bank firms. Circumstantial evidence suggests the figure has climbed since then, fueled by economic growth and an increasing appetite for bank lending.
However, the deeply traditional, male-dominated society that is prevalent across much of the Arab world, coupled with bureaucratic restraints unique to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, pose particular challenges for women seeking to get ahead.
"Many women in the West Bank want to do things, but they can't. Our culture is generally more of a man's culture. Women are trying to do things, but in small steps," said Ziadeh.
Restrictions from Israel, which controls all entry points to the West Bank, only add to the problems, she said.
"Because of the occupation, we need a permit to do anything," she said, pointing to the difficulty of importing leotards and other ballet garb not available in the West Bank, for example.
Although the odds are not in their favour, the outlook for women is improving in the cities, if not yet in the poorer, hidebound v i llages that dot the arid territory.
Women's literacy and employment rates are rising. Female police units are integrating into West Bank forces, and women make up a quarter of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's cabinet.
Looking to spread the good word, NISAA FM radio station took to the airwaves in 2010, set up by and for women. It highlights local success stories about anything from female-led investment groups to refugee camp microfinance projects.
"We need awareness about being a businesswoman," said Maysoun Odeh Gangat, the founder and CEO of NISAA FM, which already ranks as one of Ramallah's top five radio stations.
Ramallah also now has a Ladies Cafe - a women-only establishment set up earlier this year by 21-year-old Balsam Qadoura and seven other partners.
Studying English at Birzeit University, many of Qadoura's female friends plan on pursuing business after graduating. But she said her plans couldn't wait.
The brightly coloured cafe, on Ramallah's main highstreet, provides a relaxed place for women to meet, smoke waterpipes and listen to blaring Middle East music.
Some locals have questioned whether a cafe just for women represents a step back in the struggle for equality, but Qadoura argues that women needed their own space to help counter the male-domination seen in many of the city's other such establishments.
"The men act like we are not human beings. They say 'what are you doing here, it's not your place'," she said.
Palestinian women's participation in the workforce has gradually risen over the past two decades, lifted in the mid-1990s thanks to an economic boom after the Palestinians won limited self-rule and foreign donor cash started to pour in.
In 1995, women made up some 11.5 percent of the workforce, a figure that has risen to 16.7 percent, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.
However, this number is low compared to the World Bank's 26 percent average for the Middle East and North Africa, and the labour distribution is highly uneven, with women in many areas of the Palestinian Territories still out of the market.
In the Gaza Strip, a woman made headlines in May simply because she was a waitress in the coastal enclave, which is ruled by the Islamist group Hamas and where patriarchal resistance to women working outside the home still prevails.
"A high percentage of people have no contribution to the national economy," said Salah Abu Eisheh, the West Bank and Gaza r e presentative for the Near East Foundation, a non-governmental organisation promoting women's empowerment through business.
"We are in good shape, but still far from having real equality," he said, adding that many men feared that women's empowerment gave women unfair advantages.
He hoped rising levels of female students at Palestinian universities, who represent more than 50 percent of the student population, would help push more women into business.
Yet, the statistics bureau estimates that nearly half of all women with a higher education remain unemployed.
Huda al-Jack, owner and managing partner of the West Bank's first coffee chain, Zman cafe, blames a culture where men do deals with each other in a social context that tends to exclude women.
"It was difficult for me to integrate," said al-Jack, who is of Sudanese-Palestinian descent and who moved to Ramallah from California in 2003.
"I had to really prove myself. I started out making 30 percent of what I was making in the States." Only after working her way up the ladder, and helping launch a company in Dubai, did al-Jack get taken seriously, she said.
"Sometimes I feel like we're going backwards," she said, adding that society's refusal to address sexual harassment in the workplace continues to limit women.
Al-Jack hopes to develop a gender-blind business community and is currently planning another establishment where a Palestinian woman will serve customers.
Emerging female business leaders are following in the wake of al-Jack's success. Ziadeh, her dance studio only recently opened, sees the role of businesswomen as essential if a future, independent Palestinian state is to be a success.
"People will accept that women can handle it, that women are changing," she said. "I want the world to know that we Palestinians can do it. We can grow."

Archery is a pastime activity, an art form, and a beach lifestyle. Archery has been designed and influenced by many archers throughout the years.

”Archery Lessons has given me more than I expected, because I expected somebody to say “Okay here, do this, do that, go home, and come back next week,” but the follow up that he has given, and the effort of sending me the lessons, and the encouragement… He’s very subtle about it but he’s so positive, so he has surpassed my expectations.”

The Sabillasville Boot Camp session are back-to-back days designed with your schedule in mind. Please call us for more information
In December 1843, Charles Dickens did a hell of a thing. The son of a debtor, Dickens found himself drowning in debt as well and penned a Victorian morality tale in a desperate attempt to ease his financial burdens. The story we have come to know as A Christmas Carol was written in the span of six weeks. No publisher would touch it and so Dickens published it himself. The book was ready just before the holiday that it celebrated and all 6,000 copies sold out in the span of a week. It became a holiday institution immediately, its popularity serving to "redefine the importance of Christmas and the major sentiments associated with the holiday," according to wikipedia.
Dickens' hero, Ebenezer Scrooge, had lost all use for the human endowments of charity, community, friendship and love. In fact, he demonstrated contempt for anything but money -- a pose that has been greatly admired in our own culture until rec ... well, we have at least sought comfort in epithets like conspicuous consumption and luxury tax. The analogy brings up some uncomfortable comparisons to go with our holiday cheer.
With our ability to supply basic necessities at a zenith, we strain for meaning and stimulation, indebting ourselves to buy things for a holiday we swear is not about material objects. We accept gross inadequacies in national and local healthcare, energy use and environmental degradation; the plight of those beyond our borders reduced to fables. If the ghost of Jacob Marley returned tonight, what bleak landscape would he threaten us with as an eternal post-mortem walking tour? Wait. Don't answer that just yet. Viewing the world through the lens of consumption, we interpret events in the language of commodities. We're perfectly at home with these unimportant distinctions between consumers and citizens (neighbors?) yet the only thing that preoccupies us more at this time of year than Christmas are the moments of consternation at how crass and commercial it has become.
Instead of ghosts, perhaps our dreamscapes are inhabited with the representative elements that first appeared as improvements to daily life, only to become seeds for greed and short-sightedness as they gave rise to our modern society. Christmas Past might feature a child waking sweetly on a long drive with her parents to Grandma's house. She might peer over the big backseat of a large automobile and ask, "Papa, are we there yet?" and he might answer, "Yes, Angel. Thanks to the new Interstate road system we'll be there in another few minutes!"
"If we only knew then what we know now," we might say. But what would we do differently? If we could revisit critical junctures, would we choose to begin down a more sustainable path?
Christmas Future would surely take place in that green, green landscape of the BP and IBM commercials, where birds chirp and squirrels chase deer and all sorts of other nonsensical pastimes envelope us in open meadows while we pull on rainbow cigars. The future would have to be particularly incoherent and disorienting in order to be sufficiently post-whatever we'll be over by then. To pull this off, the virtual reality rendering might crash into a smoky apocalypse to really get our attention. The idea that what we find would tug at our innocence enough to invoke a specter of regret is both the genius of the Dickensian cliche and wishful thinking. Scrooge was savvy for his day, but we have fourth graders who would have him for lunch.
It's Christmas present that is the problem. How do we see ourselves at this particular juncture? More attention is being paid the loss and destruction of water, minerals, oil, trees, fish, soil and air than ever before. Yet the prices for most raw materials are near historical lows and continue to fall. Supplies are cheap and appear to be abundant as technology continues to stay just ahead of depletion. Richer on a more grand scale than ever before, the resources upon which civilization depends to create economic progress are declining at a rate proportional to the gains in material well-being. We are thriving and yet the quality of our finest moments seems diminished.
Do we admit the disjuncture about the way we live and all it takes to support it? How about the one that really makes a mockery of Wall Street, that the earth is a closed system? Would we be startled by a solution waiting just outside our reach, ready for us to take charge if we might dare?
A Christmas Carol is not known as irreligious text but note the lack of religion in Dickens' tale. We get all exercised about presents but exchanging gifts was the birthright of the pagan holiday, Sol Invictus. Let's give it back -- or better yet, announce where it came from. Notwithstanding the nefarious ploys of being drawn away by the foolish errors of heathendom, do these not both attempt to consecrate the One and True Light?
Ah, the sun. Sol Invictus, the unconquerable sun god, had already made Dec. 25 a holiday; the early Christians were chastised for being unobservant until they begged and borrowed and made the post-solstice feast their own. The Romans were just the next in a long line of people trying to remain in good stead with our main star. Perhaps we would do well to take our place in that procession. The moral hymn of our day is waiting to be written or perhaps we just need to re-read an older one to be reminded that we, too, need to change our ways. Dawn we now?

Boris Vedenskiy have prepared an exclusive review of "smart" column, which covered everything from the unboxing to demonstrate the capabilities of the Assistant.
Google Home got to edition in a beautiful box, but to dwell for too long on the packaging makes no sense. In addition to speakers, chargers and a few pieces of paper, nothing inside.

Susceptometry-based oximetry is a well-established, robust method for quantifying hemoglobin oxygen saturation (HbO2) in vivo; but the method is somewhat limited by the orientation of the vessel of interest relative to Bo. T2-based oximetry, based on the dependence of blood water T2 on HbO2, provides greater flexibility with respect to vessel geometry. However, the measured T2 critically depends on Bo and sequence-specific imaging parameters. Here, a T2-prepared bSSFP sequence and appropriate calibration curve were used to extract HbO2 at the superior sagittal sinus and the results were compared to susceptometry-based oximetry. The agreement between both methods was excellent with 2% bias.
The classical structural parcellation algorithm by Behrens et al1 remains widely used in clinical research, largely thanks to its simplicity and availability in standard MRI processing software. However, its construction and dependency on tractography leads to several biases that can severely affect the conclusions drawn from it, but which are not well known. We illustrate these biases via the original thalamus parcellation experiment on Human Connectome Project (HCP) data3. Based on our experiments, we outline open problems for future structural parcellation algorithms, and possible directions for overcoming them.

About half an hour’s drive south from Pamplona you’ll come across the town of Olite. It’s easy to miss, but you really shouldn’t. It’s a beautiful place with a maze-like mediaeval centre where you can wander around and get lost.
The highlight of Olite is the castle, better known as the Palacio Real or Royal Palace. Allow a good few hours to explore the myriad rooms, courtyards, towers and turrets. You’ll certainly get some incredible views of the surrounding countryside and vineyards. This was the seat of the Court of Navarre until 1512 and it’s not hard to imagine how life was back then as it is was very well restored after a fire in 1937! To get a real feel for the history of the castle, visit during the Mediaeval Fair held in August.
Nearby you will find the Wine and Vine Museum of Navarra. It is located in another former palace in Olite. It is spread over three floors showing off the whole history of wine, the tools the vine growers use, the wine making process and, of course, there is the opportunity for some tasting. The region is perhaps most famous in Spain for its rosé wine but don’t dismiss the reds and whites. Many of them are very good indeed.
Entry costs €3.50 and this ticket covers both the castle and the wine museum. Times change according to the month so check their website, but the castle is generally open every day from 1000-1800 and later in the summer. The wine museum follows similar hours but closes for a couple of hours at 1400. Be aware that it doesn’t reopen on Sunday afternoons. Guess when I tried to visit!

This spring, or mostly the lack of it, has been a prime example of that premise. I saw some skunk cabbage last week that was barely peeking out of some swampy ground. This unique native wildflower sometimes sprouts as early as late February. And I’ve yet to see the yellow blooms of coltsfoot, another early wildflower that often appears by the third week of March.
Like almost everything else this spring, some of the early fly hatches will undoubtedly be arriving somewhat behind schedule. One of the best of those is a species of caddisfly called the grannom, which usually offers some exciting and productive fly-fishing opportunities.
In a normal year, the grannoms typically begin emerging in this area about now, often right in sync with the opening of the regular trout season. Grannoms emerge on many streams throughout this area, but two of the best-known waters for heavy hatches of these insects are the Little Juniata River and Penns Creek. Yellow Creek and the lower stretches of Spring Creek also have good grannom hatches. Once they start emerging, the peak of the grannom activity generally lasts a week or less.
There are several strategies for fishing the grannom hatch. The first is in the morning when the bugs are actually hatching. The peak of the hatching activity usually lasts about an hour or less and occurs from 7 to 9 in the morning, depending somewhat on the prevailing weather conditions. Like most species of caddis, the grannom pupae leave their homes on the stream bottom and rapidly ascend to the water’s surface where they transform into the winged, adult caddisfly. Often, individual insects will flutter about on the surface before finally becoming airborne. All this activity can stir lots of trout to the surface take advantage of all the food being served up to them. An elk-hair caddis with a brownish-gray wing and black body is a good dry-fly imitation for the grannom hatch.
Once they escape the water, the adult grannoms will retreat to streamside bushes and other vegetation to rest and hide. Wind gusts frequently dislodge some of these insects from their perches and onto the water again. Occasionally, a handful of stragglers whose biological clocks are off a few ticks will also hatch here and there throughout the day. These circumstances can sometimes be enough to keep the trout looking up well into the afternoon some days, so prospecting likely trout lies with a grannom dry fly can often be productive during midday when the flies are in abundance.
In late afternoon or early evening, the grannoms leave the bushes for their mating flight, which completes their life cycle. Generally, this activity will occur earlier on overcast days and later on bright days. Swarms of the male and female caddis converge over the stream where they will mate, followed by the females dipping to the water’s surface to lay their eggs. Once their egg-laying is completed, the females die and fall onto the water in great numbers.
Rises during the morning hatch can be splashy or exuberant, because the fish are often forced to dash after the escaping insects. In the evening, the feeding rhythms are much more relaxed with the trout positioning themselves in the various current tongues to leisurely pluck the spent caddis as they drift by. For that reason, it is wise to mark the feeding lie of an individual fish or two and make accurate casts to those locations rather than a shotgun delivery all about the pool.
While most anglers target the early-season dry-fly action that the grannoms can offer, it pays to be aware of other tactics for those times when the trout aren’t readily coming to the surface to feed. Wet flies such as the classic Leadwing Coachman or Gray Hackle Peacock patterns can be deadly during grannom time by letting the fly swing downstream in the current to imitate a caddis pupa swimming to the surface to hatch.
The eighth annual Fly Tiers Reunion will be hosted by Seven Springs Mountain Resort at the resort’s Sporting Clays Lodge located at 777 Waterwheel Drive, Champion, on Friday, April 27 beginning at 6 p.m. The event will showcase some of the country’s finest and internationally known fly tiers who will be demonstrating their fly-tying skills and showcasing their most effective fly patterns.
Headlining the event this year will be Joe Humphreys, Bob and Bobby Clouser, Tom Baltz, Greg Hoover, Ted and Bob Patlin, Scott Loughner, Joe and Jody Messinger, Tim Camissa, Bob Mead, Josh Miller, Randy Buchanan, Greg Heffner, Gordon Chesney, Jack Fields, Chuck Furimsky and Andy, Jocelyn and Stone Fresch.

Having foster parents means they don't know about when you were really little. It means that they established a life and family when the one that was supposed to care for you was falling apart.
Having foster parents means that you have to think before you speak. You have to learn how to behave. You have to know how to take constructive criticism.
Being a kid in a new home is hard. You want to fight back because everything you're used to controlling is gone. Because everything that was out of control is in control...its confusing. Everyone who was big and powerful and caused pain is gone...replaced by people who don't want to cause pain...but WHY?
I'll admit...even at my age I hold out. I won't speak when I am told something. I argue incessantly. I want to be right. I bring up my parents and my family when I want to be right. I want to know the things I used to know and not swim in the difference. I will lie about stupid things...ESPECIALLY feelings.
A week before my 21 birthday, after 20 years of abuse I was adopted into a family. Its nearly been six months now....and when I see the boards I feel torn. I know raising kids isn't easy...but I also feel for the kids because right now I can see why they act the way they do.

But afterwards, some people believed they actually took someone with a Basij car. They said he was on a motorcycle, coming the other way and hiding in a corner. Some people shouted: “We caught him! We caught him!”. People went towards him and they disarmed him and took out his identity card, which was of a Basij member. And he was shouting, – because people were furious – he was shouting: “I didn’t want to kill her! I didn’t want to kill her!”. People just caught him and they didn’t know what to do with him. Some people said: “Don’t harm him! We are not killers like them!”. And… well, I was a few meters away, watching. I was shocked, so I didn’t participate anything.
Hejazi: I was just looking at them, watching, yes. And they said: “We can’t even give him back to the police, because they would just let him go away. So what should we do?”.
Intervistatrice: But they were certain in their own minds that he was from the Basij militia and that he was the one responsible?
Hejazi: Yes, I heard him. He didn’t say “I wasn’t the one who shot her”, I think he was just crying, because he was afraid, “I didn’t want to kill her!”.
So they let him go, because they didn’t know what to do with him; they should have either harmed him or given him back to the police and none of them would work in that situation, and they were afraid to expose themselves to the police. They just let him go and they took his identity cards. I don’t know those people who took his identity cards, but I know that there are people there who know who he is. I noticed that some people were taking photos of him, but I don’t know who they are as well. And then I went back to my office to wash my hands and when I came out people had scattered. And that’s what I have seen.

At once funny and scary, she is Kakanias himself, remind- ing us of the root meaning of "catharsis": a cleansIng, a purging. The houses are lit from within by votive candles, creating an atmosphere of sacramental mystery; the artist has painted the interiors with surprisingly merry scenes of sexual license, infantile aggres- sion, torture, murder, and incontinence.

Metro Government is one step closer to getting a $10 million loan from the Louisville Water Company.
The Board of Water Works voted Tuesday to approve the loan, which will be used to pay a $14 million settlement with a group of retired firefighters who were underpaid for overtime work.
“If we were not doing this loan, we would be investing these reserves in government backed securities and it would actually be a slightly lower rate so this is a good short term use of the funds that will generate some interest income,” he says.
The city used bonds to pay a larger settlement in a similar suit last year. Mayor Greg Fischer says the decision to borrow from the Water Company seems more popular.
“The reaction I’ve received from the citizens has been it’s an example of city agencies cooperating with each other showing common sense in how to deal with a liability that we face as a city,” he says.
The city will repay the Water Company with interest beginning in 2012. The Metro Council must approve the loan, too. They’ll vote on it Thursday. It’s expected to pass.

After watching girls with my dream body type compete in The Fittest Games (Ryan got 6th place over all, by the way!) and spending months years listening to Cole and Ryan talk about snatches, dead lifts and cleans, I finally got over my fear of embarrassing them myself and gave Koda Crossfit a try.
A severe flare up of peroneal tendonitis has caused me to put half marathon training on hold for a while (boooo), but Crossfit seems like the perfect alternative. Girls gotta stay fit, you know. Fist pump, push up, chapstick.
The WOD (work out of the day for all you noobs) was a challenging one. It wore me out more than 13.1 miles ever could but left with with a huge sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
Note: This is where I died. 50 air squats may not sound so bad but I'm here to tell you that it is totally and completely miserable, especially on your first day.
Holy hamstrings, Crossfit. My quads, hammies and traps have never been so sore in my life. That "have to brace yourself while sitting down or you might collapse before you ass hits the chair" kind of sore. I love it. It hurts so good....or maybe I'm just crazy.

Devrimci Anarşist Faaliyet: "The state’s project of eliminating revolutionary opposition hasn’t finished yet"
Reconnaissance par Trump de Jérusalem comme capitale d'Israël : de l'huile sur le feu qui brûle la Palestine
For several years NVIDIA has been building the world's best cloud gaming technology with the ability to stream at a crystal-clear 1080p 60FPS, with low latency. Today, we're announcing GeForce NOW for Mac and PC, a new cloud gaming service that transforms your Mac or PC into a high-performance gaming PC by connecting them to blazing-fast GeForce GTX 1080 gaming PCs hosted in the cloud.
Using our unparalleled cloud gaming technology, and the performance of the world's fastest consumer GPUs, you'll be able to play the latest PC games at exceptional detail levels, with super smooth framerates, for an unrivaled experience that can otherwise only be obtained through a PC system upgrade.
To use GeForce NOW for Mac and PC, simply load the GeForce NOW app and install your favorite Steam, Origin, Uplay, GOG or Battle.net games, that you own, onto your virtual GeForce NOW GeForce GTX 1080 PC. Once loaded, enjoy your games with high-quality visual effects, high framerates, and NVIDIA GameWorks effects courtesy of the cloud-based GeForce GTX 1080 GeForce NOW PCs.
Alternatively, install games that use a dedicated launcher, such as World of Tanks and Warframe, and play with and against other gamers, all via the cloud.
GeForce NOW also makes things easy – all patching, game configuring and driver updating is handled automatically by the GeForce NOW infrastructure. Even save games, achievements and other settings are automatically synchronized with digital game platforms, enabling you to instantly pick up from where you stopped.
I've said this before but I still think the consoles will eventually die off and turn into streaming only services once bandwidth and controller latency issues eventually get improved. Playstation 7 will probably be the equivalent of a roku stick with a controller. That way we'll never have to upgrade a console again. They'll just upgrade their servers that run all the games and there will always be PC quality graphics. And once that becomes a thing all the PC games will turn into streaming only services too. Even tho everyone's PCs could run the games themselves the game companies will become streaming only to stop pirating games once and for all. Sure there will be countries or locations with crap internet still, but by the time Playstation 7 is coming out the wireless networks could be so advanced we could use it's internet connection instead of having any more landlines. Then again I could be predicting something that will never happen like all those people back in the 40s thought we'd have flying cars by now.
With Playstation having it's own streaming service and now Nvidia making it's own service, having to own physical consoles and PCs specifically for gaming might come to an end within our lifetimes.
The downside to the Nvidia service is the cost. I've been seeing the numbers "$25 per 20 hours of gaming" floating around alot. If so, thats a hell of an expense for now.
Until it becomes affordable for everyone and I mean everyone we will never see a full switch to a streaming game service. Not only that but very few people are going to be on board for paying a fee and a rental fee to play a game (people already bitch about paying for things like DLC and this is roughly the same thing and at the end of the day you don't even own the game, just a right to access a server to play a game). I still think the Playstation Now service is a crock of shit since you pay a monthly access fee plus an hourly fee to play a game (with prices being based on game popularity or series name) and won't be caught dead using it (and there are some games I'd really like to play on it).
Secondly hardware will always be a thing no matter what any service says. Consoles might become a thing of the past but PC's won't because, at least with this system, you'll always need some sort of hardware to run it (in this case you need a system running an nVidia card). Honestly it's just another gimmick to try and weasel even more money out of consumers hands (kind of like paying full price for a digital copy of a game (which is absurd)) and this one does it monthly/hourly.
This absolutely won't work if it ends up like movie/TV services are now. Gamers are even less likely to sub to several different services because they have the one game they want to play that's not on the service they have. Plus games can't make money like this while Movies and TV shows make revenue via theaters and sponsors. Like strider said, paying fees on top of fees is a no go for gamers. That's why MMOs don't work on console.
Fiber optic Internet service will have to become the standard for this to be viable, which is probably a decade away from happening.
Its one of those things thats good in concept, but in reality everyone wants a piece of the pie and you'll have too many different services walling off games to under their brand. A whole new era of 3rd party wars would start that would collapse the industry because, while it worked when you paid $600 for both consoles, now you'll pay that in a few months and more on top of it if you want to keep playing all the games you want. Origin and Steam would have their own service, then Amazon, Nvidia, Uplay, Netflix would probably get into it, WB would try to make one probably.... just a bad idea all around. Sure a lot of games would be on all the services, but they would all have exclusives trying to rake in subs.
I've gotten annoyed with managing my digital movie and tv series collection. It didn't bother me before because Netflix had pretty much everything. I'd never have to search for stuff on my hard drives or old dvd-rs because it would all be on Netflix. Now that Netflix has dropped about 50% of their content over the last couple years and will lose significantly more once all of Disney's properties are removed next year I've realized all my old dvds, blu rays and digital movies are all getting more use again. This is were plex comes in.
I setup plex on my main pc, moved a bunch of movies and tv series into some folders and set plex to use those folders. This program auto grabbed all meta data for the content, images, etc and is basically a Netflix clone. I was shocked by how efficient this is. I installed the plex client app on my ps3, ps4 and roku stick and as long as my pc with the plex server is running I can now stream all my content to every tv in the house. It even keeps track of where i left off in a movie and i can resume it on a different device if I want.
So I bought a 4tb hard drive yesterday and I'm going all in on this. I'm going to rip a bunch of my dvds and blu rays (the ones that don't have a digital copy) into mkv files and throw them on that hard drive for my plex. I'll try putting my old anime avi files (with hard coded subs from back in the old download days) in there to to see if plex can play those too. Plex will even organise by genre to so it all works good. And plex is free.
I was thinking about buying a nvidia shield because it can be used as a plex media server instead of just a client like the PlayStation/roku apps but it looks like it has some limitations with file types and my old anime files would definitely not play on it unless i converted every file thru some program called handbrake. I'll look into that some more.
I figured I'd share this in case anyone else was getting annoyed with Netflix and every company making their own Netflix clones. Instead of paying every company a piece of the pie it'll be cheaper in the long run to just make my own Netflix with the content i already own that is already tailored to my preferances. And plex can stream outside of your home in 720p if you go on a road trip. I doubt I'll ever use that feature tho, especially with upload rates being shit with spectrum.
Go to https://www.plex.tv to get the media server and the PlayStation/xbox store/roku/android to download the plex app. I know this topic seems like am advertisement but they're paying me nothing and it's all free downloads anyway. it just works and works great.
To fix low volume in Nvidia Shadowplay recordings, open the game you are going to record, minimize it, right click your audio icon, open volume mixer, scroll to the right until you see NVIDIA Capture Server and the game. Set both to 100 percent and turn your volume up to 100%. Control the volume of your speakers or headphones with an in-line volume control. The PC must have volume set at 100% to record at full volume.
The new PlayStation 4 firmware update will include external HHD support for game installation. Finally. I honestly didn't realize the original PS4s even had USB 3. They are also finally adding custom wallpapers via screenshots. About damn time. The wallpapers in the online store are complete garbage. I'd still prefer to use my own .jpg files like on the PS3, but modders used that feature as a way to hack the system which is why we never got the functionality in PS4. Using a screenshot is completely fine with me.
Am I the only one suffering from steam sale fatigue? Maybe its just me but ever since they changed the store to the design it is now nothing in the store appeals to me anymore. Its probably because of the massive influx of every game from every independent developer. Theres so many games on there that I never look at what new games came out anymore because in any given week 40+ new games were released and 250+ games are listed in their weekly sales. I stopped looking and only pay attention to humble bundle sales now. Even with the steam sale going on now I don't see any huge sale thats leaping out at me to take my money anymore. Sure I still have a backlog of games but there seems to be less and less new AAA or indie games that I'm interested in for PC. Unless its a game I want for console I hardly look at the steam store anymore even though I use steam on a daily basis.

So, I come home from dinner to catch the end of Friday night's A's game. And I wish I hadn't seen it. Turning a 4-2 lead into a 7-4 deficit in the 8th inning just stinks.
And frankly, I was unimpressed with Damian Miller covering the plate in that 8th inning. They teach catchers, “don't reach for the pitch when a runner's stealing.” It's much quicker to let the pitch come to you before trying to throw him out.
If a throw coming in from the outfield is going to beat the runner, shouldn't you just get in the middle of the baseline and totally block the plate? So, why was Miller left diving back to the plate on both Nix' and Young's basehits?
Dave Delluci did make a hell of a slide to beat the tag and score the go-ahead run, but Miller simply should have blocked him off.

As we will already be in London on the Saturday for queens of the Stone Age and Liv for Harry Potter plays then we are just going to meet up after and then join the queue. Lol. Probably around midnight cheaper than a hotel lol. I doubt we will get centre though as fed fans will prob start arriving early saturday! Last year 11ish got us centre on Monday but that wasn’t fed. Anyway maybe Court 1 though lol
Jealous that you are going to see Ginger Josh on Saturday, would have loved to go but couldn't justify the expense as I don't like anyone else on the bill.
I haven't yet received my LTA resale tickets and telephoned to check what is happening. The LTA are dealing with this despatch not AELTC. The LTA say they are posting out Tuesday's (3 July) tickets during this week (they are still sending them out as of today) so I should expect them by Saturday (the timeframe is consistent with the tm email). Hopefully this might be useful information for those waiting.
Received this morning (were mailed yesterday) - near the CC back in section 514 - I gather they have sent out all the first week tix but not the second week.
I like the hives but that’s about it lol. Haven’t seen quotsa since songs for the deaf tour. So didn’t want to miss them, though with foos the weekend before and garbage and incubus in September it’s an expensive gig year.
Murray and some of my other faves being in the opposite half to Fed always improves the tickets you get from queuing. Maybe we will leave the grounds at 5 Monday to get back in lol. Looks like bottom half for my Thursday centre
I'm there on Monday, I'm predicting my oop on centre will be fed, Serena, Stan v Grigor. Back on centre Wednesday- good chance its Del po , Wozniacki and Cilic. Love guessing. Time will tell if I'm right.
Got all my wk1 tickets today that were bought on Monday...... Mon Tues and Sat, already had Wed from public ballot

Imagine if instead of going to your local butcher for your New York strip, you went to a meat lab. The proof of concept is there, and lab grown meat is a reality. And while cultured meat promises many advantages to conventional grown meat, maybe we should take a closer look.
I work in a cell culture lab, and I know first-hand how expensive it is to keep cell cultures alive. The cells need to be kept at a constant temperature 24/7, in a sterile environment and constantly monitored. It is very frustrating to set up your dishes with cells, only to come back on experiment day to find fungus or bacteria happily growing in your dish. After all, we grow the cells in media that is rich in nutrients and at optimal growing conditions. It’s the perfect environment for contaminants. How do we prevent bacteria and fungus from growing? Lots and lots of anti-microbials! While this is fine for in-vitro experiments, we certainly don’t know the long term effects of these antimicrobials in our bodies if we consume them.
What is also alarming is that the growth media could be contaminated with undetectable viruses. [1] Viruses in media are more difficult to detect, because they need PCR amplification, and since the media comes from animals (more on that later), there is very little we can do to prevent this. Again, these viruses might not affect the experiments being performed, but could have effects on a human consuming lab grown meat.
Now, if we can achieve complete sterility in these labs, the use of antimicrobials could be avoided. But, as you can imagine, this is very costly.
The “expense problem” is usually swept under the rug by proponents of lab cultured meat with the argument of escalation. [2] In other words, as the technology develops it will become less expensive. But unfortunately, even in the scientific realm, escalation of the technology to grow cells is happening slowly, this has been a barrier for scientific research for the last 30 years. 3 The technology for the creation of lab grown meat is very new, and even though it’s possible at a small scale, the technology for this meat to reach the supermarket is not here yet. Another hurdle that needs to be met is that lab grown meat would need machines that would “exercise the muscles” being grown to create the “right” texture. These machines have been conceptualized but have not been created. [4] In other words, scalability is still far, far away.
Lab grown meat is also touted as being “cruelty-free”. These cell culture models are grown with Fetal Bovine Serum, thus growing meat starts by harvesting stem cells from a live cow and then making them replicate over time in this media. [2] Fetal bovine serum is harvested from the blood of fetal cows, and there is already a lot of push back for using this very useful medium for scientific research. [5] The alternative to Fetal Bovine Serum would be to engineer algae to create the media, but this has proven very hard to do, again delaying the prospect of escalation.6
Furthermore, lab grown meat is grown with a single strain of cells. This means that at the moment we have to grow the muscle cells separate from the fat cells. [7] As you might imagine, the flavor is not appetizing without the addition of fat. Adding fat is necessary to lab grown meat, this creates another hurdle, growing mix cultures is harder than you imagine. Growing fat cells requires techniques and environments that are different to the techniques and environments of growing muscle. And and since growing fat cells has not been studied as much as growing other tissues like cartilage or muscle, new frontiers have yet to be trail blazed.8 What scares me the most, is that there are many articles claiming that having a fat-free meat substitute will be a healthier alternative (articles like this one and this one!). First of all, eating completely fat free muscle can kill you! [9] Rabbit starvation happens when you consume lean protein in the absence of fat, thus scientists would have to add fat to the lab grown meat in order to make it safe for consumption. I imagine that the scientists would look into our current nutrition guidelines to make the perfect meat-to-fat ratio. The last time we decided to create the perfect fat in a lab, we created fat alternatives like margarine and other polyunsaturated fats that turned out to be less than optimal. [10]
Now consider the “yuck” factor that will be associated with lab grown meat. I doubt that people will jump with enthusiasm to the idea of consuming this product. This will put scientists in a very pesky situation, when farmed salmon was not selling because of its dull color, [11] scientists came up with a solution. They discovered that by adding artificial color to their feed, salmon would develop a color that was similar to their fresh caught counterpart. [12] The salmon looks the part, but the health effects of eating salmon go beyond the color. Salmon get their color from eating crustaceans and other substances that contain asthaxanthin, but crustaceans also increase their Omega-3 fatty acids, in fact, salmons fed a pellet diet that included asthaxanthin (but lacks naturally occurring Omega-3 fatty acids) have a different fatty-acid composition –regardless of color – and this fatty acid content might be deleterious to our health. [13]
Finally, I would like to address the subject of sustainability. Sustainability is very important, and it’s a subject that everyone should embrace. The proponents of lab cultured meat propose that lab grown meat could be better for the environment. [14] This is if we can get to production levels necessary to bring cultured meat to market, if we can convince people to eat it (over grass fed meat), and that’s not even considering if the stuff is safe for consumption. But let’s pretend that those details are unimportant, the problem is that creating a new system of meat production is not the answer to our ecological woes. Creating new technologies to fix a problem that already has a solution only creates more cost. In fact, this problem exists in medicine; For example, robot-assisted surgeries have not proven to be economically (or proven to be more advantageous in the long term) than laparoscopic or open surgeries. [15]
This happens with pharmaceutical development. We are constantly looking for the next blockbuster drug, but prevention should always be the most important intervention, there is no need for a new drug. We also complain that the pharmaceutical research is muddled, and riddled with inconsistencies, this is because so much money is spent in development, and faulty research is pushed in order to bring these drugs to market. But as Harold Thimleby puts it “pharmaceutical development fails scientific standards; yet technology development, does not even aspire to the scientific standards that pharmaceutical research is aware it fails to reach.” [16]
We already have a solution that for our sustainability problem. I’ll let the likes of Diana Rodgers, Joel Salatin, Mike Ritter and The Savory Institute make the argument for me. In short, producing meat the way it was meant to be produced, by letting cows graze on green grass actually saves the environment. [17] This does not mean that we should stop looking into growing muscles in-vitro. Just like Velcro was developed for astronauts and eventually made it to your shoes, technological advances have impact beyond the scope of their original implementation. Lab cultured tissue could eventually make it possible for us to grow replacement organs in-vitro. [18] Technology is not inherently evil, in fact I am constantly amused with the ingenuity of humans. It’s the application of such technologies that we should be wary about. Maybe one day we’ll have the option of getting our cultured steak medium rare, but for now I’ll continue to choose grassfed.

Recently I was browsing ditto.com to find my next pair of sunglasses to borrow (see last elizabeth&james pair here) and came across these most ahhhmazing studded prada sunglasses. They have quite the hefty price tag but luckily I could rent them for just a few bucks. When they arrived, I opened the package and felt just as excited as if I bought them (minus the guilt of charging them to my amex).
Immediately after holding them, I envisioned their neutral color going perfectly with a black and white look. I went with the leather leggings to add to the edginess that the studs bring to the look and the tassel sweater for cool street style. I wore this out to lunch this past weekend and was excited to start my weekend errands afterwards so I could go around town wearing the newest and most stylish pair of sunglasses.

I'm an INFP. All my life I've had a really hard time establishing meaningful connections with people, because I usually don't feel like they're interested in knowing me. This includes people who are supposedly my friends or romantic partners. In conversation, I truly listen to people and respond to what they say. I draw them out, asking them questions about themselves, their lives, their thoughts and feelings. When they answer, I listen without interrupting. I pay attention and remember what they say. I'm genuinely interested. I long for others to do the same for me, but they never do. I'm smart, educated, accomplished, funny, and have had interesting adventures in my life. But people never ask about me. If I volunteer a little scrap of info about myself during the course of a conversation, I almost never get any uptake from the other person. They go right back to talking about themself. (This is especially true if I mention a topic that's important to me but that has no direct relation to the person I'm talking with.)
I always end up knowing my friends and partners *much* better than they know me. It's painfully lonely! Why does it have to be this way? How can I be more interesting to people? Does this sound at all familiar to anyone? How have you coped with this problem?
Understand that people are wrapped up in themselves, and nobody else really exists for them, other than as targets to profit from, or obstacles to avoid.
Thus, forget about trying to establish communication or connection, and focus on your own experience of living.
Maybe the people you talked to were mainly Thinkers? I know it's not possible that everyone around you is a T, but those that are might get uncomfortable when you touch upon deep and significant things. I'm an INTP and whenever my best friend gets too emotional or anything, I get uncomfortable even though I know it means a lot to her, so usually I just shut up cause I don't know what to say and then she changes the topic herself.
Also, if you ever just need to talk about yourself, find a person with whom you're on polite terms, ask them something and when they ask 'how about you?', you go into a long rant about your weekend or job or whatever it is. Whenever I simply want to talk to be selfish I use this trick since most people will ask you back just to be polite. The person might not care, but you just might feel a little better.

Renown for its healing properties in medicinal honey, the Manuka flower is partnered in our Ariki gin with internationally sourced botanicals.
Distillation is a combination of Ariki’s own custom-designed reflux method, and, a vapour infusion still. Vapour infusion develops Ariki’s distinctive aromatic notes, resulting in a stunning full-bodied gin. South Seas purity and quality are integral to the taste profile, lending Ariki gin a Pacific edge.
A hereditary member of the nobility. Ariki are known on other islands of Polynesia as Ari’i (Tahiti) and Ali’i (Samoa, Hawaii), carrying great prestige or mana.
Unique customs and culture traverse this vast Pacific Ocean and its tropical islands, inspiring our leadership position as the island region's first ultra-premium brand.
We take immense pride in producing ultra-premium gin and vodka, spirits that need to be extraordinary to carry the name of Ariki, a traditional chiefly title.
Our story begins out of a desire to develop spirits that could take on the best in the world. With sophistication, style and integrity we have produced spirits inspired by our Polynesian roots.
In 2014 we came together to form Ariki Spirit. Beginning a journey to create an Ultra-Premium gin and vodka, using organic ingredients, sourced primarily from the islands of Polynesia. Our unique botanicals, purity of New Zealand water form a smooth collaboration of Pacific characters producing a spirit of unsurpassed quality.
Our connection and the integrity of our spirits remains true to what the Ariki represents.We are proud to be able to share our skilfully crafted and small batch spirits. Just as the voyaging Polynesian people did in their epic journeys across the Pacific, Ariki is bringing the Spirit of the Pacific to the world.
On the fringe of the world's largest Polynesian city, Auckland is the setting for Ariki Spirit’s creative home.
Our dream began its journey in Te Weiti, a community settled centuries ago by early Maori. Meaning little water, Te Weiti is now better known as Silverdale.
Situated within a fruitful plantation, the distillery draws bountiful wild Manuka flower from the nearby Matakana region, providing some of our locally sourced botanicals.The majority coming from acrossAotearoa, the Maori name for New Zealand.

If the days that you lead are busy, it would be quite difficult for you to get up and face the next day. There would be so many factors that one would need to focus on and doing so would be quite stressful. Especially if you are on a business visit or in a field that requires you to tire yourself constantly, you would be feeling quite exhausted after you finish a busy day’s work. Hence you should know the option that you can take in order to make your day pleasant. While different people may have different opinions about what brings them pleasure, it could be accepted that going for a good massage is one of the most ideal ways to find pleasure after a busy day.
There are activities that you can engage in that would result in giving you physical satisfaction and pleasure. Then there are activities that would contribute more towards giving your mind relaxation and pleasure. What is important about a massage would be that it is well capable of giving you the pleasure that your mind and the body would need. Especially if one focuses on massages such as body to body massage, it would be possible for one to satiate many of the mental and physical needs through a single activity. All that one would have to do would be to find a good massage service provider that would direct a trained massage therapist to you and you would simply have to lie down and enjoy the pleasure that they give you.
An erotic massage could easily bring you the level of pleasure that you need after a busy day. All of us have sexual needs and it would be best to find means to satiate them in a good way. When one obtains such massages, it would let them let go of all the worries of the day and would just let them have their moment in the massage itself. This would let you face the next day that comes with a refreshed body and mind. Therefore one needs to understand the potential of a massage that is erotic and should engage in such a massage to know the true pleasure that it can bring.
A busy day would exhaust you, but obtaining such a massage would just bring you back to life in a relaxed manner. Hence one should always know of the ways that one could obtain such relaxation, pleasure and serenity through a single activity. The service provider that you choose would play a significant role in bringing you this pleasure.
Unbeneficial functional standards for Net projects including Web sites, Intranets or Portals contribute generally to holdups hindrances impediments, higher costs or in applications which experts claim not meet the outlook. Independent if the Web site, Intranet or Portal is tailor made developed or built on packaged application such as Web-, enterprise content material management or perhaps portal software program, the efficient specification packages the foundation for project holdups hindrances impediments and larger costs. To limit holds off and surprising investments during the development process, the following risks should be averted:
Too obscure or incomplete functional standards: This is the most common mistake that companies perform. Everything that is usually ambiguously or not specific at all, designers do not implement or apply in a different way of what web owners want. This kind of relates primarily to World wide web features which can be considered as prevalent user goals. For example , HTML CODE title tags, which are used to bookmark Internet pages. The Web steerage committee may specify that every page includes a page name, but would not specify that HTML Subject tags must be implemented as well. Web developers as a result may tend not to implement HTML CODE Title tags or put into practice them in a method, which varies from web page owners’ thoughts. There are additional examples including error managing on via the internet forms or maybe the definition of alt texts designed for images to comply with the disability midst section www.bsprojects.ro 508. These cases look like details but in practice, if builders need to modify hundreds or even thousands of pages, it amounts to many man-days or even just man-weeks. Especially, the corrections for photos as company owners need first of all to outline the image brands prior that Web developers may implement the ATL texts. Ambiguous efficient specification can easily result as a result of lack of inner or exterior missing functionality skills. In this instance, a one-day usability best practice workshop transfers the mandatory or at least standard usability abilities to the Internet team. It is recommended, even to get companies which have usability expertise or count on the subcontractor’s skill set, that an external and neutral manager reviews the functional specification. Especially, as a result reviews relate with marginal spending as compared to the whole Web assets (e. g. about $10 K — $15 K dollars for your review).
Future site enhancement not identified or perhaps not conveyed: It is crucial that your Web committee identifies by least the main future site enhancements and communicates them to the development team. In the best case, the expansion team has learned the plan for the approaching three years. This kind of approach permits the development staff to predict implementation alternatives to variety future web page enhancements. It is more cost effective upon mid- or perhaps long-term to put more initially and to create a flexible resolution. If Internet teams do not know or even disregard future improvements, the risk for higher financial commitment increases (e. g. adding new efficiency in the future brings about partially or perhaps at worst in totally restoring existing functionality). Looking at the financial delta for a adaptable solution vs . a solution just simply satisfying the actual requirements, the flexible formula has proved to be more cost-effective in practice from a mid- and long-term point of view.
Designed functionality not really aligned with internal methods: Many companies look at site functionality only from a website visitor perspective (e. g. facilitation of searching information or undertaking transaction) and corporate benefits (e. g. economic benefits of self-service features). Nevertheless , there is a third dimension the effect of site functionality in internal assets. Site functionality that can greatly impact interior resources will be for example: — Web sites: providing news, over the internet recruitment, via the internet support, and so forth – Intranets / portals: providing content maintenance operation for business managers
It is essential for the success of site efficiency that the Web committee analyzes the impact and takes activities to ensure treatments of the organized functionality. For example , providing this great article maintenance operation to entrepreneurs and merchandise mangers with an connected workflow. This functionality is effective and can create business rewards such as decreased time to marketplace. However , in practice, business owners and product managers will need to produce, validate, assessment, approve and retire articles. This brings about additional work load. If the World wide web committee have not defined inside the Web governance (processes, insurance policies, ownership and potentially enforcement), it may happen that this functionality is not used and so becomes ineffective.
Wish lists versus actual needs and business requirements: The efficient specification is certainly not aligned with customer’s needs or business requirements. This is more common for interior applications including Intranets or portals. In so many cases, the task committee neglects to perform a sound inner survey and defines features by generalizing individual employees’ wishes with no sound shows. Capturing the feedback of internal users across the group allows determining the critical functionality. To effectively perform a survey a representative set of staff need to be asked. Further these employees need to be categorized in to profiles. The profiles must be characterized by for example , frequency of usage of the Intranet, estimated duration simply by visit, use of the Intranet to aid their daily tasks, contribution to the organization, etc . Depending on this information the internet team are able to prioritize features and opt for the most effective and relevant operation for the next discharge. Less essential or reduced important operation may be element of future emits (roadmap) or perhaps dropped. If such a sound decision process is usually not performed, it may happen that operation is designed but only used by couple of users plus the return of investment can be not achieved.
Not enough image supports or perhaps purely text message based: Calcado description of Web applications can be construed subjectively and hence leading to incorrect expectations. To avoid setting wrong expectations, which may are only discovered during development or in worst cases at release time, efficient specification need to be complemented by visual facilitates (e. g. screenshots or at best HTML prototypes for home webpages or any key navigation web pages like sub-home pages meant for the major parts of the site such as for human resources, business units, funding, etc . ). This allows minimizing subjective model and considering the users’ feedback before development. This approach facilitates setting an appropriate expectations also to avoid virtually any disappointments right at the end once the new application is normally online.
We certainly have observed these types of common mistakes, independently if perhaps companies are suffering from their Web applications in house or subcontracted them to an external service provider.
Unbeneficial functional requirements for World wide web projects including Web sites, Intranets or Websites contribute typically to holds off, higher costs or in applications that do not match the targets. Independent if the Web site, Intranet or Web destination is customized developed or perhaps built on packaged software such as Web-, enterprise content material management or perhaps portal software, the efficient specification lies the foundation for the purpose of project holdups hindrances impediments and larger costs. To limit holdups hindrances impediments and unpredicted investments during the development method, the following stumbling blocks should be averted:
Too vague or unfinished functional requirements: This is the most frequent mistake that companies perform. Everything that is definitely ambiguously or not specified at all, designers do not put into practice or apply in a different way of what site owners want. This kind of relates primarily to Internet features which have been considered as common user targets. For example , HTML title tags, which are used to bookmark Web pages. The Web steering committee may possibly specify that each page consists of a page name, but will not specify that HTML Subject tags must be implemented too. Web developers consequently may usually do not implement CODE Title tags or put into action them in a approach, which is different from site owners’ thoughts. There are other examples including error managing on on the web forms or maybe the definition of ALT texts meant for images to comply with the disability operate section 508. These versions of look like details but in practice, if builders need to enhance hundreds or even thousands of pages, that amounts to many man-days or even just man-weeks. Especially, the modifications for images as business owners need earliest to outline the image names prior that Web developers can easily implement the ATL texts. Ambiguous practical specification may result due to the lack of internal or external missing functionality skills. In cases like this, a one-day usability ideal practice workshop transfers the required or at least standard usability abilities to the Internet team. It is recommended, even for the purpose of companies which have usability skills or count on the subcontractor’s skill set, that an external and neutral adviser reviews the functional specs. Especially, as such reviews refer to marginal spending as compared to the whole Web investment funds (e. g. about $12 K – $15 E dollars for that review).
Future site enhancement certainly not identified or not disseminated: It is crucial that Web panel identifies at least the top future web page enhancements and communicates them to the development group. In the very best case, the development team is aware of the plan for the approaching three years. This kind of approach allows the development team to predict implementation alternatives to hold future internet site enhancements. It truly is more cost effective in mid- or long-term obtain more at the beginning and to construct a flexible choice. If World wide web teams do not know or even ignore future innovations, the risk with respect to higher financial commitment increases (e. g. adding new functionality in the future results partially or at worst appdes.ir in totally restoring existing functionality). Looking at the financial delta for a flexible solution vs a solution just simply satisfying the latest requirements, the flexible treatment has confirmed to be more cost-effective used from a mid- and long-term point of view.
Prepared functionality not aligned with internal solutions: Many companies check out site operation only from a site visitor perspective (e. g. facilitation of searching info or performing transaction) and company benefits (e. g. economic benefits of self-service features). Yet , there is a third dimension the effect of site functionality on internal information. Site efficiency that can heavily impact interior resources will be for example: – Web sites: featuring news, over the internet recruitment, on-line support, etc . – Intranets / portals: providing content maintenance functionality for business managers
It is crucial for the achievements of site efficiency that the World wide web committee evaluates the impact and takes activities to ensure treatments of the planned functionality. For example , providing a few possibilities maintenance features to businesses and product mangers with an affiliated workflow. This kind of functionality works well and can make business rewards such as decreased time to industry. However , used, business owners and product managers will need to compose, validate, review, approve and retire articles. This brings about additional workload. If the Web committee have not defined in the Web governance (processes, regulations, ownership and potentially enforcement), it may happen that this operation is not really used thus becomes ineffective.
Wish data versus actual needs and business requirements: The practical specification can be not lined up with customer’s needs or business requirements. This is more common for internal applications including Intranets or portals. In so many cases, the task committee neglects to perform a sound inner survey and defines functionality by generalizing individual employees’ wishes with no sound demonstrates. Capturing the feedback of internal users across the institution allows deciding the important functionality. To effectively perform a survey an agent set of workers need to be asked. Further these kinds of employees should be categorized in to profiles. The profiles have to be characterized by for example , frequency of usage of the Intranet, projected duration by simply visit, using the Intranet to aid their daily tasks, contribution to the organization, etc . Depending on this information the internet team may then prioritize features and find the most effective and relevant functionality for the next release. Less important or less important functionality may be element of future releases (roadmap) or dropped. Any time such a sound decision process is definitely not performed, it may happen that operation is designed but simply used by few users and the return of investment is usually not realized.
Not enough image supports or perhaps purely text based: Calcado description of Web applications can be viewed subjectively and therefore leading to wrong expectations. To stop setting incorrect expectations, which may are only learned during development or in worst cases at kick off time, useful specification must be complemented simply by visual helps (e. g. screenshots or at best HTML prototypes for home webpages or any major navigation web pages like sub-home pages pertaining to the major sections of the site including for human resources, business units, invest, etc . ). This allows reducing subjective decryption and taking into account the users’ feedback prior development. This approach helps setting the appropriate expectations and also to avoid any disappointments in the end once the fresh application can be online.
We have observed these types of common faults, independently if perhaps companies are suffering from their Net applications in house or subcontracted them to another service provider.
Worthless functional requirements for Internet projects including Web sites, Intranets or Sites contribute basically to holds off, higher costs or in applications which in turn not meet the goals. Independent in case the Web site, Intranet or Web site is tailor made developed or built about packaged program such as Web-, enterprise content management or portal software program, the efficient specification pieces the foundation with regards to project holdups hindrances impediments and larger costs. To limit holdups hindrances impediments and surprising investments through the development method, the following stumbling blocks should be prevented:
Too obscure or imperfect functional specification: This is the most popular mistake that companies perform. Everything that is ambiguously or not particular at all, programmers do not use or use in a different way of what webmasters want. Here you will learn all about online gambling for real money. This relates primarily to World wide web features which have been considered as common user expectations. For example , HTML CODE title tags, which are used to bookmark Websites. The Web guiding committee might specify that every page has a page name, but will not specify that HTML Title tags has to be implemented as well. Web developers consequently may do not implement HTML Title tags or use them in a approach, which differs from web page owners’ dreams. There are different examples including error managing on on-line forms or perhaps the definition of alt texts to get images to comply with the disability act section 508. These good examples look like facts but in practice, if designers need to adjust hundreds or even thousands of pages, this amounts to several man-days or perhaps man-weeks. Especially, the modifications for pictures as businesses need first of all to clearly define the image brands prior that Web developers can easily implement the ATL text messaging. Ambiguous useful specification may result as a result of lack of interior or external missing simplicity skills. In this instance, a one-day usability ideal practice workshop transfers the essential or at least simple usability abilities to the World wide web team. Experts recommend, even pertaining to companies which have usability abilities or rely on the subcontractor’s skill set, that an external and neutral adviser reviews the functional specification. Especially, as a result reviews refer to marginal spending as compared to the overall Web ventures (e. g. about $10,50 K – $15 T dollars for any review).
Future site enhancement not identified or perhaps not conveyed: It is crucial the fact that Web committee identifies by least difficulties future internet site enhancements and communicates those to the development team. In the very best case, the expansion team knows the roadmap for the approaching three years. This approach permits the development staff to count on implementation alternatives to coordinate future site enhancements. It is actually more cost effective about mid- or long-term to put more at first and to build a flexible option. If Web teams do not know or even disregard future improvements, the risk just for higher expense increases (e. g. adding new operation in the future produces partially or perhaps at worst caterinrivera.com in totally repairing existing functionality). Looking at the financial delta for a flexible solution compared to a solution simply just satisfying the existing requirements, the flexible alternative has confirmed to be more cost-effective in practice from a mid- and long-term perspective.
Prepared functionality not really aligned with internal means: Many companies take a look at site efficiency only from a website visitor perspective (e. g. facilitation of searching facts or doing transaction) and corporate benefits (e. g. fiscal benefits of self-service features). Nevertheless , there is a third dimension the impact of site functionality upon internal assets. Site features that can intensely impact interior resources happen to be for example: – Web sites: rendering news, on line recruitment, on line support, and so forth – Intranets / portals: providing content material maintenance operation for business managers
It is essential for the success of site functionality that the Net committee evaluates the impact and takes actions to ensure experditions of the prepared functionality. For instance , providing this maintenance features to businesses and product mangers with an connected workflow. This functionality is beneficial and can create business benefits such as lowered time to marketplace. However , used, business owners and product managers will need to write, validate, review, approve and retire articles. This produces additional workload. If the Net committee has not defined inside the Web governance (processes, insurance plans, ownership and potentially enforcement), it may happen that this operation is certainly not used and hence becomes pointless.
Wish to do this versus real needs and business requirements: The useful specification is certainly not aligned with user’s needs or perhaps business requirements. This is more widespread for internal applications including Intranets or perhaps portals. On many occasions, the project committee neglects to perform a sound interior survey and defines efficiency by generalizing individual employees’ wishes without the sound proves. Capturing the feedback of internal users across the business allows deciding the important functionality. To effectively perform a survey an agent set of staff need to be asked. Further these types of employees should be categorized in to profiles. The profiles have to be characterized by for example , frequency of usage of the Intranet, believed duration by visit, usage of the Intranet to accomplish their daily tasks, contribution to the organization, etc . Depending on this information the net team can then prioritize the functionality and select the most effective and relevant operation for the next launch. Less important or not as much important features may be part of future releases (roadmap) or dropped. Any time such a sound decision process is definitely not performed, it may happen that operation is designed but just used by few users and the return of investment is usually not attained.
Not enough vision supports or purely textual content based: Textual description of Web applications can be construed subjectively thus leading to incorrect expectations. To avoid setting wrong expectations, which can are only uncovered during expansion or at worst at kick off time, efficient specification have to be complemented by simply visual supports (e. g. screenshots at least HTML prototypes for home internet pages or any main navigation internet pages like sub-home pages pertaining to the major sections of the site just like for recruiting, business units, money, etc . ). This allows lowering subjective message and taking into account the users’ feedback former development. This kind of approach facilitates setting the suitable expectations also to avoid virtually any disappointments right at the end once the new application is normally online.
We have observed these common flaws, independently any time companies allow us their Internet applications in house or subcontracted them to an external service provider.

Oh hey /x/. While googling my username I came across this archive of a great thread I made on /x/ ages back. Here it is in its glory again, enjoy.
i wish this board moved faster. there are less shit posters than... elsewhere, but i see posts i did like months ago. get on this
one day people as dedicated as you will help the paranormal forum we just have to wait in the darkness and believe.
So I assume this was thought of, but did anyone ever check the cigarette as a source of the poison? Seems odd that they'd mention that it wasn't the Pasty, but not mention the cigarette as a possible source.
unless it is a classic design. a focus on the recreational level of gymnastics, We're told in Scripture that it's better ?
Fun fact: Paranormal literally means anything out of the normal. It, similarly to how the board has been functioning as a creepy board, as opposed to ghosts and aliens and conspiracies, has come to mean ghost and aliens,all of that stuff.
Rubbish! Everyone knows that a "silver cord" is the leash that links a Sul'dam to a Damane. It is the leash that links the bracelet and collar of an a'dam. Just thought I should clear that up.
I remember a picture that freaked me out for days but can't find it again. There's a story behind it and I'll describe the picture afterward.
There was a dude who was into the occult a long ass time ago. He heard of this supposed witch and set off on his own to investigate her. He was never heard from again. A while later his wife received a package. In the package was her husband's camera and a note. The note said that it was from some dude who bought it in a pawnshop or something and he did some digging to find out where to send it, because it had her husband's name engraved on it. When she had the film developed only one photo came out of the thing.
The photo was of an attack dog charging at the guy. Behind the dog was a woman dressed in strange clothing, and her face was almost completely black save for her eyes. The photo was monochrome.
If any of you can find the photo, I know it's on the internet somewhere, I think the rest of this board will get a kick out of it. It's honestly the creepiest photo I've ever seen besides the one I've attached to this post.
A navy ship dry docked and the dude in charge of taking pictures took some pictures of the thing before maintenance. He submitted his photos, and his superior was all like "that's great, but who's the dude with the axe?" When they went over the photos the attached picture was discovered. A search of the ship was conducted by police but nobody was found. Since the ship was dry docked it was a lethal drop to the concrete from any window or deck. There was only one way on and off the ship without making a lethal jump, which was covered by CCTV cameras.
Shit man, this made me in a bad mood. You cant just kidnap people and rape them like that, it's rude and ungentleman-like.

AMD today announced that it was selected for an award of $12.6 million for two research projects associated with the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Extreme-Scale Computing Research and Development Program, known as “FastForward.” The DOE award provides up to $9.6 million to AMD for processor-related research and up to $3 million for memory-related researchi. AMD’s award-winning AMD Opteron™ processor has powered many of the world’s largest supercomputers over the past decade and the company invented the world’s first and only Accelerated Processing Unit (APU).
FastForward is a jointly funded collaboration between DOE Office of Science, and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to initiate partnerships with multiple companies to accelerate the research and development of critical technologies needed for extreme scale computing, on the path toward exascale computing. Exascale computing is essentially a grand challenge to provide the next level of computational power required to help ensure the prosperity and security of the United States. The DOE’s strategic plan seeks to address the nation’s most pressing scientific challenges by advancing simulation-based scientific discovery made possible by the world’s highest performing exascale supercomputers.
Exascale supercomputers will be capable of performing one quintillion (or a billion billion) calculations per second, roughly one thousand times faster than today’s fastest available supercomputers. Exascale supercomputers are designed to break through the current limitations of today’s supercomputers by dramatically reducing the length of run time required to perform calculations and improving the capability to perform detailed analyses of complex systems. Medical science, astrophysics, climate modeling, and national security all have applications with extreme computing requirements.
"To prepare for the next phase of extreme scale computing, NNSA and DOE Office of Science are taking a proactive step in jointly making strategic investments in key areas such as processor, file storage and memory technologies with AMD and others,” said Thuc Hoang of DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration. “A key to successfully developing next-generation HPC capabilities is bringing together the know-how and best minds of industry leaders and national labs to work on this grand challenge.”
“We’re honored to be selected for this research project to help drive the next frontier for high-performance computing,” said Alan Lee, AMD’s corporate vice president for Advanced Research and Development. “AMD has long been the technology partner of choice for many of the world’s leading high-performance computing providers. This award from the DOE will fund critical research and development required to enable high-performance, power-efficient exascale systems. Additionally, AMD will undertake work to drive advances in memory bandwidth and communication speed, which are essential for heterogeneous architecture, exascale-class supercomputers with thousands of processors.”
According to Dr. William J. Harrod, Division Director of Research, in the DOE Office of Science, ASCR, “extreme scale technology will create a whole new class of high performance computing systems that can achieve 1,000 times the performance of today’s petascale computers while limiting growth in space and power requirements. The primary goal of the Department’s exascale effort is to ensure the availability of leading-edge computing assets for national security and scientific discovery. The development of high performance, energy-efficient processor and memory technologies are critical to achieving the Department’s goals and AMD is initiating innovative designs for these components.”
AMD Opteron processors are used today in many of the world’s leading supercomputers, including IBM’s Roadrunner computer at the DOE’s Los Alamos National Laboratory, which in 2008 was the first supercomputer to reach sustained petaflop performance. AMD Opteron processors were also used in the world’s second petascale supercomputer, Cray’s Jaguar supercomputer deployed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Moreover, the DOE announced last fall that 19,200 AMD Opteron™ 6200 Series processors will be used to help power their new Titan system also at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is expected to provide peak performance in excess of 20 petaflops when it becomes fully operational by early 2013. AMD Opteron processors were also selected for the Blue Waters supercomputing project at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
According to the report, “The Future of Computing Performance, Game Over or Next Level?” by the National Academy of Sciences in 2011, “Virtually every sector of society – manufacturing, financial services, education, government, the military, entertainment, and so on – has become dependent on continued growth in computing performance to drive industrial productivity, increase efficiency, and enable innovation.” To address this need, the FastForward program funds new or existing innovative technologies targeted for productization in a five-to-ten year timeframe. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory represented seven DOE laboratories and the DOE as the Source Selection Official for this award.
I recently wrote about the joy of travelling with your adult children after a great trip away with my 28-year-old daughter. This seemed to resonate with some folks so I thought I’d offer some tips for a successful trip away with your grown-up child.
While not an absolute necessity, I’d suggest you try to keep it to just yourself and one of your adult children (if you have more than one). What makes it a great trip is shared, quality one-on-one time with your grown child, where you mutually decide and compromise on what you’re going to do. Adding even one more party can skew things to the point where one or other of you becomes the third wheel.
For example, bring your partner along and your kid may feel like they need to submit to whatever the couple wants to do, or go off on their own to give them ‘alone time’. Similarly, bring the kid’s partner or sibling or friend along and you may find the group dynamic changed so you’re the odd one out.
Of course a family trip with all your adult children and relevant partners is also a great vacation, but is not what I’ve got in mind with this list.
Money can often be a touchy subject. As the parent, you may be accustomed to paying all the costs for family vacations. But your child is now an adult with his or her own income (hopefully). So it is not appropriate to assume you will still bear all the costs of a trip together. But how do you decide how costs will be shared?
Your kid may be on the fast track to the executive suite, so you may be thinking that they can easily afford to take you along for the trip. However, they may still have the mind-set that the parent absorbs all the family vacation costs, even now that they’re earning more. Best to get the cost-sharing understanding out in the open before you book the trip to avoid hurt feelings, and wallets, later.
It’s probably best to start with a 50-50 cost sharing understanding, just as you would with an adult friend.
If your kid has a limited budget and you are able and willing to carry a bigger share by all means do so. Similarly, the shoe may now be on the other foot, where you’re on a limited retirement income and they’re pulling in the big bucks. In which case, they may take on a higher proportion of overall costs.
Whatever you do, don’t bring an accountant’s eye to cost splitting. Any over-payment on your side is worth it for the experience.
If your adult child is looking forward to clubbing every night at the hot spots in town, you may want to reconsider if this is the trip for you.
Similarly, if your idea of a great trip is getting cozy poolside with a good book each afternoon, while your child has compiled a long sight-seeing list, one or both of you will end up disappointed.
You next need to make sure you’re aligned on the budget level for your trip. This is an extension of the cost-sharing discussion touched on above. If one party can only afford hostels or budget hotels, while the other wants nothing less than 5 star hotels, there’s going to be a clash. It wouldn’t be fair to make the party on the limited budget pay half the cost of the deluxe hotel. Come to an agreement beforehand.
Perhaps, you stay at a 3 or 4 star hotel but the hostel-lover only contributes half the cost of what the budget hotel would have been.
Another approach would be for the flush party to say ‘I’ll pay for the hotel and you pick up the rental car’ – assuming the rental is much less. This can also avoid hurt pride that might arise from nitpicking the details when splitting costs of each item.
As noted above, the overall goals for your trip need to be aligned. But once you get into the details of your daily itineraries, you both need to have some flexibility to ensure each of you gets to do what you really want to do.
You also need to make sure that what one party ‘really wants to do’ is not beyond the abilities of the other. If nothing less than the full 20 mile hike along that rugged mountain trail is going to satisfy your child, and your sore knees challenge you walking around town, don’t agree to the hike. Forget ‘doing it to make them happy’. Either they do it on their own, or with someone else, or save it for another trip.
Fortunately, this is not a stranger you’re going with. You’ve already got a pretty good idea of each other’s interests and your compatibility. Still, the last time you travelled somewhere with them, they may have been a teenager. You may be surprised that their interests have changed. Be open to things you may not have chosen on your own. You may really enjoy it.
Have a positive attitude and fully engage in every moment of your time together. Take lots of pictures. Have fun!

Solving the Pancake Problem with an E. coli Computer Our goal is to genetically engineer a biological system that can compute solutions to a puzzle called the burnt pancake problem. The EHOP computer is a proof of concept for computing in vivo, with implications for future data storage devices and transgenic systems. Our work was done in collaboration with the Davidson College iGEM team.
The Burnt Pancake Problem The pancake problem is a puzzle in which a scrambled series of units (or stack of pancakes) must be shuffled into the correct order and orientation. In the burnt pancake problem, each pancake is given an orientation by burning one side. The The leftmost stack in Figure 1 below shows a scrambled stack of burnt pancakes. To solve the problem, every unit, or pancake, must be placed in the proper order (largest on bottom, smallest on top) and in the proper orientation (burnt side down, golden side up). The pancakes are flipped with two spatulas: one to lift pancakes off the top of the stack (if needed), the other to flip part (or all) of the remaining stack of pancakes. The pancakes lifted by the first spatula are returned to the top of the stack without being flipped. The illustration below shows that this stack of pancakes can be put into correct order and orientation in three such steps. One can verify that no two allowable flips are sufficient. Mathematically, one question sorrounding this scenario is to determine the least number of allowable two-spatula flips needed to change a given arrangement of pancakes into the correct order and orientation.
Approach Trial and error is one approach to solving the burnt pancake problem, but how could one compute the quickest solution? Our idea is to let E. coli do the work, using each cell as a tiny processor in a massively parallel machine. A mathematical model of the flipping process helps us design the system and interpret the output of our EHOP computer.
Biological System The biological representation of a pancake is a functional unit of DNA such as a promoter or coding region. To flip these units of DNA, we have reconstituted the Hin/ Hix invertase system from Salmonella typhimurium as a BioBrick compatible system in E. coli. Hin invertase (BBa_J31001) was cloned from S. typhimurium, Ames strain TA100 and tagged with LVA. We built the recombinational enhancer (RE) and Hin invertase recognition sequence HixC using the publicly available genomic sequence of S. typhimurium and a dsDNA assembly program we created for gene synthesis from overlapping oligos.
Every segment of DNA flanked by a pair of HixC sites is a "pancake" capable of being inverted. Hin invertase recognizes pairs of HixC sites and inverts the DNA fragment in between the two HixC sites with the help of the Fis protein bound to the RE. In our system, selectable phenotypes (including antibiotic resistance and RFP expression), depend upon the proper arrangement of a series of HixC-flanked DNA segments in a plasmid. This allows us to select for cells that have successfully solved the puzzle.
Mathematics To better understand the possible results of the flipping of biological pancakes, it was necessary to better understand the combinatorial mathematics underlying the process. For a burnt pancake problem involving n pancakes, there are n!2^n possible orders and orientations of the pancakes. A graph representing the relationships between the 8 orders and orientations of two pancakes is given if Figure 3 below. This is useful in understanding "how close" one stack is to another. For example, if a stack begins as -2,1 and ends in the final position of 1,2, then we know AT LEAST two flips took place, although we can not determine exactly which flips or how many. The flipping of a stack from an initial position to the final position corresponds to what is called a walk in the graph.
Note that there are 48 possible stacks of three burnt pancakes. While this graph is far more unwieldy, we were able to model this graph on a sphere. Figure 4 below illustrates the view of the sphere from the "North Star". The graph below has one vertex at the North Pole, five vertices on the Arctic Circle, eleven vertices on the Tropic of Capricorn, and fourteen vertices on the Equator. The southern hemisphere is an inversion of this graph. Figure 5 is a picture of the full graph with 48 vertices on a sphere representing the 3-pancake problem.
A population of E. coli cells (1015 cells, for instance) each carrying ~100 copies of pancake stacks has astounding parallel processing capacity.
Building new parts using synthetic DNA required that we determine the desired sequence, order the DNA to be made, anneal the oligos, ligate into pSB1A2, and verify using sequencing. This method was used to build the HixC, Recombination Enhancer (RE), and the Reverse RBS.
The process of PCR required us to locate the gene and design appropriate primers, isolate genomic DNA, work to optimize the PCR reaction, purify the band, and clone the gene into pSB1A2. This method was used to make Hin recombinase from Salmonella, Hin recombinase with an LVA tag, and three antibiotic resistance genes from E. coli.
To build reverse parts, we used a procedure that we affectionately call the PCR Switcharoo. Here, we designed the primers with the biobrick prefix and suffix switched. These primers were also complementary to the part. We purified the Xba1/Spe1 fragment of the part, amplified and purified the fragment, then cloned it into pSB1A2. We used this method to create the reversed pBAD promoter and three reversed antibiotic resistance genes.
In our design of the construction, we wanted to attempt to control the flipping process. IPTG turns on the Hin recombinase which in turn induces the flipping of segment of DNA between two HixC sites. Here, recombination occurs without gene expression in the target. We then introduce Arabinose which induces the pBAD promoter and, hence, gene expression in the target. We can then use restriction digestion to measure recombination.
One pancake and two pancake constructs were made and tested for flipping. Restriction mapping was used to verify that flipping was occuring in one pancake constructs. Since in these experiments the Hin recombinase expression cassette had not be intentionally induced, the flipping was occurring spuriously.
Additional experiments are underway to measure flipping genetically with Tet resistance and to test two pancake constructs.
1. Modeling was used in the building of the biological system. In particular, attention was paid to the order in which intermediates were constructed so as to maximize the number of intermediates that could be used to make controls for our experiments and for eventual future constructs with more pancakes.
2. Given two pancakes, there are eight possible constructs. Modeling was used to help determine which of the constructs would be the most valuable for our investigation of the flipping mechanism. This becomes a much larger concern very quickly as the number of pancakes increases. There are 48 possible 3-pancake constructs and 384 possible 4-pancake constructs. The larger scale constructs represent an opportunity for further exploration. We have attempted to make intermediates that would be helpful in the investigation of this or other larger scale investigations.
3. We anticipate using modeling to deduce the kinetics of the pancake flipping and to detect any size or location biases associated with the flipping in the multiple-pancake problem.
Single pancakes The problems of read-through - uncontrolled Tet expression, uncontrolled flipping New pSB1A7 vector: insulates, but is not compatible with parts carrying double terminators Designing pancakes without TT's
5. if controlled, the possibility of reversing ANY standard biobrick, thus nearly doubling the size of the iGEM registry
During the course of the summer, many lessons were learned -- in addition to the molecular biology and mathematics involved in our problem.
Setbacks were encountered along the way, including human errors, erroneous procedures, faulty materials, and limitations of equipment, time, and money. Through creative thinking and teamwork with our Davidson collaborators, most of these setbacks were overcome.
Through the wonders of the technology, we were able to communicate on a nearly daily basis throughout the summer between institutions that are literally 1000 miles apart. We worked on our combined project with no face-to-face meeting of the teams or the team leaders. We all anticipating our first meeting at the 2006 Jamboree.
The concept of teamwork came into play on several different levels during this project. On one level was the interaction between the individual members on our team. Each person has different interests and career aspirations, yet we were able to pull together utilizing each person's strengths while acknowledging but accepting each person's weaknesses. Second, was the interdisciplinary interaction. There were clearly times when each of the disciplines led the charge toward getting a better understanding of the situation. Last, but certainly not least, was the teamwork between the Missouri Western team and Davidson College team. Each team had its strengths. Davidson College participated in iGEM 2005 whereas this was Missouri Western's first year. Missouri Western was able to get started two weeks earlier than the Davidson team, however, and played a crucial role in the formulation of the framework for the problem (although the original suggestion of working on the Pancake Problem came from Dr. Heyer of Davidson). Finally, while Davidson excelled at performing some of the biology procedures, Missouri Western students contributed through being very good at working with polyacrylamide gels -- ideal for working with some of the smaller segments of DNA. Overall, this was an extremely successful collaboration. Many thanks to our teammates at Davidson.
Working as a part of iGEM has garnered the attention of our school's administration and of the local press. We were proactive in seeking out positive press. As you may be aware, biotechnology is a current hot topic in the state of Missouri. We have had favorable write-ups in both the local newspaper and a campus publication. We anticipate more positive coverage on our return from the Jamboree.
5. The mathematics and biology meshed well in this project. There was plenty for members with emphasis in both areas to stay engaged with the project. This particular choice of project was ideal for the members of our combined team.
6. Multiple campuses can increase the capacity for both learning and product. Through communication and cooperation, we have shown that it is possible for multiple institutions to work together on a single project. Size of school does not seem to be a limiting factor.
7. Lastly, we had a blast and learned a lot of molecular biology, a lot of mathematics, a lot about the process of research, and a lot about the benefits of collaboration.
The picture below is of the half graph for the signed permutations for the 3-pancake problem. The full graph would have 48 vertices with each connected to six other vertices. The plan is to transfer this half graph onto the northern hemisphere of a globe with 123 as the north pole, five permutations on the Arctic Circle, eleven on the Tropic of Capricorn, and seven on the equator. An identical graph can be placed on the southern hemisphere such that each permutation occurs diametrically opposite its biological complement. In the picture below, green edges correspond to flips involving one pancake only and black edges correspond to a flip in which a double pancake is involved.
The graphic below was created using Geometer's SketchPad by Marian and shows the 24 vertices on the Northern Hemisphere, similar to the pushpin and rubber band manipulative above. The edges in this graph represent the relationships among the permutations. Pink edges correspond to the flip of a single pancake, black edges to the flip of a double, and green edges to vertices in the Southern Hemisphere. A 3-D model on a globe (okay, it is really a beachball) is in progress. Of curious note, doesn't this graph look similar to Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man?

Claude Paradis was impoverished and homeless, living on the streets of Montreal, Canada. He struggled with addiction to both alcohol and drugs, with a future so bleak, he considered ending his own life.
He did not end his life, however, and today he is a priest who dedicates his time to serving the physical and spiritual needs of those trapped in poverty, prison and prostitution.
“The street brought me to the Church and the Church in the end brought me back to the street,” the priest told the Journal Metro.
This past December, as a sign of his closeness and solidarity with the homeless, Fr. Paradis decided to sleep on the street for the whole month, to care for the homeless people there with solidarity and charity.
His hope was that he could accompany people in a difficult situation while also making the citizens of Montreal aware of the harsh reality faced by those living on the street. Fr. Paradi founded an institution called Notre-Dame-de-la-rue (Our Lady of the Street). Each night, he goes out to bring food and shelter to those living on the streets. He also administers the sacraments, celebrates the Eucharist and even presides at funerals.
The priest is accompanied by one of his co-workers, Kevin Cardin, who also was addicted to drugs, but found help, changed his life and now has a family. Notre-Dame-de-la-rue has the support of the Archbishop Christian Lépine of Montreal, who has described the initiative as “a presence of the Church to give encouragement.” It also has the support of the city.
“Our mission is especially to give encouragement. Unlike the shelters, we go out to the people, a bit like a door-to-door service. We talk to them, sometimes we pray together before they go back to face the harshness of the street.”
Fr. Paradis knows how hard life on the street is. After growing up in the Gaspé region and working in Cowansville as a nurse, he came to Montreal 25 years ago. However, he was unable to find a job. “Isolation and despair took hold of me,” he said. Living on the street, he thought about committing suicide. “I started doing cocaine and then crack,” he recalled.
“I had the privilege of meeting God just at the moment I was doubting Him. On a little back street in Montreal, abandoned by people, there was nobody there. Passing by the old church, impelled by I don't know what instinct, I turned back in there.”
At that moment, he had a deep and intense encounter with God. He realized he did not want to die, but rather wanted to become “a man of the Church.”
Fr. Paradis went on to fight his addictions and now ministers to many people who face the same challenges he struggled with years ago. The 57-year-old priest has dedicated the rest of his life to serving the poor, saying “on the street is where I want to be, until I die.”

Auto Parts Warehouse (APW) is an American online retailer of automotive parts and accessories for cars, vans, trucks, and sport utility vehicles. It is one of the flagship websites of U.S.
We are living in a world surrounded by numerous things that are either related to the technology, the latest gadgets or the latest fashion. And Fashion today has made its significance felt in almost all sectors of life. Fashion can be termed into two groups: One group which follows fashion trends and adopts them and the other group who create fashion and style statements for the others to follow them. It can also be extended to another set of people who rarely have anything to do with fashion trends but yet follow their own style to create their own unique personality; adding one more style to the fashion world.
Fashion is not just about cosmetics and make up or the hair-do. It is a sense of creating the charisma of looking good in anything you wear and this magic is created with the right kind of accessories going along with the foot wear and the clothes, making up a pleasant picture to view. Many a times, people who do not afford to buy expensive clothes look their best in their casual wear, just by presenting themselves in that manner of sophistication and creating an aura around them with the confidence of looking good.
There are myriad forms of fashion, and trends keep on changing with the seasons. From the early 60s and 70s to the present millennium, there has been an immense change in the forms, looks and thoughts about fashion trends.
In India, much of fashion has been influenced by the Hindi Film Industry, popularly called Bollywood. The trends that have changed through time can be fairly seen in the movies made during the 60s and 70s and how they have evolved in various forms bringing about a style that can be followed by the general public. People have aped the west from very early times and this was no exception. The clothes made in the 60s and 70s were very much influenced by the western countries and given a traditional touch. The Bell Bottoms, scarves and the hair style was very much prevalent in those days as an icon of style. Later in the 80s and 90s, Fashion world sizzled like never before. There was a craving by the people to look different, stylish and modern and this could be seen in their outlook towards their outfit, new styles of hair, makeup, accessories like purses, earrings, necklaces, matching footwear etc.
People were conscious about each and every new thing that was marketed and they copied the styles from their Bollywood idols. Bollywood started as a platform for theatre artistes and went on to become a commercial entry to the youths and aspirants for a career in the film and fashion industry. This gave the youth of today to emphasize on the fashion world. Art and music have become an inseparable thing of the past and so it is deeply rooted in the present as well with more features and facilities.
Today fashion, art, music, designers, dance etc all have a place in the industry and people can choose to take up anything related to this industry as their profession too. Art and music have long been implemented in the school co-curricular activities and the Higher colleges are now offering various courses for better professionalism in these areas. There are also various acting schools and the small screen i.e., the television has opened up avenues in bringing out the talent in the young minds through numerous platforms of music and dance. This is the innovation of the millennium in creating jobs and work in the fashion industry. The trends that we see are brought about by the fashion houses that have regular seasons to showcase their invention, many of which are popularized in FTV, Zee Trendz and TLC channels. We can also get a glimpse of the stylish outfits through these shows that the models present. Today, Modelling is also one of the platforms for an entry into the world of fashion.
In the yester years, fashion was constrained only to the actors in the film or those that were bold enough to carry themselves in the public that they were considered fashionable. Others just wooed them behind close doors. Slowly when times began changing, we could see the women showing off their styles in the traditional saree with an embroidered blouse and a different neck style. Then we saw the saree being draped in various styles like the Bengali style or the Gujarati style etc. The women were liberating their choice of freedom and it could be seen in their appearances with a high heeled slipper or the handbag she carried or the way she held her saree or the hair and the makeup she wore. All these changes brought about the invention of churidhars and then the salwar kameez and finally the fashion of dresses was out in the open. Women accepted to the fact that there was nothing wrong in looking good and the men of course, loved to see the attractive side of women and fantasized the idea over their spouses.
This change in attitude of the public was very well taken by the fashionistas and a huge market was created to meet the demands of the public. Today fashion creates a new look with distinct style for a particular person and keeps oneself updated with the latest trends seen in the market. This industry is popular for its glamour as well as the mixture of Indian tradition and culture put into the designer wear that the models showcase.
People love to experiment different textures of materials used in the outfits and so the designers give them a wide collection of dresses using all kinds of clothes. There is the traditional Khadi and silk combination that is presently creating waves seen in both men’s and women’s wear. Then we have the embroidery work in zardosi, swarovski studded tops and lehangas and multi stoned work in bridal collection sarees etc. Then the most sought materials like cotton, polyster, chiffon, crush materials used in varied iconoclastic designs and styles.
Always there is a hope for the designers that the youth want a change in the fashion and are glad to keep up the trend with a fusion of Indian and western mix of fashionable wear. Also the youth of today are very practical in their sense of styling for a particular occasion. Be it a party or for a marriage or the casual look, they want the best and they believe in looking the best. And to achieve this, people go one step ahead in ensuring that they have everything in their wardrobe for any kind of occasion.
Apart from the stylish clothes and fashion that is currently popular people want to try something that goes along with their outlook. So the market started towards the very own friend of a woman- The Hand Bag or the Purse. The Fresh look of a purse with magnificent colours and its stylish features like the chain handle or the jazzy zips with numerous pockets in different shapes attracted the public like never before. And with the increasing demand of the prices of branded purses, it became a must for every woman to complete her shopping. So did the other accessories line up by creating a place for themselves in the market. Just a few to quote, the earring and necklaces, the various Belts, hand bracelets and brooch, the stiletto and its wonderful embroidered, party wear slippers along with its brotherly high rugged shoes giving a perfect cowboy look etc.
Fashion industry attracts many young people nowadays not only because it is a rather new profession, but also it is supposed to realize person’s likes in the field of fashion. Besides, it is quite a high-paid profession today. When a young person decides to connect his or her activity with the fashion industry nothing comes to mind except one its aspect – fashion design. Probably, few people actually know that it’s a separate field of fashion industry. In fact, there is a great number of other professions and specialties in fashion including designing clothing, fashion design, fashion marketing, fashion merchandising, etc. The latter doesn’t get worthy attention, but it is very important. Due to merchandising we have fashionable clothes in the shops and stores.
How can one know whether fashion merchandising is the field for him to start work at? Look through the following traits of a potential fashion merchandiser and if at least one point coincides with your way of life, you have all chances to make the career in the field. Do you like to spend your weekend walking through flea markets for the latest retro fashions? Or maybe your friends want to borrow your fashionable shoes and your defiant accessories? If so, maybe you should take a walk down the fashion runway. Being a student in merchandising, you will get an opportunity to learn more about fabrics and textiles. You are also going to study the cultures and subcultures that shape the way people dress.
No doubt, in order to become a professional merchandiser, a great desire and talent for this specialty is not enough. If a person wants to get into this career and have success in it one needs to get the right education and training at first. A fashion merchandising college will be of great help for you. Once you study at a fashion merchandising college you will get an opportunity to learn all the ins and outs of the fashion industry because there one can get a practical experience and build a strong foundation necessary for further working in this field.
A student has the right to choose whether to obtain a two-year Associate in Art degree or a four-year Bachelor of Science degree in the field of fashion. It depends on the kind of a fashion merchandising college you are going to visit. Besides, you are also welcome to unite this education with classes or even a major or minor in a related specialty, for instance, fashion design or fashion marketing. Students in a fashion merchandising college learn how to manufacture, buy, promote, and sell fashion items, beginning from clothing and jewelry to cosmetics and furniture. They also learn about textiles (fabrics and the fibers used to make them).
One should choose his or her future merchandising college very thoroughly. Depending upon the fashion merchandising college you are going to attend a sort of the necessary courses in your degree course will greatly vary. The most preferable courses include subjects like accounting principles, business law, salesmanship, fashion sketching, merchandising math, merchandising, publicity and promotions, fashion development, trend-spotting, and the history of fashion. You are certain to like those subjects, besides, they will give you the fundamental knowledge of the fashion industry.
Studying at a fashion merchandising college is not like studying at any other educational establishment. Many core courses in fashion merchandising are hands-on and involve a great amount of project work. Professors tend to rely more on their life experiences than on textbooks. If you are going to become a student expect to take a lot of field trips and listen to many guest speakers. You may visit a fashion magazine or large clothing company. You might even swing by a fashion show or two.
Having the profession of a fashion merchandiser is very interesting. It involves much communication with other people. When a person gets the job of a fashion merchandiser he or she is going to spend all days long visiting various fashion shows, buying clothing and designs, speaking with designers, overseeing advertising and marketing campaigns necessary for successful selling of your products, and managing the stores within your business network. You are also expected to find yourself negotiating business agreements with manufacturers and suppliers. Besides, you are going to arrange your own store displays. The scope of your activity depends on the size of the business you have as well as on the level of practical work expected of you.
Beginning the fashion merchandising career you should always improve your skills and knowledge of fashion tendencies in the world, and the most important thing you will have to do is to perfect your ability of picking out the next big thing in fashion before anyone else does. This will guarantee your success. This ability carries the foundation of your new knowledge of past fashions and trends. It includes everything you will obtain by attending a fashion merchandising college, but further you should develop this trend adding your own good taste in clothing.
Summing up, it would be necessary to say that the career of a fashion merchandiser cooperates with many different fields of the fashion industry. That’s why if you are searching for a more interesting kind of activity, something that’s more than just designing clothes or visiting fashion shows, fashion merchandising may be your piece of cake. But be very attentive while choosing an appropriate fashion merchandising college, try to use your wisdom in this uneasy task, because it may define your future profession and even you life. You should do your research before entering the fashion merchandising college, and beforehand check whether the school or program you are going to attend is properly accredited.
The notion that trends in fashion take part in a phenomenon known as the trickle down effect has long been recognised by fashion pundits. A process of social emulation of society’s upper echelons by the subordinates provides myriad incentives for perpetual and incessant changes in fashion through a sequence of novelty and imitation. Dior’s ‘New Look’ of 1947 consisted of creations that were only affordable to a minority of affluent women of the time. Fashion was governed by haute-couture designers and presented to the masses to aspire toward. However, this traditional prospective has been vigorously challenged by many throughout the fashion world. Revisionist observations have introduced a paradoxical argument that fashion trends have, on numerous occasions, inadvertently emerged from the more obscure spheres of society onto the glamorous catwalks of high-fashion designers.
These styles can originate from a range of unorthodox sources, from leather-jacketed punks and dramatic Goths, the teddy boys of the 1950s, to ethnic minority cultures from all edges of the globe. Styles that emerge from the bottom of the social hierarchy are increasingly bubbling up to become the status of high fashion. There has been significant concern over the implications of this so-called bubble-up effect, such as the ambiguity between the notions of flattering imitation and outright exploitation of subcultures and minority groups. Democratization and globalisation of fashion has contributed to the abrasion of the authenticity and original identity of street-style culture. The inadvertent massification of maverick ideas undermines the ‘street value’ of the fashions for the very people who originally created them.
The underlying definition of subculture, with regards to anthropology and sociology, is a group of people who differentiates from the larger prevailing culture surrounding them. Members of a subculture have their own shared values and conventions, tending to oppose mainstream culture, for example in fashion and music tastes. Gelder proposed several principal characteristics that subcultures portrayed in general: negative relations to work and class, association with their own territory, living in non-domestic habitats, profligate sense of stylistic exaggeration, and stubborn refusal of massification. Hebdige emphasised that the opposition by subcultures to conform to standard societal values has been slated as a negative trait, where in fact the misunderstood groups are only attempting to find their own identity and meaning. The divergence away from social normalcy has unsurprisingly proliferated new ideas and styles, and this can be distinctly observed through the existence of fashion diversity. Ethnicity, race, class and gender can be physical distinctions of subcultures. Furthermore, qualities which determine a subculture may be aesthetic, linguistic, sexual, political, religious, or a mixture of these factors.
Sigmund Freud and his nephew Edward Bernays investigated the drivers of social control and the engineering of consent. Their psychological theories provide insight into the causes of deviation, by members of a subculture, from social norms. They highlighted the irrationality of human beings and discovered that by tapping into their deepest desires, it is possible to manipulate unconscious minds in order to manage society. Freud believed that stimulating the unconscious was crucial to creating desire, and therefore is conducive to economic progress and mass democracy. Bernays argued that individual freedom was unattainable because it would be “too dangerous to allow human beings to truly express themselves”. Through various methods of advertising, a distinctive ‘majority’ can be created in society, where a person belonging to this group is perceived to be normal, conventional and conformist. By using techniques to satisfy people’s inner desires, the rise of widespread consumerism plays a part in the organized manipulation of the masses. However, through the unleashing of certain uncontrolled aggressive instincts, occasional irrationality emerged in groups, and this repudiation of the banalities of ordinary life is believed to be a key factor in the generation of subcultures.
The expansion of youth styles from subcultures into the fashion market is a real network or infrastructure of new kinds of commercial and economic institutions. The creation of new and startling styles will be inextricably linked to a process of production and publicity inevitably leading to the diffusion and spread of the subversive subculture trends. For example, both mod and punk innovations have become incorporated into high and mainstream fashion after the initial low-key emergence of such styles. The complexities of society perpetuate continuous change in style and taste, with different classes or groups prevailing during certain periods of time. To deal with the question of which is the most influential source of fashion, it is necessary to consider distribution of power. It is not the same for all classes to have access to the means by which ideas are disseminated in our society, principally the mass media. In history, the elites have had greater power to prescribe meaning and dictate what is to be defined as normality.
Trickling down to shape the views of the substantial passive parts of the population, designers from high places were able to set trends that diffused from the upper to lower spectrum of society. Subcultures, it was suggested, go against nature and are subject to abhorrence and disapproval by followers of mainstream trends. Regrettably, criminal gangs, homeless subcultures and reckless skateboarders, among other ‘negative’ portrayals of subcultures have been accused of dragging down the image of other ‘positive’ subcultures which demonstrate creativity and inspiration. There is an unstable relationship between socialising and de-socialising forces. Nevertheless, German philosopher Kant observed that actual social life should and always will consist of in some way its own opposite asocial life, which he described as “unsociable sociality”.
Without doubt, fashion exhibits a dichotomy of conformity and differentiation, with contradictory groups aspiring to fit in and stand out from a crowd. Previously, the pace of change that fashion went through has spawned social emulation, a phenomenon whereby subordinate groups follow a process of imitation of the fashion tastes adopted by the upper echelons of society. Veblen, a Norwegian-American sociologist and economist, criticized in detail the rise of consumerism, especially the notion of conspicuous consumption, initiated by people of high status. Another influential sociologist Georg Simmel, classified two basic human instincts – the impetus to imitate one’s neighbours, and conversely, the individualistic behaviour of distinguishing oneself.
Simmel indicated the tendency towards social equalization with the desire for individual differentiation and change. Indeed, to elucidate Simmel’s theory of distinction versus imitation, the distinctiveness of subcultures in the early stages of a set fashion assures for its destruction as the fashion spreads. An idea or a custom has its optimal innovative intensity when it is constrained to a small clandestine group. After the original symbolic value of the idea has been exploited by commercialisation and accepted as a part of mass culture, the balance will have a tendency to tip towards imitation over distinction. An example of the imitation of a distinctive subculture is the evolution of blue jeans, which originating from humble American cowboys and gold-miners, demonstrate a bubble-up effect of a subculture. On a larger scale, it can be said that Western style dressing ‘bubbled-up’ from 19th Century Quaker’s attire, rather than ‘trickling down’ from the styles of Court aristocracy.
Simmel describes fashion as a process by which the society consolidates itself by reintegrating what disrupts it. The existence of fashion requires that some members of society must be perceived as superior or inferior. From economist Harvey Leibenstein’s perspective, fashion is a market constituted of ‘snobs’. The phenomenon of ‘snob-demand’ depicts consumers as snobs who will stop buying a product when the price drops too much. The trickle down effect has been related to a ‘band-wagon effect’ where the turnovers of a product are particularly high as a result of imitation. Every economic choice is bound not only to the pure computational rationality of individuals, but is influenced by irrational factors, such social imitation, contrary to what Simmel calls the ‘need for distinction’. However, a ‘reverse bandwagon effect’ acts as an opposing force when a snobbish consumer stops buying a product because too many others are buying it as well. The resultant force depends on the relative intensity of the two forces.
Subcultures have often endured a less than agreeable relationship with the mainstream as a result of exploitation and cultural appropriation. This often leads to the demise or evolution of a particular subculture once the originally novel ideas have been commercially popularised to an extent where the ideologies of the subculture have lost their fundamental connotations. The insatiable commercial hunger for new trends instigated the counterfeiting of subculture fashion, unjustifiably used on the sophisticated catwalks in fashion dictatorships of Paris, Milan and New York. It is not purely sartorial fashion but also music subcultures that are particularly vulnerable to the massification process. Certain types of music like jazz, punk, hip hop and rave were only listened to by minority groups at the initial stages of its history.
Events in history have had substantial impacts on the rise, development and evolution of subcultures. The First World War had an impact on men’s hairstyles as lice and fleas were ubiquitous in wartime trenches. Those with shaved heads were presumed to have served at the Front while those with long hair were branded cowards, deserters, and pacifists. During the 1920s, standard social etiquettes were discarded by certain youth subcultures, as drink, drugs and jazz infiltrated America, intensified by the alcohol prohibition of the time. A crime subculture emerged as smugglers discovered profit opportunities with Mexican and Cuban drug plantations. The Great Depression of the late 20s in North America caused pervasive poverty and unemployment. Consequently, a significant number of adolescents discovered identity and expression through urban youth gangs, such as the ‘dead end kids’.
Existentialists like Camus and Sartre also played a significant part in influencing the subcultures of the 1950s and 60s. Emphasis on freedom of the individual created a version of existential bohemianism resembling the beat generation. This subculture represented a version of bohemian hedonism; McClure declares that “non-conformity and spontaneous creativity were crucial”. In literature, Steinbeck’s “The Grapes of Wrath” depicted the economic hardship of these times. Initially burned and banned to American citizens, condemned as communist propaganda, this book was given the Nobel Prize for literature in 1962. It only took a few decades for the previously socially unacceptable book to diffuse into mainstream culture.
The popularisation of folk and cowboy songs led to their unique underlying patterns being mixed with elements of jazz, blues and soul, creating a new subculture of western swing. Technological progress facilitated “instantaneous mass media creating large subcultures from the ideas of a range of smaller subcultures”. Accordingly, a bubble-up effect can be seen where, through a process of innovation and diffusion, original ideas can spread into mass culture.
The process of integration has a potential to lead to the polarisation of warring subcultures, contributing to social disorganization. Shaw and Mckay assessed that although their data is not sufficient to determine “the extent to which membership in delinquent gangs produces delinquency”, membership is probably a contributing factor. They use the term ‘differential social organisation’ to depict how subculture formation is a result of broader economic and demographic forces that undermine conventional local institutions of control.
The institution of the family is weakened by these forces, and as a result, alternatives to the traditional family have arisen as various subcultures. Ethan Watters elucidated this social trend in his book defining urban tribes as “groups of never-married’s between the ages of 25 and 45 who gather in common-interest groups and enjoy an urban lifestyle”. Analysis of the long term perspective of street trends reveal that youth trends bubble-up every five to ten years, and that individualism, anarchy and self-realization, are universal in these trends.
In the process of bubbling up, there are two important concepts to consider, that of ‘diffusion’ and ‘defusion’. Fashion diffusion focuses on the individual and the crowd, particularly in this case the spreading of fashion in a systematic way from small scale to large scale institutions. It highlights the idea that fashion innovation and creativity drawn from subcultures are integrated into mass culture. In the process, non-conformist fashion may be subject to defusion, a diluting of the fundamental intrinsic meaning of the original subculture. The commercialisation of fashion is especially central to the danger of decontextualisation of trend origins. For example, the wearing of ripped jeans, an accepted form of attire nowadays, does not necessarily relate to the image of ‘hippies’ in modern times. The concept of identity and its modifications and transformations after a period of time should be carefully considered.
Analysis of street style is another fundamental aspect in determining the extent of a bubble-up effect in fashion. It is an idea that opposes the view that high fashion has given way to popular culture. Polhemus proposed that “styles which start life on the street corner have a way of ending up on the backs of top models on the world’s most prestigious fashion catwalks”. Prior to this new train of thought, the predominant view was that new looks began with couture and ‘trickle down’ to the mass market mainline fashion industry. Polhemus suggested that the evidence he found gave insight to a chain of events; initially genuine street innovation appears, followed by the featuring in mass media, such as magazines or television programmes, of street kids. In time, the ritzy version of the original idea makes an appearance, as a part of a top designer’s collection.
Polhemus identified two basic street-styles involving dressing up or dressing down. Those from a relatively affluent sector of society, such as the Beatniks and Hippies developed a penchant for the latter, preferring to descend down the socio-economic ladder in the interest of authenticity. Nowadays, the variety of attire seen on streets and nightclubs show that culture is no longer only a prerogative of the upper class. Although, the creatively democratic society that we progress towards optimizes fashion innovation, cynics of the bubble-up effect, such as Johnny Stuart, condemned in his book on rockers, “the fancy fashionable versions of the Perfecto which you see all over the place, dilute the significance, taking away its original magic, castrating it”.
Social crises of the 1950s and 1970s brought about new ideological constructions in response to the worsening economy, scarcity of jobs, loss of community, and the failure of consumerism to satisfy real needs. Racism became a solution to the problems of working-class life. Such periods of social turmoil resulted in fashion defusion, with many subcultures becoming increasingly detached from their foundation symbolisms. The connotations of the attire of the teddy boys during the 1970s bore little resemblance to the style of 1956. The original narcissistic upper-class style was somewhat irrevocably lost in a wave of ‘second generation teds’ that preferred fidelity to the classic ‘bad-boy’ stereotypes. The concept of specificity, subcultures responding to circumstances at distinctive moments in history, is depicted as vital to the study of subcultures.
Therefore the resultant mass-consumed item may draw distance from the emblem of the original subculture, attainable to all who can afford it. The loss of identity may prove to be a serious problem as subcultures may feel exploited, estranged and meaningless without a sense of belonging. Subcultures established a sense of community to certain individuals during a new post-war age that witnessed the deterioration of traditional social groupings. Polhemus claims that subcultures like Teddy Boys, Mods, Rockers, Skinheads, Rockabillies, Hipsters, Surfers, Hippies, Rastafarians, Headbangers, Goths, etc, as “social phenomenon style tribes cannot be dismissed as something transitory”. Known as the Kogal phenomenon, a subculture emerged where groups of young girls between the ages of 15 and 18 appeared on the streets of Tokyo with long dyed-brown or bleached-blond hair, tanned skin, heavy makeup, brightly coloured miniskirts or short pants that flare out at the bottom, and high platform boots.
‘Field’ has become more appropriate in the analysis of fashion changes. People engaged in similar lifestyles with intrinsically similar cultural capital, i.e. nationality, profession, family and friends form group identities interacting with others in the same ‘field’. This has been an important contributing factor to the birth of subcultures.The anachronistic belief that class was a determinant of fashion has reduced significantly, as confirmed by Bauman, who proposed the idea of ‘liquid society’, where fashion exists in a more flexible and malleable state.
A particular phenomenon of recent times, subject to both a trickle-down and a bubble-up effect of varying degrees, is the democratization and globalization of fashion. There has been an emergence of ‘prêt-a-porter’ invented by John Claude Weill in 1949. This development has increased the speed and diffusion of fashion trends across the world, which amplified the culture of fast fashion, massification and global standardisation. Standardised factory-made prêt-a-porter clothes, of which ‘wearability’ is crucial, sometimes descend from places of high fashion, for example inspired from couture. Designers such as Poiret, Dior and Lacroix produce a ready-to-wear line alongside their haute couture collection to take advantage of a wider market. Nevertheless, its mass-produced industrial nature detracts away from the exclusivity of traditional couture.
By 1930, couturiers like Schiaparelli, Delauney, and Patou began to design their own ready-to-wear boutiques, understanding the new emerging system of fashion whereby the moment that people stop copying you, it means that you are no longer any good. The democratization of couture disallowed it to sustain its elitist nature and therefore haute couture was beginning to accept that fashion was about emulation. Nevertheless, attire was not entirely uniform and equalised. Subtle nuances continued to mark social distinctions but mitigated the upper class penchant for conspicuous consumption.
Democratising fashion came hand in hand with a ‘disunification’ of feminine attire, which varied more in form and became less homogeneous. The fundamental attraction of making profit inspired innovation in styles and a perpetual search for lower costs through efficient industrial manufacturing. Institutions were evolving to an extent that the pretentious elitist sectors diminished in favour of universal mass production. The end of the Second World War brought about increased demand for fashion, encouraged by films and magazines of the time and the take off of global advertising campaigns, i.e. Levi’s, Rodier, Benetton, Naf-Naf, etc, highlighting the need for high standards of living, well-being and hedonistic mass culture. It is the globalisation and rapidity of fashion movements, as Kawamura amply discussed, that underline the fact that “fast-changing tastes of consumers are matched only by the cleverness of the department store that identifies trendsetters among young consumers and feeds their knowledge into the production cycle”.
It is impossible to conduct discourse in fashion without associating it with change, unpredictability and a high degree of uncertainty. It is very difficult to distinguish which goods will be adorned by the mass population and which trends will be instantaneously rejected. In general, industries need economic capital and political solidarity to function but these institutions are particularly difficult to uphold in the aesthetic industry. A paradox exists in that while on a superficial level everyone associates fashion with change, the underlying forces value stability. They argue that it is not possible to speak of one single fashion, but rather of different fashions existing at the same time. This is especially the case for an intrinsically fast-paced, competitive and fragmented industry. A bubble-up effect is inherent to a globalised fashion world, and the upward flow of fashion stemming from various subcultures contributes abundantly to this process.
A career in the fashion industry sounds glamorous and lucrative. Have you consider getting into the fashion industry, but might think that you cannot manage it? There are so many different roles and positions that you can play in the fashion world. One does not necessarily be a fashion designer but still be able to have a very success career in the fashion industry.
Being able to make a living with things you like is always enjoyable. If you are a fashion fan and love to see beautiful clothing, accessories or sketches around you, you should consider starting a career in the fashion world. Below are some key roles in the fashion world where you can take part in – from design, production, marketing, to many more.
This is one of the most high profile jobs in the fashion industry. Designers are responsible for conceptualizing their ideas on trends and realizing them on their final products. Designers can be employed by companies which own a group of designers, or work for their own brand and production line, or, even as a freelancer providing designs for difference companies.
1. Apparel designers: Obviously these are clothing designers, ranging from lingerie, sports wear, casual wear to high fashion couture, for men, women and kids.
2. Footwear designers: They design footwear for men, women and kids from a style point of view, as well as from a foot-health’s perspective.
3. Accessory designers: Accessories has a broad definitely – from handbags, hat, eyewear to gloves, scarves and jewelry pieces.
Production involves the sampling of garments and accessories until producing the final pieces that would deliver to shops and customers. This massive work involves a team of various professions:
1. Merchandiser: Merchandisers play a key role in the production process of a fashion product.They are responsible for buying raw materials for production, selecting fabric, textiles and trims. They have to make decisions based on pricing, quality and latest trend and innovation of raw materials.
2. Technical Designers: Technical designers are the one responsible for doing fittings during the whole sampling to production procedure. They might not be the one who designed the garment but are the experts in providing alternative to the garment to improve the fitting of garment.
3. Pattern Makers: Pattern is the basis for a garment to be sewed. Pattern makers produce and maintain patterns for garments that designers have sketched out. Pattern makers are key persons in realization of a garment.
4. Pattern Graders: The sizing of garment starts with the pattern grading. Pattern graders are experts in creating size specifications for different sizes. They are vital persons in for any fashion brands, as a consistent sizing across products can maintain customer loyalty and confidence.
5. Fitting Models: Ultimately garments and footwear are made for putting comfort and style together. Fitting is a crucial part in fashion industry and the most precise fitting is to use model as the body for fitting.
Many companies have their own dedicated models for fitting their lines, who has the exact sizing measurement the brand requires. Sometimes you would see ads looking for sampling models, from kids, men, women to plus size models.
6. Quality Control Specialists: Quality control is of top importance for any sort of products, and is no exception in fashion industry. Quality control specialists look at the quality of raw materials, like peeling, shrinking and color fading of textile and overall quality of a fashion item, for instance, the overall assembling of an accessory item.
7. Planners: Fashion planners coordinate closely with designers, merchandisers and buyers to decide the production plan for the coming seasons. They look at both production and marketing side while paying close attention to the latest fashion trend.
Marketing is as important as making a perfect piece of fashion item. Whether it’s marketing in a wholesale or retail side, people in fashion marketing bears the mission of promoting the fashion item into this fast changing world.
1. Fashion Buyer/ Retail Merchandisers: Product merchandisers are the ones who buy ready-made products to be sold in a shop like department stores. These merchandisers conduct researches and analyze market trend, the relative customer wants and stocks. They bear huge responsibility in terms of profit making, since having the eye to buy the right product for sales can make a difference in revenue.
2. Showroom Sales Specialists: Some brands own their showrooms, displaying their collection for fashion buyers (wholesalers) to make their orders. Compared with retail sales, showroom sales specialists should know their seasonal returning customer better and be able provide detailed information on the selling collections.
3. Retail Store Manager/ Boutique Owners: Retail shop manager, sales and boutique owners are the first line personnel facing retail customers like you and me.
Besides in the field of designing, producing or marketing a fashion item, one might be attracted by other positions like as a writer of fashion magazine, online blogs and fashion event management etc. Below is a list highlighting the other possible jobs related to fashion industry:
1. Fashion Writers: Writers or freelance writers can write for magazines, online blogs or sites on reviews, trends and recommendations. Fashion writers can also develop into fashion magazine editors.
2. Personal Stylists:Some department stores provide personal styling services while some private customer would employ personal stylist giving them recommendations in personal styling.
3. Fashion event Management/ Public Relations: There are nameless fashion events which requires professional public relations and event management personnel to take care of. There are PR companies specialized in holding fashion related events.
Besides the above mentioned careers in the fashion industry, there are still many other opportunities like photographer, costume designer and catalog/ fashion show models, etc. One of the most reachable way to keep yourself updated with job opportunities and fashion trend is to be active in fashion forum and subscribe to fashion magazines.
A fashion marketing internship is one of the quickest ways to break into the ultra-competitive fashion industry It’s a giant industry that is completely dependent on the professional fashion-designers, marketers and retail merchandisers. What is created as a masterpiece by its expert wardrobe designers remains a far-fetched dream for the customers unless it is made available on the floor of showrooms. But it needs team work especially of the dexterous marketers, who are responsible for the extreme success. It is extensive training imparted to the selected individuals, which creates an army of skilled marketing executives, and this training begins with a fashion marketing internship.
These executives attend the lectures and learn all the strategies to promote business. To join the apparel industry, the new entrants need a degree or they have to undergo short-term fashion marketing internship program. Also known as merchandising professionals, these fashion-apparel-promoting marketers, conduct marketing research to identify new trends of fashion so that stylish wardrobes can be introduced in the market. They dwell on the mood of fashion-loving people, especially the young generation, for stylish fashion-dresses. Such kind of extensive survey helps the expert-designers read the psychology of customers and thus help the fashion-designing specialists create superbly developed fashion wardrobes.
Before embarking on a career in fashion marketing, one must understand what it they would be doing and why fashion marketers are so important. Creation of a stylish wardrobe is only half done if the items are not supplied in the market for sales. The marketing is shouldered by the retail merchandisers, who look for a market. Flooding the market with attractive fashion products can not yield any result unless immense curiosity is aroused among the people. This is the job which indispensably is accomplished by the retail merchandisers in order to promote sales of attire. These marketers popularize the exquisitely-designed fashions through internet. In order to attract the customers, these merchandisers highlight the outstanding features of latest wardrobes that in turn blooms the business unbelievably. And as part of a fashion marketing internship, the intern will be mirroring the professional performing these tasks, and possibly taking part in them.
The retail merchandisers inspect the market and make sure that the demand for a trendy wardrobe is met at every cost. Another important issue which the marketers focus their attention on is the price. The retailers often charge arbitrarily and this affects the business in an unfavorable way. Being aware of such acts going on in the market, the retail merchandisers can conduct raid at the blacklisted showrooms, and expect the fashion marketing intern to monitor their actions. If they find any defiance of ‘legal & fair trade practices’ norms, then they impose heavy fines and take legal action against the culprit.
In order to let the fashion fans keep in touch with the newly introduced fashion line, the fashion marketing internship team is expected to keep updating the website regularly, highlighting the code of dress, price and discount as well. To redress grievances of the dissatisfied-customers the fashion- companies mention on their sites their E-mail address and phone numbers also so that customers can communicate their problems.
If you are a fresh off your first fashion marketing internship or right out of fashion school and curiously looking for a lucrative job, do submit your resume to fashion houses, fashion pr firms, and the lke. As retail merchandisers are the backbone of fashion industry, you can be considered for respective posts with great honor. If you hold a degree in fashion design and are courteous, have an eye for style and a keen knack for business, the fashion marketing has got to be your destination. If you have no certificate or degree in the fashion-designing then you should go for 2 to 4 years course in respective field to herald a career in fashion industry, or at least take on a fashion marketing internship while you are studying another line of work.

I was at the city of my university for some days – that was the reason for my delay. I´ll try to upload new things (finish sketches I started there) as soon as possible.
//unsure whats out there and what would benefit him most. Am looking forwards to the +5 dodge AC also
The only +AC boots I've seen in-game (that weren't DM upgrades) were Boots of the Underdog, which were +3 dodge AC. Not common, dropped by some poor slob that I killed, many moons ago.
If you can make the AC upgrade via DM and components, getting effects that are restricted on vouchers can be helpful (eg; Immunity to Knockdown, Immunity to Electricity, etc). Such boots can be found already.
So its the best fit for what he does. What gets him most times are those damn slimes in the demon realm. They insist on stoning him
Personally, several of mine need and use the Boots of Springing & Striding. Others use the ones with Imp Evasion and Mobility, Immunity to Knockdown(though they later changed to the necklace), Immunity to Electricity, or have footwear made with Vouchers.
If you want to just upgrade some boots already IG, I'd suggest those with Improved Evasion and Mobility, although rare to find. (Improved Evasion being one of those feats that you aren't allowed to obtain by upgrade nor on a custom item.) Then you can upgrade with attributes like CON or DEX or even WIS up to +10 total, get that upgrade to +5 AC (Dodge), and tack on various skills at 5 points each times 6 skills, like Hide MS or Tumble etc (sum up to 30), or a +3 to All Skills. Also, upgrades like the Dodge Feat, or Freedom, or even Sneak Attack +3d6 might be useful. Then, upgrades of +30 to acid, fire, electrical or other elemental resistances can be done. Something like that is what I'll be doing for my wizard.
On my ranger-rogue-sd 'scout' I'll be making custom boots something like this: Boots of Springing Ability (+12,000 to cost), 50% Immunity to Slashing (other custom items of mine will have 50% imm to Bludgeoning, Piercing, Acid, and maybe Fire), Bonus Spell Slots for Ranger, mostly to be used for Camo, Mass Camo, or Magic Fang. Also, Haste 3-5 times a day, Teleport and Transference both 5xday. These boots should work well for my scout's traveling, hiding, and protection needs, and will probably have some description that tells them as blessed of Gort and Andra. Then I'll upgrade them with CON and DEX and skills, etc. So for a monk, you could tailor something appropriate like that. I've been told that the most useful elemental resistance to have maxed (50% on a custom item, or at least the 30 by upgrade) is Acid, because of those Dark Realm oozes.
As to your petrifaction issue, really the Statuebreaker's Cloak is your only solution. I'm not sure if that cloak can be upgraded in any way, as some of those scripty items are not very compatible with upgrading. What I'm doing for my both my wizard and my scout is to shift any feature that I've been using via cloaks on to other items, so that I may regularly wear the Statuebreaker's Cloak.
BTW, I've never seen any Boots of anti-Knockdown, so I wouldn't count on finding them anymore. Anti-Knockdown comes only from the Amulet now, although that Amulet can take upgrades. About the Boots of Striding and Springing, I know that you can get this feature on a custom item, but I'm not sure if the Boots that you find IG can be upgraded, since they seem to be one of those scripty items.
Believe these are the Immunity to KD Boots; should still be available as they are listed in Crafting section too:
I'd be interested to know if these are indeed Immunity to Knockdown boots, and if they may still be crafted. Being not familiar with any crafting except armor and traps, and since both the Dwarf-Maker DM Upgrades list and the Custom Item list forbid adding the Imm KD property to anything as an upgrade or via custom, I didn't know that any Imm KD item could be crafted.
Raiden is well upgraded. he has the 30 to elemental resists already and with 25 lvls of monk and 5 of SD he has the dodge, mobility and epic dodge also
I see now that for your monk, those Boots of Evasion would not be the most useful option, as those would most benefit a character without dodgey-type feats (like my wizard).
That's true because neither the Imm KD nor the Impr Evasion properties may be added by upgrade (nor by custom item).
So you may not put either of these two properties onto an item (that didn't already have the property).
But if you have items with each of those properties on it, you may upgrade those items (with other qualities).
The only caveat to that being asked us not to upgrade player's earthroot boots with AC, as the boots stick you to the ground, which makes for a harder time doing dodgey stuff.
MannyJabrielle wrote: The only caveat to that being asked us not to upgrade player's earthroot boots with AC, as the boots stick you to the ground, which makes for a harder time doing dodgey stuff.
If that is the case, I would go with the Necklace vs KD and then Grounded Boots (Immunity to Lightning), Winged Boots, or the ones that allow you to change binding locations (or vouher). Add +5 AC to both the necklace and boots via upgrades, if you do not mind the component hunts.
Just to mention it again, in reference to potentially upgrading the Winged Boots, if you use an item with a specially-scripted appearance or action, it would be wise to ask a DM to make sure that it can be upgraded without issue.
I'd been told that certain scripted item appearances like the Circlet will be deactivated if the item is upgraded with additional properties, and who knows what other scripted action property might be voided.

Quite true. Manny upgraded a circlet for me yesterday, and informed me that I would need a redesign for it to work properly. Sadly, the circlet does not work in the helmet redesign system as it does not occupy the actual slot. This will require another DM intervention. *sigh*
The circlets can be upgraded, but the upgrades won't be used if using the VFX version...you have to turn that option off (;;option headvfx) so that the helm gets equipped like a normal NWN helm.
In the VFX version, the properties of those items are applied via scripting based on the item's tag and possibly blueprint resref, and in-game additions aren't handled by that scripting (it affects the PC "skin" item that I use for a bunch of things, like ioun stones and subrace traits, so all the scripting for it has to be carefully integrated).
Yes, as mentioned, the helmet has to be worn as a regular helmet for any upgrades applied to the item to be applied to the character. That's why I said the ;;option headvfx toggle had to be turned off.
Apologies if I wasn't specific in saying that you had to KEEP the option toggled off and wear the helm normally to get the bonus to apply to the character :-/

Not a problem; simply too dense to understand directions. Still, I may request a sub helm, as this one cannot be altered in appearance. It ain't bad, but I want to be content with something as permanent on display.
The Z1 Frameset is stiff enough for optimal pedaling efficiency yet smooth and compliant to keep you comfortable and riding strong on those long days in the saddle. That winning combination is why many Pros have raced the Z Series at the highest levels of the sport. The Z1's UHC Ultimate+Nano carbon fiber frame is built with Felt's Dynamic Monocoque Construction and forms the perfect chassis for your next dream bike.
InsideOut is a revolutionary internally optimized molding process that completely eliminates excess material, and therefore weight, inside the frame tubes and junctions. Placing polyurethane inserts inside the frame during the molding process—especially at the bottom bracket and head tube area—and then applying a precise amount of pressure and heat results in perfectly formed tubes, inside and out.
Modular Monocoque Construction is an advanced carbon fiber manufacturing technique that allows Felt to mold individual sections of the frameset and then join them together. The main advantage of MMC is that it allows each section to be optimized to meet the specific engineering demands of that particular section of the frame.
UHC Ulimate+ Nano is the mark of Felt’s lightest, stiffest, best performing frames. UHC stands for Ultra Hybrid Carbon, and as the name indicates these frames feature a hybrid blend of high modulus raw carbon fiber. The stiffest fibers are used in certain areas of the frame, more durable fibers in others. Nano refers to a proprietary resin matrix that increases frame strength at the molecular level.
Felt’s DuPont paint is the highest quality paint offered on Felt products. Reserved for our top-of-the-line bicycles, DuPont paint offers unparalleled clarity and durability in a multitude of colors.
The Barbados wind beats to the same rhythm of the boom-box buses that rumble past the Barbados Yacht Club each day. It starts, it stops, it turns around, all the time going in no particular direction. You pick it up and take it one way only to find it is taking you in the wrong direction. It pulsates like the booming bass beat. It is hot and humid.
For the majority of sailors at the 2017 OK Dinghy World Championships in Barbados, it has been hard to make sense of the wind, but one person has shown an uncanny ability to be in the right place every time, and sail his boat faster than anyone else.
Discarding a third place in the 79-boat fleet Nick Craig, from Britain, dominated the series for perhaps his most convincing win ever. This is his fifth OK Dinghy world crown and perhaps the sweetest yet as he becomes the first person in the 60 year history of the class to win five world titles.
The defending champion, Jim Hunt, sailed an impressive series as well, never below fifth, and put together a scoreline that in most years would have easily won him the title. Third place Luke O’Connell, from New Zealand, led a strong Kiwi challenge with five boats inside the top ten.
Only one race was possible on the final day in perhaps the most capricious wind of the week. Jørgen Svendsen, of Denmark, led the race all the way until the final beat when Hunt and Craig sneaked past as the wind started to go even more patchy and shifty. Hunt took his second victory of the week, while O’Connell took third as Svendsen was an early starter.
The race team tried to start the final race, but the conditions and the time were against them. Eventually they admitted defeat and at 14.50, the end of the regatta was signalled and the start of the race to the beach to get the first boat into the containers.
O’Connell said, “It’s been a tough week, I am pleased to come away with third. The middle of the week was pretty bad for me. I don’t know what happened there really. But it was great sailing here. Nick and Jim sailed super well and nick definitely deserved to win.”
Paying tribute to Craig, Hunt said “It’s fantastic isn’t it. He just outsailed every one all week. He’s just been a bit more on it all week, starting better, being in the right place at the right time. He hasn’t really missed anything. He was quick downwind, there were not really any holes in his game, which is a bit of a shame, as if he hadn’t been here I would have looked quite good.”
New World Champion, Craig, said, “Fantastic day, absolutely delighted. It was always a little tense as I needed a 12th which is just the kind of thing where you could be too conservative and end up having a 20th, so I got an average start which was just good enough, got a lane, and went up to about fifth at the windward mark and then just sailed really conservatively and just sailed near Jim as well partly because he always goes the right way and because if he was deep or going well then I would be matching him. So it worked out really nicely.”
“I think it was a tricky week because it was very shifty and we had weed challenges, but overall it’s just a fantastic place so sail. It’s so warm, the water is warm, beer is cold; it’s fantastic. I really enjoyed myself.”
Next year the class heads to Warnemunde in Germany, for the 2018 World Championship, one of the classes favourite venues.
Even as the OK Dinghies were packed away in their containers to begin their long journeys home, their spaces on the beach were slowly being filled with Finns for the start of the Finn World Masters on Friday.

The Internet has radically transformed our world. We are now more connected and exposed to more information than we’ve ever been before. This reality has rendered many of the world’s traditional institutions of power ripe for disruption. The Internet itself, however, is built upon and accessed through centralized infrastructure susceptible to government and institutional oversight and manipulation. In order to maximally leverage the disruptive and regenerative potential that technology affords us, decentralized technologies and infrastructure must be built and properly implemented.
Join us for a panel discussion on the regenerative potential of decentralized technologies such as blockchain, cryptocurrency and smart contracts.

This is an exquisite sparkling wine made from 52% Chardonnay and 48% Pinot Noir, concocted into a special blend and aged for almost six years in oak cask. After disgorgement it was given another five months to sit in bottle before release. It has such freshness on the palate, such enviable acidity, that it’s hard to believe the grapes were picked so long ago. Crisp apple dominates, with just a trace of yeastiness on the nose and palate. This is a delicious wine.
L'Ermitage, Roederer Estate's special Tête de Cuvée, is a sparkling wine made only in exceptional years from pre-selected, estate-grown grapes. Carrying on the tradition of Champagne Louis Roederer in France, Roederer Estate produces its sparkling wines in the traditional French methode and adds special oak-aged reserve wines to each blend.

Here’s a great article that helps explain why so many US- and Europe-based VCs are said to be keen on getting into Southeast Asia. It comes via Forbes in a guest post from Fenox Venture Capital’s Anis Uzzaman and Tom Maxim.
Go read the post now – if you didn’t yet – but basically it points out that China and India are seen as huge opportunities for VCs (thanks in no small part to billion-plus populations) but actually Southeast Asia (and Japan) also represent a real opportunity to invest in a fast-growing ecosystem.
We like to call Southeast Asia, “New Asia.” These countries have large populations, even larger economies, and are creating dynamic communities of entrepreneurs. Founders in this region, we’ve seen, are increasingly willing to take on risk and innovate.
Indonesia (a huge market with 250 million people) and Singapore (a financial hub) are focused on as two of the prime countries of interest:
Singapore, due to its strategic location, top-notch infrastructure and political stability, is the gateway to Southeast Asia. It’s a major financial hub, regarded by the World Bank as the friendliest place in the world to do business. Just as U.S. entrepreneurs prefer to incorporate their companies in Delaware, founders in Southeast Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and even India often opt to register their companies in Singapore. The Singapore government has been providing startups with substantial support, including office space, training, mentoring, and incubation programs, along with tax and funding incentives.
Indonesia, meanwhile, is on track to place among world’s 10 largest economies by 2050 according to McKinsey. With a population of 240 million, it’s the fourth most populous country in the world. The country’s middle class will grow from 45 million to 135 million by 2030. It’s poised to become the world’s third largest mobile market after India and China.
Southeast Asia as a whole has been increasing regional integration while improving its regulatory and business environment. New entrepreneurship communities have emerged in cities like Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta. Software developers cost a fraction of those in developed markets.
The truth is that Singapore and Indonesia stand out but there is more to the region. Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines are among the upcoming markets with fast-growing Internet populations and tech savvy consumers.
At the recent 500 Startups Geeks On A Plane event in Southeast Asia, it was refreshing to see just how many of the ‘foreigners’ were actually investors or entrepreneurs already involved in the region. That illustrates that Southeast Asia is increasingly becoming a place where those with money to spend, seeking to invest or in search of a challenge want to be due to the fantastic opportunities that can be had here.
It doesn’t have the sheer market size of China or India, but – as the Forbes piece explains – the sheer growth and possibilities are already attracting many.
A recent Business Insider article on how tech is the “great equalizer” got me thinking. The effects of technology are all the more profound in Asia, where many of the things that we take for granted in the West are often not available.... Continue →
Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves, even when we risk disappointing others.
Everything that pushes up out of the earth I love. Everything under the earth, root vegetables, I love to cook.
The essence of romantic love is that wonderful beginning, after which sadness and impossibility may become the rule.
Lovers of air travel find it exhilarating to hang poised between the illusion of immortality and the fact of death.

If you need to relax, loosen up and luxuriate in a few of the best surf the world has to offer, head down to Nosara, Costa Rica, to the Harbor Reef Surf Hotel. National Geographic has named this spot one of the high 20 browsing spots on the earth. This specialty surf hotel specializes in offering a surf retreat on the west coast of Costa Rica. Tucked away from the touristic Tamarindo, Nosara presents peace and refuge and the true essence of Costa Rica. Venture into the nearby jungle for zip lining, or loosen up on the pristine beachside to absorb the sounds of the waves. Whether you're a newbie or a complicated surfer, these waves are welcoming to everyone. It's no thriller why celebrities are shopping for properties on this heavenly hideaway. This licensed green hotel is a high Trip Advisor choice known for its hospitality.,patagonia lincoln nh ﻿Let My People Go Surfing is a shifting autobiography, agreat business e book, and uplifting blueprint for hope! I first heard about Yvon Chouinard over thirty years ago, after I was working in the Canadian Rockies.,patagonia ethics There are two most important elements of the proper ski jacket. The jacket should present insulation from the cold and be waterproofed from the elements. While many ski jackets seem like they're both heat and made of material to maintain out melting snow, there are just a few that function higher than others. Northface, Columbia, Patagonia and Marmot are all manufacturers of ski jackets that embody liners or shells inside the jackets themselves to behave as an added layer of protection. The best ski jackets are made of Gore-Tex material, which acts as a repellent for wind, rain and snow. Brands made with this cloth are very best.,
No one can really agree where Chilean Patagonia begins. Much of the south of this long, skinny country is jagged shoreline, uninhabited islands, roads that come to dead ends, and impenetrable forests and ice fields. The lake district seems to be like a mirror picture of Argentina's, although German settlers have left their mark on the church buildings and homes of Frutillar , Puerto Octay and Puerto Varas. These cities (and Pucón to the north) are near a series of national parks that defend the lakes and forested slopes of the Villarrica and Puyehue volcanoes. Trekking, cycling, kayaking and rafting trips are simple to organise from any of the cities, and Pachamagua , in Puerto Varas, is a canyoning specialist.,patagonia lincoln nh ﻿Driving south on Duquesne Rd in the Santa Cruz County sector of the Coronado National Forest in Southern Arizona one comes upon a broad, grassy plain which looks more prefer it belongs in the grasslands of the Great Plains moderately than in the mountains of Southern Arizona.
Whatever season you are mountaineering in, it's a good idea to carry the proper outerwear for when you may want it. A light-weight, waterproof jacket can shield your pores and skin from wind and light rain, making it appropriate for short hikes the place you anticipate pleasant weather. When mountaineering with heavy rain expected, take along waterproof outwear, comparable to rain pants and a rain poncho or jacket. In the winter, when chilly temperatures are frequent, you'll need to take waterproof, insulated outer layers, equivalent to a coat and overalls, together with an extra mid layer similar to a fleece jacket, sweatshirt or long-sleeve shirt.

Our goal is to help professionals and the public to keep up with the most recent findings on fluorides as well as some previous science that has been overlooked or has been classified.
In this series, we cover retail trends from NRF 2018. Part 1 highlights our store tour. Part 2 brings insights from Expo and Stages. And Part 3 covers the exhibits and sessions of Retail 2020.
In NRF 2018, the Innovation Lab and Sessions were designed to show retailers where they need to be by 2020. As Ann Marie Stevens, founder of Retail Innovation Lounge says:
Emily Culp was the innovator beyond Rebecca Minkoff high-tech store. Today she’s Chief Marketing Officer of Keds Shoes. How does she spend her time? Watching shoppers!
The secret to success, according to Culp, is learning the pain points in the Customer Journey. Then do something about it – first in process and then with technology.
This is true even for old school brands such as Sonic Automotive. The Eco Park facility was designed to take out the pain of shopping for a pre-owned car.
“Communication and organizational alignment are critical. With transparency in the pricing process, we battled the negative perceptions and also injected the positive.” – Marti Eulberg, Director Brand Management, Sonic Automotive.
Retail 2020 Innovation Lab featured interactive booths by the stages of the Customer’s Journey – Awareness, Consideration, Engagement, Service, and Post-Purchase.
This year, the key themes were 360 view of the customer with AI Analytics, Voice Search, and Mobile Apps. The Innovation Lab felt familiar. And yet this is the year where fantasy turned into deployment. We are starting to see these technologies in stores.
To respond dynamically to customers, the leading retailers are already deploying Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning.
Visual Search is a side-effect of Vision Analytics, which is the core of driverless cars. It helps to find products even when they don’t know what to search for. This is an advanced search for unstructured data, and indication of how far we can go with advanced analytics.
How often did you find a shoe that fits? If you are like my mother, it takes five runs to the store and a couple of returns to Amazon. When she finally finds something she like, by next season it is no longer available. The 3D Scanner creates a customize assessment of each feet, which can be printed with a 3D printer.
The 3D Scanner is a win-win solution. Customers get shoes that are customized to their individual needs. And the retailer gets a lot of personal information, which can be tailored for future sales. The technology is already available in more than 1000 stores. It’s rumored to increase sales by 21%.
Digital screens have taken over shopping malls, inside stores, and even over bathroom mirrors. But what would you do if you could digitalize your store window?
What if you could change the display for specific demographics? What if you could change the theme every hour? What if you could change the “Sale of the Day”?
The trend of “digitizing the store” is pushed forward by the marketing department. And yet, the most effective data-oriented disruptions are already in the store.
Internet of Things (IoT) is already a reality. A key theme in Store Operations is Dynamic Management, which means monitoring and measuring in real-time.
For example, Trax Retail and the Nielsen Company joined to provide Shelf Intelligence Platform. The system processes over 10 billion images, 125000 items, and 4000 metrics. The solution is versatile. It is deployed with mobile applications, fixed cameras on shelves, and in robots.
Smart fabrics, talking robots, and endless aisles are no longer in the realm of science fiction. There seems to be an endless debate whether retailers should be technology companies first.
Amazon is a technology first company. It’s is also a platform. Despite the media hype over Amazon Go, in NRF 2018 retailers were focused on next steps. This was the idea behind Retail 2020.
Should Retailers Care About AI Ethics? If you think retail success depends on being part of a social community, then YES
The panel with Tenzin Priyadarshi of MIT Media Lab, Francesca Rossi the AI Ethics Leader in IBM, and Anindya Ghose of NYU’s Stern School of Business, was serious.
The panel provided thought provoking views on Artificial Intelligence. What sort of data is feeding the system? “Good” vs. “Bad” is tested on a daily basis by the type of data and training of AI systems.
How Ethics be embedded in the system? How do we make the system “trust worthy” especially when the decision is made by AI? In medical applications, for example, IBM requires a human decision during the process.
As we see in the challenges of “Fake News”, owners of data are “biased”. What are the requirements for transparency? How do we know to ask the “Correct Question”?
According to the investors, the key is not technology but leadership. There are options to innovations in technology, and in process. Today, you can outsource almost everything to a solution provider and access the data in the Cloud.
“The advantage of digital brands is that data is a part of their DNA. And that data advantage is faster and faster because the brand has direct connections to their customers. If you hit on a concept, you can reach a million dollars in sales in the first month.” – Scott Friend, Bain Capital Market
A word of caution, however, is keeping the retailer’s unique identify. In Store 8, for example, Walmart created the environment for innovation. But incubators are not a panacea. Nor is being digital.
“Online digital business should be fully integrated with physical stores.” Scott Emmons, iLab Leader Neiman Marcus
Customers have many options, in product, pricing, and brands. The stores are evolving into a variety of distribution points and experience centers. The essence of retail is re-imagined.
“With that kind of change, and disruption, and volatility come enormous opportunity.” – Matt Shay, President NRF

With the advent of hydraulic-powered attachments such as a breaker, a grapple or an auger, the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation. Many excavators feature a quick coupler for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite. Excavators are usually employed together with loaders and bulldozers. Most wheeled, compact and some medium-sized (11 to 18-tonne) excavators have a backfill (or dozer) blade. This is a horizontal bulldozer-like blade attached to the undercarriage and is used for levelling and pushing removed material back into a hole.

APTA represents more than 100,000 members: physical therapists, physical therapist assistants, and students of physical therapy.
include a Maryland Chapter representative that will review just the Henry O. and Florence P. Kendall Practice Award.
This subcommittee meets approximately 2 time per year via conference call for 1 hour in the winter and spring.
Individuals appointed to this committee shall serve a two year term. No individual shall serve more than two consecutive terms.
The Awards Committee subcommittees will apply the criteria established by the Board of Directors (Board) for each association honor and award to each nomination received for each award under its purview and make recommendations regarding award recipients to the Board.
Review award nominations* received for each award that falls under the subcommittee's purview against the applicable criteria established by the Board of Directors.
When requested by the Board of Directors, review and make recommendations on proposals for new awards applicable to the subcommittee's award category and provide feedback on the utility of the criteria and measurement tools for existing awards within the subcommittee's purview.
*A nomination is the packet of materials submitted to APTA in response to the association's annual call for nominations for its honors and awards program. Each subcommittee works independently to review the received nominations that fall within its purview.
**A recommendation is what each Awards Committee Subcommittee brings to the Board after it has completed its review of all nominations for each honor or award under its purview. It is the Board's responsibility to either accept or reject recommendations.
The Practice and Service Awards Subcommittee will review nominations received for the following awards:
Henry O. and Florence P. Kendall Practice Award: The Henry O. and Florence P. Kendall Practice Award recognizes a physical therapy professional who has engaged in extensive clinical practice for a minimum of 15 years. Recipients of this award embody and demonstrate a commitment to developing physical therapy as a caring profession.
Lucy Blair Service Award: The Lucy Blair Service Award honors physical therapist members or physical therapist life members whose contributions to APTA are of exceptional quality. Qualifying contributions can pertain to association components, through work on appointed or elected positions and/or in other capacities at the association and component levels.
Marilyn Moffat Leadership Award: The Marilyn Moffat Leadership Award honors an individual held in high regard by his or her peers for distinguished leadership and significant contributions to the physical therapy profession and the association.
Outstanding Physical Therapist Assistant Award: The Outstanding Physical Therapist Assistant Award recognizes a physical therapist assistant who has provided clinical services for a minimum of 5 years. This award honors individual achievements in the areas of patient care, community service, and commitment toward the profession and association.
Outstanding Physical Therapist/Physical Therapist Assistant Team Award: The Outstanding Physical Therapist/Physical Therapist Assistant Team Award honors professionals who have individually provided clinical service for a minimum of 5 years, and have positively affected the quality of physical therapy through their combined teamwork during a period of at least 3 years. This award recognizes a PT/PTA team whose positive work has contributed to the delivery of high-quality physical therapist services.
APTA Humanitarian AwardEstablished in 2017, the APTA Humanitarian Award contributes to the association’s mission of advancing physical therapy by recognizing member efforts that focus on achieving a broad global impact upon humanity. This award will honor individuals who exemplify the compassionate nature of the physical therapy profession by actively expressing a commitment to humanity and exhibiting admirable degrees of selflessness in addressing key health concerns.
APTA Societal Impact AwardEstablished in 2017, the APTA Societal Impact Award fosters the association’s outward-facing vision and highlights the impact of physical therapy in improving quality of life. This award specifically recognizes individuals who exemplify the compassionate nature of the physical therapy profession by exhibiting a distinguished commitment toward philanthropic initiatives, raising public awareness on key societal issues, and demonstrating how physical therapy can be applied to address these issues.
All APTA appointed groups will conduct their work with the Association Organizational Values in mind and in the context of 1) APTA's mission, vision, and strategic plan, and 2) the potential for their work to have implications related to physical therapist assistants, women, diversity, and risk management.
*This Board-appointed group that consists of 8 subcommittees does not have a Board Chair in order to avoid any conflict of interest or impropriety because the Board is the body that approves the association’s honors and awards recipients. Due to the nature of this group's work, it will not have a single chair. Rather, staff will assist each subcommittee to identify a member volunteer to serve as the lead for the respective subcommittee and each lead will work with the staff liaisons as needed to manage the work of their particular subcommittee.
**The role of the Board Liaison is to serve as a conduit between the Board and the Awards Committee and assist in special projects such as the review and revision of awards policies. The Board liaison does not participate in subcommittee conversations related to nominees, and does not review the nominations received for each award.
As stated in the APTA bylaws (Article IX, Section 3., A) the APTA president serves as ex-officio member to all Board-appointed committees with the exception of the Ethics and Judicial Committee. In the role as ex-officio to the Awards Committee the APTA president may take part in certain committee functions but does not review, propose, or participate in subcommittee conversations related to nominees for awards.
Size of Appointed Group: 6 members, 1 of which is a Maryland Chapter representative who participates in the review and recommendation process for only the Henry O. and Florence P. Kendall Practice Award.

A protein skimmer is installed onto the aquarium so that it can remove substances from the aquarium water so that we can keep water quality at an optimum.
It is imperative that a skimmer runs at full efficiency in order for it to work correctly. For this to be achieved it needs to be thoroughly cleaned.
You will be surprised how many people simply remove the cup from the skimmer, pour the contents down the sink, give it a wipe and put it back on the skimmer again.
Although the contents have been removed and the inside of the cup has been wiped there is one very important part which has been missed.
If the rising tube is not cleaned then it will become coated and the skimmer will not operate at full efficiency, therefore optimum water quality is harder to maintain.
Using a bottle brush clean the underside of the cup ensuring that the riser tube is clean and then wipe clean with a cloth.
The above does depend upon what type of skimmer you use, however the majority of skimmers can be cleaned in this way.

What’s on your “get me out of town!” wish list? Hot sun, long sandy beaches, ocean breezes through the palm fronds, languid lagoons, stunning sunsets? Welcome to French Polynesia, a group of five island collections, and home to unsurpassed beauty, no matter which islands you choose.
While Tahiti and Bora Bora are perhaps the best known of the French Polynesian islands, most tourists, starting with the explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, are gob-smacked by the seemingly endless strings and groups of islands that define paradise. The French-owned islands are divided into five general groups, all of which are worth a visit, or a side trip when seeing the main islands:
Windward Islands (also in the Society Islands collection; Tahiti is the largest island in this group)
The capital of French Polynesia, Papeete, is located on Tahiti and houses the local governments, plus major business and shopping centers. The major airport is also here, and welcomes planes from around the world, including the locally owned airline, Air Tahiti Nui.
Somehow, French Polynesia has managed to merge into the 21st century while simultaneously keeping its storied and ancient past intact. The blend of old traditions and modern amenities makes it the perfect spot for a truly relaxing vacation or honeymoon. In fact, Tahiti honeymoons are among the most coveted by brides and grooms everywhere! Check our news about Tahiti all inclusive resorts and Bora Bora all inclusive resorts on this website!
People who visit Tahiti thinking that they might enjoy a holiday on its black or white sand beaches have found themselves drawn like a magnet to the lovely people and almost unreal scenery. Many have stayed, among them:
English World War I romantic poet, Rupert Brooke, who is said to have fathered a daughter with a Tahitian woman during a visit in 1913.
American actor, Marlon Brando, whose third wife, Tarita Teriipia was a native of Tahiti (their gorgeous daughter Cheyenne was a model).
Many people regard France as being a romantic country, and that extends, too, to French Polynesia, where among the local native languages, French is the official tongue. A romance language in a wildly romantic locale; excellent combination! Now wonder so many honeymoons are taken here!
Most of the residents of French Polynesia reside on Tahiti, making it more visited than any of the other islands. From here, they export coconuts, vanilla beans and extract, fruit (like the highly touted health-fruit, noni fruit), fish, timber and cobalt. When you visit, bring home a strand of black Tahitian pearls!
What most want-to-be tourists imagine when they dream of a Tahiti vacation are private huts supported on stilts over the bright turquoise waters. And that’s real. In some cases, these thatched-roof huts are just cabanas, or massage rooms, but many are full hotel rooms, accessible by a raised deck pathway. A good number of them are situated in the many sheltered lagoons. These are Tahiti dreams. Bora Bora dreams. Make them come true.

I do have a UV haze filter from film days, but I never found it to have much effect. I mainly regarded it as lens protection.
It's not surprising it doesn't do much, bearing in mind that the glass used in the lens will in any event absorb quite a lot of the UV. Although optical glass absorbs less than ordinary glass.
And I've read in several places that digital sensors include a UV filter anyway, so adding another one isn't going to make much difference. And it doesn't.
However I have now ordered a rotating polariser filter, which I have not tried before. In theory it is mainly for glare and reflections, rather than cutting through atmospheric haze, so it will be a case of try it and see. It is often quoted as an essential item for landscape photography.
The one essential item I do seem to be needing for landscape photography is a replacement set of legs. I'm still using the same ones I was using in the 1969 pictures I posted.

A lot of people just think a zoom lens eliminates the need for walking, but as you will appreciate there is more to a decent landscape shot than how close you are. A lot of landscape shots that are taken with the wide or tele end of a superzoom look kind of 'forced' but sticking to either a fixed lens around 35mm focal length ( relative to film camera and full frame digital ) or a mild zoom lens of say 28-85mm can be useful. Zoom lenses are a LOT better than they used to be.
Rob Manchester wrote: I assume you mean the ones you walk on and not the three legged thing you screw the camera onto Yes.
I do have a tripod in the back of the car, but it's too heavy to go lugging it about the countryside on the off chance of needing it.
A lot of people just think a zoom lens eliminates the need for walking, but as you will appreciate there is more to a decent landscape shot than how close you are. Using the fixed-lens X100F that's a decision I don't need to think about now. If I need to zoom in a bit I can do it later by cropping from the full frame. I'm very pleased with the resolution from the lens, and with 24 MPX to play with I can chop off quite a lot and still have plenty for an online image.
To zoom out I walk backwards. I've fallen over twice doing that, so I now need a periscope attachment too.
It certainly makes a startling difference when rotated in front of this monitor screen (flat-screen monitors emit polarised light).
Then the sun came out, so a chance to try it on the camera. Brilliant! Reflections from shiny surfaces much reduced, sky twice as blue, plants and foliage show more saturated colours.
But it is clearly confusing the autofocus. I shall have to use manual focus with it, which is no great difficulty with distant views - just set infinity.

I use Highlights/Shadows in Photoshop Elements quite a lot. Here I used it to brighten the darker bits (shadow lifting) and darken the brighter bits (gives the sky more character), then increase the midtones to bring back a bit more contrast. You can overdo it, but it is good for skies.
I bought a good polarizer for my Yashica FX3 and it had the effects you mentioned. However, after a bit wasn't sure I liked it, so stopped.
This lock is unusual in that it originally had 4 pairs of gates, angled in opposite directions. The sockets for attaching another gate can still be seen in front of the ladder hoops.
The reason is that it links the Droitwich Barge Canal to the the River Salwarpe (behind the camera), which could at times be higher or lower than the level in the Barge Canal. The river is canalized for a short distance from here to the now-rebuilt Droitwich Junction Canal.
New weirs have been built to keep the river level no lower than the level in the Barge Canal, so that only the usual 2 pairs of gates are now needed.
In addition, there is a swing-bridge across the middle of the lock (behind the camera), making it an unusual lock.
Not done much not model railway/railway with the camera recently, however a recent picnic allowed me to capture this of our rescue Staffie/Greyhound Poppy. She actually stayed still enough for the photo!
My dog, also a rescue and a Staffie/Whippet cross. She's about eight in this picture and starting to go a bit grey. She is now eleven and very grey.
Poppy, is 2 sometime this month. But being a rescue we don't know when, so we'll count the end of August as her birthday and celebrate her 'Gotcha' day. She's been a handful, is very energetic and bouncy, but has a lovely temperament, and is responding well to training now she has settled down in what is her 6th chance at a home, so has not really had much of a stable life upto now (hence some of the behaviour problems we've encountered).
I have thousands of images, but sometimes it takes the passing of a few years before realising which ones are worth a second look. This is Clun in 2007.
Like it. Long time since I've been to Clun. The border towns are fascinating. Could be the subject of a short branch.
The Lakelander was a service put on by West Coast Railways on the Oxenholme to Windermere line, after Northern trains had suspended their service because of timetable chaos.

One of Iain Rice's layout plans is for a Light Railway to Clun from Broome on the Central Wales line, with a flavour of the Bishops Castle. It's an easy route along the River Clun, here's a site for Clunton station:
Here's another couple of shots from my recent Scottish trip, both from the Torridon area in the north west.

Our Cairn Terrier was rescued from a puppy mill. He's called Torri - short for Torridon. It seemed appropriate.
Llandudno north bay from the Great Orme. Lots of lovely scenery on walks round here. Coastline in the distance round to Rhyl and Prestatyn. Lots more sheep on the Orme now to keep the goats company. Plenty of snakes on the move this week so was careful not to stand on any .
Llandudno station. A pale shadow of it's former self. Platforms 1 and 2 on the right, platform 3 on the left. Formerly there was also platforms 4 and 5 too. Cab road for the horse drawn carriages rapidly grassing over - despite the heatwave.
At least I think they are, my notes just say Slate, Ffestiniog, 8/69. I remember climbing the incline out of Blaenau Ffestiniog in the rain, and fish & chips when I got back.
I'm not entirely sure I should go on posting this stuff on a "Templot" forum, there being no obvious relevance. I thought there would be lots of similar web forums for posting such "fresh air" photos, but I haven't been able to find one I would want to post on. There are dozens of photography forums, but they are all immersed in advertising, and the usual endless arguments about Canon v. Nikon and who's got the biggest lens. Plus a lot of arty-farty photos which do nothing for me.
I do have an unused licence for a XenForo forum+gallery and there is masses of spare capacity on the server. I'm wondering whether to set up a separate forum similar to this topic, but open to everyone, rather than limited to Templot users? I can't believe the world needs another photography forum, but if I can't find one I like...
I can't see the need for a forum just for pics as there are ( as you say ) plenty of them if people desire. Surely it is just a bit of light relief from spiking track or building crossing vees
Pity one of the young boys wasn't me, I would have loved playing around there. My strict dad would have told me to come down before I fell down
Rob Manchester wrote: If these are the quality of pics we can expect just keep posting them on here. Wonderful. Thanks Rob.
I don't really know what to expect. I knew I had some pics taken in the slate quarries, and I remember printing a few of them. But I have no recollection of taking those.
My dad would also have told me to get down. But it's not likely he would have been there -- I roamed free in the school holidays in the 1950s, just like those boys. But not in such a fantastic location.
Back to another lost world. Neat ballast without a weed in sight. I think these are near Talerddig on the Cambrian main line, in the early 1970s. If I can pin down the locations I will put them on Geograph. Anyone?
edit: from the hedge pattern on the distant hillside, I think this was taken from the A470 about 1/2 mile north of Carno, see: https://goo.gl/maps/xPHb5Hvngi52
Great photo's, please keep them coming, as it provides some detail from a bygone age, which can be handy for modelling purposes, even when not specifically railway related. colour would have been nice, but in those far off days colour was rare.
I do remember taking those, although I can't be sure in which quarry. The shed looks to be in an excellent state of repair, out of keeping with the surroundings. It probably still stands. Anyone?
I was in there with the permission of the last two remaining quarry workers. They were very pleased to have someone taking an interest, and showed me how to split slate. I'm sure I took a photo of them, but I can't find the neg at present.
Think they're fine. Keep 'em coming. I'll add more of my own from time to time. By the way, re other sites, I'm sure Geograph is an excellent place to put them, a visual record of places exactly as they were/are is what the site is about.
Here's a couple of my Talerrdig shots, to complement yours, taken in 2008. Looking on Geograph, it's interesting as to how much the trees and bushes have grown, compared with John Lucas's shots taken in 2001.

While I have become a person who not only loves to bike, I have chosen to ride in some pretty cold weather. However, here in the Northeast today, a snow, rain and mix keeps me from riding. However, not all bikers seem to agree with me. My hope is that they, and drivers on the road stay aware of the danger lurking with every mile.

Synopsis: Theodore Finch is fascinated by death, and he constantly thinks of ways he might kill himself. But each time, something good, no matter how small, stops him.
Violet Markey lives for the future, counting the days until graduation, when she can escape her Indiana town and her aching grief in the wake of her sister’s recent death.When Finch and Violet meet on the ledge of the bell tower at school, it’s unclear who saves whom. And when they pair up on a project to discover the “natural wonders” of their state, both Finch and Violet make more important discoveries: It’s only with Violet that Finch can be himself—a weird, funny, live-out-loud guy who’s not such a freak after all. And it’s only with Finch that Violet can forget to count away the days and start living them. But as Violet’s world grows, Finch’s begins to shrink.
This isn't my "kind of book." I usually steer clear of tough subjects, issue books, etc. I'm thrilled books about drug usage, terminal diseases, grief, or mental illness are out there and we're seeing a broader spectrum of humans represented - now more than ever. But if I'm being totally honest as a reader, I'm not usually the best audience for such books. I'm a naturally empathetic person - more than I want to be sometimes and I feel great pain for people in pain. So well written books that portray the devastation of loss, of sickness, of darkness usually just cut me deeper than I feel I need to be cut - considering how much I read. Still some of these books end up being the ones that stick with me, even if they aren't always my favorite, because they usually leave a lasting impression on my emotional state. Books that explore tough topics are usually the ones that are immediately altering - 13 REASONS WHY by Jay Asher, FAULT IN OUR STARS by John Green, and IF I STAY by Gayle Forman to name a few. I wind up deeply affected by these characters and they all set the world sliding a few notches into a new lens. So why don't I pick them up more often? Because it's a huge gamble - if they're poorly written, or if I can't quite relate then it's hugely disappointing. And it doesn't seem to quite honor the hugeness behind the reason that story is out there. If it doesn't have the big emotion behind it, how are we supposed to get inside the minds of those who aren't like us? It's more likely I'll pick up a tough book without emotion and it will just be bleak. And I guess, even the ones with the big emotion behind it - they're epic and changing and in the right hands they're life-saving - but a girl can only handle so much pain, loss, struggle and BIG LOVE, even in a fictional sense every once in a while.
I've begun this post with a tangent, I apologize. I'm leaving it anyway because I feel it needs to be said. I think you should know where I'm coming from when I say - read. this. book. I don't pick up books that begin with potential suicide. But a combination of hearing good things from other readers, a remarkable cover, and that inexplicable, magical energy drawing me to read this book right away had me hanging out with the sparks of humanity that are Theodore Finch and Violet Markey. These two have such charisma that even in their darkest moments, they draw in the reader to want to know them, to want to be next to them, to want to love them enough. The balance between these two is so fragile and it didn't take much for my heart to be completely in love with both of them. Which led to this strange feeling of soaring and sinking simultaneously as the book goes on. Where Violet goes, I go. Where Finch goes, I go. And both journeys have their own highs and lows.
There's a great surface story - the saving grace of kindred souls, the unexpected love story, the mania of depression, the loss of a sister and best friend, the commentary of the anticipation of graduation. But I want to talk about the things happening underneath. As Violet says, "It's not what we take with us, but what we leave behind." Violet and Finch grow closer as they're tasked with wandering. For a high school project they have to see the sights of Indiana - which seems like a funny task, but they take it and make it into a no-wonder-too-small situation (which I adore). They begin with the highest point in the state - a hill - and then a home-built roller coaster. Finch is very adamant about leaving something behind - to say you were there. And in a book that is so pre-occupied with death and with loss, it's a poignant act. This simple act of just leaving a piece of themselves behind, makes their characters more permanent...and just...more. And then it goes beyond things to say - it's the people we leave behind that are a true mark of who we are.
And usually this is a morbid thing. Leaving people behind. But this might be the first time I've drawn a conclusion that doesn't see that as negative. Because we influence people - and this even draws back to 13 REASONS WHY in a really great way - whether we mean to or not. And those people we have the biggest influence on - well they are our landmarks. They are the - yeah, I'm going there - bright places in the universes we create for ourselves. The need to leave a mark to say I was here is underlined in this beautiful story - and I've come out with it to say that we all leave that I was here across the lives we touch. Our greatest achievements, our best moments, our immortal and spectacular selves are stored in each other. And this revelation is channeled through Violet and Finch in a way that elevates these characters and makes them beings that will forever be a part of who I am.
Happy Holidays, friends! I'm just popping in with my favorite reads of the year - and I've happily dragged Jackie along to chime in with her top reads of 2014 as well. This was a bit of a tough list to pick out because I honestly was a tough reader to please these last few months. But I came up with a few that were actually spectacular and Jackie had some fantastic reading this year as well.
This book is a Taylor Swift song and I loved every minute of it. It was really easy to let Emery Lord onto my shelves and into my heart. Keep an eye out for The Start of Me and You coming this spring - it's another amazing, amazing contemporary from an author who's become an insta-read for me.
Reading MTLGTM has become a new (planned) tradition for me. I'm definitely going to return to this book in the holiday season to pull me into the excitement and magic that comes with this time of year. And you get a bundle of fabulous authors all in one go - Rainbow Rowell made me cry (yet again, because she's perfect), Myra McEntire made me laugh, and don't even get me started on how Laini Taylor proves again how she's one of the most skilled storytellers out there.
I didn't know if she could top Etienne St. Clair or Cricket Bell, but Josh certainly belongs in the wonderful pool of Perkins' boys who aren't perfect, but perfect for who they end up with. And of all the Perkins' girls, I think I'd most like to be Isla. This one was well worth the wait.
Another fantastic addition to an epic, epic fantasy. I'm not a fan of faeries, honestly, but for Sarah Maas and Celaena, I'm all in. I so can't wait to see where this series leads.
This book blew me away. I was so surprised by how much I loved this one. The relationship in the story hooked me immediately, and the plot was so different from everything I've read. Loved it.
I cannot gush enough about this book. NO OTHER book has made me feel the emotions that this one has. Alexis Bass nails life as a girl in high school...or at least what mine felt like. Incredible. It's a must read.
I got my history on with this book and was absolutely blown away by the authenticity. The world is spot on incredible.
This was an excellent sequel to a book I loved. Suzanne Young just gets me. The action and tension are awesome.
Hannah here: I had to throw in a few words on this one as well. It's a book I'm adding to my list of best of the year, too. Jackie and I so rarely like the same book - it's shocking really, considering how good of friends we are that we can never agree on things like best books (although she does have a fantastic list this year...) or even whether a book is good or not. But this one - we are totally on the same page. It's so, so beautiful, I'm highlighting practically every other sentence. If you haven't picked up this one yet, Jackie and I both recommend you do.
You've probably noticed it's been pretty quiet around these parts for a few months now. It's because really cool, exciting, and sometimes scary things are happening in my life. My job has changed, my time has changed and my reading has changed.
I've had to come to terms with the fact that my blog was the sacrifice. It was the piece I had to set to the side to let myself grow. And just last week, as Best of 2014 lists started showing up and I had the feeling that I didn't deserve to post my own since I've been silent on this front since March, I thought - It's time to write a farewell post and let the blog be a completed chapter of my life.
I've thought about writing this post - a goodbye post - for months now. Ever since I got my new job, which is so demanding but kind of awesome in a way that makes me feel like I've found my calling, there just hasn't been time for much personal reading, let alone blogging. But I haven't been able to pull this post together. I was serious last week - it's been long enough, and it's time. But today, I'm just not able to do it.
I just can't let go to this piece of my life, because it's a big, important part of why I am where I am today. I'm fairly confident in saying this blog changed my life and pushed me where I needed to go. I started in grad school, when I was unhappy and misplaced. YA was my comfort, my saving grace, my happy place. And I started the blog as a simple way of tracking what I was reading and just having a place to talk about the books I loved. And in 2 years, I grew a body of work that I'm really proud of.
Because it became more than the books. It was a way of dedicating myself to something I was passionate about, a way of growing an expertise and indulging in a love. It showed me that I wanted to be working with books, it brought me back to an old dream and into publishing. And this blog was brought up in every interview I've been on since I set foot in the publishing world. I'm fairly certain the fact that I knew how to write about books, that I obviously loved reading, that I was dedicated to this world to the point that I posted nearly 5 times a week for 2 years - was a selling point to my interviewers. It gave me a portfolio, in a sense - and one that I created because of love and not obligation. I want to contribute a good deal of my career to this blogging foundation.
The other reason I can't let go is because I still want to feel some kind of connection to the amazing book blogger community. I have blogger friends, who I haven't been so connected with since I've let the blog slip to the wayside. I miss them. I miss talking books - I miss having go-to people who's recommendations I trust implicitly. I know they're still there, and I do occasionally check in or run into them at book events, but I'm a faded part of this world and it's harder to connect. Twitter is a big part of this. In restructuring my tweets to be more personal and less about books, I fear I've lost that platform, and it feels a little like standing outside the circle. But with this blog, still somewhere in my periphery, there's a hint of that connection back into this group - this warm, loving, community that is something truly spectacular.
So, today, I'm not saying goodbye. I'm saying, this blog isn't what it was, but it's still here and it's still a piece of me. I might post my Top Books of 2014 tomorrow, but I can't make promises. I might throw up a review now and then, but I have no idea when I'll have time. But I'm still around, and maybe no one else is. And that's okay. Maybe I just needed to write a little love letter to my blog for being so important.
I'm stoked to welcome you to my stop on the blog tour for Breaking Fences by Juliana Haygert hosted by YA Bound.
Juliana Haygert is an auto-read author for me: if she writes it, I'm going to read it. And so far she hasn't failed to make me fall in love with her characters and pull me into their world. I loved Bia as a secondary character in Breaking the Reins, so I knew going in this would be good. But even Bia surprised me with her vulerability. And I don't know where Juliana pulls her heroes from, but they're always fantastic and this one was particularly lovable. The horses, too, make this series special, as they really do act as characters that play an important role in the story.
I knew I'd love Bia and I was eager for her story, but like I said, she still surprised me. She's such a firecracker, but circumstances mellow her. I really like the internal struggle she has between keeping her head down and letting her spirit get the best of her. Although her circumstances are bullies that seem rather out of place in a college setting - I'll admit it kept me on my toes. What I kind of love, though, is that Bia seems to have the personality of a horse. She's high-spirited, loveable to some and will get agitated around others, and she spooks easily.
So then there's Garrett, who's just completely wonderful. He has this complex family story that shapes who he is. I was completely intrigued by him and his history. Garrett is so wonderfully layered that I couldn't help but savor it as Bia managed to pull away his layers. And then there's this one scene - that just goes to show that Juliana writes kissing better than anyone - and I dare you not to completely fall for him.
Then there's Midnight and Tom. One a horse, the other the stable hand, that are some of the best secondary characters. These two, and Garrett and Bia of course, make me want to start hanging around horse stables. They make it seem like the best thing in life is caring for horses and hanging out with one another.
Juliana manages to stay true to the new adult genre while bringing something different to the table. Breaking Fences is an awesome follow up to Breaking the Reins - which, by the way, if you haven't read yet, you need to - and I'm really hoping we'll get more from this Breaking world.
All Beatriz “Bia” Fernandes wants is to prove herself—to her family and friends—though it’s hard to prove anything with an overbearing father and three famous polo-playing older brothers. After her acceptance into college results in a heated family argument, the Brazilian girl leaves everything behind to find her own American dream.
College life away from home is perfect until the people she believes to be her friends turn on her. With lies and rumors threatening to suffocate her, Bia turns to her only freedom. Riding.
But one thing gets in the way of her escape. Garrett Blackwell and his bad cowboy attitude. Working at the ranch is his obligation, bugging Bia is his newfound hobby. His thick skin and easy grin don’t hide what Bia already knows—this misunderstood and lonely cowboy fights his own demons. Brushing horses’ coats and mucking out stalls shouldn’t be this sexy, and it isn’t long before he becomes a part of her distraction.
However, escaping won’t solve her problems, and it’s up to Bia to break down the fences around her and prove her strength—not to her family and friends, but to herself … and for Garrett. Because standing on her own doesn’t have to mean standing alone.
While Juliana Haygert dreams of being Wonder Woman, Buffy, or a blood elf shadow priest, she settles for the less exciting—but equally gratifying—life of a wife, mother, and author. Thousands of miles away from her former home in Brazil, she now resides in Connecticut and spends her days writing about kick-ass heroines and the heroes who drive them crazy.
I'm so thrilled to help celebrate the paperback release of Find You in the Dark! A. Meredith Walters is absolutely one of my favorite New Adult authors and I've been following her career very closely. I read Find You in the Dark way back when NA was just emerging and I fell in love immediately. Maggie and Clayton are characters that will always have a place in my heart. I hope you'll all go out and get your copy today, whether you've read her or not! I can't recommend this amazing author enough and it's fantastic to see her flourishing.
Maggie Young had the market on normal. Normal friends, normal parents, normal grades.. normal life. Until him.
Clayton Reed was running from his past and an army of personal demons that threatened to take him down. He never thought he had a chance at happiness. Until her.
Maggie thought their love could overcome anything. Clay thought she was all he needed to fix his messy life. That together, they could face the world. But the darkness is always waiting.
The New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of Contemporary and Paranormal romance including The Find You in the Dark and Bad Rep series as well as the upcoming stand alone romance, Reclaiming the Sand, and a dark new adult series for Gallery Books.
A. Meredith spent ten years as a counselor for at risk teens and children. First working at a Domestic Violence/Sexual Assault program and then later a program for children with severe emotional and mental health issues. Her former clients and their stories continue to influence every aspect of her writing.
When not writing (or being tortured with all manner of beauty products at the hand of her very imaginative and extremely girly daughter), she is eating chocolate, watching reality television that could rot your brain and reading a smutty novel or two.
I love the concept for this novel. I wouldn't necessarily call it new adult, it's rather on the YA side, but it's still cool to see college-aged characters branching beyond the contemporary genre. Even better, Ren is the kind of heroine you can really get behind and root for. This book is doing something a little different and that's really all I needed to hear to jump on board.
One of my favorite things about this book is the way the love interest is handled. I feel a little like this bypasses a lot of other great things about this book, but I just have to say that I love that it's not a focus and it's still unexpected. There is the hint of a triangle happening, but it's different than any triangle I've read before. I'm at a bit of a loss how to explain this without spoiling, but there's the guy you swoon over and then the one who is endearing and it seems to me that Ren doesn't make the obvious choice, ever, and I enjoyed being kept on my toes.
I had a little bit of an issue with the structure. I'm not entirely sure a linear narrative best served the story, but it did create an opportunity to get Ren's voice out there. She's snarky and tough in the best way possible and it's great the way that personality shines through in her narration.
This is a great thriller that brings out a new voice and a different twist on your typical YA elements. The pages kept turning in anticipation of what Ren would do next. There's a lot of fun and adventure in this book.
This debut thriller combines a pulse-pounding thriller (like False Memory or Starters) with a new adult coming-of-age story set at Texas A&M University.
When Ren Sharpe was fourteen, she was kidnapped by a shadowy organization called FATE and trained to be a human weapon.
Now, four years later, she receives her assignment: protect Gareth Young at all costs. Currently a student at Texas A&M, Gareth will someday change the world. FATE calls people like Gareth FIPs -future important people - and they're everywhere, each with a FATE-trained shadow.
But when disaster strikes, Ren will have to turn on her maker. Together with Junie, a fellow abductee and the one person she trusts, Ren takes Gareth on the run.
Joe Shine grew up in Austin, TX (the greatest city ever), and is a graduate of Texas A&M University. He has an MFA from the Peter Stark Producing Program at the University of Southern California, and after brief stints in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, Joe returned home to Austin (repeat: the greatest city ever). Joe has a normal human job like most everyone else but hopes to become a full-time writer one day, and this is where you, the reader, must do him a really big solid and love I Become Shadow, his first novel.
Welcome to my stop on the blog tour for Royally Lost by Angie Stanton. After you check out my review and an excerpt, you should check out some of the other awesome blogs taking part in this tour. The full schedule is here!
This book has all things I love: traveling, royalty and well...does there need to be more? I love this cover, I love the concept and was so excited for a fun jaunt around Europe with a beautiful prince in tow. As a fan of movies like The Prince and Me and more recently, books like Suddenly Royal, this was right up my alley.
This is a great, light book that would be great company on a trip to the beach or as you travel across Europe. I can't help but enjoy myself when books take me to different places. And there's always something I completely connect with when a main character is traveling for the first time. It's always an adjustment and a little scary - but you have to go through that before it gets good. And with this book - it does just that. The prince stuff is all great - he's adorable and wonderful and all things you want your prince to be. But it's really when Becca has to stand on her own and how she grows into who she is because of her travels that I really came to adore this book.
That said, I also have to throw in a word about Becca's brother Dylan. I had to include the excerpt with him, because he's just the best. He may be the brightest character in this book. I love his balance of annoying brother and really great ally. He was always helping Becca in ways that were really adorable I kind of want to read his story.
If you're looking for a read to get you in the mood for summer, this is a great place to start. Becca starts out a little whiny and some of the dialog is a little too unnatural, but it grows out of that as Becca comes into herself. I love where she ends up by the end.
"This might explain why." Dylan held the magazine under her face, forcing her to look at the glossy picture of a guy who looked exactly like Nikolai.
She'd recognize him anywhere. She couldn't read the foreign headline, but it ended with an exclamation point. "Dylan where did you find this?"
"Why is he on the cover? Did he do something wrong?" She paged through the magazine, holding her breath. Confusion turned to shock when she saw a two-page spread filled with pictures of Nikolai. Nikolai at the beach; a picture of him playing polo; a picture of him in a tuxedo with a girl wearing a glittering gown. Then Becca's eyes landed on a formal picture of Nikolai in uniform, with a sword at his belt, standing next to a young girl. A stern man and austere woman sat in gilded chairs; both adults wore crowns.
"Why is Nikolai in that picture with people wearing crowns? Who is he?" she asked. Her heart pumped so fast she could feel the blood pulse through her temples. "And why did he lie about his identity?"
Summary: Dragged on a family trip to Europe’s ancient cities, Becca wants nothing more than to go home. Trapped with her emotionally distant father, over-eager stepmother, and a brother who only wants to hook up with European hotties, Becca is miserable. That is until she meets Nikolai, a guy as mysterious as he is handsome. And she unknowingly finds herself with a runaway prince.
Nikolai has everything a guy could ask for-he's crown prince, heir to the throne, and girls adore him. But the one thing he doesn't have...is freedom. Staging a coup, he flees his kingdom and goes undercover on his own European tour.
When Nikolai and Becca meet, it’s their differences that draw them together. Sparks fly as they share a whirlwind of adventures, all the while dodging his royal guard. But Becca's family vacation ends in a matter of days. Will Nikolai and Becca be forced to say goodbye forever, will his destiny catch up to him, or will they change history forever?
Angie Stanton never planned on writing books; she wanted to be a Rockette. However, growing up in rural Wisconsin, with her brothers' 4-H pigs as pets, dance didn't work out. Instead she became an avid daydreamer. After years of perfecting stories in her head, she began to write them down, and the rest is history.
Angie is the author of six books including Royally Lost, Rock and a Hard Place, and Snapshot. She graduated with a Journalism degree from the University of Wisconsin, and is a proud double finalist of the National Readers Choice Awards for Love 'em or Leave 'em.

Animal diseases can wreak economic havoc not just on smallhold farms but also on a nation’s valuable exports. Five SADC countries with Zambia in their midst were assisted by the African Development Bank’s Transboundary Animal Disease project. Support was made available to develop the means to rapidly detect and identify outbreaks of disease as well as its prevention and the monitoring of livestock health. Ultimately the aim is to create wealth and enhance rural livelihoods.

For a better life: AfDB Agriculture Projects transforming the lives of people in Cabo Verde, Ghana, Zambia and Rwanda
Africa’s agriculture sector has enormous potential. If adequately harnessed, it can make vital a contribution towards promoting inclusive growth on the continent. Over the last 10 years, Africa has experienced a relatively strong economic growth, in spite of the setbacks occasioned by the food and financial crises, political tensions, as well as natural disasters in some African countries. The laudable and impressive growth witnessed recently in Africa has unfortunately not been matched with a significant reduction in unemployment and poverty. More worrisome is the fact that growth has not been inclusive, and has not resulted in a wider access to sustainable socio-economic opportunities for most people. It has also done little to protect the vulnerable, including women and the youth, the latter accounting for the majority of Africa’s smallholder farmers. Since GDP growth originating from agriculture is by far more effective in reducing poverty than GDP growth from other sectors, and as the majority of Africa’s poor depend on smallholder agriculture for their livelihoods, pursuing inclusive agriculture growth could assist in accelerating and sustaining the region’s impressive overall economic growth, with positive impacts on the Millennium Development Goals, especially the goal of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. Since its creation, the African Development Bank has recognized the potential of agriculture to bolster inclusive growth and food security, as well as to enhance regional integration in Africa. Accordingly, the AfDB has and continues to support agricultural transformation in Africa mainly through investments in infrastructure development. Agriculture and rural development have benefitted from some USD 12 billion of public and private sector loans and grants between 1967 and 2014. In the last five years alone, the AfDB has supported more than 100 operations with commitments valued at more than USD 2 billion. Furthermore, the agriculture sector still retains its prominence in AfDB’s Ten Year Strategy 2013-2022 as an area of special emphasis towards the realization of the Strategy’s twin objectives of inclusive growth and the transition to green growth. Capitalizing on the continent’s vast agriculture resources and opportunities to integrate African enterprises in regional and global agriculture value chains, the AfDB now focuses on financing activities which demonstrate value addition and strengthen forward and backward linkages in the sector. The AfDB is also at the forefront of ensuring sustainable use of the vast agriculture resources by promoting climate-smart agriculture. This movie offers of some emerging success stories from a sample of the Bank’s interventions. It shows how our projects are impacting the lives of people. The Watershed Management Project in Cape Verde, the Rural Enterprise Project in Ghana, the Trans-boundary Animal Disease Control Project in Zambia and “One Family, One Cow” project in Rwanda are true reflections of how the AfDB’s modest but positive interventions in agriculture are touching the lives of people and helping them to reap the dividends of development.

Using technology to improve the world is no small cause. While there are numerous organisations who work with problems in society they are not built in such a way that lends to cost effective and user centric designs. Sometimes they simply can’t afford this luxury since they are government funded or NPO’s (Non-Profit Organisations). This leads to large gaps in the services provided to the communities and citizens that need them most. Fortunately there are ways that civic engagement can allow everyone to contribute. Tech for good initiatives are launching in communities across the globe and the Code for Humanity Open Hack (http://openhack.io) is one such initiative.
During this workshop we will present solutions people are already building to address gaps in social services. We will also introduce user centric design and break up into ideation sessions to identify possible solutions to to specific groups of societies members.

As a departure from my usual Disney-related posts, here is a bit about my "guilty pleasure," the French musical film by director Jacques Demy, "Les Demoiselles de Rochefort," in English "The Young Girls of Rochefort," released March 8, 1967. The first DVD I ever bought in the late 90s, in Annecy, France, was just this film. Recently I also got the Blu-Ray, and now having just received the 5-CD box set with Michel Legrands great music that came out last year, I revisited the movie and had a look at, where in Rochefort the film was shot.
The film begins and ends around the strange (and defunct) bridge Le Pont Transbordeur, south of the city, but most of the action happens around Place Colbert, the center of the old town, with the office of the town's mayor used as the home of the twins, played by the Dorléac sisters, Françoise and Catherine, the latter using as stage name her mother's maiden name of Deneuve. In the town square we find the coffee shop of Yvonne Garnier (Dannielle Darrieux), with server Josette (Geneviève Thénier), frequented by Maxence (Jacques Perrin) and carnies Etienne (George Chakiris) and Bill (Grover Dale), who visit the town to sell boats and motor bikes. The dancing troupe (from England, many seen in Summer Holiday and Half a Sixpence, and choreographed by Norman Maen) is basically everywhere, and when we are in the square - they are there, as well. But not everything happens in the town square.
Solange Garnier, the musician (Françoise Dorléac wearing the red wig) visits monsieur Simon Dame (played by Michel Piccoli) who is the owner of a store with musical instruments.
Spoiler alert: Subtil Dutrouz (played by venerable actor Henri Crémieux) turns out to be the one who is the "ignoble sadist" who has cut the old lady into 15 pieces and put her in a basket. We see nothing of this except a crowd around the basket.
N-E corner of Rue du Port and Rue de la République (which had a different name in the 60s, it seems). Maxence and Solange afterwards walk along Rue du Port with the dancing troupe behind them as if it's the most natural thing in the world.
Yvonne Garnier's son Boubou (Patrick Jeantet) has to be fetched from school several times in the film. Yvonne tells Etienne and Bill it is "not to steps behind the square" but it's still a 9 minute walk.
The N-E end of Rue Chanzy. This was the Maritime Arsenal (hence the bars in front of the windows), and it seems it is being restored. However, the building on the left of the doorway the kids come out of was completely removed, which is clearly visible in the next images!
Finally, just around the corner from the school, piano virtuoso Andy Miller (Gene Kelly) meets Solange, and afterwards does a little tap dance (with two of the English dancers dressed as sailors). Strangely, his taps were dubbed by some drummer who seems to not have been very interested in hitting the action on the screen. If you want to hear the live sound, however, six seconds (which is most of it) are in the trailer for the film! Also, the English version of the song (mostly sung by Gene!) on the CD set has all the taps, but these do not correctly follow the music if you that sync that to the picture! Sigh...
It seems the last 50 years have not been too kind to these areas in this interesting city. The film itself is such a curious, colorful fun piece of fluff. It has Gene Kelly! George Chakiris! If you don't know it, and your French is pretty good, have a look at it some day!
The Criterion Blu-Ray does have English subtitles, but only on the feature film. Sadly, the 25-year old documentary by (Jacques Demy's wife and filmmaker) Agnes Varda is not subtitled. However, the film was originally shot in two versions! Yes, EVERY shot of song or dialog was shot in French and English! The English version songs fill the whole CD number 3 in the box set! (Amazon US: here!) But when Warner was to release the English version they deemed it too "European" and shelved it! Only few scenes are known, some in the documentary and these on YouTube.
A very happy musical endeavor. But it seems that the PC-Police has struck against the Ben Sharpsteen's last scene in later copies. After the screen has gone black from soot, all characters are black-face; Minnie yells "Mickey!," Mickey yells "Minnie!," Pluto comes out of the top of the stove and yells, Al Jolson-like but in a gravelly voice "Mammie!" and the cat comes out of the stove pipe and ends saying "Yippie!" and smacks Pluto on the head with the lid of the stove... There is a YouTube version of the entire short including this scene, but I refuse to link to anything that has the wrong aspect ratio!
One of my most intriguing possessions from the "Kentucky Cache" is this little cheat sheet that Burt Gillett made, folded and used for a "Talk on Basic Principles of Motion Pictures and Sound." It is undated, but will have to be from around June 1931, with Mickey Steps Out as the "Big New Thing," but also including material from the earlier CM-7 "The Gorilla Mystery," CM-10 "The Birthday Party" and CM-14 "The Delivery Boy." Esther Campbell whistles "Valse Parisienne" from today's film, and note the preview with Bert Lewis accompanying Minnie (Marcellite Garner) and the bird (Esther Campbell).
Since Tom McKimson was Fergy's assistant, I surmise that "Tom" and "Palmer" here are the same person. Lane is here misspelled as Lano.
Bill Mason, who seems to have been born in England and died in 1937, is identified by Alberto Becattini, though he doesn't seem to appear in studio records otherwise. Alberto has this info on him: "Animator: DISNEY c31-33 (Silly Symphony 31-32 [The Cat’s Out 31, The Spider and the Fly 31, Babes in the Woods 32]); SCHLESINGER/WARNER BROS. 33 (Buddy 33 [Buddy’s Day Out]); LANTZ 35-37 (Oswald the Rabbit 36-37, Meany Miny and Moe 36-37)"
This is a fun film, and it becomes apparently clear that Jack King ain't no Fergy, whose Pluto scenes are highlights!
It so happens that there are several images that can throw a light on the production of this film, because the new L-shaped building that was finished mid-1931 was taken in use during this time, and it clearly was thought to show off the beautiful new premises! First we have the "Music Room," the director's room:
We have seen the animators in their room already; here, Johnny Cannon is at a desk that has the layout for scene 27 on its pegs.
Now - this scene was, according to the draft, animated by Rudy Zamora (on the photo to the right of Cannon), so this may indicate that the animators aren't posing at their own desks...
So it seems that the question posed in this image, that I prepared some years ago, might have been the wrong one.
Animated by Jack King, Dave Hand, Norm Ferguson, Les Clark, Dick Lundy, Tom Palmer and Ben Sharpsteen: the usual suspects.
Yes, this IS the film with Tom Palmer's "Dead dog scene" ending with Pluto saying "Kiss Me!" Since this film was released May 8th, it was likely animated late March-early April 1931. Here is an image of some of the animators in their new building (the L-shaped one) while the film was just released, in May 1931. L-to-R: Dave Hand, Dick Lundy, Norm Ferguson and Les Clark.
Both Hand and Lundy have their May 1931 calendars prominently placed - thanks, guys! Les Clark has three photos pinned up - two of the building of the building they are in, and one of one of the small Fauchon & Marco advertisement cars parked in front of the billboard across the street...
Over the coming weeks I intend to post a few more very early Mickey Mouse drafts, especially for my old mentor and friend Børge Ring.
Here is an early draft for this Robinson Crusoe-type Mickey Mouse film directed by my favorite director, Wilfred "Jaxon" Jackson, released through Columbia on 4/6/1931.
We find as animators: Jaxon himself, Charlie Byrne, Rudy Zamora, Cecil Surrey ("Sizzle"), Johnny Cannon, Gilles Armand "Frenchy" de Trémaudan, Jack Cutting, Les Clark, Dave Hand and Dick Lundy - with Norm Ferguson sharing two scenes with Jack Cutting.
On page 18 in Ross Care's must-have book about Jaxon, one can read how he (Jaxon) asked Walt to "handle" a whole film by himself, with which he meant "animate a whole film." Walt, however, thought he wanted to direct a film, and gave him the assignment of pulling together several previously discarded musical Mickey scenes, having him put them to music by a new composer Walt wanted to try out, Frank Churchill. This eventually became "Shipwrecked Among Animals," later renamed "The Castaway," and resulted in Jaxon "getting stuck" in the role of director.
I studied it intensely, and that includes the photo of the founder of the feast, though the record was issued after his passing, with the proceeds of the sales being donated to Cal Arts.
Last time I visited was in April 2017, when I showed him my CG recreation of Walt Disney's Hyperion Ave. studio in 1929 and 1939. Børge is listening and watching intensely as I explain:
Animation by Hal King (supervising animator), Ted Berman, Harry Holt, Ward Kimball (supervising animator), George Goepper, Al Bertino, Harvey Toombs, Phil Duncan, Fred Moore and Ken O'Brien. Effects by Jack Boyd. Jane was a little too quick for scene 19...
"...or is this a dream - too good to be true..." and here we leave Bongo and Fun & Fancy Free. Of course I hope you enjoyed this draft. Again, I need to impress upon you my "standard disclaimer:"
"Animation drafts were never meant to be historical documents. They were meant as go-to documents, showing the responsible artist for a certain scene, who might be able to help in case there would be any need for this further on in the production line. Therefore we often see e.g. that animators who left have been replaced by others, often their assistants, in later versions of a draft. Also for this reason it is most often the actual animator, not the supervising animator, who is mentioned [except here in most of Bongo, of course]. The drafts may also be directly inaccurate - showing early assignments where the animator actually changed when the scene was finally handed out. Keeping all this in mind, though, the drafts can give us some sort of hands-on insight into the inner workings of the production of some of the most iconic motion pictures of all time."
So what's next? And when? To be honest, I don't know yet! I'll let it be a surprise... It'll be for me!

I use to be a good singer...no scratch that...I used to be a very good singer (if I may say so myself *wink*wink).
I remember the first time I sang in church back in my beautiful sun-tanned land of Nigeria, I gave a special number(in Naija terms means a song) which I wrote myself. I wish now I could remember the song or had kept the lyrics but after that day my life changed. Everyone said I sounded wonderful.The choir leader of that church said I must join the choir...the rest they say is history...I discovered a love for singing and writing songs. Back then, I was a very shy girl and I found that in my little room in Apata I could express myself through singing and writing. I had found an outlet and I loved it.
My fondest memories of singing was the first time my Dad heard me sing in a small church in Leeds after initially jokingly telling me 'not to disgrace him o'. Well after I finished singing in church, he was beaming like a proud father. He raved about me all day and to anyone who cared to listen about how good I was and that in his own opinion 'I was better than 'Whitney Houston' Hmmm yes I know:) he was perhaps a little bias...but the echoes of his comments that made me feel ten feet tall and every chance I got I would sing and encourage people around me to as well. I moved to the wonderful town of Milton Keynes and of course joined the choir and continued my love for singing. I was still a bit shy but my voice was high, sonorous and powerful..Then I left for Canada and then I stopped singing. I mean I sang to myself but because I did not put myself out there, there was nothing to measure myself against so I did not improve on it.
Fast track 10 years and I can hardly hold a tune, how..why..I am natural at this???. I did not nurture the gift in me. I realise now that because God gives you a talent does not mean you automatically thrive in excellence of that gift. Like a seed, it needs to be fertilised, watered, put in the right environment and condition so it can bloom.
I mean the gift is still in me, I know I can sing...like people say its should be like riding a bicycle...maybe so...but what I am saying is develop the gift in you, enrich it...go for classes, practise, make yourself better. Hone your talent. Don't take what God has given you for granted.
As an example, singing sensation Whitney Houston was a rare talent, she broke the height of singing with her majestic voice, an inspiration for many other singers to aspire to but in later years it all went downhill with the demons of drugs and issues that unfortunately plagued her. Guard your heart, guard your gift and nurture it and it will make you stand before kings and people of excellence. This is my rant for today.
Yes! I am making sure that I don't stop writing ...or singing:) Watch out for my next novel...'Forbidden' coming out soon. If you want to buy my last novel which I am sure you will enjoy reading, please go to amazon to purchase my novel called Madrigal or you can buy directly from me and I will send you a signed copy
On that note, I will be publishing/sharing my new short story called 'Bus Conductor'...one chapter at a time....so watch out for this
My name is Jumoke, I am married with two kids, adorable boy and a lovely girl. I love to read and write, I have published two books so far 'The adventures of Baby Toluwashe: I know what to do' and 'Madrigal', watch out for my third one coming out soon. I love to sing and I love fashion and I love, love everything African, (as you can see, I have many loves, that's just who I am) the beautiful fabrics we wear, our culture, the communual spirit we emcompass,the strenght we radiate, the 'I dare to be bold' attitude we have. I want to bring Africa to the forefront, on par with other culture. I also love connecting with people from other culture, races, I love our differences, it tells me that our lives are meant to be rich but when you look at it we are not so different, we are all just unique individuals.

Everybody knows who Seth Rogen is these days, but his acting career got off to a relatively inauspicious start. After playing one of the “freaks” in Judd Apatow’s TV series Freaks & Geeks, his first feature film role came in Richard Kelly’s debut film, Donnie Darko, now a cult classic that is pretty widely loved (although I do know one guy who dislikes the film, probably because he finds the armchair philosophy distasteful; I think it’s similar to how somebody like me can’t watch a movie like Swordfish with a straight face, or why real-life doctors generally can’t stand House M.D.).
In this minor role, Rogen plays a high school bully named Ricky Danforth. I find it immensely amusing that not only is he a generic heavy, but he plays second fiddle to Alex Greenwald, whose acting career hasn’t exactly followed the same trajectory as Rogen’s from their common beginning (though his Wikipedia page informs me that he’s primarily a musician).
The following is a collection of three clips from Donnie Darko, which stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Jena Malone. They pretty humorously demonstrate what Rogen’s role in the film amounted to.
We see him as the sidekick bully, who gets to utter the timeless line, “I like your boobs,” before angrily flipping a cigarette butt at Donnie (Gyllenhaal).
In my favorite part, at the film’s climax, Rogen gets to grunt and shout some of the most generic dialogue imaginable. “Don’t fuckin’ move—don’t fuckin’ move!”, “Get the hell outta here—now!”, and “Come on, let’s go! They called the cops!” are all somewhat cringe-worthy.
On the last point, it’s not just funny that the dialogue is somewhat cheesy, but Rogen’s delivery also does nothing to salvage it, adding an additional layer of cheese on top. He came a long way between here and his break-out role in The 40 Year Old Virgin, and today he’s one of the more recognizable big-screen stars out there. His most recent role was in this past summer’s Funny People, which I think is his best work yet, and a performance that’s leaps and bounds above what he was doing just 8 years ago.
Donnie Darko is actually pretty fertile ground for Found Roles. That’s Noah Wyle (from ER) as the high school teacher in the clip above, and Drew Barrymore plays his colleague. Then there’s the recently-deceased Patrick Swayze in a hilarious role as the motivational speaker with a deep, dark secret. Whenever I watch Donnie Darko, though, what seems the most out of place is Seth Rogen’s appearance and performance in it, and so it’s him who I’m focusing on here—though some of those others (particularly Swayze) may be worth returning to in the near future.
Note: I feel like I’d be remiss if I discussed Seth Rogen’s early career and didn’t mention his youthful aspirations as a stand-up comic.
Pictorialist photography has been embraced initially only by the elite and then spread to the provincial intelligentsia who understood bringing of " the good, the pure and the everlasting " was nothing short of an ethical duty. Pictorialism was part of that.
The current revival of interest in the genre is due in great part to the efforts of some romantic photographers with not only a passion for antique alternative print processes but also with an ethical feeling, spirit and soul for the pure, the light and atmosphere.
Belgian image poet - fine art photographer 'Radan' André Devlaeminck (FLEMING) (°16.02.1952),"Landscape Top Photographer" at the present worked as a successful professional portraitist,a corporate and location, and fashion photographer in the 70's and 80's before concentrating on fine art photography.
At this day Radan re-applies as a pictorialist the alternative processes Bromoil and Gum Bichromate after studying photographic archaeology and nights of experimenting.
The bromoil process briefly is, that the original photographic exposed silver image, contained in gelatine on a bromide print, is bleached away chemically, replaced and applied by brush with a lithographic greasy ink.The brushes are redesigned on the same way as the earlier handmade brushes . The newly created ink image is comparable to a lithographic print. Everlasting and permanently lightfast.
This labour-intensive process, hand dyed-in-the-print with colour pigments, accentuates lively the lyrical pictorial image with a mystic light and colour effect.
And comparable to the impressionistic granular autochromes of the Lumière brothers introduced by Alfred Stieglitz in New York in 1907.
A classic adage to create a mystic and overwhelming atmosphere filled with inexpressible grandeur and lyric silence which makes man conscious of his metaphysical smallness.
An escape from this 'brutal world' and the hectic of every day. The images are the expression of a nostalgic cherishing and they radiate a serene peace through the balanced pictorial composition.
The artist gives this all an esoteric touch through his accurate observation and reproduction of the theme, thought for detail, but particularly through the high-tech finishing, the artistic and cultural - historical value of each image.
His photographs tailor-made framed, and his chromobromoils threefold matted framed with British vintage look root wood are certified one single museum quality vintage prints and become collectibles like jewels:
Of some pictures replicas or exact copies are available with the highest attainable photo quality of digital output on professional photo paper, difficult to distinguish from the originals.

Sometimes known as “subsidence insurance”, this policy designed specifically to address the difficulties that can arise with properties that have previously been underpinned. Our underpinned insurance policies are transferable – in the cases of a problematic property that has previously been subject to subsidence, there is the possibility of the policy being transferred to the new property owner, should the property be sold. Some mortgage providers consider underpinned property insurance to be compulsory – in these instances, house insurance with subsidence policies are standard.

Book Review: Food Subsidies in Developing Countries: Costs, Benefits, and Policy Options - AgEcon Search
Cancer is something that 1 out of 3 of us will have to deal with in our lives. In my family I was the first in 1999 with breast cancer. Lung cancer has since taken my mother’s life and my father and sister have both had other types of cancer. In my family it has been 4 out of 5.
When you get that diagnosis, even though you’ve been doing everything you can to have a healthy ageless body, it comes as a real shock. Then when the discussion of treatment starts the numbers are staggering in terms of cost.
Your out-of-pocket costs can soar quickly into the millions, taking your home and certainly affecting every aspect of your ageless lifestyle after 50.
And then there are the drugs to keep you alive after the treatment. That is the death knell for many families finances.
60 Minutes has done an amazing job exposing the corruption about the real cost of cancer drugs. Drugs that are priced at an annual cost of $250,000 and up are out of the reach of many families when faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis.
Doctors at one major hospital stood up to Big Pharma, as you will see in the piece, by saying no to a new drug which they felt cost twice as much and was less effective as the previous drug they used. The drug maker then reduced its price by half. So what is the real cost of cancer drugs?
And wait until you hear how the doctors are paid to recommend these drugs. They are drug salesmen often at the expense of patient care. This has a lot to do with why the U.S. drug costs are double or triple what the same drugs cost in other countries that don’t allow these unscrupulous relationships.
I can’t post them because they aren’t available in Mexico and chances are they aren’t available where you live!
The following is a script of “The Cost of Cancer Drugs” which aired on Oct. 5, 2014. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Richard Bonin, producer.
Cancer is so pervasive that it touches virtually every family in this country. More than one out of three Americans will be diagnosed with some form of it in their lifetime. And as anyone whos been through it knows, the shock and anxiety of the diagnosis is followed by a second jolt: the high price of cancer drugs.
They are so astronomical that a growing number of patients cant afford their co-pay, the percentage of their drug bill they have to pay out-of-pocket. This has led to a revolt against the drug companies led by some of the most prominent cancer doctors in the country.
Dr. Leonard Saltz: Were in a situation where a cancer diagnosis is one of the leading causes of personal bankruptcy.
Dr. Leonard Saltz is chief of gastrointestinal oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nations premier cancer centers, and hes a leading expert on colon cancer.
Lesley Stahl: So, are you saying in effect, that we have to start treating the cost of these drugs almost like a side effect from cancer?
Dr. Leonard Saltz: I think thats a fair way of looking at it. Were starting to see the term financial toxicity being used in the literature. Individual patients are going into bankruptcy trying to deal with these prices.
Dr. Leonard Saltz: And remember that many of these drugs, most of them, dont replace everything else. They get added to it. And if you figure one drug costs $120,000 and the next drugs not going to cost less, youre at a quarter-million dollars in drug costs just to get started.
Dr. Leonard Saltz: I do worry that peoples fear and anxiety are being taken advantage of. And yes, it costs money to develop these drugs, but I do think the price is too high.
The drug companies say it costs over a billion dollars to bring a new drug to market, so the prices reflect the cost of innovation.
The companies do provide financial assistance to some patients, but most people arent eligible. So many in the middle class struggle to meet the cost of their co-payments. Sometimes they take half-doses of the drug to save money. Or delay getting their prescriptions refilled.
Dr. Saltzs battle against the cost of cancer drugs started in 2012 when the FDA approved Zaltrap for treating advanced colon cancer. Saltz compared the clinical trial results of Zaltrap to those of another drug already on the market, Avastin. He says both target the same patient population, work essentially in the same way. And, when given as part of chemotherapy, deliver the identical result: extending median survival by 1.4 months, or 42 days.
Dr. Leonard Saltz: They looked to be about the same. To me, it looked like a Coke and Pepsi sort of thing.
Then Saltz, as head of the hospitals pharmacy committee, discovered how much it would cost: roughly $11,000 per month, more than twice that of Avastin.
Lesley Stahl: So $5,000 versus $11,000. Thats quite a jump. Did it have fewer side effects? Was it less toxic? Did it have
Dr. Leonard Saltz: If anything, it looked like there might be a little more toxicity in the Zaltrap study.
Dr. Peter Bach: He said, Peter, I think were not going to include a new cancer drug because it costs too much.
Bach determined that since patients would have to take Zaltrap for several months, the price tag for 42 days of extra life would run to nearly $60,000. What they then decided to do was unprecedented: reject a drug just because of its price.
Dr. Peter Bach: We did it for one reason. Because we need to take into account the financial consequences of the decisions that we make for our patients. Patients in Medicare would pay more than $2,000 a month themselves, out-of-pocket, for Zaltrap. And that that was the same as the typical income every month for a patient in Medicare.
Dr. Peter Bach: Right. 20 percent. Taking money from their childrens inheritance, from the money theyve saved. We couldnt in good conscience say, Were going to prescribe this more expensive drug.
And then they trumpeted their decision in the New York Times. Blasting what they called runaway cancer drug prices, it was a shot across the bow of the pharmaceutical industry and Congress for passing laws that Bach says allow the drug companies to charge whatever they want for cancer medications.
Another reason drug prices are so expensive is that according to an independent study, the single biggest source of income for private practice oncologists is the commission they make from cancer drugs. Theyre the ones who buy them wholesale from the pharmaceutical companies, and sell them retail to their patients. The mark-up for Medicare patients is guaranteed by law: the average in the case of Zaltrap was six percent.
Dr. Leonard Saltz: What that does is create a very substantial incentive to use a more expensive drug, because if youre getting six percent of $10, thats nothing. If youre getting six percent of $10,000 that starts to add up. So now you have a real conflict of interest.
Dr. Peter Bach: We have a pricing system for drugs which is completely dictated by the people who are making the drugs.
Dr. Peter Bach: Just a question of how brave they are and how little they want to end up in the New York Times or on 60 Minutes.
Thats because media exposure, he says, works. Right after their editorial was published, the drugs manufacturer, Sanofi, cut the price of Zaltrap by more than half.
Dr. Peter Bach: It was a shocking event. Because it was irrefutable evidence that the price was a fiction. All of those arguments that weve heard for decades, We have to charge the price we charge. We have to recoup our money. Were good for society. Trust us. Well set the right price. One op-ed in the New York Times from one hospital and they said, Oh, okay, well charge a different price. It was like we were in a Turkish bazaar.
Dr. Peter Bach: They said, This carpet is $500? and you say, Ill give you $100. And the guy says, Okay. They set it up to make it highly profitable for doctors to go for Zaltrap instead of Avastin. It was crazy!
Dr. Peter Bach: They lowered it in a way that doctors could get the drug for less. But patients were still paying as if it was high-priced.
Dr. Peter Bach: They said to the doctor, Buy Zaltrap from us for $11,000 and well send you a check for $6,000. Then you give it to your patient and you get to bill the patients insurance company as if it cost $11,000. So it made it extremely profitable for the doctors. They could basically double their money if they use Zaltrap.
High cancer drug prices are harming patients because either you come up with the money, or you die.
All this is accepted industry practice. After about six months, once Medicare and private insurers became aware of the doctors discount, the price was cut in half for everyone.
John Castellani: The drug companies have to put a price on a medicine that reflects the cost of developing them, which is very expensive and takes a long period of time, and the value that it can provide.
John Castellani is president and CEO of PhRMA, the drug industrys trade and lobbying group in Washington.
Lesley Stahl: If you are taking a drug thats no better than another drug already on the market and charging twice as much, and everybody thought the original drug was too much
John Castellani: We dont set the prices on what the patient pays. What a patient pays is determined by his or her insurance.
Lesley Stahl: Are you saying that the pharmaceutical companys not to blame for how much the patient is paying? Youre saying its the insurance company?
John Castellani: Im saying the insurance model makes the medicine seem artificially expensive for the patient.
Lesley Stahl: Twenty percent of $11,000 a month is a heck of a lot more than 20 percent of $5,000 a month.
Sanofi declined our request for an interview, but said in this email that they lowered the price of Zaltrap after listening to early feedback from the oncology community and  To ensure affordable choices for patients
Dr. Hagop Kantarjian: High cancer drug prices are harming patients because either you come up with the money, or you die.
Hagop Kantarjian chairs the department of leukemia at MD Anderson in Houston. Inspired by the doctors at Sloan Kettering, he enlisted 119 of the worlds leading leukemia specialists to co-sign this article about the high price of drugs that dont just add a few weeks of life, but actually add years, like Gleevec.
It treats CML, one of the most common types of blood cancer that used to be a death sentence, but with Gleevec most patients survive for 10 years or more.
Dr. Hagop Kantarjian: So far. And that shows the dilemma, because here you have a drug that makes people live their normal life. But in order to live normally, they are enslaved by the cost of the drug. They have to pay every year.
Gleevec is the top selling drug for industry giant Novartis, bringing in more than $4 billion a year in sales. $35 billion since the drug came to market. There are now several other drugs like it. So, youd think with the competition, the price of Gleevec would have come down.
Dr. Hagop Kantarjian: And yet, the price of the drug tripled from $28,000 a year in 2001 to $92,000 a year in 2012.
Lesley Stahl: Not just the new ones. So you have a new drug that might come out at a $100,000, but they are also saying the old drugs have to come up to that price, too?
Dr. Hagop Kantarjian: Exactly. They are making prices unreasonable, unsustainable and, in my opinion, immoral.
When we asked Novartis why they tripled the price of Gleevec, they told us, Gleevec has been a life-changing medicine  When setting the prices of our medicines we consider  the benefits they bring to patients  The price of existing treatments and the investments needed to continue to innovate
Dr. Kantarjian says one thing that has to change is the law that prevents Medicare from negotiating for lower prices.
Dr. Hagop Kantarjian: This is unique to the United States. If you look anywhere in the world, there are negotiations. Either by the government or by different regulatory bodies to regulate the price of the drug. And this is why the prices are 50 percent to 80 percent lower anywhere in the world compared to the United States.
Dr. Hagop Kantarjian: Same drug. American patients end up paying two to three times more for the same drug compared to Canadians or Europeans or Australians and others.
Lesley Stahl: Now, Novartis, which makes Gleevec, says that the price is fair because this is a miracle drug. It really works.
The challenge, Dr. Saltz at Sloan Kettering says, is knowing where to draw the line between how long a drug extends life and how much it costs.
Dr. Leonard Saltz: I dont know where that line is, but we as a society have been unwilling to discuss this topic and, as a result, the only people that are setting the line are the people that are selling the drugs.

It's always fun to see people taking shots at me. I used over the counter painkillers that 6CW didn't approve, and it apparently makes me addicted to all sorts of drugs. I showed 6CW I wouldn't adhere to their demands, while the rest of you sheep do what they want you to do.
@x12x: Max is the bigger man for walking away? If he walked away why's he in the building each week being a cheerleader for the TA? Sounds like excuses to me but what do I know...I'm just a sheep.
@x12x: blocked...what I achieve is for me and me alone. I said I didn't need the fans and I wasn't lying.

@x12x Now that's a joke to open your stand up set with. Maybe I was wrong about you not following Mick Foley into comedy.
Grace you are the reason for what happened in the past. You and all the other failures this comany has employed. Just how many people turned off there streams or went for a toilet break when you started to speak speak for that fact
I cannot dignify a response to idiots such as you @mrjm. I am world champion because of skills, stardom and spelling #company #their #speak
That moment when you cannot dignify a response yet tag them into your tweet anyway....I always knew you were thick as Edd's Ma's Dick....But reaching peak Adam Johnson grooming levels here
So Keith Leone wants to ruin Engels fun, but no matter how I beg and plead he won't give an answer...step up or step down. #bigmatchbottler
Being a target of jealousy isn't new to me. Neither is leading a successful organisation. 6CW.....you are welcome. #AGame #Saviour #Icon #Legend
The problem with you @MaxAdamson6CW is you are now merely supporting cast in my show. I'm sure that is enough to drive a man to drugs right? #WorldChampion
@TheAmazingGrace I don't even wrestle anymore. I make a sufficient enough salary without having to put my body through any more punishment. As long as I'm getting paid I don't care if you beat Joshua's record title reign mate.
That was old 6CW @MaxAdamson6CW and unless you and your little buddies can prove their worth quickly then you will find that salary negotiated. Don't go making any big purchases. #old6CWfailure #new6CWprosperous
@ClarkeJames6WF: @TheAmazingGrace Newsflash, d*ckhead. You aren't the owner. Cerberus is gonna rip your f**king head off and sh*t down your neck, then you can go back to Hollywood and make some more straight to DVD shi*t that nobody will watch. You helmet.
@ClarkeJames6WF: @TheAmazingGrace nobody talks to my mate @MaxAdamson6CW like that. You spineless f*****. That's why you have a locker room to yourself, cause we all want to kick the f**k out of you.
@ClarkeJames6WF: @TheAmazingGrace you and old chicken neck, Charlie boy. Guaranteed he's fiddled a few kids in his time. Werthers loving nonce. Pair of you should just p*ss off back to tinseltown and f**k each other.
@ClarkeJames6WF what is this 6WF you speak of? I thought you had a contract with 6CW? That can soon be rectified. So much anger from someone so insignificant. But by all means attack me to try and make a name for yourself #nothingnew #WorldChampion #Icon
@x12x: Apparently the dictionary definition of 'insignificant' changed today to "worthy of replying to". Is this really the best man to represent 6CW?! A guy who lets anyone get a reaction over twitter? #AnfannyGrace #IconforNAMBLA

@x12x: Coming from the guy who stole that r*tard Kenty's whole act? Nice one...don't at me though, I don't want to be associated with you once the unavoidable 'misconduct' accusations start coming out.

That is fine @x12x I will tell @AlexWalker6CW you don't want a world title shot now or in the future. So much for wanting to sit on top of the pile #whatexactlydoyoudohere

Joof Jansen van Rensburg was shot by neighbour SAPF constable Percy Ledwaba after the cop refused to return a rugby ball accidentially kicked across the wall by the Afrikaner’s grandsons…
22 April 2011. EVANDER. An Afrikaner father and grandfather, Joof Janse van Rensburg, reportedly shot in the stomach on 13 March by SAPS constable Percy Ledwaba in front of the white man’s son and grandsons, has succumbed to his injuries, reports the Ridge Times News in its April 22 2011 edition issue 16. The police constable remains on duty at Evander police station.
A charge of murder will “be investigated against constable Ledwaba”, said SAPF spokesman capt Leonard Hlathi. Meanwhile the constable still remains on his post, he confirmed when questioned by Ridge Times journalist Jana Oosthuizen. Hlathi said he could not confirm persistent rumours in the Afrikaans community that the service pistol with which Mr Janse van Rensburg was shot, still remained at the Evander station until he had investigated the claim. Hlathi said “forensic tests would be done to determine whether a shot was fired’
Mr Jansen van Rensburg and his wife Poppie were visiting with their daughter and her family in Selonica Street in Evander on March 13, watching their grandsons kick a rugby ball around, when the ball accidentially bounced into the neighbour’s yard. Reportedly the neighbour, constable Ledwaba, wasn’t well pleased and refused to give the ball back to the Afrikaner boys - so their dad Frans Viviers, and constable Ledwaba got into a fisticuffs with each other. When the grandfather set to to help his son-in-law, the constable reportedly then pulled out his service gun and shot Mr Jansen van Rensburg in the stomach. TheHe was rushed to Netcare N17 hospital in Springs. Ms Oosthuizen writes that he had since died of his injuries. The Ridge Times also noted that constable Ledwaba wrote in the incident book at the police station on March 13 2011 that he had shot dead Mr Jansen van Rensburg. Hlathi said they will now investigate a case of murder and their findings will be forwarded to the provincial police commissioner in Mpumalanga. “He will decide what will happen to constable Ledwaba,’ said Hlathi. Mr Jansen van Rensburg is survived by his widow, three children, three stepchildren and five grandchildren. His funeral service will take place from the Dutch Hervormed Church at Eendracht.

'Generally speaking, genocide does not necessarily mean the immediate destruction of a nation, except when accomplished by mass killings of all members of a nation. It is intended rather to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.
The objectives of such a plan would be the disintegration of the political and social institutions, of culture, language, national feelings, religion, and the economic existence of national groups, and the destruction of personal security, liberty, health, dignity and lives of the members of such groups...

I’m up to my ears in work right now, but wanted to pop into to tell you about my new sexy paranormal story…
Sidney Coffey, Seattle’s “News at Nine” girl, uncovers the scoop of a lifetime and her ticket into serious journalism. The only problem is–without proof–no one’s going to believe the victims of recent gang killings are in fact “undead” and vampires!
With her gut telling her there’s an even bigger story lurking beneath the surface, she decides to beard a reclusive vampire master in his den for an interview. But meeting the master only complicates things. For a woman with a voracious sexual appetite, the tall, dark and gloomy vamp proves an irresistible challenge.
When a reporter trespasses on his estate, Navarro is at first amused then annoyed that the little baggage is close to putting together the pieces of a dangerous plot involving an old enemy and a group of murdered geneticists. To keep her safe, Navarro issues an invitation he won’t let her refuse.
And if you read HWAP, please think about posting a review to let other readers know whether it’s worth their time and cash. Reviews do matter!
When Noah buys a classic ’68 Camaro from a fellow firefighter’s widow, he hopes it will ease some of the grief crushing his heart. But the grinding noise under the car’s hood sends him straight to a mechanic. Something about the burly, imposing Hoyt sparks Noah’s interest, and it’s not just Hoyt’s ice-blue eyes and bad-boy biker looks. It’s the mutual interest they have—Club LaForge.
After losing his partner to cancer a year ago, Hoyt never thought he’d feel the same kind of rush with another man. But his reaction to Noah throbs deep in his body like the rumble of his Harley.
LaForge seems like the perfect place to meet and work off some sorrow, to feel alive again. But the flood of desire quickly gets hot enough to melt their emotional barriers into unexpected connections.
Connections Hoyt isn’t sure he’s ready for…especially since history has a scary way of repeating itself.
Warning: Get your motor running for a Harley-riding hunk of muscle who doesn’t give a damn about the rules of being a Dom, and a firefighter who can take the heat. Buy a case of your favorite coolant. You’re gonna need it.
The second book in the Night Fall series will be released toward the end of this week. Love vampires? Love sexy threesomes? Like a little suspense with bite? Well, you’ll love Truly, Madly…Deadly!
But before the book releases, I want to be sure you’ve read the Book #1 — Sm{B}itten! So, I made sure you have no excuses left for why you haven’t read Sm{B}itten—I entered it into Kindle Unlimited, so it’s FREE to KU subscribers, and just $0.99 for everyone else!
I’d love to hear from you. Have you read Sm{B}itten? Are you excited for Truly, Madly…Deadly? Are you ready for a fast-paced, paranormal series?
There’s a lovely thing that authors know about called a “backlist.” When we publish a new book, it’s automatically on the backlist of things available for readers to find. And after you’ve been around a while, there could be a lot of books on that list—even ones so old readers don’t remember them. Like a fine piece of furniture, a writer can dust off an older title, give it a fresh coat of polish, and send it out into the world again.
I have a book coming on February 10th that’s up for pre-order now! It’s a historical western set in Two Mule, Texas—and yes, to those of you who pay attention, it’s a prequel book to the Lone Star Lovers series. I love this story. It was one of my first print books ever. It has tons of humor and sweaty sex. This one’s all dusted off, polished and ready for a second chance at life. And isn’t this the prettiest cover ever?
Honey Cafferty lives a happy, if precarious, existence as a traveling saleswoman. She sells her elixirs and potions while searching for the one thing she hasn’t been able to brew from the back of her colorful wagon—a sense of belonging. She arrives in Two Mule, Texas, with her Elixir of Love, a potion that improves a man’s libido but might just get her run out of town.
Sheriff Joe Tanner is protective of his little town. Downright hostile toward anyone who might take advantage of the fine folk under his protection. Any snake-oil salesman who rolls into town better just keep right on rolling.
Honey isn’t what Joe expected, from her vibrant red hair and cat-green eyes to her curvy mouth and hips. And when the men of the town begin to plead exhaustion—and place the blame squarely on her sweet-smelling shoulders—Joe has no choice but to launch an investigation. A very, very deep investigation…
Warning: Contains a sheriff who prides himself on keeping his town running as smooth as a well-greased wagon wheel, and a wandering saleswoman who’s more than a bump (and grind) in his road.
Well, Burnin’ up Memphis is available on all sites now! I can hardly wait to hear from you. I hope you love it. I hope you love my guys. I have an inkling where I’ll go next, but it’s always nice to hear which fella struck your fancy.
The only thing I have left to say is this: If you love the book, please let someone else know it. You can tell a friend or post a review. The only way I can stay a success and writing full-time is through your continued support. I’m very appreciative of everyone you do.
When a roof collapse kills his best friend and his girlfriend clears out his apartment and leaves, firefighter John Cooper knows he shouldn’t sit alone in his empty apartment. But when he accepts an invitation to Club LaForge, his feet get colder with every step he takes inside.
The sights, sounds and smells of the BDSM club make him sweat, and not because he’s turned off. Yet he can’t bring himself to admit—to himself, or to his luscious guide, Moira—that this lifestyle might just be what he needs.
An experienced BDSM trainer, Moira senses that Coop is not only a Dom in the making, but exactly what she’s been looking for. A man to be her lover and her Dom. The only problem is, Coop isn’t looking for anything complicated.
Moira’s willing to start slow and easy, but even once there’s enough trust to bring Coop into her world—and to her Dom—she’s still worried he’ll look for the nearest exit.
Warning: Do you smell smoke? Don’t worry, it’s just a hot and sexy firefighter getting down and dirty. Contains BDSM scenes, ropes, floggers, some spanking, some sharing, and some five-alarm sex.
I seem to have officially become a color coded Post It girl. I’m can’t say it’s something I planned, or would have expected. For years I’ve kept a running list of things needing to be done on a legal pad. And for those years I found myself irritated by the messiness of the list with all the lines through it. Always wanting a clean list, this meant I was rewriting the list over and over, which isn’t as effective as just doing the item. You know?
Then, I made a change in my workspace. I got rid of the large desk in the open area upstairs and instead moved to a small writing desk in a corner in my bedroom. It was an adjustment, but the move has forced me to rethink my organization. I cut down on the clutter, which always makes me happy, and I’ve figured out the most effective way to use the space.
One change to using the space was to move from the never ending list rewrite to sticking Post It Notes on the wall I now face. I’ve found that with the stickies staring me in the face I’m more inclined to get things done because I would rather look at a blank wall than an Post It filled one.
I’ve also found that color coding the Post Its makes things easier. Apparently I like to compartmentalize, because I’ve gone so far to do Green for Day Job, Orange for Personal, Pink/Melon for Band/School and Red for Writing. There’s also a major feeling of accomplishment when I empty things off the wall.
This has me wondering, though, what kind of person are you? Semi-organized? Scattered? Obsessively methodical? Somewhere in between? Do you like lists or do you just have an amazing memory that doesn’t requires lists?
Commenters will be entered into a drawing for an eBook giveaway. In celebration of the recent release of Cyber Illusions (Sensory Ops), the final chapter in the Sensory Ops Series, I am giving away a digital copy of the first five books in the Sensory Ops series.

The transport arrived amid a whirl of dust kicked up from the barren yard beside the house. The gritty air nearly obscured the moon, Phobos, as it made the first of several orbits for the day. The aircraft hovered, framed by the uneven curves of the asteroid, then set down with a thud that shuddered the fiber-board planks of her front porch, vertical engines stalling then shutting off altogether. Slowly, the dust settled.
She’d been sweeping, preparing the cabin for the transport’s arrival. As with every element of the company’s schedule, the ship arrived precisely on time. Although she was prepared, a flutter of anticipation tickled her belly. She set aside the broom, wiped her palms against the sides of her sturdy blue work pants, and descended the stairs, eager to meet the shipment.
Mary’s heart skipped a beat when she realized she hadn’t had a face-to-face conversation with another human being in a very long time. She pasted on a smile. “Welcome.”
His sharp gaze swept her little cabin, the golden fields beyond it, then finally rested on her. “You Mary Bledsoe?”
He likely wondered how someone of her stature had managed to pass the physical tests to qualify for farming. She stiffened her spine to add a few centimeters to her small, wiry frame and met his gaze with her usual calm, chilly stare. “I am.” She bit back a sarcastic, Who else do you think I could be? Every one of the thousand colonists had been handpicked and transported by the company—they had a monopoly on Martian transportation and industry.
His mouth twitched, but he kept his gaze steady. “I have your shipment, and I’ll need your signature on the bill of lading.”
She nodded. “I’ll need to inspect.” She’d received notice of the contents of the shipment via the comm-console situated in the cabin’s main room shortly after claiming her homestead.
Although the fields had been pre-planted and her new home fully furnished, there were still some items, especially the perishables, that needed stocking: replacement blades for the combine sheltered in the barn, pallets of foodstuffs, clothing, and fuel packs…and her mate.
Trying not to appear overeager to see him, she waited as the transport commander’s crew scurried to let down the rear ramp and roll out the pallets. With well-trained efficiency, they stacked them beside the porch. She counted the pallets with their quick-wrapped goods, scanned her gaze over the identifying labels, signed for delivery, then shoved her hands into her pockets to hide the fact they were beginning to shake.
The commander’s mouth firmed into a straight line. “Did you receive training in the use of the B-Mod collar?”
He knew she had. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be here, already in possession of a land grant. She gave a curt nod. “Yes. I also signed saying I knew there were no guarantees for my safety or his willingness to work. If we don’t suit, if he proves stubborn, then I’ll return him.”
“Just don’t get too attached, ma’am. You have enough on your hands without coddling one of these rejects.”
The brusque quality of his voice surprised her. Was he truly worried? Should she be more concerned? Her hands drew into fists inside her pants pockets.
But then he extended the chain with the controller for the prisoner’s behavior modification collar, a thin ID tag with a recessed button on one side. She slipped it over her head and followed him to the side of the transport. The guard inside the vehicle opened the door. The prisoner scooted on the seat toward the edge, hands still in manacles, then slid to the ground beside her.
Heart rate rising, she gazed up into a face set in grim lines. Blue eyes, cold as ice, sparked with some deep emotion as he stared back.
He was larger than she had expected. Surprisingly so. Prisoners built like this one were generally shipped to company loading docks or to the dome’s arena. He was dressed as she was in sturdy denim pants and long-sleeved shirt. She studied his broad chest and wide shoulders. He was built like a gladiator; his arms and thighs were deeply muscled. “You’re sure he’s mine?” she asked, turning toward the commander who’d fished a key from his pocket to unlock the prisoner’s handcuffs.
The pilot’s grunt and the flinty glare he gave the prisoner said he too had some reservations. “His collar matches the invoice. Guess they thought you might need the extra muscle.”
Anger flashed at his comment. She’d had enough of men thinking she wasn’t up to the rigors of Martian prairie life. Her hand still gripped the B-Mod chip. She slipped it slowly away, remembering her training. Show no fear. As long as she had the chip, she had control.
Without glancing at the metal torque hugging the base of his neck, because she didn’t want to betray her sudden case of nerves, she lifted her chin and cleared her expression.
One side of his mouth quirked. That flash of movement might have been her imagination because he gave her a stony stare.
Heat crept up her neck, but she ignored the blush threatening to suffuse her face. Turning back to the commander, she offered her hand.
Not a professional form of address, but no one had called her by her first name, alone, for a very long time. For that small gift, she gave him a warm smile. “Thanks for everything. We’ll be fine here.”
A duffel was tossed from the transport by one of the guards. The bag was small. Likely only a couple changes of clothing for the prisoner. She jerked her chin toward it, knowing she was still being observed by the crew. “Bring it,” she said, making her tone curt. She turned, walking toward the cabin, wondering if the lock on her new mate’s door would actually hold the man.
Ever have a character in a book who was larger than life, who you knew would scare the crap out of you if you met him in the real world?
And he’s a Dom. The last man standing in his very close-knit, kinky band of brothers in blue. Readers have been asking for his story since the first of my Delta Heat books came out. It’s been a long wait. There were five other stories leading up to this one. I know you won’t mind the wait. Not once you reach THE END.
The novella drops into online bookstores tomorrow. I can’t wait to hear what you think. 🙂 For now, you can pre-order you copy here: Samhain Publishing
When his four Memphis PD friends needed to let off steam, Mondo helped them all navigate the BDSM world—his world—and find the women of their dreams. Now the vice cop and La Forge Master/Dom is the last single man standing. And he’s feeling a little like the odd man out.
He’s been waiting a long time for the right woman, one strong enough to match his dark passions. A timid grade school teacher definitely doesn’t make the short list.
Sunny Boudreau was content with her rather prosaic life until a trio of lovers moves in next door. But as she gets to know them and all their friends, she’s drawn to the edge of their ménage/BDSM play. She’s tempted to take the plunge—except Mondo warns her off.
Her first taste of the club only whets her appetite and ignites her desire to prove she’s exactly the woman Mondo’s been hungering for.
Warning: BDSM play at your favorite kinky club, group play at home, some fun BDSM, girl-on-girl kissing, an orgy…the usual for our boys in blue.
Sunny refused to think about what she was doing, concentrating instead on moving one foot in front of the other, despite her trepidation and embarrassment. Part of her couldn’t believe she was doing this, walking nude into a roomful of strangers. The other part clung to the sight of the man walking in front of her. Anger at how quickly he’d dismissed her commitment to this path without really knowing her fueled her forward movement.
He didn’t know how lonely she was, how out of step she was with her acquaintances at work. They had their boyfriends, had their plain vanilla sex, their ordinary lives, when she dreamed of something more. Something rare and exciting. Not until she’d met Pansy had she understood her need to explore her true nature.
Since the night she’d masturbated, knowing full well Mondo watched, she’d devoured every book she could find on BDSM and fetishes, and much of what she’d read left her feeling as though she’d only been half alive before. And now she stood on a precipice, ready to take the dive into deeper, dark waters.
And Mondo was the key. The teacher she needed. Already he was more attractive, more mysterious and dangerous than anyone she’d ever met. As a vice cop, he faced dangers at work she could only imagine. A far cry from her own job, which she loved, but which didn’t fill her need for adventure.
Even now, wearing his collar, her breaths were so shallow she had to consciously force them to deepen or risked fainting. And wouldn’t Mondo love it if she did, proving he’d been right all along? Following Mondo out of his playroom and into the noisy, boisterous salon took an act of courage—courage she hadn’t known she possessed. Just summoning up the nerve to step inside La Forge fully dressed had taken nearly everything she had.
She didn’t like crowds, had hated lining up with the others who hoped they’d be chosen for play and instruction, on display for an entire room of barely dressed people to be eyed like they were trussed-up chickens in a meat market.
Pansy had wanted to take her shopping, to buy something sexy and appropriately subbie, but Sunny had hesitated. Sure, she’d read a lot about the lifestyle, but she wasn’t prepared to act as though she knew more than she did.
Everything she’d read had excited her, but she knew herself well enough to know she had to enter this adventure on her own terms, be completely herself, or she’d balk at the last minute from fear and embarrassment.
The fact that Mondo had managed to get her out of her clothes so quickly and striding toward the noisy room was a testament to how much she wanted him as a teacher. Or perhaps how much she wanted to prove him wrong. Anger continued to fuel her bravado.
Pansy had extolled his skills, his sensitivity, his strength. She’d told Sunny that he could push a sub farther than her pre-conceived limits—and it had to be true, because already she was naked and aroused—something any of the dozens of players turning their way to note their passage would see. Her nipples were tightly beaded, her areolas dimpled. Moisture was pooling between her legs. She hoped the dim lighting would hide the gleam between her thighs.
Shutting the others out before she lost her nerve, she kept her gaze on Mondo’s broad shoulders as he moved with purpose through the center of the room, past chairs and sofas where a dizzying array of sexual acts were occurring.
Her mouth dropped as she spotted Pansy, bent forward with Billy holding her hands to provide her balance, her pregnant belly bared, while Beau clapped his hand on her naked bottom—not harshly enough to rock her body, but her cheeks were pink, her pussy flushed and engorged—for anyone to see.
Sunny’s cheeks burned for her new friend. Taking another step, she bumped into Mondo, who turned his head and gave her a searing glance. “Sorry, Sir,” she mumbled, not able to meet his knowing gaze, because she’d been caught staring at another woman’s pussy.
Sunny swallowed hard, surprised at how much she envied Pansy’s predicament. Meeting Mondo’s hard gaze, she quivered inside. Sensing he’d know if she tried to give him anything less than the truth, she admitted her interest with a whispered, “Yes, Sir.”
Mondo stepped closer, forcing her head up to maintain their locked gazes. A hand slipped between her thighs, fingers gliding in the moisture coating her smooth outer labia. Shock sent a shiver straight up her spine at the intimate touch, and she nearly reached out to push his hand away.
Without any emotion in his eyes, Mondo smiled. “I’ll touch you however I want. No matter who watches.”
The urge to widen her stance, to invite further caresses warred with the chilling awareness that others watched.
Mondo gave her a long look. Everything inside her made her want to lower her gaze, to hide the longing surging up inside her. For him. For what this place offered. How much of that longing was for him specifically or for what he might be able to teach her, she wasn’t sure. But she held his gaze, braving out the tense moment.
She ducked her head, averting her gaze as she’d been instructed. She almost smiled at his irritation but firmed her lips to hide her amusement. The fact she wanted to smile when she was nude and vulnerable surprised her. She’d never done this before. Even with the few lovers she’d had, she was quick to find a robe rather than parade naked.
“I want you to watch with me tonight,” he said, his voice pitched low. “Be my shadow. When I pause, you kneel. When I move, you follow.” He trailed a finger down the side of her face. “If I caress you, you will let me see whether you feel pleasure or discomfort. Hide nothing.”
He pulled his head back and looked down at her, his eyes narrowed as he studied her face. “I shouldn’t. You’re bold and shouldn’t be rewarded. You have a lot to learn.”
“You didn’t say you won’t.” The further narrowing of his eyes told her she’d displeased him. Quickly, before he could respond, she slowly knelt in front of him. “You paused, Sir.”
In TASTE ME DEADLY, the heroine has a passion for making chocolate, though she buried it years earlier. There is something sexy about melting chocolate and smoothing it out over a granite countertop, working it into mold, making shavings and drizzles. Its silken smoothness against your skin and the excitement of imagining your lover as the countertop while you work the chocolate over him.
In TASTE ME DEADLY, Liam helps his heroine, Grey, rediscover her passion while encouraging her to make a few new friends. And what better entertainment could there be for four women in a kitchen than chocolate and talking about men?
Of all the recipes I found while researching TASTE ME DEADLY, the one that I’m hoping to one day make are baby tortes. This one that I found on Pinterest looks sweet and romantic and perfect for a romantic dinner with a lover.
Commenters on today’s blog will be entered into a drawing for a digital copy of the first two Sensory Ops books.
After five years in Witness Protection, Greycen Craig’s life of careful routine is upended when she learns her sister is the victim in a hit and run, hospitalized, unconscious, and needing a kidney only Grey can give.
Despite warnings that this “accident” is a ruse to draw her out into the open, Grey risks everything to race back to Miami—where she comes face to face with the one man she aches to trust.
FBI agent Liam Burgess thinks he’s prepared for the moment Grey walks into her sister’s hospital room. But the moment the woman who holds his heart appears, his tongue is almost too tied to remember to ask one burning question—why she disappeared in Las Vegas two years ago.
As Grey struggles with what to tell him—everything or nothing—the danger that drove her underground resurfaces, threatening everyone she loves. And the only safe place to run is the arms of the one man she can’t tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

Playing switch in front of a La Forge BDSM club audience was supposed to be a one-time fling. A favor for a friend. Instead, when Craig Eason realizes he’s caught the attention of an enigmatic, powerful Dom across the crowded room, he senses this could be the man he’s been looking for to test the boundaries of his own sexuality.
Firefighter Aiden Byrne is a very private man with strong S&M longings he keeps in check for everyone else’s safety. His sub, Jennifer Callum, thinks she likes it rough, but he can’t let go the way he’d like to. Until one defiant stare from the handsome cop on the La Forge stage causes Aiden’s most dangerous needs to uncoil from the deepest, darkest part of his soul.
With the blessing—and active involvement—of his sub, a seduction is set in motion that ends in a scene that shakes them all to the core…
Warning: Contains a powerful, burly firefighter who plans to take everything a hot cop thinks he knows about himself and send it up in smoke. Please replace the batteries in all your smoke detectors before reading this book. Contains scenes with m/m/f, m/m, spanking, flogging, restraints, and one wild orgy of pleasure.

Otumfuo Osei Tutu was a Special Guest of Honour at the 75th Anniversary of the death of a former Okyenhene, Nana Sir Ofori Atta. Nana Ofori Atta is the source of transformation for Akyem Abuakwa.
Furthermore, this visit is one for the history books. This is because the last an Asante king went to Kyebi he died. That incident occurred over 300 years ago. Also, the Asantes and Akyems were once bitter rivals following ancestral wars fought between their forefathers in colonial Ghana. That day in 1717 was Opemsuo Osei Tutu’s last as his dreaded army, victorious in dismantling the Denkyira empire, was halted in their tracks before returning to Kumasi.

If you are an owner of a huge company that manufactures a certain product, then you would probably want an easy flow of operations within your business. That is why finding and using the right industrial equipment is quite essential. Now there are various types of industry out there in the world. In this article, you will have an idea of the different types of equipment used on each respective industry that is made accessible to various companies:
Chemical Industry – is an industry or business in which organizations produce certain chemicals for the supposed benefit of the people. This type of industry produces a ton of products which include but not limited to pesticides, silica, coconut oil, and polyethylene. That just means that there is a wide array of equipment used within this industry. The important of them all, are machinery in which they facilitate chemicals from negatively reacting to one another.
Now, what are some of these equipment used? The common ones include a variety of analytical machines like the spectrophotometer, and also a few distillation setups as well.
Agriculture & Forestry – in this industry, big machinery are often used by workers in the field. Although, this isn’t applicable to all aspects of farming businesses around, as some people still like to do it the old fashion way. In this industry, typical machineries like the tractor have become prevalent to most farms out there, while second-hand tools are viable to the farmer’s own discretion.
You could do a lot of things with agriculture. Some of these tasks include pesticide regulation, cultivating and tilling soil, harvesting crops, planting seeds, and even grading some vegetables and fruits. With regards to the equipment used, the typical ones include ploughs, wagons, backhoes broadcast seeders, milking machines, and the tractor.
Construction – in this industry, far more advanced equipment and machinery are used by companies or businesses out there. It is widely known that construction is the main focus of this industry, although there are other aspects and tasks involved as well. Some of these include the management of the construction site, conceptualizing, designing, surveying, allocating funds, devising a schedule, and also providing materials or equipment to the employees or workers assigned.
Some of the equipment used within this business include bulldozers, excavators, cranes, drilling machines, forklifts, and wheel loaders.
Manufacturing – on this industry, manufacturing of items is again involved although, apart from the chemical industry, it involves more on the production of non-chemically based products or materials. Some of these products include food packagings, electronic gadgets, automobiles, apparels, and certain equipment or machinery that are also used by other sectors of the industry. That means that there are a variety of equipment used within this industry. Examples within this industry include car lifts, compressors, vacuum sealers, flatbed cutters, and even process controllers.

Gustav Klimt was a brilliant and extremely remarkable artist who’s work was produced in the time of Austrian born artist’s career. The works of that time were basically seen controversial. Appallingly, the work was largely criticized due to exotic and erotic nature of the artist’s works. His art forms were not at all subtle. In fact he entirely and exceptionally used symbolism in his paintings and the marvels he created went far beyond people imagination of that era. Although, the efforts he worked with did not pay off well as it was not widely accepted by the people but some bits he designed during his colorful career are seen currently as the most influential and important pieces of Austria.
“Whoever wants to know something about me – as an artist who alone is significant – they should look attentively at my pictures and there seek to recognize what I am and what I want.”
Gustav Klimt, the Austrian painter was Vienna’s most esteemed advocator of the Art Nouveau. His amusing styles were also renowned in Germany as Jugendstil which literally meant “youth style”. He is remembered and honoured as the greatest of all decorative painters of twentieth century and he also created marvellously some significant forms of erotic art. At the very beginning of his career, he was accomplished as a conventional painter and encountered modern trends of European art from that encourage him to produce his personal uniquely eclectic and fantastic styles.
“I can paint and draw. I believe this myself and a few other people say that they believe this too. But I’m not certain of whether it’s true.”
He created many paintings and murals ceiling in various buildings in Vienna and got famous throughout the Austro Hungarian Empire. Then Gustav Klimt very conveniently and passionately grew out of the historical fashion of interior décor. Fortunately, the art world existing in Vienna at the end of the century was looking for new ways and directions just like Gustav Klimt was. By resting under the strong influence of Asian art, symbolism and several European artistic movements, He advanced his enchanting formal language of mosaic elements, two dimensional, instructive colors and alluring art ornaments of Nouveau.
One of his most wondrously famous painting known as “the kiss” was marked as the peak of golden phase and a new form of high spirited art period got introduced. This was characterized by the dominating catchy ornaments and the use of terrific gold leaf.
According to the respectable painter Klimt, he confessed that self-portraits were never his cup of tea. But later on, strange yet interestingly, he started to paint people especially women. He created women portraits in his own erotic forms which is truly charming and abstract in its own manner. Floge who was the most affectionate companion of Klimt introduced him to one of the lakes called Attersee. He got inspired by the charismatic and enamoring landscapes where he normally spends his summers.
Gustav Klimt started travelling to Rome and Florence in 1911 and constructed various masterpieces. The Virgin, Death and Life and The Bride are among the most provocative and infatuating landscape art works that he designed the next coming years. Outside the boundaries of Vienna, these marvels were widely accepted and admired mainly due to the different forms of arts. He still maintained his work which was graphical in nature and took over a non-traditional thinking depicting landscapes and human figures. Majority of the work that he painted was only a few years away from his death and it was largely accepted and appreciated outside Vienna.
The golden words of the pleasing artist who won hearts of almost all the art lovers by creating desirable paintings for the entire world:
“Sometimes I miss out the morning’s painting session and instead study my Japanese books in the open.”
“There is nothing that special to see when looking at me. I’m a painter who paints day in day out, from morning till evening – figure pictures and landscapes, more rarely portraits.”
Pablo Picasso, indubitably one of the finest artists to have been born in the 20th century, lives in our hearts and minds through his marvelous work. Whenever he stroked a blank canvas with his brush, a rift in time was made; a piece of work immortalized at the very instance it was created.
His paintings, besides being iconic and largely recognized throughout the world, also often sell for substantial fortunes. The Spanish maestro’s work has become the pride and honor of art galleries, museums and private collections over the years. No other artist of his age has had such a huge impact upon the world of art and upon the life of a commoner alike.
Having previously looked upon the most popular works of the artist, we now bring you a compilation of his most expensive paintings. Here’s a list of the 5 most expensive paintings of Pablo Picasso:
The Spanish maestro’s very own tender-aged mistress Marie-Therese Walter is depicted in this exquisite work of art. She has been captured sleeping on a comfortable arm chair; a scenery that Picasso went on to replicate in another one of his Marie-Therese Walter paintings titled ‘La Lecture’. Legend has it that the artist finished this brilliant painting in one sitting on the afternoon of January 24th 1932. Marie-Therese Walter was only twenty four years of age back then while Picasso had just hit his fifties. There are two things about this painting which make it particularly renowned: it’s lush erotic imagery and the accident in which it was damaged back in 2006.
La Reve makes it to the top of the list of Pablo Picasso’s most expensive paintings. It has been sold for record price only to break that record in future! It placed sixth in the list of the most expensive paintings ever to have been sold back in November 1997 when, at a Christie’s auction, it brought in an astounding 48.4 million US dollars. It was then being resold in 2006 to the well known art collector Steven Cohen for 139 million (thrice its record price) by its previous owner and casino tycoon Steve Wynn. Wynn, while showing off this majestic work to a few of his friends, ran his arm right through the painting which therefore lowered its value down to 85 million. At first he planned not to sell it again but, in early 2013, he got it fixed and made good as new. The painting was then sold, at another one of Christie’s auctions, to Steven Cohen in 2006 for a staggering 155 million US dollars which makes it the second most expensive painting ever to have been sold!
Being another one of Marie-Therese Walter’s depictions, Nude, Green Leaves and Bust, like La Reve, also appeals to the eye of the beholder with its erotic content. Along the bottom of the painting, Picasso’s young mistress can be seen lying naked on floor with her limbs stretched out irregularly. In the background, leaves of the philodendron – or love – tree can be spotted. Picasso fancied the love tree and kept one in his residence. Upon keener inspection of the painting, there can be spotted a face coming out from behind a curtain. It is assumed to be Picasso’s own, emerging to deliver a kiss on his mistresses’ body. The painting belongs to the artist’s famous ‘blue period’. By now, he had perfected his own painting techniques. It is believed that Nude, Green Leaves and Bust was finished within a day.
Sidney and Frances Brody, famous art collectors of the 1950s bought this majestic artwork for a fairly low $17,000 somewhere in 1952. Until May 2010, the painting resided with the Brodies. It was then auctioned at Christie’s where it was sold for $106.5 million. Until La Reve was resold in 2013, Nude Green Leaves and Bust held the prestigious title of being Picasso’s most expensive painting while also holding the world record for being the most expensive painting sold at an auction.
Garcon a la Pipe shows, in portrait, a boy wearing a crown made of roses on his head while holding a pipe in his left hand. This boy was a street worker from Paris who used to pose for Picasso. The maestro was only twenty four years of age when he finished painting this brilliant painting. Garcon a la Pipe brought the young Picasso a great deal of fame. The color theme of the painting distinguishes it from his later works. This one belongs to his famous Rose period.
The very first person to have bought this masterpiece was John Whitney, who paid $30,000 for it back in 1950. Whitney was the American ambassador to Great Britain. Garcon a la Pipe stayed a part of his private collection until the May of 2004. John Whitney died in 1982 and his wife, Betsey found a philanthropic organization called ‘Greentree Foundation’ soon afterwards. The painting was brought to a Sotheby’s auction under the Greentree Foundation’s supervision on 2004. The painting held the record for the greatest pre-sale estimate ever back then when it was estimated to sell around $70 million. The Spanish maestro’s masterpiece went on astonishing the experts attending the auction when it shot up to $104 million. It is the third most expensive painting by Picasso.
Besides being one of his most iconic works, Dora Maar Au Chat was Picasso’s own personal favorite. The subject of the portrait is his very own mistress Dora Maar, who also happened to be one of the most popular surrealist photographers of the time. He always used to refer to her as his own ‘private muse’. The painting shows Dora Maar, alike Marie-Therese Walter, sitting on an armchair posing for the Picasso. In the background, a black cat can be seen right beside Dora’s shoulder. The Spanish maestro blends both bright and dark shades brilliantly in this work of his. For instance, the chaotic pattern of Dora’s dress, it increases the mystery of the painting two-fold.
Leigh and Mary Block, art collectors from Chicago, originally owned the painting. They decided to sell it to Chicago’s Gidwitz family’s private collection in 1963. After remaining a part of the Gidwitz collection for a good 43 years, it was put up for auction at the Sotheby’s in 2006. Experts estimated its value to go up to $50 million. And just like Garcon a la Pipe, Dora Maar Au Chat too went beyond it’s pre-sale estimates by quite a large sum. It was sold to a buyer whose identity remains unknown to this day. He paid $95.22 million (which is twice the pre-sale estimate) for the painting and it finally ceased to be a part of the Gidwitz collection.
Femme Aux Bras Croises, which fairly translates to: ‘woman with crossed arms’ belongs to the maestro’s famous Blue Period. It is believed that the subject of this artwork was an actual female inmate belonging to a prison hospital in Paris called Saint Lazare. Among the many owners of this brilliant portrait was a famous writer and art collector named Gertrude Stein. He later had the high honor of becoming a subject of one of Picasso’s paintings.
The portrait was bought buy Chauncey McCormick, an art collector from a wealthy American family in 1963. It stayed with the mcCormicks till 2000. It was then bought by an anonymous buyer at an auction at Christie’s. There went on an intense battle of bids before the owner was chose. It sold for 55 million US dollars and remains, to this day, among the most expensive Picasso paintings ever.
While Sandro Botticelli didn’t get to relish the perks of fame much during his lifetime, paintings by Botticelli came to be recognized as one of the high-flying elements of the Early Renaissance. A Florentine by origin, he is considered among the more educated artists of the Renaissance period. While they are many in numbers, we shall look at some of the more well-known paintings by Botticelli.
This one (pictured above) is more commonly and frequently referred to as simply The Annunciation. Utilizing Tempera on Panel as the medium, it took close to 1 year for Botticelli to complete it after it was commissioned by the Church of Florentine Convent of Costello in 1489; the completion took place sometime in 1490. Currently available for viewing at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, the original painting has “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee” from St. Luke’s Gospel (1:35) inscribed in Latin at the bottom.

The internet is a great place to buy paintings; or indeed anything these days. Online stores and auction houses operate round the clock and your desired products can be obtained with just a click of the button; the sheer variety is also bewildering and you can browse through literally thousands of watercolor paintings in a single store, let alone others.
Buying watercolor flower and oil flower paintings on the internet saves you from a lot of unnecessary fatigue if you were to go physically to an art gallery or print shops to select one; since this calls for you to dedicate many hours of your precious time and energy.
Fernando Botero Angulo is a Columbian artist and sculptor who has amassed great fame and has been a world renowned figurative artist for well over 3 decades. He was born in the city of Medellin, which is also the second largest municipality in Columbia on April 19, 1932. Fernando had a tough childhood as his family struggled to make ends meet; his father David Botero rode on horseback and was a salesman, while his mother Flora Angulo was a seamstress.
David Botero died when Fernando was only 4 years old and the little family looked towards their mother as their sole financial support. From then on, Botero’s uncle supported the family and paid for Fernando to be sent to a matador’s school for 2 years. Fernando had initially been isolated from the more mainstream art genres as presented in cultural institutions and museums. The young boy was instead influenced by the Baroque sculpture styles of the rich city life and early colonial churches.
By the time he was 16 years old, Fernando Botero had already published his first mainstream illustrations for the daily El Colombiano paper’s Sunday supplement. The money earned from these publications was used to pay the high school fees which Botero attended at the Liceo de Marinilla de Antioquia. It was during this time that his paintings were first exhibited in 1948.
Abstract Art in its most basic form is the modern take classical artistic expression form like Expressionism, Impressionism, and Romanticism. In fact, abstract art as we have come to know it today almost didn’t exist until the late 19th century. It had been experimented on by classical artists in the 17th and 18th century, but it had not yet been recognized as a distinct practice that could capitalize as a separate art entity in itself.
Broadly speaking, when we talk about abstract art, we also mention Figurative and Non-Figurative art. But there are subtle differences between these three art forms and a sweeping generalization is not so easily explained. It is prudent therefore to consider Abstractionism in art as being fundamentally different from these other 2 categories. In fact, we may even say that Abstract Art is totally different in the sense that artists aim to deliberately distort their depictions of seemingly random and ordinary things.
This deviation of reality is what makes Abstract art so popular and unique. Depending on the level of abstractionism we divide this art in to two categories; Fauvism and Cubism. If the paintings depict a partial deviation from reality then it is termed as Fauvism whereas complete deviation is Cubism. Thus we can conclude that abstract art never really strives to create artistic brilliance in the form of realism (as was the case in classical art) but rather there are a whole horde of potential subjects that can be addressed through Abstract Art.
Art is basically anything that results through the bodily expression of certain ideas and states of the human mind and emotions through visual and optical means; meaning paintings, music, all these are classified as art forms. Arts can be classified into a diverse number of contemporary styles and expressions, common art forms include painting, print making, and sculpture.
The 3 art forms mentioned above have been around ever since the advent of modern man dating back to the Egyptian age. More recent trends have emerged such as performing arts which include theatre, film, music, and dance. But the subject of discussion here is solely painting. There are many different kinds of paintings too, and art had really diversified into 3 major classes; Romanticism, Expressionism, and Impressionism.
The world of arts and craft are bereft with highly valuable creations from popular artists and sculptures. These valuable paintings and the like are showcased at some of the world’s leading art museums as well as private collections; many people are enthusiastic collectors since the possession of any one of such notable works exude a certain class or elite of the owner and says a lot about his personality.
While collectors may adopt the legal process of acquiring a historically significant painting or artifact by paying the millions of dollars it costs, there are some who prefer stealing.
Historically, there have been significant paintings that were stolen at some time and remained unseen for many decades afterwards, but a majority of paintings resurface after a few years; mostly on the black market, in private collections, or the authorities recover it.
Discussed below are some of the famous paintings that have been stolen during the last 50 years. Continue reading
Amerighi da Caravaggio or Michaelangelo Merisi as he is more famously called was a popular Italian artist from the 16th century. Caravaggio was born in the year 1571 in the city of Milan, Italy.
He showed great potential for art ever since very early in his childhood, and eventually would go on to train under such coveted names as Simone Peterzano in his birth city of Milan. When he was 20 years old, Caravaggio moved to Rome where he was able to use his talents as a gifted painter to get painting contracts for many new palazzos and churches which required emerging talent for filling its interior spaces and domes.
Abstract Art is a relatively new kind of contemporary expressionism through which apparently random blotches of color and patterns are used to communicate ideas. It is often mixed with non-objective art and non-figurative art; there are similarities among all three, but the meaning of each is not exactly identical. So it is better to perceive Abstract Art as separate from other two.

How beautiful! My dear children, my cenacle burns with love for Me and for my Son this evening. Be always assiduous in prayer, now more than ever. You know that in these difficult times only prayer can help you.
I am near to you, always ready to listen to your voice. Ask for all those graces that you need to win eternal life. Do not lose your mind if you are not always fulfilled by the things of this world, but exult in all those graces that you have with respect to the infinite Kingdom of God.
Pray for all my young people who are losing themselves because of drugs, unbridled sexuality, drunkenness. My children, they no longer think about the needs of the spirit itself because they are taken in by the false joys of the world.
Never before as in this moment has Satan been making a pillage of my weakest children. Temptations do not leave you for even one moment. Be more attentive; seek not to follow the one who seems to be the most beautiful, since he incites you to accept his false offers.
The good comes only from God and if you are not attentive, you can easily err. Listen to the voice of my Son. He loves you and you are his. Open the doors of your hearts and all will appear clearer to you.
The days to come will be yet more trying. Be strong, help each other. In difficulties ask the advice of your priests and start again on the path that leads you to freedom of body and spirit.
Follow the Word of God and you cannot err. He is Light. Do not waste time in worldliness but dedicate to the Father each moment of your brief life.
In early 2007, a powerful image came to me one day during prayer. I recount it again here (from The Smoldering Candle):
I saw the world gathered as though in a dark room. In the center is a burning candle. It is very short, the wax nearly all melted. The Flame represents the light of Christ: Truth.
I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. (John 8:12)
The world for the most part is ignoring this Flame. But for those who are not, those who are gazing at the Light and letting It guide them, something wonderful and hidden is happening: their inner being is secretly being set aflame.
There is rapidly coming a time when this period of grace will no longer be able to support the wick (civilization) due to the sin of the world. Events which are coming will collapse the candle completely, and the Light of this candle will be snuffed out. There will be sudden chaos in the “room.”
He takes understanding from the leaders of the land, till they grope in the darkness without light; he makes them stagger like drunken men. (Job 12:25)
The deprivation of Light will lead to great confusion and fear. But those who had been absorbing the Light in this time of preparation we are now in will have an inner Light by which to guide them and others (for the Light can never be extinguished). Even though they will be experiencing the darkness around them, the inner Light of Jesus will be shining brightly within, supernaturally directing them from the hidden place of the heart.
Then this vision had a disturbing scene. There was a light in the distance… a very small light. It was unnatural, like a small fluorescent light. Suddenly, most in the room stampeded towards this light, the only light they could see. For them it was hope… but it was a false, deceptive light. It did not offer Warmth, nor Fire, nor Salvation—that Flame which they had already refused.
Two years after I received this interior “vision,” Pope Benedict XVI wrote in a letter to all the bishops of the world:
In our days, when in vast areas of the world the faith is in danger of dying out like a flame which no longer has fuel, the overriding priority is to make God present in this world and to show men and women the way to God. Not just any god, but the God who spoke on Sinai; to that God whose face we recognize in a love which presses “to the end” (cf. Jn 13:1)—in Jesus Christ, crucified and risen. The real problem at this moment of our history is that God is disappearing from the human horizon, and, with the dimming of the light which comes from God, humanity is losing its bearings, with increasingly evident destructive effects.—Letter of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to All the Bishops of the World, March 10, 2009; Catholic Online
What I saw in that dark room was, I believe, a compressed vision of what is coming upon the world, according to the Church Father’s understanding of the Scriptures (which form part of the voice of Sacred Tradition because of the Father’s development of doctrine in the early Church and their proximity to the lives of the Apostles). For the sake of new readers and as a refresher, I will lay the so-called Illumination of Conscience within the Church Father’s basic chronology below, and then explain how it relates to a “new Pentecost.”
Scripture attests that, in the last days, many false prophets will arise to lead the faithful astray.[1] St. John also describes this in Revelation 12 as a confrontation between the “woman clothed in the sun” with the “dragon“,[2] Satan, whom Jesus called “the father of lies.”[3] These false prophets usher in a period of growing lawlessness as the natural and moral law is abandoned for an anti-Gospel, thus preparing the way for the Antichrist. This period is accompanied by what Jesus called “the labor pains.”[4]
Then war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels battled against the dragon. The dragon and its angels fought back, but they did not prevail and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. The huge dragon, the ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, who deceived the whole world, was thrown down to earth, and its angels were thrown down with it… woe to you, earth and sea, for the Devil has come down to you in great fury, for he knows he has but a short time. (Rev 12:7-9, 12)
As I will explain further below, this event may be concomitant with the “illumination” described in Revelation 6, an event which signals that the “day of the Lord” has come: [7]
Then I watched while he broke open the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake… Then the sky was divided like a torn scroll curling up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place… They cried out to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, because the great day of their wrath has come and who can withstand it?” (Rev 6:12-17)
The “restrainer” of 2 Thess 2 will be removed ushering in the Antichrist to whom the dragon gives his limited power: [8]
For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. But the one who restrains is to do so only for the present, until he is removed from the scene. And then the lawless one will be revealed. (2 Thess 2:7-8)
Then I saw a beast come out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads… To it the dragon gave its own power and throne, along with great authority… Fascinated, the whole world followed after the beast. (Rev 13:1-3)
This Antichrist is the false light who will deceive through “every mighty deed and in signs and wonders that lie” those who have refused the graces of Divine Mercy, those who…
…have not accepted the love of truth so that they may be saved. Therefore, God is sending them a deceiving power so that they may believe the lie, that all who have not believed the truth but have approved wrongdoing may be condemned. (2 Thess 2:10-12)
Those who follow the Antichrist are given a mark by which they may “buy and sell”.[9] He reigns for a short period, what St. John calls “forty two months,”[10] and then—through a manifestation of Jesus’s power— the Antichrist is destroyed:
…the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord [Jesus] will kill with the breath of his mouth and render powerless by the manifestation of his coming. (2 Thess 2:8)
that Christ will strike the Antichrist by dazzling him with a brightness that will be like an omen and sign of His Second Coming… The most authoritative view, and the one that appears to be most in harmony with Holy Scripture, is that, after the fall of the Antichrist, the Catholic Church will once again enter upon a period of prosperity and triumph. —The End of the Present World and the Mysteries of the Future Life, Fr. Charles Arminjon (1824-1885), p. 56-57; Sophia Institute Press
All those who followed the Antichrist will likewise become victims of the very “culture of death” they embraced.
The beast was caught and with it the false prophet who had performed in its sight the signs by which he led astray those who had accepted the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped its image. The two were thrown alive into the fiery pool burning with sulfur. The rest were killed by the sword that came out of the mouth of the one riding the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh. (cf. Rev 19:20-21)
Since God, having finished His works, rested on the seventh day and blessed it, at the end of the six thousandth year all wickedness must be abolished from the earth, and righteousness reign for a thousand years… —Caecilius Firmianus Lactantius (250-317 A.D.; Ecclesiastical writer), The Divine Institutes, Vol 7
With the death of Antichrist comes the dawning of the “day of the Lord” when the earth is renewed by the Holy Spirit and Christ reigns with his saints for a “thousand years,” a symbolic number indicating an extended period of time. [11] That is, the prophecies of the Old and New Testament are fulfilled whereby Christ is made known to, and glorified in all the nations before the end of time.
I and every other orthodox Christian feel certain that there will be a resurrection of the flesh followed by a thousand years in a rebuilt, embellished, and enlarged city of Jerusalem, as was announced by the Prophets Ezekiel, Isaias and others… A man among us named John, one of Christ’s Apostles, received and foretold that the followers of Christ would dwell in Jerusalem for a thousand years, and that afterwards the universal and, in short, everlasting resurrection and judgment would take place. —St. Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho, Ch. 81, The Fathers of the Church, Christian Heritage
I am coming to gather all nations and tongues; they shall come and see my glory. I will place a sign among them; from them I will send survivors to the nations… to the distant coastlands which have never heard of my fame, or seen my glory; and they shall proclaim my glory among the nations. (Isaiah 66:18-19)
From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says the LORD. They shall go out and see the corpses of the people who rebelled against me… (Isaiah 66:23-24)
During this period of peace, Satan is chained in the abyss for the “thousand years.” [12] He will no longer be able to tempt the Church as she grows exponentially in holiness to prepare her for the final coming of Jesus in glory…
…that he might present to himself the church in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. (Eph 5:27)
Therefore, the Son of the most high and mighty God… shall have destroyed unrighteousness, and executed His great judgment, and shall have recalled to life the righteous, who… will be engaged among men a thousand years, and will rule them with most just command… Also the prince of devils, who is the contriver of all evils, shall be bound with chains, and shall be imprisoned during the thousand years of the heavenly rule… —4th century Ecclesiastical writer, Lactantius, “The Divine Institutes”, The ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol 7, p. 211
At the very end, Satan is released from the abyss ushering in the end of time, the Second Coming, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment.[13]
We shall indeed be able to interpret the words, “The priest of God and of Christ shall reign with Him a thousand years; and when the thousand years shall be finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison;” for thus they signify that the reign of the saints and the bondage of the devil shall cease simultaneously… —St. Augustine, The Anti-Nicene Fathers, City of God, Book XX, Chap. 13, 19
In Charismatic? Part VI, we see how the popes have been prophesying and praying for a “new Pentecost” that will “renew the face of the earth.” When will this Pentecost come?
In some ways it has already begun, though it is mostly hidden in the hearts of the faithful. It is that flame of truth burning ever brighter in the souls of those who are responding to grace in this “time of mercy.” That flame is the Holy Spirit, for Jesus said…
Also, many souls today are already experiencing, to one degree or another, an “illumination of conscience” as the Holy Spirit leads them into deeper repentance. And yet, there is coming a definitive event, according to many mystics, saints, and seers, in which the entire world will all at once see their souls the way God sees them, as though they were standing before Him in judgment.[14]
It will be a warning and grace given to draw as many souls into His mercy before the inevitable purification of the world.[15] Since the Illumination is the coming of divine light, of the “Spirit of truth,” how can this not be a Pentecost of sorts? It is precisely this gift of the Illumination that will break the power of Satan in many people’s lives. The light of truth will shine in the darkness, and the darkness will flee from those who admit the Light into their hearts. In the spiritual realm, St. Michael and his angels will cast Satan and his minions “to the earth” where their powers will be concentrated behind the Antichrist and his followers.[16] The Illumination is thus not only a sign of Divine Mercy, but of the approaching Divine Justice as the Antichrist prepares to twist the real meaning behind the Illumination and deceive souls (see The Coming Counterfeit ).
That is one of the reasons that the Illumination will not entirely transform the world: not everyone will accept this free grace. As I wrote in Revelation Illumination, the Sixth Seal in John’s Apocalypse is followed by the marking of the “foreheads of the servants of our God”[17] before a final chastisement(s) purifies the earth. Those who refuse this grace will become prey to Antichrist’s deception and be marked by him (see The Great Numbering). And thus, the last armies of this era will be formed for “the final confrontation” between those who stand for a culture of life, and those who promote the culture of death.
But the kingdom of God will have already begun in the hearts of those who join the army of Heaven. Christ’s kingdom is not of this earth;[18] it is a spiritual kingdom. And thus, that kingdom, which will shine and spread to the farthest coastlands in the Era of Peace, begins in the hearts of those who are and will form the remnant of the Church at the end of this age. Pentecost begins in the upper room and then spreads from there. The Upper Room today is the Heart of Mary. And all those who enter in now — especially through consecration to her — are already being prepared by the Holy Spirit for their part in the times to come that will both end the dominion of Satan in our era and renew the face of the earth.
It may help to turn to some of the modern seers in the Church who are speaking with a consistent voice on the Illumination. As always with prophetic revelation, it remains subject to the discernment of the Church.[19]
The common thread in modern prophetic revelation is that the Illumination is a gift from the Father to call home the prodigal sons—but that these graces will not be universally accepted.
In words to an American woman, Barbara Rose Centilli, whose purported messages from God the Father are under diocesan examination, the Father allegedly said:
To overcome the tremendous effects of generations of sin, I must send the power to break through and transform the world. But this surge of power will be uncomfortable, even painful for some. This will cause the contrast between darkness and light to become even greater. —from the four volumes Seeing With the Eyes of the Soul, November 15th, 1996; as quoted in The Miracle of the Illumination of Conscience by Dr. Thomas W. Petrisko, p. 53
The day of the Lord approaches. All must be prepared. Ready yourselves in body, mind, and soul. Purify yourselves. —Ibid., February 16th, 1998; (see my writing on the coming “Day of the Lord”: Two More Days
After the cleansing action of My mercy will come the life of My Spirit, powerful and transmitted, conducted, through the waters of My mercy. —Ibid., December 28th, 1999
But to those who refuse the light of truth, their hearts will harden further. These must therefore pass through the door of Justice:
…before I come as a just Judge, I first open wide the door of My mercy. He who refuses to pass through the door of My mercy must pass through the door of My justice. —Jesus to St. Faustina, Divine Mercy in My Soul, Diary of St Faustina, n. 1146
In messages allegedly from the “Heavenly Father” conveyed in 1993 to a young Australian man named Matthew Kelly, it was said:
The mini-judgment is a reality. People no longer realize that they offend Me. Out of My infinite Mercy I will provide a mini-judgment. It will be painful, very painful, but short. You will see your sins, you will see how much you offend Me every day. I know that you think this sounds like a very good thing, but unfortunately, even this won’t bring the whole world into My love. Some people will turn even further away from Me, they will be proud and stubborn…. Those who repent will be given an unquenchable thirst for this light… All those who love Me will join to help form the heel that crushes Satan. —from The Miracle of the Illumination of Conscience by Dr. Thomas W. Petrisko, p.96-97
Of more notoriety are the messages given to the late Fr. Stefano Gobbi that received an Imprimatur. In an interior locution allegedly given by the Blessed Mother, she speaks of the coming of the Holy Spirit to establish Christ’s reign on earth as associated with the Illumination.
The Holy Spirit will come to establish the glorious reign of Christ and it will be a reign of grace, of holiness, of love, of justice and of peace. With His divine love, He will open the doors of hearts and illuminate all consciences. Every person will see himself in the burning fire of divine truth. It will be like a judgment in miniature. And then Jesus Christ will bring His glorious reign in the world. —To the Priests, Our Lady’s Beloved Sons, May 22nd, 1988
However, Fr. Gobbi indicates in an address to priests that Satan’s kingdom must also be destroyed before a new Pentecost is brought to complete fruition.
Brother priests, this [Kingdom of the Divine Will], however, is not possible if, after the victory obtained over Satan, after having removed the obstacle because his [Satan's] power has been destroyed… this cannot happen, except by a most special outpouring of the Holy Spirit: the Second Pentecost. —www.MMP-USA.net
The Illumination of Conscience remains a mystery in terms of its exact spiritual dimensions, of what precisely will occur when it happens, and what graces it will bring to the Church and the world. The Blessed Mother in her message to Fr. Gobbi called it “the burning fire of divine truth.” I wrote a meditation along that same vein two years ago called The Illuminating Fire. And we know, of course, that the Holy Spirit descended on Pentecost in tongues of fire… We can no doubt expect something unprecedented since the first Pentecost 2000 years ago.
What is certain is that the Church will be given the necessary grace to pass through her own Passion and eventually share in the Resurrection of her Lord. The Holy Spirit will fill “lamps”, that is hearts, with the “oil” of grace for those preparing in these times, so that the Flame of Christ will sustain them in the darkest moments.[21] We can be confident, based on the Church Father’s teachings, that a time of peace, justice, and unity will subdue all of creation and that the Holy Spirit will renew the face of the earth. The Gospel will reach to the furthest coastlands, and the Sacred Heart of Jesus will reign through the Holy Eucharist in every nation.[22]
…this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world as a witness to all nations, and then the end will come. (Matthew 24:14)

Following the company’s acquisition of BHP Billiton’s (LON:BLT) shale sites in Eagle Ford, The Permian and Haynesville for a total of $10.5 billion, BP (LON:BP), has said it is considering selling its US oil and gas projects as part of its $6 billion asset sale program, as reported in Bloomberg.
As of 8.40 BST, BP currently sits on the UK benchmark index at 563.30 GBX −0.40 (0.071%) as investors digest the news. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 is up 0.67 per cent at 7628.81 points.
The company has, so far, experienced success in its bid to reduce the cost of shale production, with a total reduction of almost 35% spanning the last five years. The acquisition of BHP (LON:BLT) sites, which is BP’s (LON:BP) biggest deal since the Atlantic Richfield Deal of 1999, its daily shale and gas production has risen from 315,000 to 500,000.
According to Bloomberg, BP said in a press statement: “Following the closing of BP’s recently announced acquisition of BHP’s U.S. unconventional oil and gas portfolio, BP Lower 48 may sell a portion of its legacy operating assets in U.S. onshore….it’s consistent with BP's approach of actively managing and high-grading its advantaged oil and gas portfolio, focusing on higher-return assets with significant development potential.”
Apple shares closed in the green after sending out invitations to a special event on September 12th, where it is widely expected to unveil three new iPhones.
Apple shares ended higher in the US Thursday, amid widespread reports the tech innovator will unveil three new iPhones at an event it is hosting on September 12th. The event date coincides with the tech giant’s traditional iPhone launch period, while a new Apple watch could also feature.
Apple shares closed 0.92% higher at $225.03 in the US Thursday. The stock was also a little higher in after-hours activity.
Next to no clues have been discerned from the invitation that has been sent out for the September 12th event in its Steve Jobs theatre, at the Cupertino, California campus. However, previous rumours and reported ‘leaks’, suggest that three new iPhones will be on show.
While each of the three expected new iPhone models are anticipated to be based on the iPhone X, they will likely each attract different audiences.
One iPhone that is expected to be unveiled, is rumoured to have a larger screen than the current X model. Another, is expected to have an edge-to-edge screen, but come in cheaper than the current iPhone X, due to the LCD screen.
And, the third model, could be a gold version of the iPhone X; Apple reportedly filed documents seeking approval for a gold version of the phone, but only released it in silver and grey.
While the rumour mill will likely be in overdrive for the next two weeks, no confirmed details will be available until the special event takes place.
Separately, Apple has also purchased a startup that makes lenses for AR glasses. Tim Cook’s tech firm has acquired Akonia Holographics, based in Longmont, Colorado.
“Apple buys smaller companies from time to time, and we generally don’t discuss our purpose or plans,” the tech business said in a statement.
On the Akonia website, the company explains that it has “over 200 patents pertaining to holographic systems and materials. The HoloMirror™ has introduced new possibilities to finally enable lightweight, high-FOV and low-cost consumer AR head-worn displays.”

24 News Media | Know, what changes are there in women till 31st year, come from the body texture, it is 3 changes
Hello friends like we all know that there is a God in human beings in the two shaklas, a man and a second woman. Just as women grow older, their thinking changes quite a lot. If today one is on earth Even if there were no women then a person would not even be there. Hardly anyone will know that the real beauty of a woman and the changes in it come after the age of 31, so let us now tell you what changes happen when women are 31.
According to Scientist Research, it is reported that the age of 21's is very fragile. During the age of this age, the kind of fellowship that a woman gets, she gets absorbed in it. All of you must also have seen that too much Women are loved at this age and they cheat in this age and because of this 21 women get a change in their thinking
When the age of women turns 11, then they begin to make physical changes. Between the age of 11 years and 21, there is a lot of increase in the body of women, due to which the woman becomes even more beautiful. This age During the time, women are unable to do the wrong thinking in the right way, because of this, take whatever decision they make in this age and understand them.
According to the research, it is reported that when the age of the women is 25 years, they become quite intelligent, because after coming to this age, they get enough experience, after which they also identify the wrong. By this age, the woman gets entangled in many relationships and at this age there are many changes in the power of thinking and understanding of women of this age.
Instead of making an outright gift, you could choose to use a charitable lead trust. With a charitable lead trust, your gift is placed in a trust. The recipient of the gift draws the income from this trust. Upon your death, your heirs will receive the principal with little or no estate tax.
If you prefer to retain an income interest in your gift, you could use a pooled income fund, a charitable remainder unitrust, or a charitable remainder annuity trust. With each of these strategies, you receive the income generated by your gift, and the recipient receives the principal upon your death.
Finally, you could purchase a life insurance policy and name the charitable organization as the owner and beneficiary of the policy. This would enable you to make a large future gift at a potentially low current cost.
The cost and availability of life insurance depend on factors such as age, health, and the type and amount of insurance purchased. Before implementing a strategy involving life insurance, it would be prudent to make sure that you are insurable.
As with most financial decisions, there are expenses associated with the purchase of life insurance. Policies commonly have contract limitations, fees, and charges, which can include mortality and expense charges. Most have surrender charges that are assessed during the early years of the contract if the contract owner surrenders the policy; plus, there could be income tax implications. Any guarantees are contingent on the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Life insurance is not guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency; it is not deposit of, nor is it guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank or savings association.
While trusts offer numerous advantages, they incur up-front costs and ongoing administrative fees. The use of trusts involves a complex web of tax rules and regulations. You might consider enlisting the counsel of an experienced estate planning professional and your legal and tax advisors before implementing such strategies.

Stanozolol has low androgenic property and very high anabolic properties. It is used by bodybuilders and athletes for the gains in strength, vascularity, and muscle tone, it does not have the ability to aromatize and it does not convert to estrogen water retention. Stanozolol contributes to the formation of a lean, quality looking muscular formations. It does not cause any water bloat and became popular among bodybuilders in the cutting phase of the training. This medication can also be used by women.
Stanozolol has been proved to increase blood flow for people using it. It is rather used by the athletes to help them lose fat and rather retain lean mass of the body. This steroid is also of huge aid in the metabolism of proteins. Stanozolol is usually considered a safer choice for female bodybuilders (mostly in oral form) because its anabolic effects predominate over its androgenic effects, although virilization and masculinization are still possible to occur. The compound can be stacked with Trenbolone Hexahydrobenzylcarbonate in order to achieve androgenic effect, with Metandienone, Oxymetholone, Testosterone Enanthate, or Nandrolone Decanoate to achieve strength and mass, with all Testosterone compounds (Cypionate, Enanthate, Propionate) or Nandrolone Phenylpropionate to achieve bulking effect.

I'm a self-published author from South Australia. My first book, Soul Fire, is a YA fantasy romance.
What starts off as a beautifully written, lavishly different take on history quickly becomes a historical Days of our Lives - and not in a good way.
The quotes by Beyonce and Lorde at the beginning of the parts (again, another book that needed part 1, 2 and 3 for no discernible reason. I don't like that this is becoming a trend) felt strange and out of place. It felt like putting a Backstreet Boys quote at the beginning of a Game of Thrones novel. Weird. Didn't like.
What could've been an amazing story of four young women coming into their own turned into a complete mess of 'I can't accept your proposal... oh you're rich?? DAMNIT'. Seriously. That's the premise. Or Marie changing her mind five friggin times and screwing Gill over, who by the way was risking his life to be with her.
Marie asking Aelwyn to take her place as princess just outlined how self-involved these characters are. She just asks her to give up her looks, identity and any hope of her own future. Meanwhile, Aelwyn is eying off Marie's betrothed like 'mmmm gonna get me some of that... even if he is marrying my best friend. But they don't love each other anyway, so may as well'.
Then there's Wolf, who I liked to begin with, but then became the biggest sap. "I'm sad this girl I just met and don't know from a bar of soap isn't marrying me. Teehee, imagine if she said yes and then discovered I'm a crown prince! What lolz will be had. WAIT SHE SAID NO, WTH."
Isabelle who was the only character I continued to like, getting royally fucked over (pun). Having her beloved killed by the man who'd raped her since she was nine, finding out she was pregnant with the rapist prince's child. Here was me thinking she'd devise some amazing plot to become Queen of France, but instead she was just a barbie doll.
Ronan, I liked. I did. Until she became so two-faced I couldn't figure her out. "I like Wolf. Oh wait, here he comes to dance with me and propose, better dance with everyone else and be a bitch to him." There's playing hard to get, and then there's Ronan.
Urgh. Also, was the second half of this novel edited AT ALL? There are three events in the last twenty pages which were skimmed over like 'they put the barrels of magefire out to sea, they exploded, kah-blooey, then this engagment was announced, also btw the first prince was a sorceror which suddenly clears up, like, three plot points not previously discussed - never mind that magic has never been seen anywhere else in the world. Oh wait, that's coz he wasn't the REAL prince, so it was just lucky he was shot tbh.
There's a second book. I kind of want to read it. To quote the Sith Warrior character on Star Wars: The Old Republic:

Introduction – Besides the classical data sources that have been used for many years (including child health certificates and school surveys), other sources may be useful for the evaluation and monitoring of vaccination coverage.
Methods – We identified the main new tools that can be used in the evaluation of vaccination coverage. The advantages and disadvantages of each one were assessed. Each tool was classified as relevant or not for the routine assessment of vaccination overage.
Results – Vaccine sales allow the follow-up of vaccination activity trends; however, they do not allow the calculation of immunization coverage.
Conclusions – EGB data allow a rapid update of national vaccination coverage estimates in children whatever their age, and for all recommended vaccines provided that they are reimbursed. Subnational coverage estimations will be provided by the DCIR database. None of these new tools are suitable for the evaluation of vaccination coverage among adults.
Estimation of vaccination coverage in France through the Permanent Beneficiaries Sample (EGB): example of measles, hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccination
Introduction – Vaccination coverage (VC) in children and teenagers is estimated using 24th months health certificates data and through school surveys.
Although both tools allow reliable estimations of vaccination coverage, data are available only several years after the vaccination is performed. We used the Permanent Beneficiaries Sample (“Échantillon généraliste des bénéficiaires”, EGB) for the estimation of vaccination coverage, in order to improve the timeliness of coverage measurement. We present here measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), hepatitis B and HPV vaccination coverage data.
Method – The EGB is a representative sample of the population affiliated to the main French social security system. It contains for each individual his/her past vaccine reimbursements history.
Results – For children born in 2009, MMR vaccination coverage at 24 months of age was 90.4% and hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 58.2% for three doses in December 2011. For girls aged 15-17 years, 45.3% had begun HPV vaccination, and 29.9% had received the full vaccination scheme.
Discussion-conclusion – EGB data are consistent with health certificates data. This tool allows regularly updated reactive and reliable vaccination coverage estimations.
Follow-up of MMR vaccine sales data to assess the impact of a local awareness campaign on measles vaccination in 2011 in Auvergne, France
Introduction – A local awareness campaign for immunization against measles was implemented in two French districts of the Auvergne region by sending letters to parents early 2011 to address a measles outbreak. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of this action on vaccination coverage.
Materials and methods – Data from vaccine sales to pharmacies from the statistics committee GERS were used over the period 1 September 2010 to 30 June 2011. The first indicator tested compared a post-action and preaction for a period of four months each, the second comparing monthly sales, and the third compared variations in the sales of MMR vaccine between the Auvergne and Rhône-Alpes regions to monitor the impact of the outbreak.
Results – A few months after the campaign, increases in MMR vaccine sales were significantly higher in districts where the campaign took place, regardless of the indicator used. Moreover, the increase in sales occurred soon after the action.
Discussion-conclusion – The use of vaccine sales data to pharmacies provided by GERS suggests a beneficial effect of raising awareness on immunization coverage through indicators, although it is not possible to estimate the share attributable to this action. The lack of declination by age data from vaccine sales is the main limitation of this source.
Meningitis C vaccine coverage estimate from reimbursement aggregated data in Finistère District, France, among 1 to 24 years old people
Context – Facing an increase of meningitis C incidence, a study was carried out from the Système national d’information inter-régimes de l’assurance maladie (SNIIRAM) aggregated dataset to test the hypothesis of an insufficient meningococcal C vaccine coverage (VC) in the Finistère District (France) among 1-24 years old who are targeted by the vaccine recommendations.
Material and methods – Age aggregated (1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, 15-19 years, 20-24 years) numbers of conjugate vaccine doses reimbursed in 2010 and 2011 were used and divided by Insee population estimates for 2009.
Results – 1-24 years vaccine coverage was equal to 20.1% in Finistère, 18.5% in Brittany, and 19.4% in France outside Brittany. Finistère 1-4 years coverage was 5% lower than that of France outside Brittany (42.2 vs. 47.3%, p<0.001). It was slightly higher in all other age-groups.
Discussion-conclusion – Meningococcal C VC was not sufficient among 1-24-years to induce herd immunity to the rest of the population. However, the Finistère situation is not particular in France. In an emergency situation, the SNIIRAM aggregated data contributed to quickly estimate VC. Our results were consistent with those available at the national level from the Permanent Beneficiaries Sample (EGB). This analysis contributed to issue new recommendations by French public health authorities in order to reinforce vaccination among 1-24 years old in Finistère, promote vaccination in the rest of France among 1-24-years old, and temporarily propose it to 2-11 months old children in Finistère.

The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include: rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it
dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of
Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations, and wildlife.
Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally occurring or can result from urban storm runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining, or farming.
Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban storm water runoff, and residential uses.
Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and which can also come from gas stations, urban storm water runoff, and septic systems.
Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring or the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.
In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, the EPA prescribes regulations which limit the amount of certain contaminants in
water provided by public water systems. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled
water which must provide the same protection for public health. Agawam is required to collect a minimum of 30 water samples each month from locations throughout Town and tests these samples for coliform bacteria.
The peak of the month since June 3, occurred on June 10 with gold prices at $1,190.87 per ounce, after Bloomberg agency reported the intentions of the Germany chancellor to offer Greece an incremental deal in exchange for tighter restrictions on the country.
The main aim of this deal would be the payment to the IMF before the end of the month, to avoid Greece's exit from the eurozone, though, according to the declarations of the Spanish economic minister to Reuters “Grexit is off the table, we want to keep Greece in the euro zone.”
On 11 June, the price of gold reached a maximum of $1,186.92 per ounce, before dropping to a minimum of $1,179 per ounce. The reason for this drop was the U.S. retail sales and unemployment data which drove dollar higher.
On 12 June, the gold market offered gold prices in a similar range, with a maximum of $1,183.68, and a minimum of $1,177.67 per ounce. The gold market remained subject to the ups and downs of the US dollar and the continuous negotiation between the IMF and Greece which increases the attractiveness of gold as a safe haven asset.
Over the weekend, the price of gold was established on $1,181.60 per ounce, and at the beginning of the week the precious metal posted a sharp rise to $1,186.18 per ounce, with peaks and valleys along the day falling even to $1,174.15 per ounce, though rising back to $1,189 per ounce.
On 16 June, the gold market showed a range of price between $1,187 and $1,185, though it dropped consequently to $1,178.07 per ounce. On June 17 gold prices raised back again, to $1,182.37 per ounce.
It has been a hectic week for the gold market and for the last weeks of June, gold investors suggest to keep an eye close on Greece's development and bear in mind the security gold offers when it comes to weather the storm of the economy.

smart watches for men with price | smart watches for android | smart wrist watch brands | where to get smart watch
Finding and installing apps is another sore point. Android Wear 2.0 has two ways of installing apps: On the watch directly, which is woefully awkward, or through the Play Store on the Web, which is okay. Watch faces for Wear OS exist in the kind of state Android phone apps were in during their earliest days—all over the place, so good luck searching. Watch makers would do well to include some sensible, category-spanning offerings by default in their devices.
Although rectangular is the most common design, there are smart watches that have a circular display similar to regular watches. The Apple Watch is only available in the rectangular design. The circular design is available in the Samsung Gear S2, Moto 360, and LG G Watch R models. Many models have changeable straps, so you can dress casual, sporty, and formal.
Garmin has been putting out go-to smartwatches for sports lovers for a while now. Running, cycling, swimming, golf - Garmin has had us well and truly covered. Despite the Forerunner name, the 645 Music is more in the mould of the Vivoactive 3 Music. It's got a similar look and also brings the music this time. This helps make the Garmin more of a smartwatch rival to the Apple Watch, Samsung Gear or Fitbit Ionic than before.
Aside from its jack-of-all-fitness-trades, master-of-none nature, the Gear Sport has other drawbacks. Chief among them is that voice dictation is significantly less reliable than on the Apple Watch or Wear OS and is best used for short phrases and quick replies. Then there’s S Voice, the digital assistant that can’t do much—and you probably don’t have time to learn how to make it do the few things it can do. And major apps still do not have a presence in Samsung’s marketplace—the Sport runs Samsung’s Tizen operating system instead of Wear OS—so any app or device you want to control directly on your phone is a gamble on an indie developer having the same need.
To round off the Gear Sport’s positives, it has very solid battery life (almost never less than 50 percent of the battery remaining after a full day), it can play offline Spotify playlists (even for free accounts), and if you have a Samsung phone, it integrates easily with most of the apps you have installed there. The Gear Sport is easier to set up with a non-Samsung Android phone than previous versions of the Gear watch, too. It still requires the installation of at least four apps and some regular updating, but it’s not the hour-long trial-and-error of other Gear watches we’ve tested, working reliably in our testing.
A smartwatch is a wearable computer in the form of a wristwatch; modern smartwatches provide a local touchscreen interface for daily use, while an associated smartphone app provides for management and telemetry (such as long-term biomonitoring). While early models could perform basic tasks, such as calculations, digital time telling, translations, and game-playing, 2010s smartwatches have more general functionality closer to smartphones, including mobile apps, a mobile operating system and Bluetooth connectivity. Some smartwatches function as portable media players, with FM radio and playback of digital audio and video files via a Bluetooth or USB headset. Some models, called 'watch phones' (or vice versa), have complete functionality of a typical smartphone using LTE technology.[1][2][3]
Outside of the Fossil Group, we're waiting for the Casio Pro Trek WSD-F30 and Montblanc Summit 2. The Summit 2 will be the first smartwatch to run on Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 3100 processor, which aims to make a raft of improvements including beefing up the battery life. It's also expected to be joined by a new Louis Vuitton smartwatch, which will run on that new Snapdragon chip.
Battery life for the Q watches is unremarkably reliable, and that’s the best thing you can say about a touchscreen smartwatch. The Q Explorist never ran out of juice entirely while wearing it, even after having it be the primary turn-by-turn direction notifier on two 1-hour drives, followed by 30 minutes of actively tracked cycling and the usual all-day text/app notifications. While we didn’t wear the Venture for full days of testing, most reviews find no fault with the battery. The USB charger is a basic magnetic disc that slides onto the rounded back of the watch (though it could stand to stick onto the watch more strongly, like the Apple Watch’s similar disc).
The launch of Samsung's Gear S smartwatch was covered by the media in late August 2014. The model features a curved Super AMOLED display and a built-in 3G modem, with technology writer Darrell Etherington stating on the TechCrunch website, "we’re finally starting to see displays that wrap around the contours of the wrist, rather than sticking out as a traditional flat surface." The corporation commenced selling the Gear S smartwatch in October 2014, alongside the Gear Circle headset accessory.[72] At IFA 2014 Sony Mobile announced the third generation of its smartwatch series, the Sony Smartwatch 3 powered by Android Wear.[73] Also, the Fashion Entertainments' e-paper watch was announced.[74]
For deeper integration with your Android phone, you can give Google's Wear OS platform a try with Fossil's $275 Q Control touchscreen smartwatch. It lacks GPS and support for NFC payments, which is why the Gear Sport is a better fitness-focused smartwatch for Android users, but Fossil's Google Assistant integration and stylish design make it a solid contender. However, smartwatches with Qualcomm's new Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor start shipping in October, so you may want to hold off until we put them to the test.
The Charge 3's screen has 40-percent more active space than the Charge 2 has, and it makes for a better touchscreen overall. From the watch face, swipe from top to bottom to reveal the notification drawer; from bottom to top to see the daily dashboard; and side to side to see available apps. Transitions between screen pages are smooth, and stick-figure animations in apps like the Exercise app move with ease.
Samsung treads between smartwatch and fitness tracker, also packing in a heart rate sensor along with that GPS and its much-improved Samsung Health software. There's also the option of LTE (coming soon), if you wish for an untethered connection, with a standalone speaker for taking calls on the watch. It's now waterproof, too, adding swim tracking skills that are on par with the Watch Series 4.
They include a heart rate monitor, pedometer and altimeter to track steps taken and stairs climbed and often a GPS chip to record your distance covered. They will sync with your smartphone to give you a suite of tools to monitor your exercise progress. Many of them will offer notifications of incoming phone calls, text and email alerts as well. But they are designed with fitness tracking in mind. If you are happy using your smartphone for your day to day messaging, calendar, apps and music, a fitness tracker will suffice.
That’s the big downside of relying on your phone as a tracker, unless it is somewhere on your body, whenever you are moving about or exercising, all that effort won’t be counted. For some people - say joggers who wear their smartphone on an arm band, that’s not a big issue, but you really aren’t getting the full picture of your activity, including the things you do in your sleep, without having a gadget mounted on your wrist.
Like previous Gear watches, the Gear Sport uses a rotating bezel and two side buttons for most of its navigation. This works better than you’d think by looking at it, and it’s a boon to those who wear gloves for part of the year. In fact, we actually prefer this approach to Wear OS or the Apple Watch: Rotating through your home screens, notifications, lists of apps, or messages happens at remarkable speed for a tiny device. The screen is 1.2 inches and 360 pixels in diameter, but it’s brighter than our pick’s, and it looks decent enough while displaying most content, though text isn’t as sharp as on the Fossil screens. The watch itself is not small, at 43 and 44 millimeters wide and tall, respectively, and 11.6 mm thick, but it’s nowhere near as beefy as our prior pick, the Gear S3.
▽ Your account minimum payment amount is determined by the purchases and balances on your WebBank/Fingerhut Credit Account. The change in minimum payment amount is based on your account balance at the time it is advertised, and includes an assumption of interest charges and SafeLine fees, as applicable. The change in minimum payment amount does not include subsequent activity on your account such as any purchases, including deferred payment purchases, backordered, unshipped, returned or other pending purchases or exchanges; any payments, including partial, missed or returned payments; any fees, including recurring partner program charges, subsequent interest charges, late fees or returned payment fees. It is also subject to change based on shipping address, shipping method, partial shipments and taxes. Your minimum payment amount will not change and the purchase will not reflect on your statement until the order ships. If you have a balance or are making a multiple item purchase, see the Existing Balance Payment Chart.
Fossil introduced its fourth generation of smartwatches, the Q Explorist HR and Q Venture HR, upgraded versions of our current picks at the same respective prices. These editions of the watches add untethered GPS, NFC for Google Pay purchases, and heart-rate monitoring. Fossil also claims that they’re waterproof enough for swimming. However, both use an aging Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 chip when a newer version is expected to arrive in September.
Speaking of music, that's what really sets this smartwatch apart (especially compared to Garmin's other wearables). The Vivoactive 3 Music has enough internal storage for 500 songs — and they're easy to download to your device using the Garmin Express software. Once your songs are downloaded, you can listen to music without a smartphone. Just connect some Bluetooth headphones to the watch and you're good to go. If streaming is more your game, then you can also download some popular media apps as well.
First and foremost, the Movado Connect runs on top of the standard Android Wear specs package — a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, 512mb of RAM, and 4GB of storage. It also includes a 1.39-inch 400×400 AMOLED display, 300mAh battery, and a typical array of sensors including an accelerometer and gyroscope. There’s also an ambient light sensor here and support for NFC, meaning you’ll be able to use Google Pay with this watch.
How frustrating. I really -like- the idea of a smart watch... but it's so hard to find the right one. I'm not an exercise freak so heartrate monitors etc are useless to me. I really like the design of the Samsung watches with their bezels to control it, but the Tizen OS with it's limited apps puts me right off. The Access Grayson watch is beautiful, but the lack of NFC is a deal breaker for me - Google Pay with the convenience of a watch is part of the reason I'd buy one. I don't need to be able to put a sim in it... that's what my phone's for, but GOS would be nice for when I travel, and as a motorbike rider some level of waterproofing is a must. Guess I'm waiting for the next round of watches to see what's on offer.
Most stores that sell these smart watches feature display models that you can pick up and touch. We recommend getting a feel for how these watches operate before you invest in one of your own. Specifically, you’ll want to know the form of navigation each of these use to go through the various screens, apps, and functionalities. We were partial to twistable bezels and dials, but you might be used to swiping your way through screens.
Smartwatches are still a relatively new electronics category, but these devices are poised to hit the mainstream. This year we saw major players such as LG and Motorola throw their smartwatches in the ring, along with Samsung, Sony, and a host of smaller companies like Pebble and Martian. And Apple finally confirmed its entry, the innovative Apple Watch, expected to arrive early in 2015.
The Sofie, on the other hand, is designed for women with jewelry inspired accents. It has a smaller 1.19 inch 390×390 AMOLED display, and a smaller casing at 42mm. As mentioned, pricing starts at $350 for either variant and goes up depending on options. Sales are available from MichaelKors.com (Grayson — Sofie) and also from outlets such as Amazon. (Grayson — Sofie)
Waterproof to 165 feet and tested to military standards for durability, it includes features like a digital compass, altimeter, and barometer that you won’t find in most other smartwatches, as well as more standard tools such as GPS. The WSD-F20 can also function as a flashlight — handy in an emergency — and lets you download maps for offline navigation when you’re far from the nearest cell signal.
It has all the same core fitness and sports tracking as the Series 3, including built-in GPS and a swimproof design. You can also expect improvements in run tracking and new supported activities like yoga and hiking. It comes packing LTE once again so you can take it out sans iPhone and still make/receive calls, get texts and all other notifications you would on your phone. A new speaker should also make Siri chats and phone calls sound louder and clearer.
Qualcomm is preparing to launch a new generation of wearable processors at an event in September. That’s likely going to mean new hardware and maybe even new capabilities within wearable operating systems. So at least for the next few weeks, it might be best to hold off on buying any new smartwatches, at least those still rocking a Snapdragon Wear 2100…
We test every new smartwatch to gauge its design and comfort. If it’s not stylish and comfortable enough to get you from an early morning workout to the office to a night out, you probably won’t wear it every day. Most smartwatches are also fitness trackers, so we put all of its sensors to the test, from step counts to heart rate to GPS (when applicable).
Apple has continued its focus on its health focus with the Series 4. In addition to being able to detect a fall, this new Apple Watch introduces three heart-rate tracking features that will be available later this year. It lets you know if your heart rate is too low, it can detect irregular rhythms (which may indicate atrial fibrillation), and most impressively, it serves as an FDA-cleared electrocardiogram.
For all of you outdoorsmen, Casio returned to IFA this year with its latest Pro Trek watch. The Casio WSD-F30 takes the same great features of previous generations and slaps them inside of a slightly slimmer body. The 60.5mm × 53.8mm × 14.9mm body is still pretty huge, but it’s considerably smaller than what came before it and still maintains 5ATM water resistance, MIL-STD-810, and even low-temperature resistance.
The Apple Watch Series 4 is now on sale, and it's the best smartwatch you can buy right now. The redesigned device, which starts at $399 for the GPS model and $499 for the cellular version, is the best smartwatch you can buy. It has a larger display and slightly bigger case size while retaining the same rounded square design the watch is known for. Even more importantly, Apple received FDA clearance for a new electrocardiogram feature that can take a 30-second EKG and diagnose atrial fibrillation.
After roaming around San Francisco one day last year, photographing with a friend, we went to see a one-time-only screening of William Eggleston’s “Stranded in Canton“. It was the kind of experience that leaves you scratching your head, in the best possible way. Eggleston’s experiment (filmed on a PortaPak in 1973) was so ahead of its time it almost didn’t exist.
Fittingly, the film’s settled into memory as more of a hazy dream than a movie. There’s no story, no plot, no traditional anything – but it’s loaded with characters: real people playing themselves, as they might have, drunk and singing while an observant friend glided around them with an infrared video camera in 1973.
What I didn’t know was that Eggleston was making portraits with a 5×7 view camera around the same time, with help from one of his Canton friends on strobe patrol. Beautifully printed in “5×7” from Twin Palms Publishing, the 57 plates in the book speak distinctly where Canton mostly mumbles.
Referred to in Michael Almereyda’s expert essay as “the Nightclub pictures”, the portraits do more than describe 70s kitsch, they show what can happen when a photographer forces himself to step outside of his traditional working methods to photograph what’s familiar in an entirely new way.
Like most great work with big cameras, the portraits bely the complexity of their execution with simple, pictorial facts; a face, a feature, some fashion. And the fufillment of these facts sets the stage for a portrait that delivers more than your average picture. Meaning, these are extremely good portraits; in both style and expression, and they continue to yield surprises with each page flip. (Who’s the Chan Marshall doppleganger in Plate 10?)
As black and white pictures from a photographer well-known for his color work (the pictures were made well before Eggleston’s colorific MOMA debut in ’76) they feel like cousins of Lee Friedlander’s color-saturated portraits of musicians, in reverse. But the book doesn’t rely on having “black and white portraits by a color photographer” as its bait. There are outside pictures and still-lifes and color shots as well, including a few that have been previously published – and this one, of a familiar subject, Marcia Hare.
More correctly, these aren’t your typical good-time party pics. They’re incisions — slices of clarity, moments from otherwise foggy evenings held still by the strobe and fixed to the unforgiving five-by-seven frame. However captured, the portraits are never cold. Their clarity helps, but it’s Eggleston’s attenuation to what makes a moment perfect that makes the pictures come alive.
When Eggleston’s discussed, people often overlook the Cartier-Bresson connection. Even when photographing artchitecturally, Eggleston appears to be as much about the moment as anything else. (Why take two? Get it right the first time…) And it’s this taste for what’s passing (even if it’s stationary) that comes into clear view in 5×7.
Pictures can be anything, really, and good pictures can be everything else and all of the above. Or not. When I look at the Nightclub pictures, they seem to be a way for a photographer to say, “this is life, and this is how we lived it, and here’s who these people are and what they looked like and how we liked to spend our time.” It is what it is what it is. Simple, really. Good enough for a box under the bed.
Fortunately the pictures have been dusted-off and held-up in the good light of this book, so we can all look, not just at the wallpaper details in the background, or at the technique that went into such scans, but that we can see through the lens itself, as if Eggleston and the camera and the guy with the strobe weren’t even there.
It’s not an easy thing to take pictures that successfully fix a passing world. And it’s harder still to make photographs of people who are looking directly at the camera – and end-up with pictures that don’t feel like Pictures.
For this viewer, Eggleston’s 5×7 leaves me as if I were approaching a building with a screened front door that’s been left open. There’s music’s inside and a room full of friends — an extra chair at their table. A welcoming.
Thanks to Twin Palms Publishing for facilitating this review. More reviews on 2point8, and more Eggleston.
I had the chance to look at this book. Unusual camera and type of photography as compared to we are used to from Eggleston, but wonderful images.

Marketing Malcolm X For merchants of trendy items, there's no doubt about what letter is going to spell profits
New York -- Put on your best X-wear, break open your bag of X-chips and get ready to get X-cited, because America's marketing machine has zeroed in on its newest target: Malcolm X, movie star.
In high gear to capitalize on tomorrow's release of director Spike Lee's film, "Malcolm X," the flow of X-stuff seems to know no limits. Caps, shirts, belts, calendars, automobile air fresheners and even potato chips are now graced by the simple letter "X" in hopes that the leader's surname, once synonymous with militancy, will now strike a chord with consumers.
Two New York locations have become the prime sellers of Malcolm X paraphernalia: Mr. Lee's pricey gift shop in Brooklyn featuring Malcolm X pins, necklaces, books and T-shirts; and the innumerable vendors around Times Square hawking unlicensed baseball caps and jerseys emblazoned with an X.
Mr. Lee and Betty Shabazz, Malcolm X's widow, have said the products will help spark a greater interest in Malcolm X, who was born Malcolm Little in 1925 and was assassinated in 1965.
Ms. Shabazz, who declined comment, has hired Curtis Management Group, an Indianapolis company that manages scores of celebrities or their estates, to protect the name from being pirated. (The company also represents the estates of James Dean, Humphrey Bogart and Babe Ruth.) Curtis spokeswoman Stephanie Osha said at least five companies have been sued for using the X without Ms. Shabazz's permission. Another 40 companies with 160 products, including the air freshener, have been licensed.
"The control extends to X when it refers to Malcolm X. Somehow it's more than a letter -- it represents him. Of course, we're not going to sue Xavier College; we just want to protect his name," Ms. Osha said.
She declined to say how much money Ms. Shabazz would make from the licensed sales, but estates typically earn around 5 percent of sales. With about 80 percent of the projected $100 million in Malcolm X goods licensed, several million dollars will undoubtedly flow back to the family.
Malcolm X took the name X to represent the African surname lost to slavery. After a pilgrimage to Mecca he took the name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz.
But because thousands of African-Americans took the surname X too, especially in the 1960s, some do not believe it right that Malcolm X's estate tries to monopolize the letter.Akilah Ali, a Philadelphia jeweler who makes a line of pins and pendants shaped like an X, said the name is part of African-Americans' shared history.
"Malcolm didn't own the X. It's true that the X is almost synonymous with him, but it's also other people's name too," Ms. Ali said.
Malcolm X's brother, Robert Little, said he finds it objectionable that his brother, who preached revolution and economic self-reliance for African-Americans, should be marketed by movie distributor Time Warner Inc., a major entertainment conglomerate with revenues last year of $11.5 billion, and sold by big retail stores.
"I would prefer seeing Malcolm's philosophy being put into practice than his face being portrayed on a shirt. He shouldn't be a fashion statement," said Mr. Little, who heads the New York City Child Welfare Administration.
Another prickly issue surrounding the marketing of Malcolm X is that many of the pirates selling his name are not African-American but Koreans, with whom New York's African-American community has had sometimes touchy relations.
Most of the baseball caps at Times Square, where an enormous X advertises the film, are made in Taiwan, Hong Kong or Korea. Korean fashion manufacturers also promoted clothing with an X logo at a recent fashion fair, saying they couldn't be expected to get caught short in the now-worldwide X-craze.
Even the Nation of Islam has been angry at Malcolm X's dilution and selling, although Malcolm X parted company with the Nation of Islam in 1964. The organization's newspaper said that "blacks again are witnessing the murder of Malcolm X, but this time it is the man's legacy the enemy is destroying; and they are doing it with the approval of black consumers."
But at Mr. Lee's store, Spike's Joint, a steady stream of customers recently flowed in asking for Malcolm X gear.
"People just want to be identified with what he stood for," said Phil, a customer from New Jersey. There's nothing wrong with that. People just like who he was."
The misunderstood 'rule of thumb' Misconception: Many feminists for years thought the phrase "rule of thumb" referred to British common law's tolerance of wife-beating.
Newarcc Petting Zoo | Big cat with appetite needs room to keep growing - tribunedigital-baltimoresun
Tiffany eats eight cans of chicken cat food a day and loves romping with a Welsh corgi named Pepper.
But the 9-month-old orange striped cat is not just a playful tabby with a big appetite. She is a 300-pound Siberian tiger and one of the star attractions at the NEWARCC Petting Farm in Davidsonville.
The cub, raised by Steve and Debbie Collison since she was only 5 weeks old, has outgrown their house and now her small fenced yard.
NEWARCC, the National Endangered Wild Animal Research and Conservation Center, is holding a fund-raiser Sunday for a new home for Tiffany.
The Collisons, owners of NEWARCC, wish to create a quarter-acre exhibit with an exercise area, pool and new shelter for the rare tiger.
They do not yet know how much the new facility will cost or how many fund-raisers they will need to pay for it. They hope to begin construction this summer.
The couple began raising wild animals 15 years ago when they acquired two cougars. Four years ago, in order to help pay for their operation and to educate children about the animals, they opened the petting zoo.
In addition to big cats, NEWARCC has ostrich-like birds called rheas, rare sheep and exotic waterfowl. The Collisons hope to add wallabies and perhaps a monkey in the future.
In addition to the wild and exotic species, the farm also has the usual assortment of petting zoo animals.
The children who visit the farm off Governor's Bridge Road can feed apple slices to Bubba and Buster, the potbellied pigs; give carrots to King, a white pony; rub Willie the lama; and pet $H Handsel the miniature donkey. But as Mrs. Collison leads children through the farm, she warns them that only she can touch the tiger cub, cougars, cockatoos and rheas.
The facility is licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and is a nonprofit organization. Local businesses have donated fencing, cement and lumber. Admissions help pay the cost of maintaining the zoo.
Tiffany, for example, now eats 7 pounds of meat a day in addition to the canned cat food. When she is grown she will eat 20 pounds of meat a day, and it will cost about $4,000 a year just to feed her.
Mrs. Collison said she always wanted a tiger, but it took several years to find one. They acquired Tiffany from a private zoo in Ohio as part of a breeding program.
Only a few hundred Siberian tigers remain in the wild, despite laws to protect them. Mrs. Collison said she believes that within a few years, the animals will no longer exist outside of zoos, circuses and breeding farms. But she said maintaining tigers in captivity preserves the gene pool for attempts to reintroduce the animals into the wild.
The fund-raiser will be held Sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets cost $15 for adults and $7 for children under 12. There will be hayrides, tours of the farm and a picnic catered by Adam's the Place for Ribs.
The state senator accused of bribery is set to make his first appearance in federal court at a hearing Sept. 17. Sen. Ulysses Currie, a Prince George's County Democrat, is expected to plead not guilty.
The senator was indicted last week for allegedly accepting $245,000 in payments from Shoppers Food Warehouse in exchange for his help removing state bureaucratic hurdles. He stepped down from his position as chair of the senate's Budget and Taxation Committee to focus on his defense.
Currie's attorney, Dale Kelberman, describes the arrangement as a consulting position and says it is similar to the outside employment many of the state's legislators hold during the nine months that the General Assembly does not meet. Shoppers is headquartered in his Prince George's County district.
Two former executives from the chain were also indicted and one of them, former president William White, is also scheduled to appear Sept. 17. The other, former vice president for real estate R. Kevin Small, does not yet have a court date set.

HANCOCK - Before St. Peter's parishioners had the brick walls of its church within which to congregate, they met in each other's houses for Mass, said Richard Carrington, corresponding secretary for the church's pastoral council.
The church's history shows priests from Hagerstown and Winchester, Va., coming to large homes in Hancock in the early 1800s to 1820s to say Mass, he said.
St. Peter Catholic Church is one of two churches on East High Street celebrating its 175th anniversary this year. The other is St. Thomas' Episcopal Parish Church.
It was in 1835 that the Catholic church at 16 E. High St. opened its doors to parishioners, said Carrington, who also is corresponding secretary for the anniversary committee. The church was built by Irish Catholic immigrants who were building the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, Carrington said.
There were no labor costs because the workers built the church in their free time, Carrington said. The canal's contractor, Philip Fitzgerald, and five families - the Ryans, Baxters, Broidricks, Mc-Avoys and Littles - were principal donors for supplies to build the church, he said.
St. Peter's mission church in Little Orleans, Md., St. Patrick Catholic Mission, is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, Carrington said.
Parishioners who attend either church are considered parishioners of both churches and the Rev. John J. Lombardi officiates at both, Carrington said. A typical Sunday service at St. Peter's attracts 250 to 300 people, while Saturday Mass at St. Patrick's attracts 50 to 75, depending on the time of year, he said. During the summer, some campers along the C&O and Potomac River come to the Mass.
Archbishop Edwin O'Brien, of the Baltimore archdiocese, will conduct the anniversary Mass at St. Peter on April 25, Carrington said.
"It is an honor for a parish to have its archbishop visit," he said. O'Brien was in the area in February to recruit priests.
On Oct. 16, Bishop Mitchell Rozanski will conduct the Saturday Mass at St. Patrick, Carrington said. Rozanski is the Seton vicar. The office of the Seton vicariate serves seven counties, including Washington and Allegany counties, according to the archdiocese's Web site.
To celebrate the churches' anniversaries, both are planning a family day together in August at Cowans Gap State Park in Fulton County, Pa., Carrington said.
Five parishioners made a quilt for each church - St. Peter's and St. Patrick's - that will hang in their respective churches when they are not on display with church memorabilia in a storefront downtown next to Phillips Fashions on West Main Street, Carrington said.
With the departure of columnist Scott Ostler, and the regular use of color art (such as it is) in The Times sports section, would it be fair to say that the only special feature remaining in the Monday Special is the italic typeface on photo captions?
Wildflowers and blooming cacti aren't the only reason to head for the desert in spring. One high-desert destination that the whole family might enjoy is Calico Ghost Town. On a hillside off of I-15, about 10 minutes north of Barstow, the once-abandoned mining camp has been rejuvenated as a tourist attraction.
A tram takes visitors up the steep side of the hill to the little town above, where there are remnants of the old mining settlement, as well as newly built shops and restaurants that match the Old West decor. About a third of the structures in town are original buildings.
Calico flourished as a silver mining camp and during the late 1800s more than 2,000 people lived and worked there. It's still possible to take a self-guided walking tour through the quarter-mile of shafts and tunnels of old Maggie's Mine.
If Calico seems vaguely familiar even to newcomers, it may be because it was the model for Knott's Berry Farm's old west section. Walter Knott operated the old town until 1966, when it was donated to San Bernardino County.
Unlike the amusement park's ghost town, which has been updated over the years, the mining camp has retained much of its early rustic charm. It's a great place for a lunch break during a day of desert exploration, as well as a pleasant diversion while heading east to Las Vegas and points beyond.
Tiger Woods will miss the Masters after undergoing surgery for a pinched nerve that has been hurting him for months.
The top-ranked golfer made the announcement on his website Tuesday morning, explaining he will need several weeks of rehabilitation.
"After attempting to get ready for the Masters, and failing to make the necessary progress, I decided, in consultation with my doctors, to have this procedure done," he said.
The microdiscectomy was performed Monday in Park City, Utah. Woods said the back surgery was successful and that, after beginning intensive physical therapy in coming days, he could be chipping and putting by the end of the month.
"I'd like to express my disappointment to the Augusta National membership, staff, volunteers and patrons that I will not be at the Masters," he said. "It's a week that's very special to me."
Back spasms have pestered Woods since last summer and forced him to withdraw from the recent Arnold Palmer Invitational.
"It's tough right now, but I'm absolutely optimistic about the future," he said. "There are a couple [of] records by two outstanding individuals and players that I hope one day to break. As I've said many times, Sam and Jack reached their milestones over an entire career. I plan to have a lot of years left in mine."
It's the law. Police across Pennsylvania officially start enforcing seat- belt use today, following a 120-day warning period since Nov. 23.
It's a law most would agree is long overdue. The 30th state to enact such a law, Pennsylvania joins a group that can expect to have 10 percent fewer traffic fatalities and injuries.
According to Juli McGreevy, executive director of the Keystone Safety Belt Network, this means about 120 more people alive every year, and 730 fewer people injured.
The major opposition to a seat-belt law in Pennsylvania, said McGreevy, came from people who felt the law was an invasion of their personal freedom.
They were unable to convince legislators, who knew that 84 percent of people submitting claims to the CAT Fund for medical bills between $100,000 and $1 million had not been wearing seat belts.
"Your body becomes a projectile when a vehicle comes to a sudden stop, and you are ejected one way or another." Injuries, he said, could include a cut aorta, massive crushing injuries to the chest, bruises or cuts to the heart, or major trauma caused by a head hitting a windshield.
"All reason why you should wear a seat belt," he said. "And contrary to what some people think, low-speed accidents without seat-belt use can become very deadly. I have witnessed that time, after time, after time.
"Absolutely, people should wear them. I would rather not have to go to a family and tell them a loved one has died, if the death could have been avoided by the wearing of a seat belt."
Bethlehem Police Commissioner Thomas Murphy yesterday confirmed two off- duty Bethlehem police officers, Leonard and Cindy Jordan, were not wearing seat belts when their car was hit head-on. They both died.
But enforcement of the law may have some rough spots, and police across the Lehigh Valley yesterday discussed the nuts and bolts of how to cite, whom to cite and when to cite.
Since failure to buckle up is a secondary violation, motorists must be cited for another offense before they can be cited for failure to wear a seat belt.
Capt. Paul Woodring, executive officer to the Pennsylvania state police deputy commissioner, cited an example of a motorist receiving two citations, one for speeding and then one for failure to be wearing a seat belt.
But, he said, if the speeding charge were to be dismissed by a district justice, the seat belt violation also would have to be dismissed.
A seat-belt citation would be very difficult to issue to a passenger, said Woodring, because it is secondary. There are very few motor code violations a non-driver can be cited for - littering is one. In most cases, he said, the passenger would be warned.
"There is the argument that you can cite a driver for permitting a violation on behalf of his passenger," said Daniel Polansky, Northampton County assistant district attorney. "But a non-operator being charged with a vehicle code violation is different form the run-of-the-mill type traffic violation you see.
"I assume this all will be worked out eventually," said Polansky, "once some interpretations from the appellate courts are written." But as of today, he said, not wearing a seat belt is illegal, "whatever the enforcement problems."
Berks County District Attorney George C. Yatron also said he didn't foresee any major difficulties with the enforcement of the summary violation.
To encourage compliance, South Whitehall Township police are preparing certificates that will be mailed to motorists, identified by registration plate numbers, observed to be using their seat belts.
South Whitehall's police Chief Donald MacConnell said, "I think that the seat-belt law is definitely a beginning for the state, but I think the legislature has to make it stiffer, and improved, so police can enforce it more effectively."
"We've been trying to get into the habit ourselves as police officers," said Walnutport Chief Russell Fye. "So we have a new rule and regulation pertaining to it: All officers while in their patrol car must wear their seat belts."
The officers complained there might be some problem getting out of a car quickly enough to apprehend a suspect, said Fye, but they have been complying.
In Allentown, Police Chief Wayne T. Stephens said police are ready to make sure each motorist stopped is wearing a seat belt. "We believe seat belts save lives," he said. "We've even had officers involved in accidents, and because they wore a seat belt, avoided serious injury."
State Rep. Paul McHale, a major proponent of the law, said yesterday he would have been more satisfied with a stronger piece of legislation than the one adopted last year.
About nine months before the current law was passed, McHale was advocating a law that could have been enforced by itself, and not in conjunction with any other violation, mandating a $20 fine. But the vote failed, he said.
The current law will save lives, he said, although not as many lives as another version of the law might have achieved. But the overriding issue is not one of legality, but safety: Wearing seat belts saves lives, he said.
"We have to review the law as it was written, improve it and enact the very best law that we can," said McHale.
So, motorists entering the commonwealth can expect to be greeted with a large sign, erected by the Department of Transportation, informing them that seat-belt use is the law in Pennsylvania.
The White Supremacist Next Door Neighbors First Knew Mark Thomas As The Man With The Anti-tax Signs. Then His Message Turned From Criticizing Government To Attacking Jews And Blacks.
Mrs. Minnie A. Hillegass, 95, formerly of Lesher Road, Palm, died Saturday in the Zohlman Nursing Home, Richlandtown. She was the widow of John K. Hillegass.

Orlando returned from a 12-game road trip with the lowest batting average in the Southern League, and reliever Paul Gnacinski helped the O-Twins stay there with five innings of no-hit pitching to lead Greenville to a 7-3 victory Friday night in front of 615 fans at Tinker Field.
Gnacinski (3-0) had to face only 14 batters to get 15 outs. He came on with two on and none out in the bottom of the fifth inning and induced catcher Sam Sorce to hit into a double play. He struck out two and walked none the rest of the way to start Orlando's eight-game homestand on a sour note.
''He shut the door on us,'' Orlando Manager George Mitterwald said. ''We started out fast, but we couldn't get a big hit. A lot of times you can bury a team early if you can score a few runs. We've only done that once this year, though, and we've had some chances.''
Orlando loaded the bases in the bottom of the first, but managed only one run. Greenville starter Pete Smith got Sorce to strike out looking to set the tone for the evening. The O-Twins stranded eight runners in the first five innings.
Greenville's Bob Tumpane and Inocencio Guerrero hit home runs on consecutive pitches from losing pitcher Mark Clemons (3-2) in the top of the second. Clemons gave up three more runs on four hits in the third as Greenville claimed a 6-1 lead.
Clemons, Orlando's only starter with a winning record, settled down after the third to allow only one run before being lifted in the ninth. But Gnacinski kept the O-Twins from mounting a rally.
''Once Clemons settled down, he pitched a pretty good game,'' Mitterwald said. ''He hasn't had a bad outing yet. I just hope Alan Sontag can get it going tomorrow. He is due to pitch a good game.''
Center fielder Greg Tubbs led Greenville with three hits and two runs scored. Guerrero and Dave Griffin, the Southern League's leading hitter, drove in two runs apiece.
Greg Morhardt was Orlando's only player with two hits. John Marquardt added a double to drive in two runs in the third inning, but that was the brunt of the O-Twins' five-hit attack.
NILES -- Michigan State Police are looking for a former Cass County sex offender who has failed to register with authorities since 2000. Police said Tuesday they hope the public can help them track down the whereabouts of Dwight James Hawkins, 22, formerly of Cassopolis. Hawkins is about 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs about 150 pounds. He has blond hair and blue eyes. Police said he also goes by the name DJ Hawkins. Hawkins' last known address was the 50000 block of Point Road in Cassopolis when he last registered with authorities Sept. 8, 2000, said 1st Lt. Michael Brown of the Niles Post. Hawkins is charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a victim under the age of 13 years old. Hawkins is wanted on a felony "uttering and publishing" charge and for a sex offender violation, police said. Brown said if anyone knows where Hawkins may be, the person should call the Niles Post at (269) 683-4411 or the Tri-County Sex Offender Registry Task Force hot line toll-free at (866) 501-SORT.

I have asked around previously about the whereabouts of any Mini Wheels magazines. Buy, swap, sell, copy ,scan or archive somewhere. It would be a shame to lose theses little pieces of history. I have a couple of issues, particularly one which has a report on the 1977 'Slot Racing Revival ' meeting held at Slotz, Seven Hills. Open class was won by Denis Traeger. I would be happy to copy or scan it for anyone interested.
I Did 'communicate' with Dave Smith some years ago, when Retro was beginning to 'Happen', so I am Sure (the 'Collective' WE),..
There is so much Good stuff and History available and turning up in the US, (as seen on Slotblog etc) and it Would be good to have some of 'Our' stuff 'Available' as such !!
I will start scanning what I have and share them with you. The quality is not great as they are photo copies of photo copies. I also have some 'Australian Model Car and Slot Racing Review' mags from the 1960's if you are interested as well.
Yeah, even the originals of what I've got are not great, as they look like old Gestetner or Roneo prints.
OK, I've scanned 3 magazines that I have, and Neil has sent me one of his, which have ended up on here;
If anyone else has some Aussie slot car magazines, newsletters, etc and would like to share, please let me know by following up in the new thread under "General Discussion".
Having Now, 'Finally' managing to Recall from the deepest darkest depths of my brain cells, How to 'set' the correct 'Permisions' for the additions I was trying to make and to allow me the required control over the New "General Discussion" section and,.. 'Other people's Posts etc.
I have now got a Permanent 'Link' on the front page of the Forum, in the 'Links' Section and have Made the 'Post' in the General Discussion Section 'Sticky'.
So, perhaps if others want to add Info' etc might be best to 'post' in the General Discussion section ??

List No. 6 & 7 seniority case at Hon Supreme Court: The SLP filed by BSNL and other individuals was dismissed today. Hon SC observed that since there is no ROTA mentioned in the statutory SDE Recruitment rules 1996 and 2002, seniority can be claimed only after joining the service of that cadre.As such Hon SC found no infirmity in the judgement of Hon HC of Mumbai and Ernakulam.
The SLP filed by BSNL against Hon CAT Jabalpur judgement on notional date of promotion allowed by Hon SC. However the notional date of promotion given to 124 officers of Karnataka circle by another bench of Hon SC is protected.

Following the angry comments made by Nigerians, in reaction to Wizkid’s failure to make it to the venue of the 2018 Coachella, the singer is cursing out his trolls on Twitter.
The singer was scheduled to perform at the ongoing Coachella Arts & Music Festival in US, but he could not make it to the venue of the event due to visa issues. He has put out a tweet to explain the situation, the organisers of the event did the same but the explanation did not stop Nigerians from dragging the singer on Twitter. Wizkid has been labelled unprofessional and care free.
In reaction to these comments, Wizkid has been cursing out his trolls. He responded to a comment made by a certain @KreemO_, by saying ‘Na ur papa fuck up!’
Gunz are by far the least appealing choice to take. Kanonz, for their faults, have that hefty big hitting power. Zappas have long range, ignore Orks' terrible accuracy and with upgrades can slow and bypass enemy armor. Guns seem like a 'can't afford/can't kustomize anything else' weapon. They are unimpressive and unremarkable. I'd like to change that (note that I don't want to make them OP, nor make Orks too versatile, but rather make Gunz nice in an Orky kind of way.
I propose to change the properties of Gunz a bit. First, like they currently are, they would have a 'minimum' and 'maximum' number of shots. However, various upgrades and buffs could augment these.
Extra Shots: Turrets, prow gunz, and batteries each have a 'minimum' and 'maximum' number of shots. Turrets are more reliable, having a consistent range, while batteries are more swingy, occasionally only puttering out a few shots or belching out a ton of them.
Weight of Fire- Orks have terrible accuracy, but this could get somewhat mitigated by throwing a lot of shots in a general direction. Every turret, prow gun, and side battery on a single ship would impart a small bonus to base accuracy in that arc. So Kustomizing a ship around having lots of gunz would make them more accurate than if you had Gunz+Kanonz in an arc. The exact percentages could be tweaked, but it would mean if you were gonna spam gunz then obviously a Dethdeala is going to get a better benefit than just a Basha.
Drillin' effect- Ork gun shells are crude, but repeated hits in the same area can drill deep into a ship's hull to hit vital components. Their base crit chance is very low and can't directly be improved, but every penetrating hit on an enemy ship generates a 'debuff' on the ship that increases the crit chance of the next penetrating hit for the next 2 seconds, until it reaches some reasonable cap. This encourages you to focus-fire a single target with guns, raking its hull with fire until you reach the meaty bitz.
More Dakka- Passively gives +1 to the minimum and maximum number of shots in a salvo of all gunz weapons. When Lock-On is in effect, you always fire the maximum number of shots.
They could play around with the specific values to keep it balanced, but the idea here is that Gunz are still a middling secondary weapon, but if you're really willing to invest in them they can be an impressive medium-range weapon. Since many buffs increase the minimum number of shots in a salvo you can really maximize the dakka, and since gunz variants tend to be cheaper than other weapons you can make the most of how their crit chance works by focus-firing tougher enemies. They don't need any AP in this situation because you are throwing so much lead at the target; even a Battle Barge will get perforated eventually.
I built a bad moonz fleet around gunz that does pretty well in skirmish. Haven't been able to try it with multiplayer though. Moved recently and am relegated to playing on my laptop, which doesn't have the same power. If I activate all my lock ons with out tac cog active, my machine can't handle all the objects at once
Orkz is never beatin in battle. If we win we win, if we die we die fightin so it don't count. If we legz it we don't die neither, so we can come back for annuver go, see!

I keep 1 kroozer as a devoted defensive carrier and 1 Hamma with zzaps. No one else gets kustom points spent, so it's all gunz and torps. Upgrades are more dakka, more shields, shield recharge, extra turrets, and order duration (the zzap ship replaces more dakka and order duration with shield pierce and slow). The bad moonz extra upgrade is usually belt armour or extra bridge. It is definitely supposed to broadside. Skills are usually things like boost recharge, shield regen, stasis bomb, and waaagh. Playstyle is similar to kannons, in that you want to get in close to ram and board. Biggest difference is gunz start chipping away at the enemy shield from longer range and prevent a partial recharge by dealing constant damage. Get into that 3k sweet spot, hit lock on, and watch those hull points tick off like water through a sieve.
Edit: I give my light kroozers Goff favor and use them to disrupt formations like giant krooze-rokkitz
I haven’t had the opportunity to travel much lately, but I hear it’s getting rough out there in the world. I don’t even spend enough time over in San Francisco to notice what the tourists are up to these days by way of claiming their space, but I hear that selfie-sticks, and high expectations are a part of the scene.
Another part of the scene seems to be disruption. When I read the news about the Baby Bison that got picked up by the un-named tourists in Yellowstone, I ran a gamut of emotions. Anger at the stupidity of it. Sadness for the needless loss. Feeling remiss in that I haven’t been doing my part in educating my readers about caring for the wonders of the world.
The National Park System has reported that there are more and more people taking extreme chances in nature with their selfie-sticks. Both Mashable and Vice have run multiple reports a few months ago about people actually dying for their extreme selfies.
News has been circulating on social media about people putting a bison calf in their car. The story is true, and its sad conclusion highlights the importance of keeping a safe distance from park wildlife. Here’s the full account:
Last week, visitors were cited for placing a newborn bison calf in their vehicle and transporting it to a park facility because of their misplaced concern for the animal’s welfare. In terms of human safety, this was a dangerous activity because adult animals are very protective of their young and will act aggressively to defend them. In addition, interference by people can cause mothers to reject their offspring. In this case, park rangers tried repeatedly to reunite the newborn bison calf with the herd. These efforts failed. The bison calf was later euthanized because it was abandoned and causing a dangerous situation by continually approaching people and cars along the roadway.
In a recent viral video, a visitor approached within an arm’s length of an adult bison in the Old Faithful area. Another video featured visitors posing for pictures with bison at extremely unsafe and illegal distances. Last year, five visitors were seriously injured when they approached bison too closely. Bison injure more visitors to Yellowstone than any other animal.
Approaching wild animals can drastically affect their well-being and, in this case, their survival. Park regulations require that you stay at least 25 yards (23 m) away from all wildlife (including bison, elk and deer) and at least 100 yards (91 m) away from bears and wolves. Disregarding these regulations can result in fines, injury, and even death. The safety of these animals, as well as human safety, depends on everyone using good judgment and following these simple rules. — National Park Service
I’ve been a photographer for almost forty years. I get selfies. We used to call them self portraits and we made them all the time. It was part of the process of becoming a fine artist. Prior to the development of photography, painters painted self portraits. So, it’s not a new thing – the concept is hundreds of years old. And, it’s an understandable thing that is is becoming more commonplace – as we become a less wordy, more visual world, selfies are our new way of journal keeping.
That may be the case, but a selfie is not worth a life. Expectations and disruption are not worth your footprint on nature. Baby bison, and any baby critters, belong with their mothers, no matter how inclement the weather. Ignorance is not an excuse to disrupt nature. Had that baby bison been left in the wild it would not have been rejected by its herd. Educate yourself before you travel and remember to pack your common sense – especially when out in nature.
Thanks to those trade deals that raised the standard of living around the world, more of the world is traveling now, so there’s that crush of humanity with more people crowding formerly quiet places and sometimes doing stupid things.

Artists, Writers, Photographers … it’s probably our intense curiosity about life that drives us to move about on the planet. Our need to experience the revitalization of Self attracts the artist in us to the road or the rail or the skies. In a way, traveling is very similar to the creation process – both are taking a leap into the unknown.
Within our travels we find the discovery of a new place, a new language, a new taste, a new way of seeing, or find new work methods that will ultimately, profoundly affect our work.
ARTIST-AT-LARGE is here to inspire and encourage you to open the door and step out into an unknown world – to transform – even if it is only by experiencing your own neighborhood.

One month ago, the top winter triathletes around the world competed for national and world titles in championship events that took place in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Cheile Gradistei, Romania. These wild red squirrels wanted to join the action too!
Swedish photographer Geert Weggen works extensively with wild squirrels to capture unique, whimsical images. We’re pleased to feature Weggen’s latest photos, inspired by the sport of winter triathlon, which consists of a run, bike and ski.
Maybe you’ve signed up for Wildflower (what’s Wildflower? ) and haven’t quite sorted out your logistics for the epic weekend of triathlon, camping, beer, wine, and music. Or maybe you’ve always wanted to sign up for Wildflower, but have been holding back because sorting out the BYO details is just too overwhelming. (Do I have to eat freeze dried camp food for my pre-race dinner? Is there an option besides instant coffee? Where do I shower? No, really. WHERE DO I SHOWER???) No worries, I’ve got all your answers right here.
Assuming that you’re not driving to the race, Monterey Regional Airport is the closest airport to Lake San Antonio … but doesn’t seem to serve direct flights from Denver. Given that, your best bet is to fly into San Jose Airport, although San Francisco and Oakland are also decent options. You’ll need to rent a car, as the race site is not Uber-able from the airport. Don’t want to deal with flying with your bike and then having to rent an enormous, expensive SUV? ProBike Express, your local bike concierge, will offer bike + bag + tent + anything else you need transport services if there is sufficient interest; TriBike Transport serves the race as well.
Plan for a 2-1/2 to 3 hour drive from the airport down to Lake San Antonio, but make sure to buffer an extra 30-60 minutes to stop for provisions along the way (see “Food & Water” below). Your best bet is to hit up Salinas, which is about halfway from San Jose Airport to Lake San Antonio and serves as a convenient place to stock up on supplies for the weekend. There’s a Costco, a Walmart, a Target, and a Safeway, so between the four you should be able to find pretty much everything you need. There’s also an In-N-Out Burger in Salinas, and if you don’t stop and get a double-double animal style, we’re going to have a serious conversation about your priorities.
If you find yourself 15 minutes south of Salinas and realize you forgot the key ingredient for your famous campfire mac-n-cheese, you can stop at the Safeway in King City, which is about an hour outside of Lake San Antonio. For real this is the last place to find provisions, so check your list twice before driving off.
Finally, you’ll want to plan your trip timing around the road closures within Lake San Antonio Park. All roads in the park are closed on Saturday from 7am-3pm and on Sunday from 8am-3pm. Regardless of what race you’re eyeing, plan to arrive no later than Friday and leave late Sunday afternoon. (Already made travel arrangements that conflict with road closures? You can park at North Shore campground and take a boat shuttle to/from the race site.)
There are a myriad of great lodging options available for Wildflower, as long as you’re not dead set on turn down service and a chocolate on your pillow: there are no hotels to be found anywhere near the race site. Here’s what is available:
Camping is available at a number of campgrounds surrounding the Lake. You can lock in advance reservations HERE. Individual spaces are first-come-first-served, so if you’re picky about locations, plan to arrive at the race site on Thursday rather than Friday. Camping is $25/person/night for everyone over 16.
RV parking is available at the campgrounds as well with the same logistics and pricing as tent camping. (The limited number of RV spots with hookups are, unfortunately, sold out.) You can bring your own RV or you can arrange to have one delivered to the campsite if a two-day drive each way doesn’t fit your schedule.
While sadly the super-cool Tinker Tins are sold out for 2018, there is still limited available for the Bell Tents (think: Glamping), at $950 for the full three nights. If you like the idea of camping but want to add a little civility, or just back support, to the weekend, I’d jump on these quickly – more info HERE.
For all of these lodging options, standard campground bathrooms should typically be no more than a few hundred yards away. Some of these will have showers, some won’t, so get the lay of the land ahead of time and strategize shower timing to avoid the crowds.
If you really can’t get past the idea of a private, hot shower, AirBnB and VRBO are great sources for rentals surrounding Lake San Antonio, and there are hotels in nearby Paso Robles, approximately 35 miles from the Lake. If you do stay outside the park, keep those Saturday and Sunday road closure times in mind, and plan to pay the $10/person/day Festival pass rates upon entering the Park.
This is the area where your advance planning skills really get tested. You do want to think through ALL of your food and drink needs prior to heading to Wildflower for the weekend.
• Water – Yes, you need to bring your own water. Maybe a half gallon per day per person? Maybe even a smidge more to account for race day requirements.
• Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner – How many days? What do you want to eat? How are you going to cook it? How are you going to store it? If you’re going to cook, you’ll need to bring your own skillet, pots, plates and utensils, and be sure to grab a cooler – styrofoam or the real deal – when you stop for provisions. You can grab ice, firewood, and lighter fluid at the small, very basic, general store onsite.
• Want to restock mid-weekend? In addition to the small, onsite store, Oak Hill Market is roughly 15 minutes outside the park and is about the best general store there is: quality meats, great produce, wine, barbecue supplies, eggs, and a great deli. (There’s also a gas station here – the nearest one I believe – if you are running low!)
• Don’t want to cook over a fire? – Welcome to my world. Thankfully we won’t be left to starve – there will be a wide variety of food trucks at the festival all weekend, and they will mostly be serving healthy/gourmet food rather than traditional carnival food truck fare. Save for your 5am pre-race meal, the food trucks will have you covered. Pro tip: TriCalifornia is exploring a cashless system for festival vendors, including food trucks. Keep an eye out for more info on their website and Facebook page!
• Must. Have. Pasta. – No duh. There’s a pasta party Friday night. Did you really think they’d leave you hanging? Tickets will be available online starting in Mid-March ($12 adults / $6 under 16) and you can buy tickets onsite if that’s more your style ($14 / $8), but only those who buy tickets in advance get a second serving.
• But what about coffee??? – Yup, they thought of that too. Nate Dressel, former pro triathlete, will be there with his new venture, Frontier Coffee. Just be prepared to stand in a long line if your morning routine involves anything incorporating the word “latte.”
And if reading all that just gave you an enormous headache, there are a limited number of $200 VIP packages remaining that cover breakfast, lunch and dinner for the entire weekend. You can add this option to your campground reservation, Bell Tent reservation, or pre-purchased Festival day pass upon checkout through Active.com.
You’ve sorted through the headache of a race venue where everything – literally, EVERYTHING – is BYO. So now what? TIME TO PARTY!!! Just kidding. Well, not really. Pretty much the whole point of Wildflower is that it’s not just a race, it’s an entire weekend of awesomeness. And to experience all of this awesomeness properly, it’s going to require just a little more advance preparation.
First off, in the weeks leading into the Wildflower Experience weekend, TriCalifornia is going to release the official Wildflower app. (Yup, there’s an app for that.) Given the very limited cell service at Lake San Antonio – no, I would not anticipate any wifi hotspots – you’ll want to download this app before race weekend. Then, while you still have cell service, make sure the maps and shuttle schedules are loaded, and review the race weekend schedule. Within the app you can reserve spots for activities and services – as in: post-race massages and pedicures – and you’ll want to do this before race weekend.
Minus scheduling your massage, you can take advantage of much of the race weekend awesomeness on a more spontaneous basis. Plan for lots of time hanging around the campsite – pack your Eno hammock, or consider grabbing a cheap-o lawn chair at Walmart to enable this activity. But do wander off from your campsite at some point and check out the Festival: bands will be playing throughout the day on Saturday and Sunday, there will be local artisan tents and helicopter tours (only $99 – if I weren’t terrified of helicopters I’d say this sounds like a steal), there’s an art bar where you can paint and drink wine (this is more my speed), and you can rent paddle boards and kayaks anytime outside of race swim windows. And yes, beer and wine will be flowing all weekend long.
As if all that weren’t enough, there is a 5k run at the Redonda Vista campground on Saturday night (think: pre- or post-race shake out run) that ends with an 80’s dance party, sponsored by Clif Bar. Seriously: AN 80’S DANCE PARTY. I mean, I thought I was excited about the Wildflower Experience when I signed up – now I don’t even care about the race. I just want to go to the 80’s dance party.

This is the perfect opportunity to gaze into the future and attempt to predict what will happen in the fitness industry over the coming year.
Based on wide-ranging research and numerous conversations with colleagues working for health clubs, equipment companies and education organizations, I’ve identified some of the fitness trends we are most likely to see in the coming year. The trends listed below, although not an exhaustive list by any means, represent opportunities for you to increase your knowledge as a health and fitness professional, and identify potential areas of growth in 2018.
(Note: If you’d like to judge the accuracy of my soothsaying abilities, here are the trend lists for 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. It’s a shame I can’t make the same predictions about the outcomes of football games or the stock market.)
Recently, there has been an increase in the number of studios opening up to offer these physically demanding workouts, as well as an increase in the number of boxing/kickboxing classes showing up on group fitness schedules.
After years of high-intensity interval training reigning supreme, 2018 will make a rediscovery of functional training that emphasizes movement quality over load and intensity. Lashaun Dale, vice president for content and programming at 24 Hour Fitness who specializes in being a futurist for the fitness industry, suggests that class programming will shift toward an emphasis on what she calls “conscious movement,” as opposed to simply pushing the intensity of a workout to reach the point of exhaustion.
Fitness programs will become more mindful with instructors and trainers incorporating various strategies to promote flow states via exercise…

Always one to recognize and compliment the competition, as well as thanking the cheering crowds, Longmont’s Tyler Butterfield won yesterday’s Bermuda Marathon with grace, and gratitude.
Tyler Butterfield followed in the example set by Dage Minors in Friday’s Elite Mile when he ran to victory in the Bermuda Marathon yesterday in near-perfect running conditions.
Butterfield, Bermuda’s top male triathlete who returned from his home in Boulder, Colorado to compete for the first time in several years, set the pace after a 1hr 14min time for the first loop on his way to a winning time of 2:27:07 ahead of last year’s winner, Bryan Morseman, of the United States, who clocked 2:28:43. Third was Abu Kebede Diriba, of Ethiopia, in 2:37:44.
“I’ve done one marathon before and that was a 2:42 [time] when I was 21, a good 14 years ago,” Butterfield said after his victory. “I ran a 2:48 in an Ironman, so I knew with a 2:42 I should be able to improve on that.”
Butterfield ran several miles with another local runner, Chayce Smith, who was competing in the Bermuda Half-Marathon.
“Chayce and I ran the first lap together and it was great hearing everyone cheering us on,” Butterfield said. “It was nice to have some locals up the front.
“Bryan led me through the first half and then we ran the first mile or two [second loop] together before I pulled away just after Trimingham Hill.
“There was a slight downhill before the flat to McGall’s Hill and I had speed coming off the hill and just went with it. I thought I might regret it later because it was a little quick. The first lap was a negative split but I have to say there was a lot of people out there cheering. Thank you to the people who come out every year.”
Butterfield and Morseman were tucked in with the Half-Marathon lead pack, before the field started to open up after the two-mile mark and Butterfield carried on to win,
Butterfield still holds the senior schools mile record of 4:27:30, which he set in 1999 when a student at Saltus.
Triathlete Tyler Butterfield will run in Bermuda Marathon Weekend as he continues his preparation for the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, Australia, in April.
Butterfield is to return home from Boulder, Colorado, tomorrow and will be among hundreds taking part in the full marathon on Sunday — the final race of the three-day event.
The 34-year-old, whose schedule does not usually allow him to compete in the Bermuda Marathon Weekend, will also take part in the Butterfield & Vallis 5K next weekend, which marks the 100th anniversary of his family’s wholesale business.
“I miss doing May 24, but some years the timing works and others it doesn’t due to other races over here in the United States or internationally.
“I’m pumped to get to do a bit of Bermuda Marathon Weekend, a weekend I used to always look forward to when I lived on the island. I’m not looking at anything special from myself in the marathon; I just want to enjoy it.
“I will be racing off mostly base training and it will be one of my last long, harder runs before I switch to focus on more speed.”
Butterfield left his mark in the schools’ KPMG Front Street Mile races in the early 2000s when he set several records. His schedule will not allow him to return in time to watch those races.
“I would love to come on Thursday to watch the Front Street Mile on Friday night, but I’ve one other sponsor trip I had to do this week, today and tomorrow.”
Butterfield is also looking forward to competing in the Butterfield & Vallis race, along with brother Spencer. He will also be the guest speaker at the Bermuda Triathlon Association’s prize-giving dinner at the Loft at Flanagan’s next Saturday.
“Tickets for that are available at Raceday World, and it should be a fun night talking about modern racing, the old days of triathlon and racing with my dad Jim.
“Then the next day I will be at the Butterfield & Vallis 5k to celebrate the [company’s] 100th anniversary. It’s a perfect distance for everyone to come out and enjoy a family event.
“It’s great to be able to be home for both weekends and three great events. Bermuda always has so much going on.”
Butterfield will then turn his focus to the Commonwealth Games, where he hopes to be a part of a triathlon relay team including Flora Duffy, Tyler Smith and Erica Hawley.
“After this trip to Bermuda, it will be back to Colorado and a training camp in Arizona to start to get ready for Commonwealth Games in April,” he said.
Coeur Sports has announced they will launch the Collective Beat women’s triathlon community in 2018:
We created The Collective Beat so that we could expand our community beyond our team of ambassadors and professionals. The goal is to draw in more amazing women who are instinctively aligned with the Coeur mission of building a nation of encouraging, supportive, and positive endurance sports athletes.
There will be a nominal fee to join The Collective Beat and we wanted to share our thinking behind the program and also tell everyone about the benefits.
So, let’s start with the benefits. We set up the benefits so that members will receive much more in value than the cost of membership. First, members will receive a $200 clothing allowance that can be used to purchase some beautiful and exclusive apparel.
The gear will be designed specifically for TCB members and will be delivered around the first of April next year. Just as the North American Tri Season gets going.
Members will also receive a free women’s specific triathlon training plan that was developed by the ladies over at Hardcoeur coaching. These plans retail for up to $149.99 and we have a selection of distances that range from sprint to full iron distance.
We’ll also be giving members an an unlimited use, 20% discount code that is good all year long for Coeur Sports and Zele by Coeur products. You’ll be able to begin using your discount as soon as you join and it can be used on the new 2018 line that we just rolled out.
Plus, our amazing partners are also providing some incredible discounts. So if you’ve ever wanted to try something from great companies, like Barnanas, Zelios, Breakthrough Nutrition, Normatek, Inside Tracker and more, then this is your chance. Just sign up and do some shopping.
Finally, members will have access to a social site where they can cheer for each other and keep up with new benefits as they become available. In our heart of hearts, we believe that the social connection will be one of the most special benefits that members receive.
If this plays out the way we hope, people will know that if someone is wearing TCB gear, then there’s an extremely good chance that that individual is positive, encouraging, relatable, and approachable. We’ve said it time and again, that the first step (or pedal) into endurance sports can be a bit scary and we hope that Collective Beat members will be little beacons of encouragement all around the world.
All in all, we think this is a fantastic package of benefits that will more than cover the $250 cost of the program. We’ll be welcoming members until January 31, 2018 and then the membership will be valid until January 31, 2019.

Series to run in 2018 through top international broadcasters; Casting submissions open until February 1, 2018
TAMPA, Fla. (December 15, 2017) — IRONMAN, a Wanda Sports Holdings company, announced today that applications for the second season of “IRONMAN: Quest for Kona”, are now being accepted globally.
The series, which just finished airing its first full season on NBCSN and Red Bull TV to positive reviews, is scheduled to air in 2018 and will profile ten athletes from around the world as they embark on their journey to qualifying for the most iconic single-day endurance event, the IRONMAN® World Championship which will take place in Kailua-Kona, Hawai`i on October 13, 2018. Throughout the series, athletes will evolve physically and emotionally as they pursue the goal of competing among the best in the world.
“We are excited to embark on our search for the next set of IRONMAN competitors who are willing to share their stories of dedication and perseverance in working toward their ultimate goal – qualifying for the 2018 IRONMAN World Championship,” said Christopher Stadler, Chief Marketing Officer of IRONMAN. “I am confident that we are going to have another cast of remarkable athletes looking to share their extraordinary and awe-inspiring stories.”
Each episode will feature one charismatic and engaging contender as they take on a specific IRONMAN qualifying event, capturing the breathtaking scenery, local culture and unique athletic challenges that each setting presents. While not every athlete may ultimately qualify, each will show that IRONMAN is about persevering, enduring and being a part of something larger than themselves, proving that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE®.
Self-shot footage will be utilized to capture each person’s real-time journey as a supplement to the broadcast content. “IRONMAN: Quest for Kona” takes aspirational athletes and puts their mission front and center, inviting viewers to experience the personal highs and lows of each pursuit. Air dates and channels for each market will be released in the coming months.
Casting for the second season is currently open globally, with the first round of submission due by February 1, 2018. Additional information and casting application is available at www.ironman.com/questforkona.
“…only three athletes active today have finished ‘current-neutral’ swims of 63 miles or more — all three of them women.”
Last week Sarah Thomas got up at 5am and drove the 25 miles from her home to the swimming pool in Lakewood, Colorado, as she does most mornings. There she completed her 6,000-yard workout before heading to work as a healthcare recruiter. She was untroubled by autograph hunters; no TV crews stopped her to seek an interview.
And yet Thomas is, according to Steven Munatones, founder of the World Open Water Swimming Association, “an outlier, a once-in-a-generation athlete, and a motivator who is showing others how far they can push themselves”. In August she completed what must rank as one of 2017’s greatest achievements in endurance sport, swimming further than anyone — man or woman — has swum before without the assistance of currents: a scarcely believable 104 miles, nonstop, in three days and nights in the water.
“The record wasn’t really the big incentive for me,” Thomas tells me from her home in Denver. “It was about finding and pushing my personal limits.” What could be a weary trope coming from many athletes rings true from Thomas. She swims without sponsorship — fitting her training around her full-time job. Her achievements have received little media attention; her record-breaking swim has not, to date, even been mentioned in a national newspaper.
“Sarah herself doesn’t seek out publicity,” Ken Classen, her coach and training partner, tells me. “If it wasn’t for her friends and mother-in-law she’d probably have no publicity and quite frankly I don’t think she’d care either way.”
Last year Thomas swam a record 82 miles nonstop in Lake Powell but felt she could go further — the 100-mile barrier beckoned. In choosing the current-free Lake Champlain for her swim, Thomas was attempting something no one of either gender had previously done. “A few people have swum over 100 miles before,” explains Evan Morrison, co-founder of the Marathon Swimming Federation, that adjudicated Thomas’ swim, but only with the assistance of strong, predictable currents.
These include a 139.8-mile effort by the late Croatian swimmer, Veljko Rogosic, in the Adriatic. “His swim was very impressive, but it belongs in a separate category,” explains Morrison. According to his records, only three athletes active today have finished “current-neutral” swims of 63 miles or more — all three of them women.
Beat Knechtle, a Swiss doctor and endurance athlete who has studied female performance in open-water swimming, offers two possible explanations for this dominance. “Women have an advantage due to their higher body fat, which provides insulation against the cold and better buoyancy.” As wetsuits may not be worn for official open-water swims, this could be an important advantage. Then there is the mental side. “In open-water swimming women have learnt that they are able to beat men and therefore expect to compete at a higher level,” says Knechtle.
Thomas agrees. “Women have a long history of swimming: it’s been socially acceptable for us to be athletes in the pool and open water for much longer than in other sports. I think having that strong foundation has really helped women to compete and train at a high level.”

Sugden Regional Park in East Naples offers a host of activities, many centered around the 60-acre lake.
A Colorado man died following a triathlon at Sugden Regional Park in East Naples on Sunday, officials said.
A Collier County Sheriff’s Office deputy stationed at the event to coordinate traffic was alerted by a man about 7:20 a.m. that “there is a man in the water, not breathing,” according to a Sheriff’s Office incident report.
The deputy ran to the shoreline of the lake where he found a man, later identified as 75-year-old James Treadwell, lying on the sand and being tended to by a Collier County EMS paramedic, two race participants and Treadwell’s wife, the report states.
After confirming Treadwell had no pulse and wasn’t breathing, the group began cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Susan replied to yesterday's post by asking, but how's the FOOD? Well our first real meal at Sewing Summit was dinner last night. We did our research and decided to make a trek to Eva, a quirky little Mediterranean restaurant featuring small plates. We shared a butter lettuce salad with strawberry relish and goat cheese toasts (yummy) ... baked Greek mac and cheese with bacon and arugula (yummier) ... and eva's "baker's pie" that was all cheesy with a tomato and fresh mozzarella salad on top (yummiest)! mmm. Highly recommend.
Open Sew was up and running after dinner, and we spent several hours there just stitching away. Between machines and sewists, there was quite a hum in that room.
Today started with a quick coffee run and then straight to class! Mine was "Metal Frame Pouch" with Kelly of KelbySews. The pattern was quick and easy and shock of shocks, the gluing into the frame was a snap. What was I worried about?
From there it was on to "Creative Fabric Selection" with Jeni Baker of In Color Order. Her presentation was so engaging and enlightening.....very enjoyable! And what a treat to all get a Michael Miller Cotton Couture color card!
Lunch was really nice - the first hotel meal - bountiful salad and dessert bars. We met all new people at our lunch table and enjoyed getting acquainted and swapping cards. Also during lunch was a brief presentation by the team from Threadbias, which was cool as I'm a newcomer to their site.
Last class today was "Photography for Bloggers" with Vanessa Hewell of LBG Studio. If anything, this is where I need and want help and Vanessa gave us alot to think about and try with our cameras.
So now it's down time for a bit ... later on we'll head out to a mixer sponsored by the Salt Lake City Modern Quilt Guild ... out on the town with most of SS!
I'm glad you're updating! Sounds like it would be way too overwhelming for me I think. I need a LOT of down time and quiet time in my life. haha
Thanks for letting us live vicariously through you! I'm following along on Instagram too and it looks like a marvelous time.

You've probably heard all about Pantone's recent big announcement. It's only been a few years that I've known such a thing as a Pantone Color of the Year even existed. But once I did, I paid attention. In 2012, when the color of the year was Tangerine Tango, I created Tangerisk
So this year it's all about Radiant Orchid. The name alone is somewhat exotic, don't you think? Here's a couple of interesting reads from Blossom Heart Quilts and modern handcraft, and check out what I got when I searched for Radiant Orchid on Pinterest! Should be interesting, as orchid will be a ways out of my fabric comfort zone, but I'm willing to give it a chance in the new year. Armed with my official swatch card, I'll be watching out for my own fabric finds, and seeing what inspiration they bring. You?
This is definitely my kind of color but it doesn't really fit into our interior. I heard about this "color of the year" just few weeks ago and honestly I don't really care :-)
I was "inspired" to paint my bedroom tangerine two years ago. It looks nice with my white beaded board half way up the wall and espresso bedroom set. It isn't very calming though and I am ready for something new, but it won't be orchid! I'm thinking a taupe or grey. Something soothing.
Love this new Color of the year but with reddish hair, it won't be entering my wardrobe. Perhaps the grand babes will benefit : )
Radiant Orchid is my kind of color. I love using brights in my quilts. But since I am on a no buy fabric diet, I doubt I will be using much of it.
I enjoyed your review of the colors and your makes. I played along when it was Tangerine, skipped Emerald, and am debating on Orchid. I look forward to seeing your Radiant Orchid creation!
Ooh, I'm ahead of the curve! Plenty of orchid in my sister's wedding quilt. Who knew we were trendy?
I seem to have quite a dislike for every color they choose :( So looking forward to see what you come up with. Who knows, I might even start liking this "orchid" color.
tangerine was a dream, emerald was classic but this orchid..not sew sure about it. Will see what the fabric designers lure us in with.
I should order a swatch. Can you match it to a fabric that I would know? I have to make a purple quilt for my sister, I figure it is a time, given the colour of the year.
Very smart to get the official swatch card. I'm just not sure about this one. I'm still pining over tangerine tango....

Cole Swindell recently released the lead single from his forthcoming third studio album. "Break Up in the End" is a real change of pace for the singer, and he's sharing the story behind the song exclusively with Taste of Country readers.
"Break Up in the End" is an acoustic guitar-based ballad that's very different from any other single Swindell has released. It's one of the most unguarded vocal performances he's ever given, though he did not write the song. Jon Nite, Chase McGill and Jessie Jo Dillon co-wrote "Break Up in the End," in which the protagonist reflects back on a love that has gone, but left him better than before even if it didn't work out.
"Even if I knew you'd be the one that got away / I'd still go back and get you / Even if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake / Oh I'd still make it with you / Over and over, again and again / Even though we break up in the end," Swindell sings in the chorus.
In the video above, Swindell confirms that he draws from his own experience to deliver such raw vocal honesty.
"It's better to have her to think about and miss her than not have ever had a chance to miss her," Swindell reflects. "I think that's the message in the song, is that it's better to have loved than to not have the chance to."
Swindell has not yet released the details for his upcoming album. He is currently embarked on his first-ever full headlining tour. Swindell's Reason to Drink Tour launched on Feb. 15, and it's set to run through April 7, when it wraps up with a concert in Los Angeles. Chris Janson and Lauren Alaina are joining him on the road as support acts on the tour.

Probably my favorite char so far, the coat pattern, fur endings, sharp eyes and overall killer look.
I agree about the look. The sharp straight hair and the spiky fur and the clothes and pose all really work well together.
When forced under pressure through sprayer nozzles liquids emerge as thin elongated sheets with edge instabilities that break up into small aerosols or particles having nearly a thousand fold range in spherical diameters. Owing to gravitational forces and the viscosity of air, the rate of fall to ground can be predicted by Stokes Law and is proportional to the radius of the particles. The rate of fall before a particle hits the ground (or conversely how long a particle remains in air before it falls a given distance) is modified by entrainment in a mobile air mass. Rate of fall of a spray particle will also be influenced by the rate of evaporation of the liquid constituting the aerosol. The longer the aerosol remains in air before falling to ground (or alternatively striking an object above ground) the greater the opportunity to be carried away from its intended target (e.g., crop canopy). In general, all size classes of spray particles are capable of movement off-target, but the smallest particles would move the farthest before depositing on the ground. Drift has been historically considered to be the movement of pesticide residues via air masses during and after application. Post application movement of pesticide residues (i.e., after deposition on plants or soil) via volatilization can be classified as secondary or indirect drift. A comprehensive review of spray drift and its mitigation was published in 2005 (Felsot 2005)1 and is currently the subject of an IUPAC funded project2. A publication based on this project should be available in 2010.
Although drift has a negative connotation because of its usual association with off-target (or out of field) impacts, spray drift within, for example, the canopy during application can increase the potentially bioavailable material on foliage. On the other hand, off-target or out-of-field drift during application may produce a high concentration of residues that potentially have an immediate or acute effect on nontarget organisms.
Highly concentrated agrochemical residues generated during spray application can move (drift) beyond target foliage (or soil when a pre-emergent herbicide or fumigant is used) to nontarget receptors including water, plants and animals. Nontarget receptors may be acutely exposed and therefore face the greatest risk of adverse effects during and immediately after spray application. In addition to movement of agrochemical residues in turbulent air masses downwind of application, residues can also become concentrated in inversions or stable air masses and be transported long distances. Similarly, agrochemicals can volatilize from plant and soil surfaces in comparatively high concentrations for several days after application. These secondary drift residues also pose a hazard to nearby nontarget receptors. Factors affecting spray drift include droplet size, which can be modified by the nozzle type, nozzle spray angle and nozzle spacing, certain formulation adjuvants, wind direction, wind speed, air stability, relative humidity, temperature and height of released spray relative to the crop canopy3,4.
In the US the assessment of spray drift has been studied in detail by the Spray Drift Task Force which was set up in 19905 by 38 agricultural chemical companies to generate data to fulfil US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) spray drift data requirements. This Task Force has developed an evaluation tool to estimate the environmental exposure from spray drift at time of application6. In Europe drift is incorporated into the FOCUS model which predicts the concentration of pesticides in surface water due to run-off, erosion and drift7.
The US Spray Drift Task Force has issued several publications dealing with aerial application12, ground hydraulic application13, airblast application in orchards14 and chemigation15 and their relationship to spray drift. In Germany the Ganzelmeier Tables have been developed using different types of sprayers and nozzles so that applicators can choose equipment that will minimise drift16,17. In the UK a government website is available which allows applicators to examine the drift reduction ratings of many types of equipment18. In the EU there is a move to introduce a “Standardised Procedure for the Inspection of Sprayers in Europe” –SPISE19

Consul General of the Republic of Tajikistan in Novosibirsk pays working visit to ASU - Events - News - Altai State University
On June 6, Consul General of the Republic of Tajikistan in Novosibirsk Zardi Shamsiddin Kurbonzoda visited Altai State University in the framework of his working trip.
During the meeting, the sides discussed the issues of further cooperation between the flagship university of Altai Krai and the Republic of Tajikistan and, above all, with scientific and educational organizations of the country. At present, about 160 Tajik students are studying at ASU, and the main partners of the university are Tajik National University, Russian-Tajik Slavic University (RTSU), and others.
The Consul General confirmed the intention to strengthen and develop cooperation in the field of education between Altai State University and the universities of Tajikistan.
"We continue the pursuit of our goals and plan to increase the number of Tajik students in Altai State University. In the future, we intend to organize the preparation of our postgraduate students and candidates of sciences in Altai State University, conduct academic exchanges, and develop scientific and educational ties. In a word, we will define areas of common interests and develop further cooperation between the universities of Tajikistan and the flagship university of Altai Krai," Zardi Shamsiddin Kurbonzoda noted.
The Consul General of the Republic of Tajikistan in Novosibirsk also wished Tajik students studying at Altai State University to devote as much time as possible to studies and not to waste it in vain.
"Every minute of our life is precious, therefore, appreciate the opportunities that you receive in terms of education, the ability to supplement your knowledge and improve your competence on a daily basis. Do not postpone what you can do today. And read more books, set aside your gadgets, pick up a book by Pushkin, Lermontov or Tolstoy, improve your vocabulary of the Russian language with the help of the classic literature. All this will help you become better and achieve much in life," Zardi Shamsiddin Kurbonzoda appealed to the students.
At the end of the visit to Altai State University the Consul General of the Republic of Tajikistan in Novosibirsk met with the activists from among Tajik students studying at various faculties of Altai State University.

Very like the Explorer, the Rolex Explorer II experienced exploration in your mind. It absolutely was Geared up by using a fourth hand that rotated as soon as each individual 24 hrs and created for speleologists (cave explorers) who frequently had trouble differentiating involving the morning and afternoon or day and evening. Even though the Explorer II was unveiled in the seventies, it didn’t grow to be preferred until eventually the early 1990s. Early versions, the 1655 along with the 1019 had been the sole two watches that utilized hands not employed by some other Rolex design.
– and that is on a daily basis-Date Rolex that attributes the special President bracelet – has actually been discovered around the wrists of luminaries and dignitaries around the globe, including Eisenhower's successors, JFK and LBJ. read extra
One of many signature options of a Rolex watch is the fact that bubble-like date window. It's there to Amplify the date numerals like to the Date-just, GMT, Submariner together with other types. When the date variety appearing in that window or even the magnifying bubble itself are crooked, as well as just a bit off kilter - operate.
For deep sea divers, The ocean Dweller Rolex watch was launched in 1978 and sadly, discontinued in 2008. Portion of the reason to discontinue this Rolex product was Maybe its similarity into the Submariner apart from the steel situation was heavier and it came which has a durable crystal with no Cyclops eye. A helium escape valve was only practical for deep sea divers and Rolex basically named a person design, the Rolex Submariner 2000 Sea Dweller, but later dropped the Submariner 2000 from its title in 1973.
That vendor can kiss his EBay rating superior bye and you simply have earned your a refund. Provide the watch serviced. Be prepared to spend among $a hundred to $300. Much more if you need replacement elements. And here's a little suggestion to consider. For those who deliver your watch into Rolex for manufacturing facility company they will take away and cost you for just about any non-Rolex elements that were stuck in there. They want it 100% pure Rolex and frankly, so should you.
The #10 Cadillac, probably the favorite from the four prototypes still left in competition, has experienced this type of speed all weekend.
All our solutions have Bob’s fulfillment assure: if You're not completely satisfied on receipt, just return the watch in three times and get a complete refund on the payment.
Take into account a pre-owned watch from a reputable jeweler or watchmaker who will give a strong warranty.
The vehicle appears to additional hints have already been squeezed to the wall via the #31 Cadillac DP trying to go all around the surface. This will likely bring out the race's fourth security vehicle.
You would not have to bother with extra taxes getting additional during checkout. The price the thing is is the worth you shell out. Sales tax is simply collected on orders transported to addresses within the Condition of California.
In comparison with the Date, the Datejust features a Significantly wider number of customization alternatives, such as other metals over and above stainless steel, many supplies to the dial, and optional diamonds over the dial and bezel. The Datejust II, which was launched in 2009, has An even bigger circumstance (41mm diameter) than the regular Datejust and In addition it features an updated motion, being only obtainable in steel with white, yellow or rose gold on an Oyster bracelet.[28] In 2016, Rolex launched the Datejust 41, that has the identical 41mm diameter circumstance as being the Datejust II, nonetheless the Datejust 41 has smaller sized indexes and also a thinner bezel in comparison to the Datejust II.[29]
With SEL (strong conclusion url) bracelets Rolex happen to be stamping the aspect number, date code and Rolex crown in the inner Component of the tip backlink and so not seen with no getting rid of the bracelet.
But actual Rolex watches utilize a sapphire-like crystal. Some say it basically feels great like marble. Rip offs are actually seen with affordable plastic crystals or slender glass. So if it seems to be affordable - it most likely is.

should my convertible have marker lights in the front fenders ? I see pics on line with & without them is there a way to find out?
All Lebarons have the marker lights , they are small narrow lights in the fender just above the lower character line in the woodies or in the trim piece on non woodies just ahead of the front wheel. The light I think you are talking about is the cornering light those are installed in the lower fender just below the character line in front of the front wheel. They are activated with the appropriate turn signal to light your way into the turn. Those were options on all LeBarons and were not available on the Town and Country wagons. If you obtain a copy of the original sales literature those will be shown in the optional/standard available equipment list . I tried to scan the list of my copy but this site will not let me post it ...sorry.

“It is an alarmingly long time since I was a student, but I don’t seem to remember it being hard to get a date. This is not because I was a minx, you understand. I wore men’s army boots and two see-through dresses at a time, in the fond belief that duality and opacity were the same thing. Actually, that may explain the date thing …” (more)

You’ll have the ability to pick and choose products that you personally believe in, so make sure that your campaigns center around truly valuable products that consumers will enjoy. You’ll achieve an impressive conversion rate while simultaneously establishing the reliability of your personal brand.
Hi, Nice article. I am not sure about the process though. I can understand, finding a niche. But, when it comes to affiliate programs I get a little lost. Would I be promoting someone else's products? If so, no problem. I know I need to research high end products with gravity, are these products ones in certain stores, or companies, etc.?? If so, do I need to get permissions to be on an affiliate program with that company? Also, if it is products with a company, then how do I offer promotions on their products since they are not mine? Thank you, Nanette Vlahusich
What we’re going to look at is one category here, e-business and e-marketing. When you click on that category, Clickbank automatically sorts the results by popularity. Popularity is basically how many sales that product is getting. As an affiliate, you definitely want to sort the results by gravity. Click on this little dropdown menu and choose Gravity. Gravity is complicated, but it’s basically how many different affiliates are making sales from that product. That’s important for you as an affiliate, because the more different people are making money from that product, that really shows that it’s a proven winner.
We’ve compiled a review list of some of the most useful, informative and resourceful courses and training on the subject available. Enrolling yourself for one or more in 2018 could help you add skills and knowledge to your CV and grow in your career. Most importantly, it will make you future ready.

4. Zero Entitlement – This has been the death of many potentially successful marketers on the internet. Affiliate marketing is no get rich quick scheme — it’s a business that requires dedication, effort and hard work. If you feel entitled to earn money because you placed a few ads or you followed a guide and are expecting instant or guaranteed returns, you will be killed! Failure is just a lesson learnt and a step closer to success.
1. Finding a mentor – When you first get started with affiliate marketing, you need guidance. You will have a million questions to ask and having a mentor really does make a significant difference in terms of starting you off in the best possible way and giving you the correct advice you need to start taking action and build your internet business.
Affiliate marketing is often seen as a quick-win that requires very little effort, but when affiliates and merchants treat it as such they rarely reap the rewards. This course unlocks the secrets to success – divulging how to invest your efforts effectively, to cultivate the best possible return. You’ll learn to recognise and encourage your most profitable campaigns (as an affiliate publisher) and identify and nurture your best-performing affiliates (as a merchant).
Your domain is the address for your website (e.g., www.affilorama.com) so this is the first thing you will need to do when setting up your site. Considering there are millions of websites on the internet, it's possible that the domain name you want may already be taken by someone else. So make sure you have several options in mind. Be sure to read our advice on how to choose a good domain name.
Now as to your comment on traffic it is true, traffic is important. But the truth is, acquiring traffic is easier than converting it. Plus we have many posts dedicated to traffic generation on this blog. Simply check this post, this post or this post. But must importantly, the reason why people struggle with traffic is that they try to promote a sales page or a heavily biased piece of content. Nobody wants to share that, nobody wants to link to that, and as a result you don't get traffic and blame your lack of success on traffic (like you did in your comment above).
That’s all there is to finding Clickbank products that are a good fit for you site. As you can see, the most important thing is to see whether or not it’s something that your audience would like, and then you want to check out the sales page and the product to make sure that it’s legit. See whether or not they offer a lot of affiliate support. Thanks for watching this video. I’ll see you in the next one.

மன்னார் பொது வைத்தியசாலை வைத்தியர்களும் பணிப்பகிஸ்கரிப்பில்-மக்கள் பாதிப்பு..!! (படங்கள்) – Athirady News ;
PYEONGCHANG: Chloe Kim is the California beach girl with the bubblegum smile and bleach-blonde hair who shredded to Olympic snowboarding gold — and became the twinkly-eyed face of the Pyeongchang Games.
The bubbly 17-year-old with Korean parents and a mischievous wit triggered ‘Chloe-mania’ as swooning locals adopted her as one of their own in the absence of a truly transcendent athlete such as retired figure skater Kim Yuna.
With Lady Gaga’s “Paparazzi” playing in her earphones, Kim set a blistering pace in Tuesday’s halfpipe final, storming to gold with a charm and grace that will leave a lasting impression long after the Olympic flame has gone out.
“There are plenty of examples of people who transcend their sport — one big example in Chloe’s own sport: Shaun White — the comparisons between the two are uncanny,” Elizabeth Lindsey, of LA-based marketing agency Wasserman, told AFP.
Tales of how Kim’s biggest fan — her Seoul-based grandmother — boasts about Chloe’s exploits over tea to her fellow church-goers melted hearts.
Proud dad, Jong Jin Kim, went viral after he was spotted waving a hand-made sign which read “Go, Chloe!”
There were also constant reminders that despite her fame and rapidly growing fortune, the American sensation is a typical teenager.
After qualifying, Kim craved ice cream — vanilla Swiss almond, or at a push a mango sorbet. Once the final ended, the munchies struck again.
“I’d really like a burger and some fries,” said Kim, puffing out her cheeks. “Or some Hawaiian pizza.”
“I was tearing up, I wanted to cry,” admitted the four-time X Games champion, who was so good at 13 she might have won gold in Sochi.
Two years under the minimum age requirement then, fate decreed she would get her chance in Pyeongchang, meaning grandma could cheer her on for the first time.
“It’s so good doing it in front of my parents,” said Kim, the first woman to nail back-to-back 1080 degree spins at the Games.
Online reaction to Kim’s success in South Korea was largely positive, some likening her effortless brilliance to Kim Yuna, who won figure skating gold at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.
Others noted Kim would be cramming for college entrance exams had she grown up in Seoul instead of California, while a small minority blasted local media for trying to claim the athlete as “Korean”.
Nike, Toyota, and Visa are among companies that already sponsor Kim, and her marketing appeal is set to explode.
“She was definitely a name going into the Olympics, and now she’s an even bigger one,” said Lindsey.
Kim, whose followers on Instagram and Twitter doubled to 500,000 and 220,000 since the start of the Games, left the Phoenix snowboard park in a daze.
“I’ll probably bawl my eyes out some more but this has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl, so to be able to do it when it mattered feels amazing.” —AFP
Web Desk: In the present times, people constantly glued with their laptops and smartphones which can lead to blurry vision, tired eyes, headaches, neck pain and dry eyes. This discomfort called Computer Vision Syndrome.
If your work demands you to stay glued to screen, then follow 20-20-20 rule. In every 20 minutes, take a 20 seconds break and focus on something at least 20 feet away.
Practice simple eye exercises like eye rolling, repeated blinking and focus on any object placed away from your eyes.
There are computer glasses designed to avoid eye fatigue. Wear them while using digital screen because they can help to filter blue lights coming out from computers, smartphones and tablets.
It is also essential to take measures to prevent glare, shadow and reflection caused by external sources of light, which can also cause eye strain.
NEW DELHI: A prominent leader of India’s opposition Congress party, Shashi Tharoor, on Monday rejected police charges against him for abetment in the suicide of his wife in a case that has led to political mudslinging.
Tharoor’s wife, Sunanda Pushkar, was found dead in a Delhi hotel in January 2014, prompting an investigation by city police. Her death came days after she was involved in a row with a Pakistani woman journalist over Twitter.
On Monday, Delhi police said Pushkar’s death was a case of suicide and brought charges against her husband for abetment and cruelty, a police officer said. The officer declined to be identified in line with service rules.
“I have taken note of the filing of this preposterous charge sheet and intend to contest it vigorously. No one who knew Sunanda believes she would ever have committed suicide, let alone abetment on my part,” Tharoor on Twitter.
“If this is the conclusion arrived at after more than four years of investigation, it does not speak well of the methods or motivations of the Delhi Police.”
Tharoor, a former foreign and human resource development minister in the previous Congress party-led government, married Pushkar in late 2010, the third marriage for both of them.
Under Indian law, a magisterial inquiry is automatic if a woman dies within seven years of marriage. Subramaniam Swamy, a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, went to court demanding a special investigation into Pushkar’s death.
The Congress party said on Monday it stood by Tharoor and accused its rivals of playing politics. —Reuters

There was a time when the band Chicago was alternative. Those who have only heard the saccharine hits of the past three decades might find that difficult to believe but it is true. Though the band’s last performance here some years ago was underwhelming, I recall a time when I saw them at Festival Hall, Melbourne in 1972 and they were almost avant-garde.
I must admit that I had to be restrained from walking out after they performed my favourite song of theirs, ‘Dialogue Parts 1 & 2,’ from the Chicago V album but I am glad I stayed. A forthcoming five-disc live collection contains plenty of tracks from that era (with one from the Australian tour) that will provide plenty of evidence that Chicago was truly a great live band.
Unfortunately, the two key members of the band who sang that song have since died (Terry Kath), pursued a solo career (Peter Cetera) or left (Danny Seraphine et al). However, co-founder Robert Lamm has kept the band name going and, as so often happens in America these days, a living can be made playing ‘heritage’ gigs, festivals and casinos. It must be working well because the band has a full slate of gigs until mid-year, including a season in Las Vegas.
This documentary traces the band’s roots from its humble beginnings through to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2016 but it really should come with an advisory that the film was not only produced by the band but also directed by Peter Pardini, nephew of Lou Pardini, the keyboardist who has been a member since 2009. This has a large bearing on the angle of the documentary and while it does cover the major events in the band’s history some of them are open to interpretation.
Former co-founder and drummer Danny Seraphine, who left the group in 1990, is not happy with the film, which he called ‘revisionist history.’ “The History of Chicago, my ass!” he wrote on Facebook. Seraphine has recently formed a band called California Transit Authority, a tribute band to the earliest period of Chicago’s music. That’s sticking it to his former band members in no uncertain terms!
Formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois, the band took on the name of the Chicago Transit Authority the band and released its first album – a double – in April 1969. It was produced by James William Guercio who had recently produced Blood,Sweat & Tears and convinced CTA to move to Los Angeles. Guercio was to figure prominently in the Chicago story and not always in a good way.
That first album featured a robust re-working of Steve Winwood and Traffic’s ‘I’m A Man’ (a live favourite) and the ballad that became their first chart hit, ‘Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?’ Apart from those songs, the album contained an intriguing mix of all the band’s influences: blues, rock, jazz and even classical. The line-up, which we saw just a few years later in Australia, featured Lamm on keyboards and vocals, Cetera on vocals and bass, Kath on guitar and vocals, Seraphine on drums and a horn section of James Pankow, Lee Loughnane and Walter Parazaider. It was just about the definitive line-up and one that I recall sounded fabulous.
The band worked hard to define its sound, playing at the Whiskey a Go-Go and The Fillmore West becoming friendly with Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix (who claimed that Kath was “better than me”). By the time the second album came around they had shortened the moniker and created the distinctive logo that adorned their albums. Chicago, 1970, was the breakthrough reaching the Top 5 on the album charts and yielding three Top 10 singles: ‘25 or 6 to 4’, ‘Color My World’ and ‘Make Me Smile.’ By 1976 they had released 8 albums and Chicago X gave them the No.1 hit single ‘If You Leave Me Now.’ Eventually, the band would release 24 studio albums (and counting) and six live albums, selling over 100 million and charting 70 singles. That is major success by any standards.
Just like all good rock ‘n’ roll stories success was tempered by reality. Terry Kath, who by 1978 had severe drug and alcohol addictions, died playing Russian Roulette. In 1985, vocalist Peter Cetera left to pursue a solo career after the other band members refused to let him continue to work on his own projects as well as being in the band. James Guercio, who refused to be interviewed for the film, took advantage of a contract apparently gave him 51% of profits with the other 49% split between the six band members. It is a familiar story but one that basically left the band broke after which it was paid out by their record label, convinced that success was in the past. Other members either fell victim to the trappings of success or left.
Apart from record sales the band has received plenty of kudos and awards. In 2014 the Chicago Transit Authority album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame after the band had already won 5 Grammy awards (and been nominated another 14 times). In 2016 Chicago was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and last year Robert Lamm and James Pankow were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
Chicago’s survival saga has enough drama to make this a very interesting film but probably not the whole story.

Ramadan is a month when people fast from dawn to dusk, abstaining from food and drink.Two meals are typically prepared. First, it’s Suhour (opening of the fast), when people eat and drink before dawn. And next, it’s Iftar (breaking of the fast), when people eat and drink at dusk.
In Ramadan, men in most parts of the world, usually tend to relax before Iftar or around Suhour while women are the ones in charge of the menu and the preparing of the food for the whole family. Strangely, this has become a norm, especially in the Middle East and women have naturally embraced their role. Additionally, most food brands fuel this disparity, as they tend to target only mothers and women during Ramadan, sharing what and how to cook.
But if Ramadan meals are enjoyed by everyone, then why is it that only mums and women are usually tasked with preparing them? Ramadan meals are not just a woman’s responsibility.
And that is exactly the perspective that Puck from Arla Foods is bringing to the Middle East region, by encouraging men (husbands and sons) to lend a hand to the everyday chefs – mums and wives – be it through cooking, cutting, cleaning or even setting up the table. Because Puck’s mission of “mealtime joy”, in at least a month-like Ramadan when families are encouraged to get closer together, is fulfilling when the preparation for the meal is shared.
Currently, this idea is being scaled out across markets through male influencers who are lending their women a helping hand and through other online platforms and social channels targeting men.

The US is leader in world gold reserves, the amount of which reaches 8133 tons according to the data disclosed last January. This great amount is kept in several reliable storages around the country.
Until recently, the reserves of yellow metal were kept in the Fort Knox, Kentucky, the United States Mint in Denver, West Point in New York and, of course, in the Federal Reserve bank in Manhattan. However, a new bill has been created, giving the opportunity to more states to become guardians of this precious metal.
According to the newspaper Houston Chronicle, the Senate in the State of Texas has announced the creation of a local storage. The bill was created back in 2013 and adopted unanimously. All legal grounds for the creation of the storage were complied.
The project will be managed by the lawyer Glenn Hegar. The exact location of the storage has not been disclosed yet, but it has been reported that the structure will follow the architectural patterns of the Fort-Knox.
The data by the Texas' Senate shows that the gold reserve counts 5610 gold bars, which cost around 1 billion dollars, as reported by the Senate authority Lois Kolkhorst. The gold was acquired quite a time ago, worth 645 million dollars back then. The price for a 400 ounce gold bar was around 114 973 dollars, consequently, the price of 1 ounce was 287,43 units of the American currency.
This price of 14 years ago differs from the current one of around 1888 dollars. Judging upon this, the Texas gold reserve worth is approximately 2.7 billions of dollars.
At present, the gold belonging to Texas is kept in other regions of the country, mostly in New York. The senate aims at returning Texas' gold in full. This initiative will give the people of Texas and Texan companies the possibility to safely keep yellow metal on the territory of the state, which will lower the dependance on external factors of the market.

Last week, a Game of Thrones prequel series got a pilot order from HBO, but like winter, more prequels are coming. George R.R. Martin took to his blog this week to share some clarifying details on what the new spinoff from Kick-Ass screenwriter Jane Goldman will be about (and how far in the past it’s set), plus updates on the other prequels that are in the works.
We know the pilot from Goldman will feature all new characters and chronicle the dark ages of the Seven Kingdoms, from “horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers.” But just how long ago are we talking? And is there any chance we’ll see some familiar faces – maybe the Children of the Forest? the Night King as a man again? According to Martin, don’t get your hopes up:
This is a prequel, not a sequel. None of the characters or actors from Game of Thrones will appear in the new show. All of the successor shows we’ve been developing have been prequels, as I have mentioned before. This one really puts the PRE in prequel, since it is set not ninety years beforeGame of Thrones (like Dunk & Egg), or a few hundred years, but rather ten thousand years (well, assuming the oral histories of the First Men are accurate, but there are maesters at the Citadel who insist it has only been half that long).
Martin says things are still very early on with the pilot, with no cast, director, locations, or title chosen yet, though he does have an idea for one. “My vote would be The Long Night, which says it all,” Martin says for his ideal title, “but I’d be surprised if that’s where we end up. More likely HBO will want to work the phrase ‘Game of Thrones’ in there somewhere.”
Out of the five writers HBO brought on to develop prequel concepts – Goldman, Max Borenstein, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and Bryan Cogman – the one from the Kingsman: The Golden Circle screenwriter was what that got a pilot order. But Martin reveals that out of those remaining writers, one project was shelved, while three are still actively in the works. “Three more Game of Thrones prequels, set in different periods and featuring different characters and storylines, remain in active development,” he wrote. Martin said at least one of those could get a pilot order, which Deadline suggested last week.
While Game of Thrones is closing out next year with its eighth and final season, Martin’s world will continue on screen. Oh, and he wants you to know Winds of Winter is still his top priority. OK George, we’ll believe it when we see it.
The jury is still out on whether or not Carson Wentz will be this year's league MVP which we have no control over. But we do have control over the FedEx Players of the Year.
Today (Jan. 5), the three finalists for the FedEx Air Player of the Year were announced and along with Carson Wentz, fans can choose to vote for Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith or New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady.
There are also three separate finalists for the FedEx Ground player of the year and those are Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt, Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell and Rams running back Todd Gurley.
The winners will be announced at the NFL Honors Ceremony which airs the night before the Super Bowl (Feb. 3) on NBC.
Wentz finished this year with 33 touchdown passes, the second most in the league despite missing the final three games of the season. The 33 touchdowns are also an Eagles franchise record. Wentz also threw for 3,296 yards and had the NFL's fourth best passer rating at 101.9.

1 Thessalonians 5:18 teaches us to be thankful in all circumstances. Though this may seem impossible at times, it is a prescription for a better life. When we learn to practice gratitude, we experience the life God desires for us.
Ordinary people are far from perfect people. We sin, and at times fail real hard. Our enemy wants us to believe that it is over for us, but it is not. Following Jesus involves growing through our failure so that we might live truly extraordinary lives.
Life is not always an easy journey. Often time's it does not go according to plan. It is in those moments of pain, hurt, and disappointment that we must trust Jesus. It is in those moments that our faith is refined, made stronger, and more real.
We are designed for relationships. Relationships are one of God’s greatest gifts to us. They are also one of life’s greatest pressure points. It doesn’t have to be this way. As we learn to honor God’s great gift, we will experience far less stress.
We live in a broken world and we are a broken people. As a result pain is inevitable. We hurt people and people hurt us. Thankfully God has chosen to forgive us. Because of this, we must choose to forgive others. When we do, we experience Him and His purpose for our lives to the fullest. It begins with a choice.

Observation: John warns against loving this world and the things in it, for that love will draw you away from a relationship with God.
Application: Let’s have some real talk here for a minute. John just spent a chapter and a half telling us to love others in the world around us, and now he tells us not to love the world and the things it offers. Hmmm…
He told us to live in the light, obey God, love as Jesus did. And when you take a quick read through the gospels, you find that Jesus didn’t hate the world, right? He didn’t hide out and avoid it; he sure seemed to enjoy boating and going to weddings and having dinner with friends – all things in this world. So, John, is it time for an intervention? Are you bi-polar or just kind of confused?
When I started untangling this passage, I remembered something a friend told me just a few months after I put my faith in Jesus: “You have to live in this world, but not of this world.”
God created the world we live in – the sun, the sea, the wind, the rain, the forests, the trees, the animals, and the people we call our family, our friends. He infused the world he created with beauty and a perfection that could only come from his artistic touch.
But, through the choices of Adam and Eve, sin entered the world and sin polluted the perfection God created.
“When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam's sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned.” (Romans 5:12)
Since that moment in time, sin has continued to pollute this world with unspeakable violence, terrorism, deception, evil of every kind. Sometimes the evil of this world is televised worldwide, allowing us to believe we’re unified as we change the filter of our social media profile pictures to show support for the latest victims and proclaim that “all lives matter.”
But, sometimes the evil of this world is much more subtle – yet arguably just as dangerous. As John says, the world offers “a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions.” (verse 16)
In everyday life, this looks like our human instincts getting the best of us. It’s convincing ourselves that our lives would be better if only we had this or had finally mastered that. It looks like trusting in ourselves, our own knowledge and skills, rather than trusting in God. It looks like selfish ambition that we attempt to disguise as selfless servanthood. It looks like sin – rarely as clear as the sin of the violent terror that filled our screens all summer, but sin just the same. It’s sin that separates us from our living God, sin that destroys.
We get all twisted in our sin and deceit, convinced that it’ll somehow create a future worth living for. But truthfully, it’s all temporary – what we build, create, and produce here on our own isn’t lasting. The only thing that will last is our relationship with God our Father, creator and sustainer of the universe.
So just like Jesus, we must live in the world. We can’t be a light in this world if we attempt to avoid it and hide out from it. We must clothe ourselves in the confidence of Christ Jesus and let his light shine through us, a beacon of hope in stifling darkness. We can enjoy boat rides and weddings and dinners with friends, doing life with the people God created to surround us with. We can enjoy what God has created while separating ourselves from what we have manufactured. We simply need to keep our eyes focused on Jesus and our hearts knitted to what pleases him. When we do, our reward will be great, far better than anything this world can offer us.
Prayer: God, I pray I can live as light in this world, but not get caught up in the things of this world. I pray you’ll protect me, show me my sin where the world has convinced me it’s acceptable, and allow me to spread your love in this world of darkness. Amen.
Is there any part of this world that you're clinging onto? How can you submit that part of your life to God?

In the first works I made involving forensic facial reconstruction, It was important to me modeling all from scratch. More than to model, I created all textures and illumination in each new work.
With the time, and with the experience, I noticed that some properties of that works repeated constantly.
Because this, I developed a methodology to make the reconstruction faster, both with humans as hominids.
In this post I'll show you how was the reconstruction of a Paranthropus boisei. The work, how ever, it have the help of the archaeologist Dr. Moacir Elias Santos. He took some excellent photos that was the base of the 3D scanning with PPT-GUI.
Using CT-Scans of a Pongo pygmaeus and a Pan troglodytes (chimp) how references, the muscles was modeled.
Because of the morphology, we decided to use a CT-Scan of a chimp how reference to be deformed and match it with the mesh of the P. boisei. We used InVesalius to reconstruct the CT-Scan in a 3D mesh.
Instead of modeling the P. boisei from scratch, I imported the mesh of an Australopithecus afarensis to be deformed and match it with the skin base deformed from a CT-Scan.
The edition of the mesh in Blender Sculpt Mode was done with a digital tablet Bamboo by Wacom (CTL-470). Surprisingly it was not necessary install anyone driver on Ubuntu Linux.

I didn’t know very much about this book before I started reading. I knew that it was a massive graphic novel (592 pages), and that it was a semi-autobiography about teenagers, love, and religion. What drew me to this book was the art. I know nothing at all about art, so feel free to laugh at me if I can’t coherently explain why I like it. The art in this book is simple and cartoonish, but not so cartoonish that it can’t display realistic emotion. I like that it’s black and white and “sketchy” looking. My favorite pictures are the snowy landscapes and the pictures of Craig and Raina together. Yeah . . . that’s the best I can do at describing art. I’m done now.
The story is kind of heartbreaking. It’s about isolation and trying to figure out what to believe. Craig grows up in a strict religious environment. He is bullied at school and abused at home. When he becomes a teenager, he falls in love with a girl named Raina and starts to question his religious beliefs.
The best part of this graphic novel is its honesty. The author doesn’t hide anything from the reader. I couldn’t stop reading this book because it feels so real and so relatable. I worried about the characters and wanted them to find happiness. I was happy when they were happy. The story is quiet, but it’s powerful.
Some of the best scenes are the ones between Craig and his younger brother. For most of the book, they have an adversarial relationship. They would both be less isolated if they got along. They suffer a lot of the same abuse, but like all siblings, they can’t always relate to each other.
I really like Craig and Raina’s teenage romance. It’s a little intense, a little scary, a little sappy. Craig is a strict Christian, and there is a lot of tension between what he wants from the relationship and what his religion allows. Some of his religious beliefs are so rigid that they prevent him from enjoying life. He even gives up art at one point, even though he’s passionate about drawing.

Another awesome element of this book is the blanket motif. Blankets show up over and over throughout the book. Blankets are gifts, playthings, shields, and comfort objects. They are allies in winter and adversaries in summer. There’s even a blanket of snow on the cover. It’s a simple motif, but it adds so much to the story. It ties everything together.

Patient family needs: perception of Iranian intensive care nurses and families of patients admitted to ICUs
2M.Sc. Student, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran
Background and Objectives: In the recent studies about patient family needs in deference society and cultures, a consensus has done about patient family needs definition. Inadequate attention to the needs of patient family causes inappropriate and incoherence care and increases conflict between patient family and caregivers. Attention to the needs of family of patients who are in crisis can lead to increase their sense of trust and support and can help them in getting their decisions in relation to their patient health. The aim of this study was comparison of the perception of nurses and families of patients admitted to the ICUs about the needs of families of patients in ICUs. Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive comparative study which conducted in Kerman University of Medical Sciences. Convenience sampling was used and patient families of patients who admitted to ICUs and nurses who work in ICUs were participated in the study. The Critical Care Family Needs Inventory was used to data gathering. The patient families and nurses' socio- demographic data were gathered as well. Data analyses were done by using SPSS version 18. Descriptive and inferential analyses were used. Results: Totally 105 patient families of ICU patients and 105 ICU nurses were participated in the study. Data analysis showed there were significant differences between patient families and nurses perception of ICU patient family needs (p<0.05). Data analysis according to deferent factors showed that except Comfort factor, the other factors including "Assurance and anxiety reduction", "Information", "Proximity and accessibility" and "Support" were significantly deferent between two groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: Nurses' appropriate perception of ICU patient family needs can lead to adopt the best approach to meet these needs and can help them to provide family based nursing care as well.

"I was in a car accident Christmas of 1996. I had severe pain and my sciatic nerve on my right side was completely debilitating. I went to 17 different chiropractors/massage therapists. My last chiropractor adjusted me and on my drive home my neck popped and my whole back when numb. I almost totaled my vehicle, I had to pull over to the side of the road and call my dad to come get me. Two days later I absolutely could not move. I called Dave from the phone book and he was able to get me in immediately. Within 5 visits I never had sciatic nerve problems, no more migraines and he has drastically reduced my fibromyalgia pain..."
For 15 years I saw a chiropractor "when I needed it" instead of on a regular basis or for "maintenance care". I woke up around 3 or 4 AM with a back that felt like it was going to break until I got up and started moving around. I listened to Dr. Dave's advice and saw him for adjustments on a regular basis. For the first time in about 20 years since my auto accidents, I was able to sleep all through the night. I could even sleep in when I wanted to. Imagine a wife that wakes up feeling good! My husband loves it! Now I am in the area only once a month and cannot have his adjustments regularly, so I am back to waking up in discomfort until I find a way to have more regular adjustments..."
"I have seen many chiropractors over the years and since finding Dr. Dave I have had more significant improvement in my symptoms than ever before. He has the most intuitive and healing methods I have ever experienced. A truly gifted chiropractor! I recently moved to Idaho and still make the trip over periodically for treatment. I am blessed to have him treat me and my whole family.
"When I came to Dr. Montgomery, I have been in terrible pain off and on for over a decade. A drunk driver had plowed into me from the rear and really injured my spine. I had been to 2 other chiropractors before him, and they gave me relief, but my ability to move was slowly declining and I was losing function. I was really scared that I would end up in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.
During my first visit, Dr. Montgomery just laid me down on the chiropractic table and started looking at my spine. Right away, he noticed something that was mentioned when I went to my first visit to my first chiropractor visit over a decade earlier, that showed up on the x-rays (which Dr. Montgomery had yet to see!) He did an adjustment I had not had done before, and OH MY GOSH! I was a new woman!
It took several more weeks of adjusting, but it was like a miracle! I could walk on rough ground again, I could stand on hard surfaces again, I could wear high-heels again!
I rapidly gained function back and had fewer and fewer episodes of debilitating pain. And most importantly, I no longer feared that I would end up in a wheelchair for the rest of my life, because some idiot decided to drive drunk.

“Art inspires me,” says Anderson, who is sponsoring “A Song of Dust” by collage artist Stephanie Hunder in the Hagfors Center for Science, Business, and Religion through the Art & Identity program. “Ever since I got my chemistry degree, I’ve wanted to give something back to Augsburg. I’m very grateful to Augsburg for giving me the opportunity to obtain a degree in science. Now I can return the favor.”
With the support of his employer, Anderson completed his chemistry degree through Augsburg’s Weekend College. It took him about six years while working full-time. He has been a regular donor to the Augsburg Chemistry Alumni Scholarship ever since, and he has also devoted more than 36 years to 3M, where he is now a senior research chemist in the Infection Prevention Division.
The art he chose for Hagfors Center is a 6’ by 12’ piece comprised of five panels, one of which had already been sponsored. Anderson will sponsor two panels, and 3M’s employee matching gift program will cover the remaining two. Stephanie Hunder, gallery director and art professor at Concordia University in St. Paul, uses printmaking and photography to create images of actual objects, such as branches and grasses pressed into paper, that often mimic scientific recording in some ways. Anderson spotted her work while exploring an entire room of art proposed for the Art & Identity campaign.
“What she put on the canvas was partly scientific and partly artistic, so it represented the sciences and the arts at the same time. In fact, it represents what I do now at 3M—chemistry, engineering, biology. It all flows together. It meshes,” says Anderson. “To see art on the walls when you walk around campus is pretty inspiring, at least for me.” The piece will appear with a small recognition plaque in a prominent hallway near the physics area in the Hagfors Center.
The Hagfors Center is slated to open next January. Meanwhile, though he is not yet ready to retire, Anderson is beginning to rediscover his talent for art, using pen and ink, watercolor, and acrylics in occasional projects. “Sometimes I surprise myself,” he says. “I believe it is important to mix art with academics, as well as mixing humanity studies with science.”

A photo shows the very first Masters Tournament in 1934. The inscription on the back reads "First Masters, 1934 - Bobby Jones putts as Horton Smith, the winner, looks on." A stamp on the back reads "Copied by Morgan Fitz Photographers, Inc. Augusta GA."
President Roosevelt was busy trying to prevent an auto strike. German Chancellor Adolf Hitler was working on a plan to increase Germany’s population. Clark Gable attended the Academy Awards dinner, but Katherine Hepburn and Charles Laughton declined to attend.
On the sports pages, Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig were still belting spring training home runs for the New York Yankees.
Robert T. Jones Jr. – Bob to his friends – was making his return to competitive golf. The venue was Augusta National Golf Club, and the setting was the first Augusta National Invitation Tournament.
At 10:35 a.m. on March 22, 1934, Jones struck his tee shot on what is now the 10th hole at Augusta National.
Jones gathered himself and, with playing partner Paul Runyan and their caddies in tow, strode down the fairway.
For Jones, much more was at stake than his return to competition. It was about the club he co-founded, Augusta National, and a tournament, the Masters, that would prove to be his lasting gift to the game.
Jones’ journey from the 11th green at Merion Cricket Club on Sept. 27, 1930 – where he closed out Eugene Homans to win the U.S. Amateur and complete the Grand Slam – to Augusta 3½ years later is an interesting one.
Consider that Jones had not seen Fruitland Nurseries, the site where Augusta National was built, until after his Grand Slam.
Consider that Jones and Clifford Roberts, who shared a vision for a private golf club and an annual tournament that would celebrate Jones and his friends, were trying to raise money for their venture at the height of the Great Depression.
“Most golf courses during the Depression were folding,” said Sid Matthew, an attorney and historian. “What a tremendous challenge it was for them to build. And then to make it popular.”
Jones had been plotting his retirement for some time, but it still came as a shock to the public when he announced it in late 1930. After all, he was only 28.
The pressure of competing in major championship events took a toll on Jones. He was the prohibitive favorite in every event, and he yearned for the day when he could enjoy a game of golf with friends and not be surrounded by thousands of fans.
So he and Roberts set off to build his dream course. But he also had several other projects he was busy with.
Jones went to Hollywood in 1931 and made the highly popular film series How I Play Golf. He also had signed on with sporting goods manufacturer Spalding during this time and, according to Matthew, was partly responsible for such innovations as registering your club specifications and developing a “matched” set of clubs.
Jones went back to California in 1933 to do a follow-up series of instructional films, and he also did quite a bit of writing as an associate editor for The American Golfer, a magazine.
On July 15, 1931, The Augusta Chronicle trumpeted the news that Jones had picked Augusta for his new course.
“Bobby Jones to Build His Ideal Golf Course on Berckmans’ Place” was the large headline that accompanied a story from O.B. Keeler, an Atlanta sportswriter who was Jones’ friend and biographer.
Remarkably, course construction took less than two years. The course opened for limited play in December 1932, and the formal opening was a month later.
The final step was to stage a tournament. Initially, they wanted to bring the U.S. Open to their course, but that didn’t happen for a number of reasons. So Jones and Roberts decided to hold their own annual event.
When Jones stepped to the tee for the first round in 1934, he was still the man to beat. At least he was in the minds of the press and the public.
“It will be a matter of stepping back under heavy pressure for the first time since 1930,” Grantland Rice wrote in a preview of the first tournament for The American Golfer. “No one can say in advance how the nerve strain will affect him, what his mental attitude will be against the keen blades of so many stars, all after his scalp.”
In reality, no one knew what to expect from Jones. He had shot 1-under-par 71 in a practice round, and a few weeks before the tournament he had fired an impressive 65.
Whether Jones would even play was up for debate. According to the club, he wanted to serve as an official and preferred not to play. But the membership prevailed upon him to join the field.
“The final argument that persuaded Bob to agree to play, or so he said, was one I advanced, to the effect that he simply could not invite his golfing friends to play on his course and then decline to play with them,” Roberts wrote in his book, The Story of the Augusta National Golf Club.
Jones drew a crowd – The Chronicle reported that 900 automobiles representing 38 states and Canada passed through the entrance – but he didn’t thrill the gallery with his round of 76. The score left him in the middle of the pack and six shots behind a trio of leaders, including eventual winner Horton Smith.
The culprit, according to Keeler’s account the next day, was Jones’ putting. He required 35 putts, far more than he needed during his prime. His play off the tee and with the longer clubs was fine, according to Keeler.
Jones “smacked a spoon” onto the green at the par-5 fourth (now 13) and two-putted for a birdie. At the 11th (now 2), he “hit a brassie shot like a ruled line to the distant green, seven feet from the pin – and nearly took three putts.”
Short-game woes kept Jones from being a threat. He improved in the second round, shooting 2-over 74, but was eight strokes behind Smith.
Paired with Walter Hagen for the third round, Jones shot even-par 72 but lost the head-to-head battle to Hagen’s 70. The headline in The Chronicle read, “Jones Surrenders Final Chance.”
In the final round, Jones posted another 72 to finish the tournament at 6-over 294, 10 shots behind Smith. The tie for 13th would be his best showing in 12 Masters appearances.
Smith had the banner headline, but the newspapers played up Jones saying he would play in his tournament the next year.
“I think in one word: relieved,” said Matthew, the historian. “Another word: proud. That the debut of his course drew what should have been the expected rave reviews from those who knew the difference between an inspiring golf course and one that was challenging to play.”
“I think Jones was satisfied he had pulled off what he had intended to pull off,” Matthew said. “And then he could go hide for a while.”

茅盾先生说“太容易得到的东西便不是贵重的东西”，这是当代人类价值观的一条自然定律、潜规则，如果没有经过对这种现象进行思考、推敲，从来没有想过这个问题的话，它会很自然地写在人的潜意识中，成为判断事物的一种主观标准。
One of my neighbor’s dogs passed away this morning. He was rushed to the ER in Reno Wednesday night and it turns out he had the same issue that Angelus died from. An “aggressive tumor” on his spleen that ruptured and bled out. The dog loses so much blood into their abdomen and too quickly to replenish. They gave him a blood transfusion and after he stabilized yesterday, they removed his spleen. But he was still critical. I just learned of it last night as they have been at the vet this whole time until they came home for some rest last night.
With Angelus, he had just had his annual physical, was 100% healthy and acting the crazy husky he always was. There was 1 instance of him waking up in the middle of the night with a yelp. It was about 2 weeks before he died. I woke up, looked for any injuries and he was fine. But he seemed off. Not terribly – but off. I took him to the vet and we thought maybe he tweaked his leg in the middle of the night or something because they couldn’t find a single thing wrong with him. I wonder if the tumor had a small tear then.
Later, my vet acknowledged that it could have been that. But 2 weeks for it to fully rupture with him acting normal would be pretty long so unlikely. But I will always wonder. And that I should have delved more into it. But I was in the middle of an office move and was so busy and tired – I figured he was fine. Like he always was. I will never forgive myself for that. Or anything else associated with that stupid office move.
But my vet (who knew Angelus since 8 weeks) said statistically, the dog would have more tumors. And if they make it through the spleen removal, then you have other decisions to make. And if Angelus would have been sick, confined to bed rest after surgeries or chemo or just plain not doing well – he would have hated that. I know that.
With Tucker, the dog next door, he was much younger than Angelus. And I feel so bad for his parents. They have a bit of a situation like I did – Angelus was the healthy 1 and Stormy was the one with health issues we were always worried about. They have an older dog who I know they have been worried about. So the shock that comes with this is what hurts even more.
I remember when they brought him home, after losing their oldest Golden. He was a good friend to Angelus and Storm but he has been an even better one to Smokey. Tucker and his older brother Jameis were Smokey’s first friends after I brought him home. He met them out in the back forest and instantly took to them. He *always* ran up to them as soon as he saw them. He could smell when they were abut to come outside if we were already out and would pull towards their door. Tucker, being a Golden, was a food hound. And he always ran to me first because he knew I had the cookies. But he was a sweet boy who was always just a giant wagging tail.
And the weird thing is the past 2 days Smokey has been pulling towards their house and whining even though they weren’t outside. It’s like he could sense something was wrong. I really never doubt animal senses anymore. They know a lot more than humans in some ways.
Rose Kennedy (NOT my favorite family but she certainly experienced loss) said something that in my opinion is 100% fact…
“It has been said, ‘time heals all wounds.’ I do not agree. The wounds remain. In time, the mind, protecting its sanity, covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens. But it is never gone.”
I know they are very sad today. I remember feeling numb. And sick. And there is simply nothing anyone can say to make you feel better in any way. Time is the only thing that helps. We lose our furry friends way too quickly.
Between our beloved fur-kids that die young, species being hunted to extinction and kids with cancer or other life-ending diseases but then pedophiles, rapists, terrorists and murders walking around hurting/killing others and people like Charles Manson STILL breathing on the government tit, what other proof do you need that life is simply not set up to be fair. Ever.
That seems very fitting. Angelus loved the snow. Even more than he loved chicken. And that was a lot :)
…I lost one of my best friends. He taught me that every day should be fun. That every day should have smiles. Rain, hail, snow (obviously) or shine. And if it doesn’t, you are doing it wrong.
One of my twitter friends, who I finally got to meet at Comic Con last year with his wife, made this video for me. And for Angelus. I put off watching it because I knew I would be a wreck. And while I’m bawling like a baby, I can’t believe how sweet and truly awesome, it is.
When I was at San Diego Comic-Con this July, I was on the look out for some new, interesting Chewbacca art. He’s actually not the easiest character to portray correctly. I was never able to find anything that I loved (well…Chewbacca wise I mean.) On the last day I made it over to the Chuck Jones Gallery….as evidenced by this purchase: http://a99kitten.com/?p=10450
While there, I also bought another piece. It caught my eye as soon as I walked in but I had been so involved in my purchase of Bad Girls that it took me a while to get over to it. It was not Chewbacca, and I typically don’t collect Leia art, but this piece definitely caught my eye:
It is a good sized piece – 36″ x 24″ on canvas. It’s an artist proof (#3 of 10) and extremely cool in real life :) I’m typically not into the modern or art deco look honestly, but the colors of this just grabbed me. I love the various silvers and greys with white and black (I think another reason I will always have a husky.) My color scheme at home is all browns. Deep, rich browns in various tones. So she doesn’t really fit in but it’ll work. I have a HUGE bus stop poster of Jango Fett framed from Attack of the Clones (all blues and silvers) so they will work together. As I was discussing this piece with the gallery rep, I asked if the artist had done any Chewbacca art. He said not that he was aware of but he could contact the artist. I had actually JUST missed him that day. Darn! And it turned out he left the gallery and went over to the Acme Archives booth inside SDCC. Doh!
Anyway, turns out that no, he had not any done Chewbacca art but that he always wanted to if it was the right feel. Chewie is hard because a lot of artists portray him too cartoony or goofy. I like the fierce Chewie. So we discussed him doing a commission just for me! He would have to get OK by LucasFilm once he did the piece but I was pretty excited!
On a conference call to discuss ideas for the piece, the artist (Mike) asked why I loved Chewbacca so much. That’s easy – because he was Han’s best friend. And protector. Who was big and strong and scared most people but he was a marshmallow inside…to his people. Just like Angelus and Storm were for me. Angelus even sounded like Chewbacca when he talked. And Chewie’s sounds were inspired by George Lucas’ malamute Indiana (who looks a lot like Angelus) so it was a perfect mix. Plus we live in Tahoe and the snow and I always called it Hoth when I’d take the buds out in the snow.
Mike loved the story and it turns out he and his wife are big dog lovers. So he appreciated my love of my buds. And how it translated to my love of all things Chewbacca. So I sent him a bunch of pics of the buds as well as my favorites of Chewie so he could get a sense of how I liked them. He obviously would be keeping it in his own style (art deco-ey, modern. See his site linked below) but incorporating the Chewie, Angelus and Storm in the snow.
The finished work arrived (yes, LucasFilm signed off on it!) and I just got it back from the framers. I. Love. It. He captured the expressions of Angelus and Storm perfectly. Like….perfectly. Plus having an original piece of art commissioned just for me is pretty darn nifty. The fact that it incorporates my beloved friends who are no longer with me along with one of my favorite fictional characters brings together 2 things that I have spent a lot of time in my life enjoying.
I look at this all the time and smile. The buds brought me smiles every day while they were with me, so it’s only natural they keep doing it.
Mike Kungl: http://www.mkungl.com/2/index.php There are **easily** a handful that I would love to hang in my house.
It’s been a month since Stormy left me. Hard to believe it’s been a month already really. I still get sad and regularly think, for just that split millisecond, that I hear him moving around.
But when I start to feel sad, I try to remind myself that most people didn’t expect him to make it much past 8 once he was diagnosed with Cushings or past 9 when his 2nd liver tumor (and 2nd surgery) was diagnosed as cancerous. But instead he not only survived those things, he got to go to the beach, play in the snow, have fun, eat freshly made cheeseburger, make and play with friends, and bring everyone who met him smiles every day until he was 11.
When he could no longer stand on his own (late June), I knew our time was limited. I’d help him up and use one of those slings but then he didn’t want that after awhile. But he was still a happy guy every day. He loved to sit on the deck and watch chipmunks and birds. He loved his regular ear rubs, still ahrooed for his breakfast and loved his cheeseburger and cookies. I told him that I wanted him to stay as long as he wanted, but if he started feeling sick or in pain, he had to tell me.
On August 2nd he did tell me. But I do know that he was happy up until then. And I have to remember that is what counts: all of the time that I got to spend with him. I was lucky to have been able to bring my guys to work every day all of their lives, take them to the beach or snow every day, and then work from home and spend the extra time taking care of Storm when he needed it.
I miss my boys. I spent more time with them every day for 12 years than I did anyone else in my life. It’s hard to have that gone. They made me smile every single day. They were the best friends you could ever ask for. If you are lucky enough to have a critter in your life, make sure you hug and love them every day. They deserve it and don’t stay with us long enough.
When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.
All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.
They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.
You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.
It still makes me incredibly sad but at least I can look at his pictures or talk about him with a smile as I remember how much happiness he brought to my life. But today is a little rough. Or rrrruufffff as he would have said…
Felt blah all day even though I got a boatload of work done. And wasn’t even hungry – also very unusual for me.
Then I realized the date. The 25th. I actually spent the day thinking it was 24th until I looked at my calendar. Ah.
I left for a 2.5 hour walk. I had to go to the post office so did that and then continued on to the coastal trail up to the HMB State beach and then back home. That was one of Angelus’ favorite walks because we could hit up the beach a couple times, lots of stuff to sniff, got to see (and bark at) the horses at the horse farm and best of all – no hills!
Doing some backlogged filing today since I’ve been in Tahoe so much lately. Had to make a new file for Shadow’s adoption. Then had to make room in my office filing drawer. Only thing I was able to move was Angelus’ file. Which made me sad all over again. Probably triggered today due to combination of neighbor stopping by today as I was loading Storm in the car to go to the beach and asking where Angelus and then receiving a letter from his insurance company officially cancelling his policy and alerting to me to a credit coming back to me. Yay. I’d give all my money to get him back healthy.
It was 3 months yesterday. I woke up out of sorts and it stuck with me all day. Still very sad. Every day still. But at least I don’t bust out in tears every day anymore. That’s got to be annoying for others.
Storm and I are trying to soldier through. I do think Storm is doing better. He seems like he is used to his new routine, if not his new adopted brother (at. all.)
But this year’s birthday season won’t be quite as festive for me. One of my closest friends won’t be there to celebrate with me.
Tomorrow it will be 2 months since I lost my big guy. I’m still not really any closer to being “over it” or much better.
I still think about him all the time, and think how unfair it is that he is missing out on more Mom time, Tahoe time, beach time. Our new house is on 5 acres which I basically wanted for him and Storm. He would have really loved to patrol his forest. He visited a few times during the remodel and had so much fun there and I was so excited to have the land for them.
I still cry almost every day. Although I don’t just break down and bawl every day or start tearing up when someone asks where he is so maybe that is getting “better”. But I still can’t look through his pictures. I still have his collar and tags in my purse from when we left the vet. It’s supposed to help to talk about it. But I still cry. Writing about it makes me cry a little less.
I still blame myself for not figuring it out. Maybe he did have more tumors or was riddled with cancer and maybe he would have not made it past a month or I would have had some horrible choice to make. But it all happened so quick and never got that far. And I’ll never know. And maybe that was better for him and me. He would have hated to be sick. His life was about having fun. And he would have been miserable sitting around. And having to make a choice regarding euthanasia was truly not something I could have handled. But I can’t stop thinking maybe he could have had his surgery and been OK. And here with us now.
He died from a hemoabdomen. A tumor on his spleen that ruptured and bled out. These tumors are likely due to hemangiosarcoma. According to the doctors and everything I read afterwards, there are no symptoms to watch for until it’s basically too late. All the doctors described it as the dog equivalent of a heart attack. You can be totally fine, no symptoms of anything, playing on the beach and bam. You get weak from the blood loss which is the first sign and unless it gets operated on right then, it’s probably too late.
They told me there was no way I would have ever known unless he got regular ultrasounds on his spleen and no one would ever do that unless their dog has had tumor issues in the past (like Storm has and does get ultrasounds.) His latest physical just 2 months prior showed once again he was perfectly healthy. His heart, ears, eyes, gums, all blood tests = perfect. No one could ever believe was 11 1/2 as he looked and acted so young. Even when they ran blood tests at the ER they were all perfect except that he was anemic due to the blood loss into his abdomen.
Best case scenario was they got in there and got the tumor and spleen out after stabilizing him. Then hope for finding no other tumors while they are in there. Apparently that is highly unlikely.
The ER doc and our regular vet said up to 85% of these cases end up being a super aggressive cancer (hemangiosarcoma) and that he would have 1-3 months at most and most of that recovering from his surgery. But that leaves at least a 15% chance that he would have been OK. Stormy wasn’t supposed to make it after his surgery and he’s here 1 1/2 years later still happily ah-rooing. So why not Angelus?
But they never got him stabilized. He started doing a little better after fluids and a blood transfusion but they said he was losing it too fast. And he just stopped breathing.
I know I am supposed to take some comfort that he did not suffer. Was not in pain. Played and had fun right up to his last few hours. And I am glad of that. He was the best dog in the world who brought so many people smiles and joy. He certainly deserved all the happiness and pain-free life he could have.
I took him to work pretty every day all of his life and there were some people who weren’t too happy with the idea of dogs in the workplace at first. But Angelus won them over. He was such a great ambassador for both his breed and dogs in general. So many people that met him at work (employees, guests, partners, etc.) would comment on how awesome the huskies were. How well behaved, sweet, etc. Everyone he met on walks or at the beach loved him.
Angelus only ever wanted to have fun. He was such a happy dog. But not in that slobbery lab kind of way. He was very chill. But could also be a spaz. His presence in my life was very calming. And I always had so much fun with him. Every day, every walk, all the time. Even when making me take him for a walk in the rain he would make me smile at his desire to sniff and want to see the world. He just wanted to walk and run and play on the beach and meet new buddies and walk and sniff and walk and pee on every tall stalk of grass he could find so every dog knew that Angelus was here.
He was never sick a day in his life which was why this was so sudden and painful. He had surgery for a torn ACL but never, ever sick. He was the one who was always there for me. When my mom died, when I had a miscarriage, when Stormy got sick and we almost lost him, when my little brother died. Angelus was the one always there to get me outside, get me out of my own head. And to just sit right next to me with his head on my feet while I cried.
I miss him staring at me when I wake up in the mornings saying with his eyes “get up!” Or sitting at my feet while I work. Or hanging out in the front yard staring out into the world waiting for his next adventure. Stormy and I still haven’t gone into the yard actually. Stormy is still sad, you can tell. He was with his brother every single day all of his life except the first 7.5 weeks.
He taught me to take every chance to get outside and enjoy it, even if it’s raining but especially if it’s snowing.
I miss him. And his handsome face and happy smile. And his presence. And hugging his big fluffiness.
I tried looking through pictures of Angelus tonight and I still can’t. Not without crying. I miss him so much. His husky smile. And the smiles he brought me every day.
I try not to talk to people about it as people don’t want to deal with upset or sadness that isn’t their own. I understand this. Completely. Me = not emo. So I try and stay busy and make myself stay out of my head. But sometimes it’s just hard. I think it’s hardest when I’m tired. And ever since I lost him I just don’t sleep very well. The first week I took NyQuil every night to knock me out. Me = completely anti-drug. That’s healthy. So after 6 nights I said, that’s enough. Suck it up. Got back on my B12. And a glass of wine in the evening some nights. But I still wake up many, many times during the night. So by evening time, I am simply tired. And then get sometimes get very sad.
People say you get over it. Things get better. Get a new dog. I actually don’t believe any of that. Maybe I’ll cry less. But when people’s kids die, do they just move on? Do they just have another kid to get over it? No.
Mother’s Day is Sunday. I lost my own mom a few years back. Lost my little brother in November 2010 who I was kind of a Mom too after we lost ours. And now Angelus. I don’t have human children. Angelus and Storm were/are my kids. And they got/get more love and attention from me than a lot of people’s human children. I’m a pretty darn good mom (unlike that pathetic psycho loser on the Time mag cover. Gah.)
I’m not sure how you get over this loss. Maybe you just get used to it. But you don’t get over it. You just don’t. I am not a Kennedy fan (fascinating family to read about however) but Rose Kennedy said:
“It has been said, ‘time heals all wounds.’ I do not agree. The wounds remain. In time, the mind, (protecting its sanity), covers them with scar tissue and the pain lessens. But, it is never gone.”

The official website of the "Experience Talks" radio program on KPFK. AIP was brought onboard by the developers at Zumwinkle.com to help produce this dynamic WordPress site, which uses a variety of plugins and custom code to present live streams and recorded audio programs going back over the show's history.
Possibly the most challenging theme job ever undertaken by AIP, the design for the new Al-Jazirah site was based on a RTL (right-to-left) Wordpress theme which needed to be converted to a Drupal theme while retaining all of its bells and whistles (sliding scrollbars, slideshows, etc).
In 2010, ImNotObsessed.com became a first for us - the first site ever migrated by AIP from WordPress to Drupal, and then back to WordPress again.
After 3 years on the Drupal platform, owner/editor Vera Sweeney decided to scale back on advanced community-oriented functionality and move back to a more direct blogging approach. While the community features have been removed and some minor differences do exist, we took pains to retain her custom Drupal Theme when migrating it to the WordPress platform. The resulting site retained the exact same look as its predecessor.
Another happy WordPress-to-Drupal migration, Celebrity Baby Scoop is (you guessed it) the place to go for up-to-the-minute information on celebrity babies, and celebrities who have them.

With the summer months approaching, now would be a great time to review your homeowner’s and personal insurance program. There is a large spike in auto accidents during June through August. We offer a free review to assess your insurance needs, and we can recommend needed personal insurance coverage like a personal umbrella, cyber liability, and flood insurance. Summer Risks Are Very Real.
Watercraft -- Remember, your personal watercraft insurance does not cover racing. In addition, if your boat is over a certain length, you will need a separate boat policy. Remember to have personal floatation devices for all people in the boat, and do not drink and drive your boat. Venture beyond the geographic limits in the policy and the insurance may be nullified.
Travel -- If you are planning a family vacation, make sure you keep your home safe while gone. Use timers on lights, cancel the mail and garbage, and do not post vacation pictures on social media while you are gone.
Swimming -- Never leave a child unattended around water. If your child does not know how to swim, make sure they have a floatation device on at all times.
Bug Bites -- If you are heading outdoors, be prepared for annoying critters. Use EPA-registered insect repellents* that contain at least 20% DEET (products include Cutter Backwoods and Off! Deep Woods) for protection against mosquitoes, ticks, and other bugs. Other repellents protect against mosquitoes, but may not be effective against ticks or other bugs.
Barbecuing -- Never leave a barbecue unattended. Do not barbecue inside or in a garage. If you receive a minor burn, hold the skin under cool running water for up to 15 minutes to reduce swelling or until the pain subsides.
Sunburns -- Always use sunscreen, and if your skin is burned, mix one-part whole milk with one-part cool water and gently apply it into the affected areas with a washcloth.
Heat Stress -- You may be having fun or working in the sun, but if it is hot, keep hydrated by drink plenty of water. Wear lightweight clothing and take breaks every hour or so.
Fire pits -- Fire pits are becoming increasingly popular for outdoor entertaining. While some burn wood, others use propane or natural gas. Keep kids at a safe distance and teach them that fire pits stay hot long after the flames go out.
Remember to always seek medical treatment if the injury warrants it. Alternatives Insurance® Agency was established in St Louis County in the fall of 1992 .

Awww, you're just saying that because you're very protective of yourself as a gun owner. Now, can you imagine how the Muslim who hasn't done anything wrong feels when large groups of non-Muslims unfairly demand he fixes this situation with the extremists? Can you imagine how he feels when these non-Muslims start unfairly attacking his Muslim religion?
When we do this, all we are doing is causing further and further rifts between us and them. Is that really what we want to accomplish?
Must admit I don't know now whether to laugh and cry at the lack of reading comprehension members have shown here.
Beautiful satire by the OP. Half the people in this thread just proved the OP right. LOL. I chalk this phenomenon up to the wonderful mathematical equation. Humans=Hypocrites.
Neformore has an issue with all this and in his/her mind Muslim extremism is only .0125 percent of the 1.5 billion. This person jumped in my case for even suggesting 2% were extremist, so yes if you think 2% are extremist too then you fit Nef's view that it also means ALL Muslims are extremist.
A funny part is a quick search showed that 6% are very extremist and up to 30% have extremist views. Not my numbers, but numbers from their own Muslim groups.
The bottom line is this is a large number of people even at .0125% and people did not develop their negative views because Muslims happened to be Muslim. They developed these views because of the large number of worldwide extremist acts.
Honestly - I don't know if I'm more bothered by the fact that people completely miss the point - or the fact that so many apparently have no sense of humor
sorry but why should other gun owners apologise for the actions of someone else they have nothing do do with?
But do you think all Muslims should apologise for killing some people in France by a small group of extremists?
Now I am no advocate of guns but i don't really see why a gun owner in Texas should be out apologising if a gunman in Alaska kills a couple of people.
I don't know if you are trying to draw a parallel between violent Islamic extremism and guns. I am guessing you are and at the same time trying to point out that people demand that the whole Muslim community gets on their feet every time there is a terrorist attack, yet the same is not expected when someone shoots up a school in Sandy Hook of gun owners. It is a good point. Kind of.
Some might say that when we talk about the Islam we are talking about a identifiable group in our society who can have a direct influence potentially on the actions of these terrorists, they all have a link through their sheared faith. Owning a gun is not like that, gun owners are not connected in any real way other than that they own a gun, which is not quite as profound as sharing a religion.
Additionally I am sure that most gun owners would say that they oppose mass shootings, its just that they do not want their "freedom to bare arms" taken away from them as a result.
This is a thought provoking subject however and I can see what your getting at, why does one group have to come out in their masses and apologise for the actions of a few in their members. Yet the same is not expected of gun owners, but like i said above that comparison does have its problems.
So suppose it could be argued from the other side but I doubt that you are going to get many American gun owners to read as far down as the disclaimer and I doubt that some will understand the deeper meaning of the thread.
Wow a real WTF moment You know its really cool that you read all the way to the bottom. but i think you forgot the topic is talking about gun control not Muslims

“Read any good books lately?” That used to be a common conversation starter among adults of all ages and walks of life. Yet, despite exponential growth in overall publishing and expanded access via the web, reading in general seems to be on the decline.
Ironically, one of the primary causes of this selective illiteracy may be the Internet, itself. Living life with a smartphone permanently attached to one’s palm has proven overwhelming for many, and constant bombardment by hundreds of random posts has significantly diminished our attention span.
As cultural guru, Seth Godin, recently pointed out, best-selling books of the 1950s were often over 500 pages and readers couldn’t get enough. By contrast, some of last year’s best sellers were actually coloring books for adults.
Even so, even in this age of instant entertainment, there’s still something to be said for unplugging a while (at least figuratively) and losing oneself in the words of a master.
With that in mind, here are twelve of the best books I’ve read over the last twelve months, along with publisher’s summaries; enough to keep you busy and curious for the rest of this year (if you don’t rush).
Ruth Jefferson is a delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years’ experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a checkup on a newborn, only to be told that she’s been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don’t want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. But the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene? With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn’t offer easy answers.
One Sunday afternoon in Southern California, Bert Cousins shows up at Franny Keating’s christening party uninvited. Before evening falls, he has kissed Franny’s mother, Beverly—thus setting in motion the dissolution of their marriages and the joining of two families. Spanning five decades, Commonwealth explores how this chance encounter reverberates through the lives of all those involved. Told with equal measures of humor and heartbreak, it is a meditation on inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories; a brilliant and tender tale of the far-reaching ties of love and responsibility that bind us together.
Readers of all ages and walks of life have drawn inspiration and empowerment from Elizabeth Gilbert’s books for years. Now this beloved author digs deep into her own generative process to share her wisdom and unique perspective about creativity. With profound empathy and radiant generosity, she offers potent insights into the mysterious nature of inspiration.
We all sense it―something big is going on. Our lives are being transformed in so many realms all at once―and it is dizzying. In a work unlike anything he has attempted before, Thomas L. Friedman exposes the tectonic movements that are reshaping the world today and explains how to get the most out of them and cushion their worst impacts.
An illuminating debut memoir of a woman in science; a moving portrait of a longtime friendship; and a stunningly fresh look at plants that will forever change how you see the natural world. Acclaimed scientist Hope Jahren has built three laboratories in which she’s studied trees, flowers, seeds, and soil. Her first book is a revelatory treatise on plant life—but it is also so much more. It is a book about work, love, and the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together.
There’s a running joke among radiologists: finding a tumor in a mammogram is akin to finding a snowball in a blizzard. A bit of medical gallows humor, this simile illustrates the difficulties of finding signals (the snowball) against a background of noise (the blizzard). Both humbling and empowering, Snowball in a Blizzard lays bare the inescapable murkiness that permeates the theory and practice of modern medicine to show how, by recognizing rather than denying that uncertainty, we can all make better health decisions.

Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable or to dare greatly. Based on twelve years of pioneering research, Dr. Brené Brown dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and argues that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage. Daring Greatly is a practice and a powerful new vision for letting ourselves be seen.
Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. The payoff is a set of groundbreaking insights about rejecting conformity and improving the status quo.
Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self-confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room. Daniel Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They became one of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, working together so closely that they couldn’t remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. In the process, they may well have changed mankind’s view of its own mind.
The saga of Patty Hearst highlighted a decade in which America seemed to be suffering a collective nervous breakdown. Based on more than a hundred interviews and thousands of previously secret documents, Toobin portrays the lunacy of the half-baked radicals of the SLA and the toxic mix of sex, politics, and violence that swept up Patty Hearst. American Heiress examines the life of a young woman who suffered an unimaginable trauma and then made the stunning decision to join her captors’ crusade. Or did she?
Real estate agents like myself have all sorts of stories to tell – and I’ve already shared several in this blog. Some are amusing. Others are downright frightening. The nature of our business often draws out the most personal feelings and aspirations of our clients; the fear of purchasing something new; the sadness of selling something old.
These aren’t always easy stories to tell because not all of them have a happy ending. But once in a while we witness a little miracle or work a little magic by doing something that only happens on HGTV: Finding the perfect fit for the perfect clients.
I always remember such clients with a smile and sense of satisfaction. After working in real estate for more than fifteen years, these are the stories that help me appreciate this crazy business and fortify me when I’m questioning my own sanity.
Several years ago, I represented a wonderful multi-generational family looking to purchase a new home and began our first appointment by asking for their “wish list.” How many bedrooms and baths did they need? Did they need a backyard? Was a large kitchen or formal dining room important? In what area of San Francisco would they like to live?
The members of this family were perfect buyers and answered every question with ease – since they had discussed a definite plan before even calling me. My final question was the same as always: “Is there anything else we haven’t discussed? Something that would make or break a deal?”
The father responded immediately: “Yes. We have a grand piano in storage and I want a living room large enough for that piano.”
If you know anything about the average size of grand pianos and the average square footage of San Francisco real estate, you know the two rarely fit together well. But I agreed to show them only homes that would have family rooms or living rooms large enough for their piano – and went right to work.
Another thing that only happens on HGTV: Buyers seeing just three homes before making their decision. The reality is that most buyers tour for at least three months and view a minimum of 15 homes. In San Francisco, it’s not uncommon for buyers to spend 4-6 months on their property search due to a lack of supply and high demand for single-family homes.
Weeks passed and I began to wonder if we’d ever find a suitable property. I also wondered if a large living room was really necessary. After all, that piano had been in storage for years. How important could it be?
But finally, after four months of relentless searching, the perfect home was identified. It had everything on their list – including a large living room – with the unexpected bonus of a fireplace. The whole family was delighted and could hardly wait to make an offer, but the father of the family seemed particularly pleased. It wasn’t until after they had actually moved in that I learned the real reason why.
Several days after closing, I stopped their new place to deliver flowers and a basket of goodies from a local bakery. It was a beautiful, warm day and I noticed a few of their windows were open – then suddenly stopped in my tracks. Flowing from the windows of that large living room was some of the most incredible music I had ever heard. The patriarch of the family was playing his coveted piano and this was no casual picking at the keys. This was perfectly interpreted classical music played by a trained pianist.
I stood silently on their stairs as time seemed to stand still and simply listened. Throughout all our time searching for properties together, he had never mentioned his masterful skills. This was clearly a very personal pleasure for him and something he shared only with close friends and family.
And although it may have sometimes seemed like an insignificant factor or nearly insurmountable challenge to me, to him it was the only thing that would make a new house a real home. I had not just provided a place for this family to live; I had been part of granting a wish.
Whether you’re a real estate agent or receptionist or something else, you have “customers” and you never really know what’s in their hearts. You never know everything they’re dealing with, what they really care about or what will make them truly happy. So, sometimes the secret is to simply grant whatever wishes we can and, in doing so, create a little “accidental magic.”
New Year’s Eve always seems to hold special promise for most of us. There’s a sense of anticipation and excitement regarding what the next year might bring. Unfortunately, New Year’s Eve is also one of the most dangerous nights of the year for women; both in the United States and worldwide. The number of calls to domestic abuse hotlines usually increases as the evening progresses, and we’ll never know about all the women who don’t call or don’t reach out to their neighbors or family members due to fear or misplaced embarrassment.
So, as you celebrate with friends, I encourage you to watch what’s happening around you and listen for unusual noises in your neighborhood or apartment building. Do you hear someone crying for help? When you get in an elevator, does the woman next to you have bruises? Does she appear to be purposely covering her face?
If you suspect something, please do something. Do not try to come between a victim and her abuser. Do not attempt to calm a drunken spouse or partner. Call 911.
Most cities are expecting to receive these calls on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Offer that woman in the elevator a chance to use your phone to call for help or help her flag down a cab so she can leave the area immediately.
If you or someone you care about is experiencing abuse – of any kind – you’ll find a number of Resources on our site, including the National Domestic Abuse Hotline (1.800.799.7233) and the Crisis Text Hotline (741741). They’re free, confidential and readily available.
Last December, I sat down to pen this simple blog post, oblivious to the prospect that it could become one of the most read and shared ever (which it did). So, based on its apparent appeal – and the sad fact that still seems to be plenty of homelessness – we’ve decided to share it again. My hope is that it might have a more lasting impact this season and I’d love to hear how you’re helping in the Comments section below. I wish you peace.
I was standing in line at a Walgreen’s in Santa Rosa and the women a few spots ahead of me had a cart filled to the brim with toys and cozy, warm socks – lots and lots of toys and lots and lots of cozy warm socks. If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’ve already guessed I couldn’t help but ask this women about her purchases and if the gifts were all for her family.
“I’m from Trinity County,” she said, “and my husband and I are committed to supporting a soup kitchen that feeds many homeless families in our community. I came to Santa Rosa to have Thanksgiving with my mother and stopped in to pick up her prescription. I was amazed by the incredible sales, so I bought the socks and toys for the people at the soup kitchen.”
The couple behind me had the same reaction I did; which was the same reaction as the person ahead of me and the checkout clerk. We all commented on her generosity.
Our comments caught the attention of the store manager who was walking towards the checkout station and had heard snippets of our conversation. She stopped, turned around and asked the woman about her purchases. Hearing of her donation and commitment, the manager didn’t miss a beat and offered this angel of mercy an additional twenty-percent discount to help support her cause.
This is not an advertisement for Walgreen’s, but I’ve included their name because I was impressed that the store fosters the freedom for managers to issue discounts for worthy causes without having to check it in a manual or get permission from the corporate office.
I will repeat this story often to my friends, co-workers and family members this season and for many seasons to come. We all talk a lot about helping those less fortunate in our communities and many of us donate to charities that help homeless families.
But meeting this woman randomly last weekend was a wake up call for me. Writing checks is easy. Being with men and women during the most challenging times of their lives, when they’re really struggling not just to feed their families and keep their children warm, but to keep their families together, calls for a special kind of person with a selfless soul.
Each homeless person we encounter on the street has their own story, their own history, and it’s unlikely that any of them ever anticipated their current fate. No one plans on being homeless. Homelessness is not in their business plan, nor is it part of their dreams for the future.
The holiday season often takes our thoughts away from shelters and soup kitchens. We’re busy decorating our homes and buying presents for loved ones. We go to cocktail parties and dinners and clink champagne glasses. We rush from one event to another, dressed in warm coats, bright scarves and pull out our gloves when the temperature drops.
This season, I’ll be starting a new tradition; one I learned from a lovely woman I met in a drug store. I’ll look for sales on warm socks and knit caps, fill brown paper bags with non-perishable foods and quietly donate them to a shelter in San Francisco. I invite you to join me.
I may never again see the women who inspired me last weekend. My hope is that telling of her generosity will nudge us all to remember those that need our help. You’ll find a number of worthy organizations in the Resources section of our site.
One of the most respected agents in the San Francisco real estate market, Lee Ann Monfredini is living proof that personal expertise and insightful perspective can provide any client with a measurable, competitive advantage.

The Weight of Architecture Design Service Grant is a program that offers pre-development design assistance to a local nonprofit organization or community group who could benefit from the services of skilled architects.
"How can architecture help solve a challenge your organization faces and help achieve your mission?" This design service grant is intended to provide design assistance to local 501(c)3 non-profit organizations that can benefit from the services of skilled architects and designers and that would not otherwise have the resources to retain such services.
Our team is prepared to meet with selected nonprofits to assess and analyze a challenge identified by their organization. Suggested projects can range in scale from a redesign of a food pantry's storefront or the reorganization of a nonprofit office to the design of a pavilion in a local community park or the renovation of a local halfway house.
We are currently looking for AIA members who want to help get involved with this program. There are different levels of engagement and any level of help is appreciated! Sign-up below:
If you know a nonprofit that might be interested in applying for this design service grant, please help spread the word and send them the grant application, found here!
Education - To raise public awareness about the value of good design in community revitalization and service efforts.
Connection - To establish a dialogue and build connections between the nonprofit community and the local architectural profession in Columbus.
Identify the Challenge - Up to four organizations will be selected to develop project proposals with assistance from a dedicated team of architects and designers. The design process will include a walk-through of the site and a team meeting in order to develop an appropriate understanding of the challenge(s) the organization faces.
Develop a Solution - Beginning in late June 2017, the design teams will begin developing a specific conceptual design for each project based upon the stated goals of the proposals. As part of that process, we will host a Design Charrette in August: a half-day event that will bring together the nonprofit organizations' stakeholders with a skilled group of architects to brainstorm and develop proposed solutions.
Project Execution - The team will develop a final design solution to a schematic design level of completion, including conceptual floor plans, elevations, and renderings (if applicable). Each team will then present and promote their design proposals to the AIA Columbus membership, nonprofit organizations and the public on Tuesday, October 17, 2017 at the Annual Chapter Meeting.

Before there was a/f ratio meters there were mechanics that had years of experience reading spark plug condition as a good indicator of what the combustion chamber temps and conditions were,and while its true that reading spark plugs is an art that needs experience to master,
and that takes time,time you might not want to invest, so technology give you an option that will allow you to get good info far faster, and reading plugs certainly is not able to give the exact info that a a/f ratio gauge and an o2 sensor can give you, if you want to learn a good deal faster and get more exact answers the use of a fuel/air meter can certainly be a huge help, that doesn,t suggest you can ignore reading plugs, but it sure is a recommendation to get a f/a meter and learn how to use it.
the meter I use is no longer made and its not the best available as theres been constant upgrades in the technology, Im reluctant to suggest any brand simply because the technology is advancing and prices dropping as time passes
If you do a little research you will find lots of â€œAir/Fuel Metersâ€ on the market priced in the $100 to $ 400 range. These are â€œnarrow bandâ€ products based on production car Oxygen or Lambda sensors. You will also find products priced at $ 1000 to $ 4000 per channel and even higher. These are wide band products.
* Precise display of ratio on the rich side of â€œstoichiometricâ€, which is where all performance engines run. Usually displays Air /Fuel ratio to the second decimal place.
* Usually has very â€œcoarseâ€ display of ratio on the rich side of â€œstoichiometric. Some units only have 2 LEDs for the entire rich range!
* Usually not temperature compensated, so the same air/fuel condition in the motor will result in an indication on the meter that will vary depending on sensor temperature.
If you are a builder or tuner of performance engines who needs to maximize performance of the engines you work with, then you need to be measuring Air/Fuel ratio with a wide band meter.
If you simply want an indication that you are rich or lean to make sure you are not going to burn the motor up, you can get by with a narrow band meter
An air fuel ratio meter is a type of gauge that is used in cars, boats or any vehicle that has an internal combustion engine. Its job is to detect how much voltage is emitted by the engineâ€™s oxygen sensor, and in so doing, it can gauge the engineâ€™s air-fuel ratio. Air fuel ratio meters are important because they help to ensure that your vehicle is using fuel efficiently, helps your catalytic converter to work optimally and thus cuts down on toxic emissions, and maximizes the engineâ€™s performance in general. Nowadays, there are 2 types of air fuel ratio meters on the market: narrow-band readers, and wide-band readers. Keep reading to find out how the two are different, and their pros and cons.
The narrow band meter has long been the standard in cars, although now itâ€™s becoming a bit antiquated. They are present in your car in a round-shaped housing. Like the other gauges in your car, the mounting usually measures in either 2 1/16 inch diameter or 2 5/8 inch diameter, with 10 to 20 LEDs. Some are available with a needle-style gauge interface. The reliability of the narrow band meter can be negatively affected by increasing gas temperatures, so they have to be used with care.
Wide band meters are newer and more accurate. They can either stand alone or be mounted in round housings also. Unlike the narrow band meters, these have a numeric display, and can display much more sensitive and accurate information. They have a linear output of 0 to 5 V and can function no matter what the temperature of your carâ€™s engine.
If you have an older car that you just need to check on from time to time, especially if you suspect that something might be wrong with the oxygen sensor, then a plain old narrow band reader will probably do just fine. These models are cheaper, and as long as youâ€™re not worried about getting a very sensitive reading, then the narrow band should do just fine.
On the other hand, if itâ€™s your treasured sports car that weâ€™re talking about, or if you need to perform some really sensitive, highly refined maintenance, then you should really spring for the wide band meter. The wide band meter gives you more accurate information, gives you more precise numbers, is reliable no matter the temperature and is easier to read. If you feel that thereâ€™s a lot at stake for the health of your car, then, itâ€™s worth the extra investment in a wide band air fuel ratio meter.
keep in mind an IR temp gun will tend to read the front exhaust ports a bit lower in temperature than the rear cylinders simply because of the increase in cooler air flow surrounding them first while heated air reaches the rear two cylinders, and some internal coolant flow , is routed past those front two cylinders on each bank,and back to the radiator without making the trip thru the whole blocks cooling passages,thus they will tend to be cooler, so its not all that rare for the front two cylinders on each bank to run 20 geg-50 deg cooler, but remember your looking for major differences in cylinder temps. which tend to indicate non firing cylinders, really lean or rich fuel/air ratios or ignition miss fires[/b]
This has been an issue for 40+ years, people tend to use an elephant gun to kill a gnat! The worst thing you can do is use alkali cleaners such as 409/Fantastik, etc... on vinyl or leather, especially vinyl. Every time you use it to get the dirt off, you remove a layer of the vinyl coating, so after a while you get spots that won't clean any more, the reason they won't clean is because you're seeing the backing where the coating is washed away. Use the mildest soap first and work your way up the chain, bear in mind that lighter fluid is better for your leather/vinyl than 409 type cleaners are. When you clean, always follow with a quality treatment to preserve the oils.
Its surprising what a spray bottle with warm water,and just a few drops of dish wash detergent, a warm damp rag,and a soft tooth brush, followed by paper towels will sometimes remove
Vinyl - Polyvinyl chloride - PVC - is thermoplastic. It may be made in a film and bags used for food wrap and micro-waving, or molded in a rigid form in containers. It is made into refrigerator gaskets, used to coat fabric for upholstery and to coat wallpaper for washability, and in making floor tile, horizontal and vertical blinds, countertops, window screens, and other items. It is used in dishwashers for lining the inside and coating the wire racks. It is not affected by most chemicals. It is strong, resists weathering and most chemicals, and may be transparent, as film.
It may have an odor when boxed so needs airing before use. Also may have an odor if not dried thoroughly before storing. Do not use moth repellents with it as they harm it. Do not put on lacquered surfaces as it may stick. It withstands moderate heat but do not expose to too much heat.
Vinyl upholstery fabrics are produced porous to allow perspiration venting and will absorb stains. Wash with mild detergent and water. Use a soft bristle brush for stubborn soil. Rinse and dry. Some household cleaners and solvents remove plasticizers from vinyl, making them brittle. Abrasive cleaners scratch the smooth surface. Sometime letting detergent solution stand on surface and "soak" a few minutes loosens soil."
The newer polyurethanes are far more resistant to stains and to cleaners, but caution should still be used.

Even though we’re about to reach the summer, you don’t need me to tell you that the weather in the UK is all over the place! On the day when you really want to play some football, it’d be just your luck if the weather was horrendous! But, the beauty of football is that are so many ways to play it. If you need your football fix and you don’t know where to turn, read on!
So, you’ve turned up at the pitch and it’s pouring with rain. What do you do? Well, if there’s a leisure centre nearby, they might offer indoor pitches. You can play some five-a-side games indoors and experience a different type of fun on a smaller pitch. The downside to this is that it’s going to cost money, and availability can never be guaranteed. Always try and book in advance to avoid disappointment if the weather seems like it’s going to take a nasty turn.
Of course, if you have access to all-weather pitches, they won’t suffer from the harsh conditions quite as badly. It’s still not a good idea to be playing outside in the pouring rain due to the health problems it can cause. However, once that rain has eased off, your local pitch is going to look like a mud bath, and it won’t be any fun playing on it. All-weather pitches won’t suffer as badly, allowing you to get right back out there.
If you’ve exhausted your options and you’ve got nowhere to turn, it’s time to head home. No, you can’t go outside and play football, but there are great alternatives in any case. What about video games? I’m willing to bet that if you’re a football fan, you’ve got FIFA and Football Manager in your video game cabinet. Why not load them up and satisfy your craving to play football? You could buy FIFA 16 Ultimate Team Game Coins online, craft a squad of great players, and show off your skills in online competition. Games have evolved to the point where they are incredibly realistic these days. You should easily be able to satisfy your craving through this medium. It’s not the real thing, but it’s mighty close.
If you’re not one for video games and there’s no football on the television, why not go back to basics? There are all sorts of football-based card and board games out there. The most notable of these is Subbuteo, which can offer hours and hours of fun for the whole family. Get a basic Subbuteo set, let your imagination wander, and get ready for an afternoon of entertainment! So many football fanatics used to play this game when they were younger, so it’s time for you to see what the fuss is all about!
Follow our tips to keep you occupied when the weather isn’t so good, and it won’t be long before you’re back out there! That’s the beauty of football; it doesn’t require anything but reasonable weather, a patch of grass and a ball. Oh, and friends!

In this article, we will see how worthy are the windshield repair and other auto glass replacement services. The components of a windshield might give some clue to how it is repaired. Two sheets of glass are laminated using a layer of polyvinyl butyrate (PVB) to make a piece. A chip or a crack is the most common problem and it tends to spread over a period. An early repair can save a lot of time and money. The manufacturers’ specification of installing a windshield is nearly impossible to duplicate as well. Therefore, in many cases, replacement is not advisable.
One of the biggest businesses out there is auto glass repair because cracked windshields are extremely common. The windshield on a vehicle is designed to keep passengers and drivers from any debris on the road that could fly up and cause harm. However, when you're traveling around quickly, even just a small rock on the road can end up chipping or fracturing your windshield. The question is, should you repair it or do you need to have the whole thing replaced?
The chip or crack has surfaced and now you have to make a decision to contact an auto glass repair shop to repair the chip or crack or to have the whole windshield replaced. A small chip or crack can continue to get larger over time. This can be due to several circumstances, but the main one is that driving causes stress that will cause the damage to get worse. This is magnified with bumpier roads being driven on. The weather can also cause chips and cracks to enlarge when certain conditions exist. Sadly, the car air conditioning can add to the issue also.
When you first discover a crack or chip is the time to have an auto glass repair shop make the repair. If accomplished quickly, this might make the difference between repair and replacement. Repair versus replacement costs vary widely, but are usually found to be significantly more expensive when replacement is involved. Basically, your insurance company will allow you to have the windshield replaced with a deductible taking place on your part. This would not apply if you don't have collision included in your policy in most states.
Auto glass repair shops can repair smaller chips and cracks with ease. You can also buy auto glass repair products from your local auto parts store or go on the internet to locate these repair kits. This applies to the individual that is comfortable with doing it yourself. If you are not certain the damage can be safely repaired, then err on the side of caution, and let the professionals take care of it.
If repair is out of the equation, just know that the auto glass repair industry is alive and competitive. Shopping around to secure the best prices and service should provide gratifying results. You should realize that repair is not an option if the crack is longer than 3-4 inches or goes from edge to edge and if the chip has penetrated all sections of the piece of glass.
The idea of the story here is that if the damage is not large and does not penetrate the glass fully and if you act fast, you can often times repair the damage instead of having to replace the whole piece. When it comes to auto glass repair, there is a lot more than meets the eye, so if you are not confident, get a pro involved.
We don't spend much time in our lives thinking about one of the most ubiquitous products surrounding us every day: Glass. Glass is everywhere! Look around and you will see it in your home, office, eyeglasses (unless they're plastic), ceramics like toilets and dishes, bottles, light bulbs, tv screens, and of course in your car.
What is Glass? It's a combination of materials, most commonly silicon dioxide (sand), lime, and potash. There are specialty glasses made of other materials but the kind we see all the time, soda-lime glass, is mostly composed of the three materials mentioned above. For an easy-to-understand detailed explanation of glass, visit Wikipedia and type in the search term glass.
The two common types of glass we interact with daily, annealed and tempered, are basically the same products that have undergone different manufacturing treatments to give them individual characteristics. These characteristics are designed to serve certain functions.
Tempered glass is known as safety glass because it shatters into hundreds of tiny blocks, instead of into long sharp-edged, knife-like shards that can inflict terrible wounds. The small blocks of broken tempered glass are much less likely to cut human flesh. Tempered glass is used in the side windows and back glass on cars, as well as in commercial glass, sliding doors, and windows that reach to the floor.
Annealed glass, like in your kitchen window, is used to make windshields. You might wonder how in the world a kitchen window can be used in front of a driver. That's crazy! Yes, that would be crazy, unless the annealed glass was laminated together with a strong piece of plastic and another piece of glass to make a sandwich called laminated safety glass.
When you look through your windshield, you are looking through all three pieces, two of glass and one of plastic. The glass sticks to the plastic when it breaks. No doubt you've seen a shattered windshield and noticed that it hangs together in one big cracked piece. This is what makes the windshield different from your kitchen window.
Tempered glass is very tough and is difficult to break unless it gets punched with a sharp object. You may have seen a tool advertised on TV that's used to escape from a car by breaking the tempered side window. The tool is like a small hammer with a sharp point. Sadly, criminals have also discovered a use for it and keep it in their criminal toolbox. If you've ever suffered a broken window during a car break-in, it was probably done with one of these tools.
When it's manufactured, tempered glass is just like annealed glass. Then it goes through a heating process to "temper" it, making it tough and resilient. The glass is cooled quickly so the outside contracts and forms a compressed outer layer. It puts the whole piece of glass under tremendous stress and that's why it seems to explode when broken. The stress is released so powerfully that the glass breaks into harmless little chunks.
Why isn't tempered glass used in windshields? Many years ago it was used for windshields in some cars. Laminated safety glass just makes a better, safer product for the front of your car because it stays in place, even when broken, and keeps flying debris out of your face. It also helps to keep occupants inside the car.
The glass that we know is an unusual and interesting substance. Other materials can also be classed as glass. You might say that glass is not a substance but a quality or characteristic. A scientist might refer to glass as a state, much like a gas, liquid, or solid. Water makes a good example. Water can be gaseous (steam), liquid, or solid (ice), however it is not seen in a glassy state like liquid rock (lava) or molten metal.
Nature produces glass constantly. People who live in volcanic areas are familiar with obsidian, a glass used by early Americans to shape arrowheads, spear tips, and knives.
Just remember that when you are replacing your auto glass, the material you are looking through has an interesting history and unique characteristics that few other materials can match. Glass has been around for centuries and will endure into the foreseeable future.

To escape reality, Danny and his band of misfit buddies head to the woods for the town’s annual rite-of-passage fishing trip. After a wild party, Danny stumbles upon Goddess Camp, the urban legend of “skinny-dipping chicks” that so many horny high-school boys have fantasized about for years.

China prepares to enter vaccine-making market [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive]
China's vaccine makers are gearing up over the next few years to push exports in a move that should lower costs of lifesaving immunizations for the world's poor and provide major new competition for the big Western pharmaceutical companies.
However, it may take some time before some parts of the world are ready to embrace Chinese products when safety is as sensitive an issue as it is with vaccines -- especially given the food, drug and other scandals the country has seen.
Still, China's entry into this market will be a "game changer," said Nina Schwalbe, head of policy at the GAVI Alliance, which buys vaccines for 50 million children a year worldwide.
China's vaccine-making prowess captured world attention in 2009 when one of its companies developed the first effective vaccine against swine flu -- in just 87 days -- as the new virus swept the globe. In the past, new vaccine developments had usually been won by the U.S. and Europe.
Then, this past March the World Health Organization announced that China's drug-safety authority meets international standards for vaccine regulation. It opened the doors for Chinese vaccines to be submitted for WHO approval so they can be bought by U.N. agencies and the GAVI Alliance.
"China is a vaccine-producing power" with more than 30 companies that have an annual production capacity of nearly 1 billion doses -- the largest in the world, the country's State Food and Drug Administration said.
But more needs to be done to build confidence in Chinese vaccines overseas, said Helen Yang of Sinovac, the Chinese biotech firm that rapidly developed the swine-flu vaccine. "We think the main obstacle is that we have the name of 'made in China' still."
China's food- and drug-safety record in recent years hardly inspires confidence: In 2007, Chinese cough syrup killed 93 people in Central America; one year later, contaminated blood thinner led to dozens of deaths in the United States while tainted milk powder poisoned hundreds of thousands of Chinese babies and killed six.
The government has since imposed more regulations, stricter inspections and heavier punishments for violators. Perhaps because of that, regulators crack down on counterfeit and substandard drugmaking.
While welcoming WHO's approval of China's drug-safety authority, one expert said it takes more than a regulatory agency to keep drugmakers from cutting corners or producing fakes.
"In the U.S., we have supporting institutions such as the market economy, democracy, media monitoring, civil society, as well as a well-developed business-ethics code, but these are all still pretty much absent in China," said Yanzhong Huang, a China health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. "For China, the challenge is much greater in building a strong, robust regulative capacity."
Last year, a Chinese newspaper report linked improperly stored vaccines to four children's deaths in northern Shanxi province, raising nationwide concern. The Health Ministry said the vaccines did not cause the deaths, but some remained skeptical.
Chinese researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year that a pandemic flu vaccine given to 90 million people in 2009 was safe.
WHO's medical officer for immunization, Dr. Yvan Hutin, said WHO's approval of the Chinese drug regulatory agency is not "a blank check." Each vaccine will be evaluated rigorously, with WHO and Chinese inspectors given access to vaccine plants on top of other safety checks, he said.
Vaccines have historically been a touchy subject in the Western world, rife with safety concerns and conspiracy theories. Worries about vaccine safety resurfaced in the late 1990s triggered by debate over a claimed association between the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella and autism. The claim was later discredited.
Vaccines also are a significant part of a $300 million partnership with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the development of new health and farming products for poor countries.
China's entry into this field is important because one child dies every 20 seconds from vaccine-preventable diseases each year. UNICEF, the children's agency and the world's biggest buyer of vaccines, has been in talks with Chinese companies, said its supply director Shanelle Hall. The fund provides vaccines to nearly 60 percent of the world's children, and last year spent about $757 million.
Worldwide, vaccine sales last year grew 14 percent to $25.3 billion, according to health-care market research firm Kalorama Information, as drugmakers, which face intensifying competition from generic drugs, now see vaccines as key areas of growth, particularly in Latin America, China and India.
China's vaccine makers, some of whom already export in small amounts, are confident they will soon become big players in the field.
"I personally predict that in the next five to 10 years, China will become a very important vaccine-manufacture base in the world," said Wu Yonglin, vice president of the state-owned China National Biotec Group.
The entry of Chinese companies is expected to further pressure Western pharmaceutical companies to lower prices. Earlier this year, UNICEF's move to publicize what drugmakers charge it for vaccines showed that Western drugmakers often charged the agency double what companies in India and Indonesia do.

Romney outlines plans for illegal immigration [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive]
Backing off the harsh rhetoric of the Republican primaries, Mitt Romney pledged Thursday to address illegal immigration "in a civil but resolute manner."
He outlined plans to overhaul the green-card system for immigrants with families and to end immigration caps for their spouses and minor children.
In a speech before Hispanic leaders, Romney made only passing mention of his promise to complete a 2,000-mile border fence to help stem illegal immigration. Instead he attacked President Barack Obama's new plan to ease deportation rules for some illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children as little more than a "stopgap measure."
"As president, I won't settle for a stop-gap measure. I will work with Republicans and Democrats to find a long-term solution," Romney told the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. "I will prioritize measures that strengthen legal immigration and make it easier. And I will address the problem of illegal immigration in a civil but resolute manner. We may not always agree, but when I make a promise to you, I will keep it."
Obama will speak to the same group today. The speeches come as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to render judgment on a get-tough Arizona law and after Obama announced his revised deportation plan.
Romney again refused to say whether he would reverse Obama's policy, promising his "own long-term solution that will replace and supersede the president's temporary measure."
The former Massachusetts governor has struggled in recent days to clarify his immigration policy as he pivots from the sharp tone that defined the months-long GOP primary to a general-election audience in which Latinos will play a critical role.
During the primaries, Romney and his Republican opponents focused on border security and English as the official language, but the former Massachusetts governor didn't spell out precisely what he would do to address the nation's immigration problem.
On Thursday, as he filled in a few blanks, Romney devoted only one sentence in a 17-minute speech to the border fence and ignored language issues altogether. He did note, however, his father's birth to American parents living in a Mormon colony in Mexico.
"When he was 5, they left everything behind and started over in the United States," Romney said. "I've spoken often about how proud I am of my father."
At least one in six Americans is of Hispanic descent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and many lean toward the Democrats. By softening his tone on immigration, Romney is looking to narrow the advantage Obama has with this constituency.
The stakes are high not only for states with larger Hispanic populations such as Florida, Nevada and Colorado, but for other battlegrounds -- Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia among them -- where even a modest shift among Latino voters could be significant.
Romney was vague in some areas, particularly the treatment of immigrant children brought to the country illegally by their parents, but offered new details in others.
His plan to reallocate green cards for immigrants with families and end caps for spouses and minor children would mark a change from the current system, which is something of a first-come, first- served system. And his pledge to "staple a green card to your diploma" for immigrants who earned advanced degrees in the United States represents a significant change from current law.
It is unclear how many of Romney's promises on immigration reform, such as granting green cards to high-tech graduates, could be accomplished without congressional action.
Obama has used presidential authority twice since 2011 to make changes to immigration enforcement, including last week's announcement that many young illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children would be exempted for deportation and granted work permits for two years.
The president's re-election campaign blasted Romney for ignoring his previously stated opposition to the Dream Act, a measure that would have allowed some children of illegal immigrants to stay in the country legally.
"In front of an audience of Republican primary voters, he called the Dream Act a 'handout' and promised to veto it," Obama spokeswoman Lis Smith said.

On December 13th-14th, 2017 Kyiv hosted conference “Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals-2018. Anticipations and Expectations”. The event was held with the support of key industry associations – AIPM Ukraine, European Business Association, APRAD, APAU and AMOMD.
The event was organized by Legal Alliance Company, which unites experts in the field of pharmaceutical law.
Conference “Health and Pharmaceuticals-2018. Anticipations and Expectations” in the opinion of numerous market participants has become one of the most large-scale events of 2017. More than 250 representatives of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries took part in it. It was attended by heads of leading pharmaceutical companies, representatives of the regulatory authority, public healthcare institutions, the public, and the professional press.
The event was focused on forecasts of development and functioning of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, which the actors of the relevant markets should understand in order to enter the new business season confidently. The main agenda issues were medical reform in Ukraine, procurement of medicines, the National List of Essential Medicines, as well as ensuring competition in the pharmaceutical market.
The first session of the conference was devoted to the medical reform. The session was attended by representatives of various ranks of the national healthcare system. Iryna Sysoenko, Deputy Head of the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on Public Health, Tetiana Dumenko, Director of the State Expert Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, Oleksandr Zhyhinas, Project Manager of Health Care Reform Office of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, Yaroslava Avgustinovich, Chief Physician, Communal Establishment of Vasilkivskyi District Council “Vasylkivsky District Center for Primary Health Care”, Alexey Babich, CEO, Chief Physician of medical laboratories “DILA”, Olga Lyos, Head of Glevakha Outpatient Clinic of General Practice of Family Medicine, General Practitioner. Dmytro Aleshko, Partner at Legal Alliance, and Maryna Buchma, Government Affair Director, Teva Ukraine, acted as moderators of the event.
As expected, the health system reform has become the most discussed topic of the event. The participants of the conference voted to support the need to change the model for financing the healthcare industry and spoke about the existing problems of the modern system. Dmytro Aleshko, commenting on his expectations from the conference and the results achieved during the fruitful discussion, said, “In my opinion, one of the most important messages received from representatives of state bodies present at this event is an understanding of the need and, importantly, the willingness to work to strengthen public-private partnership. Improved investment attractiveness of Ukraine will provide patients with access to better the quality of medical services. Medical reform is another impetus to the actualization of this issue.”
The session “International Procurement: The Way to 2018” brought together representatives of manufacturing companies, distributors and the pharmaceutical community, as well as Crown Agents, UNDP and UNICEF, international organizations that procure medicines and medical products for Ukraine. The session was moderated by Vitaliy Gordienko, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Association of Manufacturers of Innovative Medicines “APRAD”, and Helena Studzinskaya, Specialty Care Business Unit Head, Delta Medical. Oleg Gudym, Head of the Legal Department, Delta Medical, Volodymyr Redko, Executive Director of the Association of Pharmaceutical Research and Development APRaD, Tetiana Korotchenko, Crown Agents Representative Ukraine, Zafar Yuldashev, Programme Specialist, United Nations Development Programme, Anatolii Trukhanov, Tender Manager, Teva Ukraine participated in the discussion as well.
During the session the results of the work of international organizations in Ukraine with regard to the procurement of medicines and medical products were discussed. Also the questions about changing approaches to the formation of the nomenclature for procurement, optimizing the delivery of drugs and medical products for patients in Ukraine, as well as other aspects that could make international procurement more effective, including the possibility of introducing international experience in Ukraine on long-term contracts were raised.
At the session the reforming of public procurement was discussed, in particular, the prospects and terms of establishing a centralized procurement agency based on the experience of foreign countries and of specialized international organizations that have been procuring medicines and medical products under contracts with the Ministry of Health of Ukraine since 2016. Participants noted some delay in reforming this area and discussed the readiness of international organizations to extend cooperation with the Ministry of Health after March 31st, 2019 in the event that by that time the centralized procurement organization will not become fully operational.
In addition, the conference participants agreed that one of the tasks for 2018 is the introduction of a procedure for negotiations between customers and bidders, which, as experience of other countries shows, will allow reducing prices for drugs, and, accordingly, procuring more drugs needed for patients.
Transition of Ukraine to the model of the National List of Essential Medicines, which has been a topical issue for the whole 2017, is closely related to the issue of providing the population with drugs for budgetary funds. These issues were discussed at the third session of the conference moderated by Volodymyr Ihnatov, Executive Director of the Association of Representatives of International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers AIPM Ukraine, Head of the Representative Office of IPSEN Pharma in Ukraine and Moldova, and Nataliia Serhiienko, Executive Director of the Healthcare Committee, European Business Association. Roman Ilyk, Deputy Minister of Health of Ukraine, Taras Lyaskovskyy, Head of Department of Pharmaceutical Activity and Pharmaceutical Products Quality, Elena Matveeva, Director of Pharmacovigilance Department of State Expert Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, Deputy Head of the Expert Committee on the selection and use of Essential Medicines, Dmytro Aleshko, Partner of Legal Alliance Company, Juanita Folmsbee, Chief of Party, USAID/SAFEMED, Oksana Lebega, Senior Technical Adviser on Governance and Health Police, USAID/SAFEMED, acted as experts at the event.
In addition, within the framework of the session, a conference call with Hector Castro, Senior Technical Director, USAID/SAFEMED, was held, during which Mr. Castro spoke about the world experience in applying the Health Technology Assessment, approaches to price regulation and reimbursement. Experts who spoke at the event agreed that there is already an understanding of the need for change in the professional environment, and this enables a further constructive dialogue between the state and the business environment.
At the conference, the session “Ensuring Competition in the Pharmaceutical Market: on the Verge of Change” was held. The session was attended by Svitlana Panaiotidi, State Commissioner of the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine, and Olena Shevchuk, the Head of the Committee’s Sixth Directorate for Research and Investigations. It was devoted to the latest Committee’s practice in the pharmaceutical sector, as well as to discussion of challenges faced by drug manufacturers and pharmacy chains. Natalia Olbert-Sinko, Director of Be—it Health&Social Impact, and Andrii Gorbatenko, Associated Partner and Head of the Competition Law Practice at Legal Alliance Company, AIPM Ukraine representative in the public council at the Committee moderated the session. “The decisions made by the Antimonopoly Committee regarding pharmaceutical companies demonstrate the urgent need for more precise criteria and methods for assessing the market participants’ behavior for compliance with the requirements of competition law. In the absence of such, the most effective way to minimize risks is to obtain the Committee’s recommendations in each case” – commented Andrii Gorbatenko.
Traditionally, the last session of the first plenary day of the conference was devoted to the forecasts of the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry development in Ukraine from the top managers of the pharmaceutical business. Ilya Kostin, Attorney-at-Law and Partner at Legal Alliance Company, and Krzysztof Siedlecki, Patent Attorney and well-known expert of the pharmaceutical market, moderated the session. Sergey Ishchenko, Director of Proxima Research, Artem Matveev, Director of Sales and Marketing, ALKALOID, Georgiy Viktorov, General Manager, Abbott Laboratories GmbH, Head of the Health Committee, European Business Association, Tatiana Pechayeva, Director General, Group of pharmaceutical companies “Lekhim”, Pavlo Kharchyk, President, AMOMD.
According to Ilya Kostin, representatives of the pharmaceutical market representing various segments of it – domestic producers, foreign manufacturers-originators, foreign generic companies, as well as representatives of operators of the medical products market were invited to participate in this session. “While the companies are different, the problems that concern them were very similar,” comments Ilya Kostin. “The main risks for business development, according to experts of the session, lie in the activities of the state and the enlargement of pharmacy chains, which are already beginning to play a dangerous anticompetitive role.” Sergii Ishchenko, who provided an overview of the main market indicators, noted the positive dynamics of financial resources for 2018, which will give an opportunity to increase sales to 20%. The operators of the medical products market also spoke very optimistically about the prospects for the coming year. In particular, Pavlo Harchik noted an increase in medical products sales and a tendency for production localization.
The second day of the conference, December 14th, was devoted to workshops from the leading legal experts of the pharmaceutical industry. Some of the most important practical topics that were discussed were the following: competition in the pharmaceutical market, business protection, procurement in PROZORRO electronic system, the practice of appealing to the Antimonopoly Committee, filling an application for the National List, as well as Digital Promotion of medicines and management of intellectual property objects. Commenting on the workshop on procurement in PROZORRO electronic system, Olexander Bondar, Senior Associate at Legal Alliance Company, noted, “Appealing the procurement to the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine is a legal mechanism for the timely protection of violated rights and legitimate interests of the procurement participant. Such a protection mechanism has a number of advantages over appeal to the court, including shorter terms of appeal to the Committee. However, given that there are no clear legislative conditions or explanations of authorized bodies on a number of issues, the success of the appeal procedure largely depends on the participants’ knowledge of Committee’s practices and approaches.”
At the workshop “The National List. Filling in the Application” Oksana Lebega, Senior Technical Adviser of the USAID-SAFEmed Project, spoke about the nuances in preparing the application for inclusion of a drug in the National List of Essential Medicines. According to the expert, all the applicants prepare their applications for the first time and, of course, a lot of questions arise. The USAID-SAFEmed project will continue its series of seminars on this topic. One of the final workshops of the second day was one by Oleksii Bezhevets, Partner at Legal Alliance Company, and Lydia Sanzgarovskaya, Senior Associate, dedicated to the issues of Digital Promotion of medicines. “The Internet gives us tremendous opportunities for drug promotion and business development. Internet applications are more flexible and provide an opportunity to reach target audiences, – Oleksii Bezhevets commented. The scope of this activity, if correctly defined from the legal point of view, gives a qualitative result. We shared our knowledge and experience with colleagues from pharma, there was an active discussion and everyone liked it.”

Have you registered? Seriously, you must register in order to log in. Have you been banned from the board? (A message will be displayed if you have.) If so, you should contact the webmaster or board administrator to find out why. If you have registered and are not banned and you still cannot log in then check and double-check your username and password. Usually this is the problem; if not, contact the board administrator -- they may have incorrect configuration settings for the board.
You may not have to -- it is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order to post messages. However, registration will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such as definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing to fellow users, usergroup subscription, etc. It only takes a few minutes to register so it is recommended you do so.
If you do not check the Log me in automatically box when you log in, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc.
In your profile you will find an option Hide your online status; if you switch this on you'll only appear to board administrators or to yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.
Don't panic! While your password cannot be retrieved it can be reset. To do this go to the login page and click I've forgotten my password. Follow the instructions and you should be back online in no time.
First check that you are entering the correct username and password. If they are okay then one of two things may have happened: if COPPA support is enabled and you clicked the I am under 13 years old link while registering then you will have to follow the instructions you received. If this is not the case then maybe your account need activating. Some boards will require all new registrations be activated, either by yourself or by the administrator before you can log on. When you registered it would have told you whether activation was required. If you were sent an email then follow the instructions; if you did not receive the email then check that your email address is valid. One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the email address you used is valid then try contacting the board administrator.
The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.
All your settings (if you are registered) are stored in the database. To alter them click the Profile link (generally shown at the top of pages but this may not be the case). This will allow you to change all your settings.
The times are almost certainly correct; however, what you may be seeing are times displayed in a timezone different from the one you are in. If this is the case, you should change your profile setting for the timezone to match your particular area, e.g. London, Paris, New York, Sydney, etc. Please note that changing the timezone, like most settings, can only be done by registered users. So if you are not registered, this is a good time to do so, if you pardon the pun!
If you are sure you have set the timezone correctly and the time is still different, the most likely answer is daylight savings time (or summer time as it is known in the UK and other places). The board is not designed to handle the changeovers between standard and daylight time so during summer months the time may be an hour different from the real local time.
The most likely reasons for this are either the administrator did not install your language or someone has not translated this board into your language. Try asking the board administrator if they can install the language pack you need or if it does not exist, please feel free to create a new translation. More information can be found at the phpBB Group website (see link at bottom of pages)
There may be two images below a username when viewing posts. The first is an image associated with your rank; generally these take the form of stars or blocks indicating how many posts you have made or your status on the forums. Below this may be a larger image known as an avatar; this is generally unique or personal to each user. It is up to the board administrator to enable avatars and they have a choice over the way in which avatars can be made available. If you are unable to use avatars then this is the decision of the board admin and you should ask them their reasons (we're sure they'll be good!)
In general you cannot directly change the wording of any rank (ranks appear below your username in topics and on your profile depending on the style used). Most boards use ranks to indicate the number of posts you have made and to identify certain users. For example, moderators and administrators may have a special rank. Please do not abuse the board by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank -- you will probably find the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post count.
Sorry, but only registered users can send email to people via the built-in email form (if the admin has enabled this feature). This is to prevent malicious use of the email system by anonymous users.
Easy -- click the relevant button on either the forum or topic screens. You may need to register before you can post a message. The facilities available to you are listed at the bottom of the forum and topic screens (the You can post new topics, You can vote in polls, etc. list)
Unless you are the board admin or forum moderator you can only edit or delete your own posts. You can edit a post (sometimes for only a limited time after it was made) by clicking the edit button for the relevant post. If someone has already replied to the post, you will find a small piece of text output below the post when you return to the topic that lists the number of times you edited it. This will only appear if no one has replied; it also will not appear if moderators or administrators edit the post (they should leave a message saying what they altered and why). Please note that normal users cannot delete a post once someone has replied.
To add a signature to a post you must first create one; this is done via your profile. Once created you can check the Add Signature box on the posting form to add your signature. You can also add a signature by default to all your posts by checking the appropriate radio box in your profile. You can still prevent a signature being added to individual posts by un-checking the add signature box on the posting form.
Creating a poll is easy -- when you post a new topic (or edit the first post of a topic, if you have permission) you should see a Add Poll form below the main posting box. If you cannot see this then you probably do not have rights to create polls. You should enter a title for the poll and then at least two options -- to set an option type in the poll question and click the Add option button. You can also set a time limit for the poll, 0 being an infinite amount. There will be a limit to the number of options you can list, which is set by the board administrator
As with posts, polls can only be edited by the original poster, a moderator, or board administrator. To edit a poll, click the first post in the topic, which always has the poll associated with it. If no one has cast a vote then users can delete the poll or edit any poll option. However, if people have already placed votes only moderators or administrators can edit or delete it; this is to prevent people rigging polls by changing options mid-way through a poll
Some forums may be limited to certain users or groups. To view, read, post, etc. you may need special authorization which only the forum moderator and board administrator can grant, so you should contact them.
Only registered users can vote in polls so as to prevent spoofing of results. If you have registered and still cannot vote then you probably do not have appropriate access rights.
BBCode is a special implementation of HTML. Whether you can use BBCode is determined by the administrator. You can also disable it on a per post basis from the posting form. BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML: tags are enclosed in square braces [ and ] rather than < and > and it offers greater control over what and how something is displayed. For more information on BBCode see the guide which can be accessed from the posting page.
That depends on whether the administrator allows you to; they have complete control over it. If you are allowed to use it, you will probably find only certain tags work. This is a safety feature to prevent people from abusing the board by using tags which may destroy the layout or cause other problems. If HTML is enabled you can disable it on a per post basis from the posting form.
Smileys, or Emoticons, are small graphical images which can be used to express some feeling using a short code, e.g. :) means happy, :( means sad. The full list of emoticons can be seen via the posting form. Try not to overuse smileys, though, as they can quickly render a post unreadable and a moderator may decide to edit them out or remove the post altogether.
Images can indeed be shown in your posts. However, there is no facility at present for uploading images directly to this board. Therefore you must link to an image stored on a publicly accessible web server, e.g. http://www.some-unknown-place.net/my-picture.gif. You cannot link to pictures stored on your own PC (unless it is a publicly accessible server) nor to images stored behind authentication mechanisms such as Hotmail or Yahoo mailboxes, password-protected sites, etc. To display the image use either the BBCode [img] tag or appropriate HTML (if allowed).
Announcements often contain important information and you should read them as soon as possible. Announcements appear at the top of every page in the forum to which they are posted. Whether or not you can post an announcement depends on the permissions required, which are set by the administrator.
Sticky topics appear below any announcements in viewforum and only on the first page. They are often quite important so you should read them where possible. As with announcements the board administrator determines what permissions are required to post sticky topics in each forum.
Locked topics are set this way by either the forum moderator or board administrator. You cannot reply to locked topics and any poll contained inside is automatically ended. Topics may be locked for many reasons.
Administrators are people assigned the highest level of control over the entire board. These people can control all facets of board operation which include setting permissions, banning users, creating usergroups or moderators, etc. They also have full moderator capabilities in all the forums.
Moderators are individuals (or groups of individuals) whose job it is to look after the running of the forums from day to day. They have the power to edit or delete posts and lock, unlock, move, delete and split topics in the forum they moderate. Generally moderators are there to prevent people going off-topic or posting abusive or offensive material.
Usergroups are a way in which board administrators can group users. Each user can belong to several groups (this differs from most other boards) and each group can be assigned individual access rights. This makes it easy for administrators to set up several users as moderators of a forum, or to give them access to a private forum, etc.
To join a usergroup click the usergroup link on the page header (dependent on template design) and you can then view all usergroups. Not all groups are open access -- some are closed and some may even have hidden memberships. If the board is open then you can request to join it by clicking the appropriate button. The user group moderator will need to approve your request; they may ask why you want to join the group. Please do not pester a group moderator if they turn your request down -- they will have their reasons.
Usergroups are initially created by the board administrator who also assigns a board moderator. If you are interested in creating a usergroup then your first point of contact should be the administrator, so try dropping them a private message.
There are three reasons for this; you are not registered and/or not logged on, the board administrator has disabled private messaging for the entire board, or the board administrator has prevented you individually from sending messages. If it is the latter case you should try asking the administrator why.
In the future we will be adding an ignore list to the private messaging system. For now, though, if you keep receiving unwanted private messages from someone, inform the board administrator -- they have the power to prevent a user from sending private messages at all.
We are sorry to hear that. The email form feature of this board includes safeguards to try to track users who send such posts. You should email the board administrator with a full copy of the email you received and it is very important this include the headers (these list details of the user that sent the email). They can then take action.

Earlier this year we set out to make the PDF version of Ability more accessible. However, subscriber David Falcus sent us examples of how pages in the more accessible version failed to display well. Here is his letter and subsequent correspondence with our consultant Ted Page.
I think this configuration is something that is quite valid, and something that I have tested with on PDF files in the past and found the accessible ones to work well with.
There are many pages in the document however that do not display well. I have included screenshots of a small selection of them below.
I'm really sorry, but I'm afraid I would have to disagree with David Falcus's view that PDF's reflow view is a valid configuration.
I think the near universal view of people who work with PDFs is that reflow view is a more or less completely ‘broken’ technology.
A document may work in reflow view, but it is never guaranteed. The only control I or anyone else will have over reflow view is in the reading order. There is just no functionality for fixing overlapping text or making text reappear when it is missing or fixing any other problem.
Probably the leading expert in PDF accessibility in the US is Duff Johnson. He is the chairman of the PDF/UA committee and vice chairman of the PDF Association.
The article is not actually about the problems of PDF reflow view per se, more about a product to do what PDF reflow can't.
But I am aware that Duff's view is very much that reflow is currently unworkable. I have also had discussions with the subject of the interview, Olaf Drümmer, on the same topic. He gave up on reflow view years ago.
However, I think there is a solution which is to produce the magazine as an epub as well as a PDF. Once you have a well tagged PDF you can create an ePub relatively easily from it.
I have to admit that this area is something that is relatively new to me – so I am busy trying to get up to speed.
The comment “…near universal view of people who work with PDFs is that reflow view is a more or less completely broken technology” is interesting.
I have been searching the web and cannot really find anything to back this up – perhaps this is a view that the experts have – but are not really articulating to a wider audience? If the reflow view is so bad why is there not more public criticism of Adobe?
What led me to the original view was that I did find some documents on the Adobe site that worked 100% correctly in the reflow view – so certainly with some types of document at least that view is workable.
It is a bit of an ironic situation that we now have the PDF/UA standard, but potentially the most popular PDF viewer is not capable of taking full advantage of it.
Whilst pdfGoHTML is interesting, at the moment it is only available for the full version of Acrobat, which is not really a realistic option for the majority of users who would have the free Adobe Reader.
I need to do some more investigation on this and will let you know if I come to any different conclusions.

The chair faced a table, in the center of the room, on which, among a clutter of books, unkempt newspapers, and correspondence, stood three hollow- stemmed glasses and a silver ice pail con- taining a bottle of champagne. Dusty, glass-fronted bookcases lined two walls of the room, a monumental breakfront occupied most of a third, and backed up against the other were two over- flowing roll-top desks, each with an an- cient swivel chair in front of it. A framed aerial view of the winery buildings hung ...... ...... above one of the desks, and a marble bust of a Caesar gazed down from the top of the breakfront. ...t\lphonso sprang up as we came in. He nodded to his hrother and gave me an embarrassed grin of recognition. Then he set about opening the wine. Alfred waved me into Al- phonso's chair. "Alphonso- will sit at his desk," he explained, dropping into one of the swivel chairs, "and I at mine. That is our custom. Alphonso?" "Make yourself comfortable," .L l- phonso said, loosening the wire at the mouth of the bottle with his fingers. The cork blew out, sailed across the table, and rolled onto an open copy of Life. "Ah," he said. He filled two glasses, handed me one, and then looked 'J inquiringly at his brother, who said, "J ust a l ttle-a taste. This is a special occasion." Alphonso gave him a full glass and lifted his own. Alfred studied ...... his glass critically for a moment. '"'Wen," he said in a voice of resignation, "sa- lute!" I took a thirsty swallow. The wine was very cold and very dry, and I was prepared to agree it might in- deed have fooled a Frenchman. But Alfred put down his glass after a sip or two and said, "Fair. A good wine, but no more than that. There is no need for you to praise it. We have tnade better. And, of course, worse. The vintage is everything." Alphonso refilled my glass and his own. Alfred watched him glumly. "Alfred doesn't care much for wine any more," Alphonso told me, with a faint grin. ...... "I care for it, all right," the other said. "What drink is better? But I have had too much. Since a boy of five, I have been drinking wine. Now my carcass is too old. I touch it profession- ally only. I drink, of course-a nice Manhattan cocktail before dinner, and at the table perhaps a glass of beer. But wine is out. It doesn't agree with me ...... any more. A sad end for a wine maker.

This show is based on the practical application of the science of emotional intelligence. Chuck is on the 1st, 2nd and 4th Wednesday from 12 to 1 PM. Call in with your questions about work or personal situations where you are feeling challenged and uncertain. Chuck helps you and others learn how to use the Emotion Roadmap to become more intelligent about handling your own emotions and your emotional relationships with others.
The Emotion Roadmap talk show will feature updates about the field of emotional intelligence, occasional guest speakers, and lots of suggestions for how to “Take the Wheel and Control How You Feel!”
· Call with your questions to see how the Emotion Roadmap can help you "take the wheel and control how you feel."
While Chuck has a strong experience base and excellent education he is very approachable and sincerely welcomes all callers and does his best to be helpful.
When strong emotions cause people to delay action and decision making Chuck hels by introducing listeners to his Emotion Roadmap. His Emotion Roadmap was conceived as a result of a strategic alliance with the pioneers of emotional intelligence, Drs. Peter Salovey, President of Yale, Jack Mayer, psychologist at the University of New Hampshire, and David Caruso, also affiliated with Yale. This group sought Chuck's assistance in 1999 when they asked him to develop ways to make their scientific discovery useful to people at work. Along the way Chuck found that the tools he developed were just as helpful to people at home.
When a listener calls and learns how to improve a relationship, or increase their ability to manage their own emotions, hopefully everybody listening is learning. Chuck is very genuine, concerned about others, and based on callers experience, he is very helpful! Here is a comment from Chuck: "I enjoy making a meaningful positive difference in people's lives. When a caller calls to speak to me, and I can help that caller move from feelings such as confusion, anxious, hopeless or insecure to feelings like clear, secure, hopeful and confident, I personally feel joyful and excited for the person. At times applying the Emotion Roadmap seems magical. People who have been stuck for a very long time, in a few short minutes, often feel much more confident and hopeful about a very challenging situation. I am thankful that WPKN provides this opportunity for me to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. Hope you listen in and find it valuable!"

ACU offers many opportunities to undertake supervised research at either the masters or doctoral level.
23 November 2009: A new survey carried out with assistance from Australian Catholic University (ACU) staff has found that Australia is failing to make best use of nurse practitioners within the health system.
The role of nurse practitioners was created several years ago and gave highly-trained nurses extra responsibilities such as prescribing medication and referring patients to other health practitioners.
However, Professor Sandy Middleton, Director of ACUs National Centre for Clinical Outcomes Research, said that this first national survey found that only about 75 per cent of respondents were employed as nurse practitioners.
"Our research makes clear that nurse practitioners are facing significant barriers to providing service in this important health provider role, Professor Middleton said.
Given widespread workforce shortages and rising health care costs, we simply cannot afford to under-utilise this important sector of the health workforce.
The questionnaire looked at demographics, the authorisation process, professional development, employment profile and clinical service patterns.
The survey found that nearly a third of respondents are waiting for approval to prescribe medication and over 70 per cent stated that lack of Medicare provider numbers and lack of authority to prescribe through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was extremely limiting to their practice.
More information on the study can be found in the most recent edition of the Australian Health Review, the peer reviewed journal of the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association.

AC Not Working in Hawthorne? Now that’s a problem! Summer is here and being indoors without a working air conditioner can make it hard to do anything. Luckily, if your AC not working there are solutions to every problem.
Something may be wrong with the wiring – If this is the case it is best to call in someone to fix the faulty wiring situation. It can cause a serious fire hazard.
Refrigerant may be low – If you notice that your refrigerant gets low too quick it may because of a leak from your AC unit.
Fan is not working – If the outside fan isn’t working it could be a problem. This fan conveys the heat from your house to the outside air. If the fan is not taken care of the compressor could possibly be damaged.
Outside is not working – If you have central AC, you most likely have an outside unit. If this is the case you may be experiencing loss of power, contractor problems, or even having an issue with the thermostat.
Frozen coils – If the coil(s) are frozen it could be because of the airflow. This happens because there may be some blockage in the air filters.
These listed above aren’t unusual things that happen. This can happen to anyone at any time. Luckily, there are solutions that can be used to fix these problems and we, AireCool Mechanical, are here to help in anyway possible.
If you or someone you know is experiencing problems with AC Not Working in Hawthorne or anywhere in the area. Call us and we will schedule an appointment to send our technicians to give you an estimate and advise you on your options.

I've never actually been there, but I know where you're talking about. Take a no. 5 bus at this bus stop. I asked Siping to wait a moment. I think I know how to keep it from happening again. I guess I'll be living with you a year from now. We'll stay with him. I'm not mad at them. Shari wanted to die. You heard your mother.
His alibi seemed cast-iron. Mitch abandoned hope. How did you spend last weekend? There is an exception to every rule. Salmonella outbreaks blemished spinach importers' reputation for running clean factories. Get your paws off of me. Eddie studied the diagram. Her teaching experience gives her an advantage when working with children.
Her dog isn't very fast. Thank you for sending me a nice card. He promised to reward me for my work.
It must've been Andries. These things just happen. The mountain rises above the plain. He handed her up into the bus. When will the film be released? Whatever happened to competition?
Diana held a knife to Gideon's throat. You are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. If you want me to, I'll stay here with you until Sal gets back. He has only to ask for help. I want to go to see a movie. She invites us to all her parties. My room is an inviolable refuge. It's good that you were able to achieve your goals.
The United States is abundant in natural resources. Craig sat down behind the steering wheel. You should follow Huey's example. Hopefully, everything will be OK. We're working on it now. How else can he act? Did you like your teachers when you were in junior high school? Tarmi didn't go and I didn't either. Maybe Wolfgang will take you to an expensive restaurant.
At the games they were sold by men who kept them warm in hot-water tanks. It won't make any difference. Could you show me how to use that machine? The rain is getting you down, isn't it? They appointed him manager. I always read the label for them. I'll be out of your way in just a moment. That's not true.
You can see her in the morning. Regrettably, that didn't happen. The ones that don't make noise are dangerous. He often eats breakfast here. I could live anywhere. Who cooks for you? Starbuck will certainly try. We just met yesterday. He finally opted for the smallest one.
Sjouke doesn't know what Roxane is trying to do. It seems to me that they will be late. Hey, what are you doing? Don't touch it, or you'll break the balance!
Dustin is the only one who ever really knew me. She threatened to set our house on fire. I love eggplant. I'm sure Ramesh won't tell Angus. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. You will see it, when you believe it.
Beverly is taller than both Kriton and her brother. You can't have it both ways. My brother and I like the same food. This city has many historical buildings. Kenn decided. The villagers supported a new road. That is a high building, is it not?
I have to pass this exam. Huey was sure Jordan didn't know how to drive a car. But back to the point; I now understand the word "material". I suggest using "vehicle door". Do you have anything to do after that? Let me go! You're hurting me! I think his job resume is questionable.
Saturday is when I am least busy. Antony has a big apartment. What do you have against her? I love this man! Neither of those things happened. There was an earthquake and, in addition, there was a tsunami. I have lived with several Zen masters, all of them cats.

Now time for some street/grafitti photography. This is very much in the style of how I used to present my images sometime back. I kind of miss it. What about you?
don't say jobless to me bro, too much determination and purpose to his walk. i love the grafitti and the capture though.
Love it. Although I think a dark background would make it much easier to look at. The contrast between the white of the webpage and the dark corners is rather painful on my eyes. Though that has nothing to do with the shot itself it would make the overall viewing experiance more enjoyable.
Everyone seems to have shots of these owls, heh. Got one I've had for ages that I shot around Brick Lane before you showed up. never been sure about it. Like the way the border looks torn on this photo.
I've been pondering over whether seeing the little booties in all their colourful glory would in fact add another positive dimension to an already great black and white capture. richard

In a typical Client Server model, most of the processing is done on the PC (client), treating the server as an information repository. Individual PC’s send requests for information to a central server, which returns the results to the client. Each PC is required to have their own version of each application it runs and they must be kept up to date to ensure optimal performance.
In a Cloud software solution,applications and data are stored, run from and managed by a central Cloud server. Users do not download and install applications om their own device or computer. Instead, data and applications are delivered to your device via a secure high speed internet connection, utilizing the processing power and storage space of the Cloud server. A Cloud model removes the need for version upgrades or license management on individual computing devices.

The year is 276 AL, the 14th year of the glorious reign of Aerys II Targaryen. The realm is at peace, the royal coffers are full, and the summer sun shines upon Westeros. The thirty-six year old king has produced an heir, Rhaegar, the Prince of Dragonstone, a thoughtful and promising young man, just begining to draw the eyes of the Seven Kingdoms. As the year opens, the king rides to Duskendale with a small honor guard to meet with the disgruntled Lord Denys Darklyn, leaving Tywin Lannister, the King’s Hand, to oversee affairs in King’s Landing.
In the the Mountains of the Moon, Lord Jon Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, has the honor of the service of two squires, Robert Baratheon, 16, the heir of Storm’s End, and Eddard Stark, 13, the second son of Lord Rickard Stark. Lord Arryn has been a popular and effective ruler since taking the mantle of lordship upon the passing of his father, but parts of the Mountains of the Moon are still wild, and even the civilized areas often defy tranquility.
To the Northwest of the Eyrie, in the Western Argent River Valley, the peace that blankets the realm seems distant. The mountain clans still raid, bandits plague the houses, and old rivalries begin to fray the tenuous peace. For even in times of prosperity, the wolves must hunt and Game of Thrones is played.
This is the chronicle of the members and retainers of House Thane, their trials, triumphs and failures as they seek their fortunes, from battle to tourney to court. Be it in glory or infamy, this is their story…

Gabriel Tarde (1843 - 1904) French sociologist and social psychologist who conceived sociology as based on small psychological interactions among individuals (much as if it were chemistry), the fundamental forces being imitation and innovation.
Among the concepts that Tarde initiated were the "group mind" (taken up and developed by Gustav Le Bon, and sometimes advanced to explain so-called herd behaviour or crowd psychology), and economic psychology, where he anticipated a number of modern developments.

ANDY KEPES, A science teacher at Mount Abraham Union High School, will succeed retiring Mt. Abe principal Paulette Bogen later this year. Independent photo/Trent Campbell
BRISTOL — When Paulette Bogan steps down at the end of the year from her position as principal at Mount Abraham Union High School, a familiar face will be standing by to take the baton.
Mount Abe earth science teacher and Addison resident Andy Kepes accepted the position last Wednesday after interviewing in late January with the Mount Abe school board. He and Leon Wheeler, who currently works as the middle school principal, will serve as co-principals next year.
“He’s just a fabulous person,” said Lanny Smith, the chair of the school board. Smith cited Kepes’ enthusiasm and excitement as factors in the board’s decision to make the hire, as well as his familiarity with the school and its programs.
“He’s well known to the school, and within the school community,” said Smith. “His knowledge of the program and his desire to make it a better program were definitely key factors.”
Kepes was one of three finalists for the position who interviewed with the board — and met with students, faculty and community members — on Jan. 27. Smith said the decision was a tough one.
Smith said that feedback from parents, teachers and students all supported the board’s choice. The question that popped up most frequently had to do with Kepes’ lack of administrative experience.
In the end, Smith said, the board decided to take a chance — much like they took a chance a few years ago in hiring a similarly inexperienced Kristine Evarts as the dean of students, a decision with which Smith said the board has been very pleased.
Kepes, who recently earned his master’s degree in educational leadership from the University of Vermont, has taught at the Bristol-based high school for five years. Prior to that, he also worked at Mount Abe for a year as a long-term substitute math teacher.
Kepes said that while he’ll miss being in the classroom full time, he was inspired to aim for an administrator’s position because of the chance it offered for making long-term changes at the school.
One of the biggest changes he envisions for Mount Abe down the road is a program that would allow students to take multiple pathways to graduation. Kepes’ vision would allow students to choose a “major” in 10th grade that would allow them to pursue an area of interest — like art, music, or science — more aggressively than they can currently.
Kepes is a jovial man. He joked about coaching the school’s “alligator wrestling team — the only one in Vermont,” he said, and changing the school’s mascot to the Mount Abe Yankees (“I think we’ll look good in pinstripes,” he said). But he’s serious when it comes to the new job, and acknowledging the difficulties he knows he’ll face — and the school will face — in the coming years.
He said he knows that there will be a “big learning curve” as far as administrative duties are concerned, and he predicted that he’ll rely on Wheeler a lot in the first year.
The school will also face significant budgeting challenges in the coming years, given the current economy and the smaller student body numbers projected for the future. Matching up a desire for new programs with dwindling state aid will be “major concerns,” Kepes said.
But Kepes said that he thinks his jump from the classroom to the principal’s office will be, in some ways, a beneficial one, despite his lack of administrative experience.
“I guess, having been in the trenches, I’ll have a good perspective of what’s facing teachers,” he said. Plus, having taught over half of the students at the school currently, he said he hopes that they’ll continue to find him approachable.
And Kepes said he feels his familiarity with the school could go a long way toward a goal many students, teachers and parents raised in meetings with the candidates for the job: Strengthening the sense of community at Mount Abe.
Though he does not anticipate it happening next year, he said he hopes to return to the classroom to teach at least one class in the years to come.
“I love teaching, but the hope is down the road that I continue to teach a class, maybe not the first year but eventually,” he said. “I think it’s important that an administrator be in the classroom part time.”

The development of breech loading had the greatest effect on naval warfare, for the first time since the Middle Ages, altering the way weapons are mounted on warships, and therefore naval tactics, now divorced from the reliance on sails with the invention of the internal combustion. A further advance in military naval technology was the design of the submarine, and its weapon, the torpedo.
A good score on the ASVAB is different than a minimum required score. Each of the military branches will have their own minimum required scores (see below). In practice, however, each branch will be more selective in their recruiting. A score of 50 on the ASVAB implies that you scored as well or better than 50% of comparable test-takers. Since ASVAB scores are used for many purposes (e.g., enlistment eligibility, military job placements, and career exploration), it is important that you score well on the ASVAB. A score of 60 or better should be your minimum target.
If you’re planning on using your scores for military enlistment, you may be hoping to achieve a score that is high enough for a specific signing bonus. While it’s natural to want to do your best, putting extra pressure on yourself can cause unnecessary anxiety. Take a few deep breaths, relax, and remember that taking the test is only part of the entire recruitment process.
We hope you find our study guides useful as you begin preparing to take the ASVAB! If you’re social like we are, please reach out to us on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Pinterest. We’d love to answer your questions, get your feedback, or just hear more about your thoughts on the ASVAB or your intended branch of service. Good luck studying and congrats as you take this exciting first step towards your military career!
Leading war poets included Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen, John McCrae, Rupert Brooke, Isaac Rosenberg, and David Jones. A similar movement occurred in literature, producing a slew of novels on both sides of the Atlantic, including notably: All Quiet on the Western Front, and Johnny Got His Gun. The 1963 English stage musical Oh, What a Lovely War! provided a satirical take on World War I, which was released in a cinematic version directed by Richard Attenborough in 1969.
The ASVAB, or the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, is a timed test given to those entering the military. There are several different areas you will be tested in, and Varsity Tutors’ ASVAB Learning Tools focus on the general science and math sections of the ASVAB. The experience is important, because your ultimate score is used to assess your qualifications for various military occupations and specialties once you are enrolled. To achieve a high score, you have to study hard and concentrate on the areas that give you the most trouble. Free ASVAB practice tests online give you the chance to brush up on concepts, work on your weaknesses, and become familiar with the test format while studying the material you’ll be tested on.
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is more commonly known as the ASVAB Test. If you are interested in a military career, you will need to pass this challenging test in order to qualify. It is used for all branches of the military which includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, National Guard, and Coast Guard. It is also used to gauge your abilities in specific areas that may be relevant to your job assignments within the military. For more information about the exact details of this exam, check out our article titled What is the ASVAB Test?
GED holders who earn 15 college credits 100 level or greater are considered equivalent with those holding high school diplomas, so that they need only the Tier I score to enlist. Eligibility is not determined by score alone. Certain recruiting goal practices may require an applicant to achieve a higher score than the required minimum AFQT score in order to be considered for enlistment. Rules and regulations are subject to change; applicants should call their local recruiting center for up to date qualification information.[4][5]
It’s best to keep the contact information of your nearest recruiting office or your actual recruiter; they are your best bet for getting your scores. ASVAB scores are valid for up to two years before you need to retest so most offices will send your current scores via mail. If you can’t get yours by mail, you can pick them up from your local recruiting office.

If your pet is struggling with chronic pain or another health problem and traditional veterinary intervention has proven to be ineffective, then your pet may be a good candidate for acupuncture. Veterinary acupuncture may be beneficial for the following conditions:
If your pet is receiving treatment for cancer, acupuncture may also be effective for alleviating the side effects of these treatments, including pain, fatigue, nausea and loss of appetite. Talk to your veterinarian to find out if your pet is a good candidate.
If your pet is suffering from pain or another illness but not responding to traditional veterinary care, veterinary acupuncture may be an effective treatment option. Veterinary acupuncture is very similar to the type of acupuncture used to treat humans. Long, thin needles are inserted at specific pressure points along an animal’s body to alleviate pain and stimulate the central nervous system. Typically, only a certified veterinary acupuncturist may administer acupuncture treatments for animals.
Veterinary acupuncture has its roots in traditional Eastern medicine. According to Chinese philosophy, the “chi” (a body’s energy) travels through energy pathways, known as meridians. A blockage or obstruction in these pathways affects the chi’s ability to travel through the body. Contemporary medicine recognizes that the concept of the “chi” is very similar to our understanding of the central nervous system. Stimulating different points along the central nervous system stimulates the release of chemicals in the muscles, brain, and spinal cord. These chemicals affect the brain’s perception of pain and stimulate the release of other chemical mediators to improve organ function.
