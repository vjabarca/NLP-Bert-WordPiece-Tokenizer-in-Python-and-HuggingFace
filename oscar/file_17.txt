canada goose coats on sale The food was simply amazing at official canada goose outlet any of the places we dined. I do recommend going to the dining room for breakfast as the lido deck can get a little crowded. We like to be waited on for breakfast and there are more choices in the dining room. If a manufacturer chooses to use a date on their product, then the FDA does define what must be in the date: if a calendar date is used the month, day and year must be printed along with a phrase explaining the meaning of that date. This is the US FDA official regulation, but at the state level many (20+) states require dating on certain foods while other states have no dating requirements at all. FYI: the FDA also allows closed dating which is coded letters and numbers used on more shelf stable products canada goose coats on sale.
The Timing Belt, sometimes called a Cambelt is an integral part of your engine. It keeps the valves opening and closing at the right time. If they open at the wrong time, major engine damage may occur. It's better to replace the timing belt when the manufacturer recommends it, rather than waiting for it to break and leave you stranded. Most timing belt failures give very little if any warning. Our customers often say "I was just driving along and the engine stopped" If your car has an interference motor, the pistons will hit the valves.

Surely not to Christy. Say what you want, but she is effective in settling business to her advantage, of course in exchange of money or gifts (promises, rent, other transfers). Certainly she is the entrepreneurial type.
You’d think they would have consulted a constitutional expert before signing the deal. My understanding was that the opposition party is supposed to have a member abstain from voting out of respect for Speaker impartiality. It sounds like it’s a bigger faux pax to make the speaker partisan than to not have somebody abstain. So the Liberals probably shouldn’t cause a deadlocked situation, but it looks like they will.
If the deal hinged on the Liberals giving up a speaker, then I’d say those two clowns aren’t fit to govern.
The tone has definitely changed in the last week and maybe all the parties have been advised that if the Legislature is deadlocked, we’re headed back for an election. If the GreeNDP felt otherwise, I think they would have been clear about it by now.
Norman Spector, who negotiated the agreement, says it was predicated on a Liberal defection. Sounds like somebody is covering his ass.
I knew the crooked clown would try to cling to power no matter what, she’s even making up fake traditions now.
“Premier Christy Clark says tradition dictates the party in power offers the speaker, intimating that if she fails to win the confidence of the house, a Liberal Speaker would resign.”
I really don’t understand how there could be an issue. How can you have a deadlock when there are an uneven number of votes. The speaker has the tie breaking vote for a reason, and you are on crack if you think an NDP speaker would ever vote Liberal with the tie breaking vote. Next topic…
should things unfold in this fashion Lt Gov Guichon would step in. Horgan should be getting ready for battle and raising money using any and all means possible
One commenter from the article nails it: “if you would bother to read the agreement made between the NDP and the Greens, there is no mention of a speaker choice. Also, if you would stop listening to rumours and read a Poli Sci 100, Canadian Politics textbook, you would understand that the fact the party in power traditionally offers a speaker does not enter the equation. What matters is the number of votes in the House. There are 87 in total, and Christy Clark can only confirm 43 of them. She needs 44 or she fails the confidence motion. When she does that, the Lt. Governor will act on the will of the House. And the will of the House has already been made clear to her, in writing.”
>>> my guess is that krusty could care less if she loses the confidence vote. the fact that she keeps bringing this up without batting an eyelash tells me there is more to the story which will be revealed AFTER that happens.
>>> no matter how pieces of chess board are moved around, end game will be a hung parliament followed by another election. of course, there are pro’s/con’s to doing snap election (maybe catching horgan with pants down) vs dragging this out for balance of year (and keeping ndp on sidelines)
Christy Clark playing usual politics game. She will elect and depose a speaker with Liberal colors, then claim that the other guys should do the same.
However she has miscalculated: Horgan will not let her play this game, they will allow the speaker to regularly vote with the majority.
The Trudeau government’s point man on foreign takeovers said he’s disturbed by news that the chair of Chinese conglomerate Anbang has been arrested by Beijing, but he will not reconsider Ottawa’s decision to allow the insurance titan to buy a stake in British Columbia’s health-care sector.
“An economic growth spurt is bringing the prospect of higher mortgage rates at a time when many Canadians in the country’s largest cities are stretching to afford homes.”
The fixed term lease loophole needs to be eliminated. I thought Krusty was going to get rid of that? Oh right, that turned out to be too hard to do.
would it be a loophole if rents were falling and tenants were using it to get their rent reduced again and again and the end of the lease?
Vince Emond and Devin Francis spotted the equivalent of three large garbage bags full of chopsticks, empty sushi containers and red party cups behind a boulder right next to the trail leading to upper Joffree Lakes.
it’s pretty ugly what the wiseguys are doing with this bs takeover talk, rumors of HCG and sucking in all sorts of mooches and naive retail investors only to have crooked insiders and connected people unload on them over the last few day as the regulators turn a blind eye. imho this co is effectively insolvent, but the powers that be have been too worried about optics, saving face and propping the housing market up versus doing to the right thing and winding the company down. as i said a couple of times over the last few days, i suspect this chatter from the BoC regarding hikes is nothing but a ploy to get prospective buyers off the fence, locking in rates now and taking the RE plunge sooner rather than later.
That guy is such a dummy. First he tries to start negotiating before all the votes were counted when either the Liberals or NDP could have won a majority. And then he signs a deal with a party that can’t actually deliver on the deal because apparently nobody knows how Parliamentary Democracy works. How about instead of pushing for PR, you first understand the system we have now?
I think Weaver’s math is fine. Your grasp of Westminster parliament needs correction. The GreeNDP based their ‘takeover’ on the fact that the Libs have to put a speaker in place in order to bring in their Throne Speech.
The Libs lose the confidence vote and the GreeNDP takeover with the SAME speaker in place. This is based on history where a speaker does not resign for partisan reasons.
If the Lib speaker does resign, then we are headed for another election and the Libs will have to wear that they caused it.
Speaking of apartment buildings for sale in Vancouver, here’s a co-op apartment building on Oak Street @ 20th being offered for sale. Isn’t co-op housing being touted as an “affordable housing” solution? and now it’s disappearing…interest rates really “have done their job”!
“Rare opportunity to acquire an exceptionally well-maintained 26-suite co-op apartment building in Vancouver’s affluent Shaughnessy neighbourhood. Given the housing co-operative ownership structure of the building, there will be no existing tenancies in place allowing the building to be rented at current market levels (market rates estimated to be approximately $3.25 per SF)”
i noticed there has been some peculiar activity at the large Beacon Cove apt complex located at 7831/51/71/91 No 1 Rd Rmd
bldg is in poor condition yet transaction volume is unusually high and turnover very quick. i suspect units are being quietly rounded up by developer group looking to hijack the strata and push for eventual sale and redevelopment.
It’s not what we would call a co-op. Prior to the legislation allowing condos circa 1970, the only way for an apartment building to be owned by suite owners was by incorporating as a cooperative. But the owners bought and sold the units much like condo owners do now. If you want a better known example look at the co-ops in Manhatten where rich people live.
Employment in the arts and culture sector dwindled for the second year in a row, with 300 jobs lost.
Dishonest cherry-picking summary wouldn’t you say? Crime dropped overall by 3% but you omitted that part. Why?
“Dishonest” in what way? Why? So that negates the rest of it? Sounds like we need to discuss your “cherry picking”.
Dishonest because you presented it as a summary when it wasn’t an accurate reflection of the article and also because you implied a correlation between the negatives and immigration when the article did no such thing?
Violent crime is almost always between people who already know each other, i.e. being a victim is a result of associating with the wrong people. In addition, in a small city like Halifax the numbers are going to be small enough that a change of 5% one way or another is just noise. Even in metro Vancouver which is 8 times bigger such a change hardly means anything.
If low interest rates have done the job, shouldn’t there be an over-abundance of rental accommodation due to the cheap financing? Instead, we have a record low vacancy rate. The city and provincial governments have done a poor job of fostering healthy development, and now everyone is blaming the BoC for prices. High prices are what happens when you limit supply and auction off what’s left for luxury condos. It’s nice to see that the city is now talking about addressing the crisis; I guess it’s never too late to start considering taking action on something that’s been on-going for a decade… I’m getting more and more pessimistic, the city is only interested in taking action as long as it’s A-okay with all existing residents and owners. The BoC may not be able to raise rates in 2018 as it… Read more »
I doubt the hikes will stop because there is their credibility on the line and also they need some ammo for next time. Right now they are out of bullets and have to reload.
That’s bizarre. IMHO the temporary foreign worker and Quebec investor immigration programs are the ones that need to get reined in the most.
“If low interest rates have done the job, shouldn’t there be an over-abundance of rental accommodation due to the cheap financing?”
I agree but that’s where the city/province needs to step in with better policy. The foreign buyers tax came pretty late, the new empty homes tax later still, and both of these together are probably still not a big enough incentive to make a huge difference. Zoning and approvals are a problem too, if purpose-built rentals were all that could be built at some good sites, I think it would get built.
If the Libs want to be dicks and force another election, im hearing word that the NDP and Greens will run candidates only in selected ridings to ensure the Liberals are shit kicked.
Doubt it. The only ridings that the Greens have any hope of picking up more seats in are already held by the NDP. In every riding the Liberals won the NDP finished second.
Except West Vancouver-Sea to Sky. If the NDP gave up that one and maybe a handful of others where the Greens came a close third and are hopeless for the NDP, maybe a deal could be struck.
The NDP is not going to “give up” any seats. They do have a slim chance to win a majority in another election. If they wanted a better chance at winning the two parties would merge as one party like the federal Reform party did with the Conservatives. I think that would be at least another election away.
The NDP is constituted as one party Canada wide (except in Quebec) with the same membership federally and provincially. This makes it almost impossible for a merger with another party to take place in any given province. Reform and the PC’s were federal only, the latter had previously separated from its provincial branches.
Would make sense if in every riding that the Green or NDP won that only that winner runs and not the Green or NDP loser in that riding….that should guarantee they don’t lose any seats….then in the ridings the liberals won, the 3rd place candidate drops out in hopes those votes go the the 2nd place candidate, which could be enough to take the seat. The real solution to all this, which should be a no brainier in a real democracy, is you select a 1st and 2nd choice, so if your first choice is in 3rd place, your 2nd choice automatically kicks in, eliminating that age old issue of cite splitting allowing one to vote their conscience and not be the reason for the victory of their least favourite candidate due to vote splitting.
Risk for the Greens is if that strategy is too effective and the NDP win a clear majority rendering them irrelevant
If Liberals force an election they will definitely be shit kicked by an enraged public forces to take yet again vote and waste tax dollars
“Canada’s central bank, which had long said interest rates are too blunt a tool to tackle the country’s housing market, may have finally decided to act and at least limit its role in fueling a potential bubble with low interest rates.”
“Canada’s 5-year government bond yield has jumped as much as 20 basis points, which could trigger higher mortgage borrowing costs, since Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins spoke on Monday.”
a “potential” bubble…that is beyond hilarious…almost as much as claims they will do the right thing and deep six both the housing market and Cdn manufacturing sectors by raising rates

See what three Hotel General Managers/Managing Directors say about the opportunity of employing disabled people. Could this be a solution to the skills gap in the Hotel Industry? Or are the difficulties insurmountable?
In the third part of our accessibility series, Arnold Fewell helps identify the simple fixes that everybody should have done for disabled guests
The Paralympics from Rio are about to hit our TV screens. We can sit back and watch these brilliant athletes perform and admire their skills and determination to overcome adversity, but how well would your business be prepared if one of the athletes came to your hotel? Would they want to come back? And are you providing for their additional needs?
Housekeepers can make a much better impression on disabled guests, say Arnold Fewell FIH and Christoph Hoffmann MIH
For hotels to embrace accessibility, they need to invest in training from people that really understand what those with disabilities are looking for, says Arnold Fewell
I lay in bed at 10.45pm in a London hotel when the fire alarms went off. I had not been given a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan (PEEP) when I checked in and there was nothing specific about the evacuation of a permanent wheelchair user in the room. As a former hotelier I knew I was probably safer staying in the room. If smoke came under the door I could use wet towels and the door would withstand fire for about 45 minutes. It was still scary as I wondered what was happening.
I was judging some industry awards recently and was talking to a fellow judge; suddenly we started talking about teaspoons and in this case the lack of them. We were at a large, five star establishment in London. The teaspoons were beautiful silver, immaculately polished but there were not enough of them. People had to ask for more and the waitress who was immaculately turned out with a beautiful smile had to disappear and get more. Judging by the length of time she was away I suspect she was collecting dirty teaspoons as she returned to the kitchen and having to wash them. Which do I remember most the lovely venue or the lack of teaspoons?
Arnold Fewell, Managing Director of AVF Marketing says hotels may pride themselves on good diversity practices, but does that include looking out for disabled staff and guests?
I stayed in a hotel last weekend and had a nightmare with a Housekeeper’s trolley. I accept that we were situated next to a laundry room and staff needed to go in and out. What I objected to was the trolley that was frequently left outside my room which meant I could not get out of my room. On our last morning we had to negotiate this impediment four times as we went downstairs for breakfast and then check out. If I had been on my own I would have had to shout for help and then hope someone heard me. This could have been so easy to avoid.

She will not expect you to marry her or anything like that. She will remember making love the first time with you for the rest of her life.

But for most girls, rather than being deeply in love with their first guy, they need to like and trust the man they're choosing to gift with their virginity.

Tama returned to Accrington in 2005 after helping Auckland to the State Championship in New Zealand. In the final against Wellington at Eden Park's Outer Oval, Tama hit 106, his second century of the season, and he took 2 wickets. In all State Championship matches he hit 342 runs at 42.7 and he took 27 wickets at 23.8, including a career best 6-44 against Northern Districts. He then hit 115, which was another career best, as his side won by an innings and 89 runs in Hamilton to move to the top of the State Championship in December.
On his return to Accrington in 2005 Tama was a pale shadow of the player who had won eight matches off his own bat the previous season. He came late due to domestic commitments and when he arrived he brought with him a knee injury which would cause him to miss just two matches, but he was far from fit for some time into the season.
Tama's statistics tell a sad tale. His 534 runs at 24.3 left only Haslingden's Pasan Wanasinghe behind him in the averages. His 43 wickets at 29.2 were by far the most expensive of any professional with just one five wicket haul to show in a total of 376.2 overs. So it was hardly surprising that the team fared so badly.
Tama Canning returned to Accrington in 2004 as a cricketer who had matured into a top class performer at State level which has in turn led to International honours.
In his second full term at the club he was a revelation turning in no fewer then eight match winning performances as Accrington climbed the table to 11th after winning nine matches their best since 2000. In league matches Tama hit 931 runs at 66.5 with five half centuries and three unbeaten centuries and he also took 56 wickets with a best of 6-45 in the win at Enfield. It was Tama's batting exploits that made the league sit up and take notice with match winning innings a regular feature of his play - 73 not out against Colne, 80 not out at Burnley, 101 not out against Rawtenstall, 79 at Todmorden, 122 not out at Rishton, 70 not out against Nelson and finally a massive unbeaten 151 at Colne before he left to join the New Zealand A tour of South Africa. Accrington offered Tama terms to return in 2005.
In April 2003, Tama was named Auckland's cricketer of the year after superb season of match-winning performances for his State. Tama finished as the leading wicket taker with 46 victims at 22.0 which was a record for Auckland, beating John Bracewell's 43 in 1986/87. Tama also hit his maiden First-class century - 113 against Canterbury, and averaged 37.6 with a total of 451 runs.
These performances earned the all rounder a place in the New Zealand Super Max side and a trip to Pakistan during the winter when he made his One Day International debut. To date Tama has played in three ODI's. In First-class matches he has 1329 runs at 25.1 and taken 143 wickets at 23.6.
When Nathan Astle became unavailable to return to Accrington for the 2001 season, the club had no hesitation in signing Tama Canning to replace him. Tama had made a big impression in his short time at Accrington at the end of 2000, scoring 265 runs at 53, including 98 at Enfield, and taking 21 wickets at 16.5. So impressive was Tama, that several other clubs were also chasing his signature. Accrington had hoped for great things from the New Zealander after his performances as a stand-in for Nathan Astle in 2000, but although he scored over 900 runs, he only took 53 wickets as Accrington finished at the bottom of the league. Tama acted as sub professional for Read in the Ribblesdale League at the start of the season, scoring 119 not out and taking 2-30 against Blackburn Northern.
A native of Adelaide, South Australia, Tama played for Western Australia before moving to New Zealand to play for Auckland. The right handed batsman and right arm fast medium bowler scored 244 runs at an average of 22.2 and took 27 wickets at 21.7 each in the Shell Trophy in the 2000 - 1 season. In the one day Shell Cup, he scored 210 runs at 35, with a highest score of 92 not out and he also took 17 wickets at 13 each.

Besides Al-Farouq Aminu, Renardo Sidney and Jordan Hamilton, who we wrote about extensively in an article already earlier this week, there were a number of intriguing prospects on hand at Amare Stoudemire Invitational Classic in Davenport, Florida, that will develop into excellent college basketball players and potentially pros down the road. Lets take a look at a few of them.
Future Alabama commit and potential McDonalds All-American JaMychal Green (#17 Scout.com, #25 Rivals) would have had a legit case to be considered the MVP of this tournament, had his team only managed to win more games. Regardless, he looked extremely impressive, as hes a true man amongst boys at the high school level.
Standing somewhere around 6-8, with an SEC-ready frame starting from the first day hell step on foot in Tuscaloosa, JaMychal Green is nothing short a physical specimen. Hes a good athlete who is very explosive around the rim and finishes superbly through contact, often with a powerful dunk. Hes got good hands and is tough as nails, bodying players up and doing a pretty solid job establishing position in the post--making him an outstanding target to lob the ball to inside. His feel for the game is somewhat average at this point, but he can regardless find the open man out of the post, showing an outstanding demeanor for a player his age and never getting rattled even when opposing players try to get in his face and instigate. Green was a man on the offensive glass, ripping rebounds away on a consistent basis and coming up with a number of huge put-back dunks. His length, timing and strength also made him a solid shot-blocking threat here, although he seemed to try a lot harder on the offensive end than he did on defense, failing to get back on a couple of possessions.
Although hes known mostly as an old school back to the basket pivot, Green surprised at times by stepping outside and knocking down a couple of 3-pointers. This might not be a super consistent weapon for him at this point, but it sure looked intriguing. Regardless, his overall skill-level is nothing to write home about at this point. His ball-handling is poor, and his footwork in the post could clearly use work. He doesnt seem to have a real go-to move, and proved to be effectively neutralized with a solid zone defense.
Green looks like a perfect understudy to bring in next to Richard Hendrix, provided the super-productive big man will decide to stick around for a year longer. If he doesnt, Alabama will need Green to play similarly to the way he did here in Floridathat is in dominant fashion. He still has a lot of work to do on his all-around game as most teenagers do, but the early signs look very promising from what we could tell, and he seems to be a great fit for the style of play we find in the SEC.
The #1 sophomore prospect in the country according to both Scout and Rivals.com didnt do a whole lot to back up those lofty claims in terms of actual productivity, getting absolutely dominated by Renardo Sidney in the first time we saw him and then showing more extremely concerning signs in the second around. Regardless, there is no question that Tyler possesses an incredible amount of upside, although at this point you have to wonder about his chances of actually achieving it considering the way he handles himself at such a young age.
Starting with the good, we find quite an incredibly intriguing all-around package. Showing good size at 6-10, an outstanding frame, and absolute freakish athleticism, Tyler looks the part of stud prospect from the first second you watch him already in warm-ups. Hes an incredibly fluid player, quick off his feet, explosive in the open court, with an outstanding 2nd bounce and a terrific first stepindeed the entire package as far as physical tools are concerned. All these things obviously make him a great threat in transition, as well as blocking shots and hitting the offensive glass.
Skill-wise, there is a lot to like here too potentially, as he already looks very advanced facing the basketwith a nice array of pull-up jumpers, 3-point range on his shot, and the ball-handling skills to create his own shot. His ability to put the ball on the floor and get by his man is pretty special for a player his sizelet alone a 16 year old who seems to have absolutely no idea what he is doing out on the court.
Has no clue is unfortunately a concept that you think of quite often when watching Tyler play. Hes incredibly raw as you might expect a player his ageswinging wildly for blocks, biting on every pump-fake, settling for terrible shots from the perimeter, over-handling the ball and running into brick walls, showing absolutely no footwork in the post, being a black hole offensively, and clearly having no clue at this point what his limitations are as a basketball player. His athletic ability is so far ahead of his skill level that he looks completely out of control for the most part, lacking any type of balance or patience, and sorely missing any real fundamentals in his game.
That would be absolutely fine if he dealt with these issues with maturity and tried to learn from his mistakes. He is, after all, only 16 years old. The problem is that he absolutely could not contain his frustration by the way he was being destroyed by Renardo Sidney, and responded by showing a terrible attitude.
He screamed at his teammates, sulked on the bench (the only one not cheering for anyone), attempted to redirect the offense and call his own plays when his team received the ball, complained non-stop to his coach, disrespected the officials, talked smack to the opposing team, showed awful body language, and generally just looked like an immature, spoiled brat for virtually the entire time he was in the spotlight.
He should have been thrown out multiple times for the way he conducted himself, but the referees could not call a technical foul on him (from what one of them told us himself) because the organizers want us to keep him in the game. It looked like his coach was afraid of telling him anything either, since he didnt seem to be bothered by his star players behavior in the least bitsitting and relaxing on the bench with his team down by 30 points, not trying to do anything in particular.
Since we dont watch as much high school basketball as some others, were not exactly sure if this is normal behavior from a star player this age, and how much to make of it. It surely cant be a positive sign. Maybe Tyler will mature as he grows older, and maybe hell get with some people that truly care about his development as a player and more importantly as a person and start to teach him right from wrong. Maybe we just caught him having a bad week, but it was very difficult not to be turned off by what we saw there.
A completely unheralded junior coming into this tournament Keith Clanton (non-top 150 player on either Scout or Rivals) did an excellent job proving his worth in the two games we saw him in, looking far more impressive than most of the other top-100 big men in attendance here.
Clanton is a 6-8 power forward with an excellent body and wingspan, with magnets for hands and an impressive skill-set facing the basket. He can put the ball on the floor extremely well for a player his size, creating his own shot with either hand, and spinning into the lane impressively with superb body control. Most college power forwards couldnt execute most of the moves he was making here, even if Clanton overdid it at times with his ball-handling, leading to a number of turnovers. He also stepped away from the hoop and knocked down a couple of smooth 3-pointers, and then proceeded to go into the post and score with a jump-hook shot. He has terrific touch around the basket, even if he spends too much time hanging out on the perimeter at this point trying to prove his small forward skills. Considering his body and somewhat average explosiveness, hes clearly a power forward at the collegiate level, but he could be an extremely dangerous one if he truly committed to playing to his strengths.
Defensively, Clanton was not very effective, showing poor awareness and gambling excessively for steals. Hes a bit on the soft side in addition to being just an average athlete, although he did show very nice timing coming up with a couple of on-ball blocks. When he did play hard, he was very productive hitting the glass as well, not a surprise considering the quality of his hands, although like a lot of players his age (just a junior keep in mind), his good moments seemed to come in spurts.
Considering what we witnessed, its our guess that its only a matter of time before Clantons name shows up on the national radar screen, unless what we saw in Orlando was just a complete aberration to how he normally plays. After all, its not every day you see a big man with such an advanced skill set.
Unable to lead his team to much of anything in the wins column, this was a fairly disappointing tournament for recent-Louisville commit Jared Swopshire (#88 Scout, #149 Rivals). Regardless, its not hard to see what the recruiting services (and the big college programs) see in him. Swopshire is a 6-7 wing player with a great frame, long arms, and solid athletic abilitylooking the role of stud prospect even if he doesnt always play like one. Hes a clear-cut perimeter player, showing a nice looking jump-shot on the catch and shoot or even pulling up off the dribble, and the ability to put the ball on the floor a little and finish around the basket. Swopshire is still a pretty raw player, somewhat soft in his approach to the game, who looked pretty comfortable just fitting in even when his team needed him to do a little more than that. His ball-handling skills could use some work, and putting weight on his frame should clearly be a priority for him. He also wasnt really felt that much defensively or on the glass in the games we saw considering his physical tools. Potential seems to be the operative word here, so well have to wait and see how he develops.
A pretty raw point guard, junior Taariq Muhammad (unranked Scout, #90 Rivals) showed his potential as a prospect but also showed that he has quite a bit of work ahead of him over the next few years. Muhammad has nice size, long arms and a good frame, and is mostly a defensive oriented point guard who rarely looks to score. He controls the tempo fairly well at times and looks pretty under control, showing some budding leadership skills that will clearly come in handy as he continues to progress as a floor general. Hes a decent athlete with some wiggle in his game that hell use infrequently to create his own shot, but he looks most content moving the ball around the perimeter trying to feed his teammates (the most notable being Al-Farouq Aminu). Teams dared Muhammad to shoot the 3-pointer by going underneath screens, and he looked inexperienced (as you might guess considering his age) trying to deal with some pressure situations. Right now, its probably too early to tell about his long term potential, although there are surely a few things to like here.
Raffington is one of the younger players (born in 1991) of German Urspring Academy, but he looked to be one of the more intriguing players on the roster. Hes a very raw player, noticeably underdeveloped physically, but with some decent tools to play the game. Raffington has decent size to compliment his solid athletic ability, and a very nice wingspan. Hes active and aggressive, even though his lack of strength hinders him, and shows some budding signs of being comfortable playing on the perimeter, although hes not a skilled offensive player at all at this point. Hes a team player who is willing to do some dirty work inside (again relative to his strength limitations), and he hit a game winning shot for Urspring in the first day to put them over St. Jude. He still has another two years before hell be ready for college (if hes interested in taking that route), so hes a name to follow for the future.
A point guard from Luxembourg currently playing for German Urspring Academy, Wiesler shouldnt have too much of a problem finding a mid to high major school if coaches here were paying attention. Hes a smart, under control player who can shoot the ball with range and put the ball on the floor reasonably well, mostly to take advantage of unbalanced defenses going either way with some crafty moves. He plays under control and can find the open man, always looking to get others involved, but not having a problem taking some offensive responsibilities himself when the situation calls for it. Hes not terribly big, quick or strong, which might limit his long-term upside to a certain degree (particularly defensively), but he definitely has a nice feel for the game.
The best player the Germans had to offer, Standhardinger did a nice job showing off his value as a high-major collegiate prospect. Standhardinger is first and foremost a competitor, an extremely emotional player who feels the game and lives every moment of it. Hes a good athlete who is clearly most comfortable playing on the wing even though hes 6-8, where he can knife his way through defenses creating his own shot with superb aggressiveness. Standhardinger wants the ball in his hands and will look to score every time down the floor if given the opportunity to do so: he has a good first step and an excellent understanding of angles to get the job done. Hes also extremely unorthodox, jumping off the wrong foot in typical European style, finishing craftily around the hoop, and knowing how to provoke the refs into making a call that favors his team (for example with a flop).
Standhardinger is a tough kid, not being afraid to hit the deck to go after a loose ball, and usually being in the middle of any scrum that goes on during the course of the game. He moves off the ball well and seems to have a nose for the rim. He clearly has nice size for the small forward position, even if he might lack the lateral quickness to guard that spot on the other end of the floor.
On the downside, Standhardinger has quite a few holes in his game that need to be polished up before he can reach anywhere near his full potential. For one, his left hand is non-existent, making him pretty predictable eventually with his slashing moves going right. His perimeter shot is not a weapon for him at all from what we saw, and he doesnt seem to have a reliable pull-up jumper he can utilize to compensate for that. Defensively, his lateral quickness is pretty suspect as mentioned, so there is some concern that he might have to play the power forward position in college where he doesnt quite fit either due to his underdeveloped post-up game. These are all correctable weaknesses, but it will take time and plenty of work until Standhardinger gets there. Still, his potential is pretty intriguing considering he manages to be so productive even despite his obvious limitations. His passion for the game should carry him pretty far in the meantime.
Ursprings combo guard off the bench, Stuckey seems to have nice potential due to his nice physical tools. Hes a smooth player who looks first and foremost to score, showing nice body control, a good first step, and a pretty floater once he gets into the lane. He can shoot the 3-pointer with solid range, and is solid in transition where his athleticism comes in very handy. Stuckey needs to improve his point guard skills to reach anywhere near his full potential. He looked like a pretty streaky player who wasnt always up for the task when he was called off the bench. Still, hes very young and obviously has plenty time to develop his all-around game.
Another somewhat unheralded junior prospect from the state of Florida, Richie Edwards (non-top 150 prospect, Rivals or Scout) surely looked impressive in the one game we saw him here in Orlando. Edwards is a 6-7 small forward who played the 4 mostly in this tournament, although hes exclusively a wing player. He has good size, and is a very smooth athlete, capable of getting off the floor with ease to finish a play with a dunk. He is an active and aggressive player, competing non-stop on the glass and in the passing lanes, and coming up with steals and offensive rebounds in the process. He also looks fairly intelligent, showing a nice array of head and pump-fakes to get his man off balance, and the ability to pull-up off the dribble for a mid-range jumper. His 3-point stroke shot has nice potential, but is a bit streaky when rushed, and there are some questions about his ability to guard small forwards from what we were told. Regardless, Edwards looked like a nice player and someone who might break into the recruiting rankings at some point if keeps playing the way he did in Orlando.

Decision analytic model to analyze the costs with efficacy data obtained from 3 randomized controlled trials, the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), and the Vasodilator Heart Failure Trials I and II.
Effectiveness and costs were evaluated using a decision analytic model considering mortality and hospitalizations. Sensitivity analyses identified which variables (cost of drug, cost of hospitalization, efficacy of drug) were influential in determining incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. All costs are in 1992 US dollars.
In the base case analysis, the analysts assumed that treatment was continued for 10 years and that treatment efficacy lasted for 10 years. The model predicted that treating patients with hydralazine-isosorbide therapy would save an additional 8 days of life with a marginal cost of $119 (the overall cost of treating a patient with hydralazine-isosorbide therapy minus the costs averted by fewer hospitalizations compared with standard therapy), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5600 per year of life saved. The additional cost of a patient treated with enalapril compared with the hydralazine-isosorbide combination was $2569 and the gain in life was 3 months, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $9700 per year of life saved. The results of the analysis were minimally sensitive to the duration of vasodilator efficacy, the effectiveness of treatment, or variations in risk reduction.
The gain in longevity per patient from enalapril relative to the hydralazine-isosorbide combination or no vasodilator therapy (3 months) was similar to gains from other widely used medications, whereas the additional cost per year of life saved (approximately $10 000) was relatively small compared with other commonly used treatments.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors directly reduce vasoconstriction caused by angiotensin II. They also may inhibit degradation of the endogenous vasodilator bradykinin. These effects make ACE inhibitors valuable in treating CHF and hypertension and in slowing the decline of renal function in persons with diabetes . Several large trials have shown decreases in mortality among persons with CHF and improvement in their quality of life, with some studies using enalapril as the ACE inhibitor (1-3).
Paul and colleagues used decision analysis and economic models to show that enalapril therapy was more expensive but more effective than a hydralazine-isosorbide regimen. Because the study relied on data from randomized trials, its inferences are strong. Other researchers have reached similar conclusions (1).
Little reason exists to doubt that other ACE inhibitors would be similarly cost-effective. If the price of enalapril decreased or if other efficiencies were identified, the regimen might decrease costs in addition to prolonging life. The enhancement of the quality of life, at least for the first 2 to 3 years, makes this therapy even more attractive (1). This quality-of-life-enhancing effect has not been shown in patients with asymptomatic CHF, although the SOLVD study (3) did show a delay in the time to development of symptoms for patients taking enalapril.
The subject of auto repair is something that has proved elusive to many people who would prefer to cross their fingers and hope their car keeps running smoothly. The key to automotive confidence lies within the acquisition of a good body of knowledge when it comes to car repairs and maintenance. The article that follows below serves as a good starting point for learning about this important topic.
When taking your car to a repair service, make sure that you have all documentation handy. This is important as you do not want the mechanic to do tasks that have already been performed on your car. This can help you save a lot of time and money with your repair.
You don’t always need a repair-person for your car troubles. There are a few things that you can fix easily yourself. If you’re feeling lucky, look online to figure out the problem. If it’s a quick repair to make, you can save yourself some cash by doing it yourself.
To prevent your car from getting rusty, wash it consistently. Rust is an inevitability, but you can stave it off for a good while. Utilize quality waxes to keep the paint looking new.
Have you noticed that your headlights aren’t shining very brightly? If so, ensure you are cleaning them regularly. Sometimes a greasy residue from the road can be deposited one the lights and hold dirt that reduces the amount of light they put out. Use a quality glass cleaner to keep your lights clean.
Ask if your intended mechanic is experienced with the make and model of your car. Basic components are usually the same, but things like hood space vary by brand. Do not hesitate to take your vehicle to a dealership to have experienced mechanics work on it.
Avoid fluffy, silly keychains, or find a way to separate your auto key from that bunch of keys on the chain! The ignition in your car can’t withstand too much extra weight, even if that weight doesn’t seem excessive to you. Heavy keys become sticky keys which leads to tumbler replacement.
Rotate your car tires every 6,000 miles or at every other oil change. Rotating your tires on a set schedule helps ensure that they wear evenly, and thus last longer. Your car will also be easier to drive, as unbalanced tires can lead to the car pulling to one side or the other.
You do not have to have repairs done at the auto dealer. There are many shops where skilled auto technicians reside. Trust someone that you’re comfortable with.
Watch for warning signs with a mechanic. There are a few signs to look for when you speak with them about your car. If they try talking really fast about the necessary repairs, can’t look you in the eye when talking to you, or try to brush you off, you should find another mechanic. They may be hiding something or they may only care about the money.
When car problems strike, there is no need to worry. As long as you have a sufficient understanding of proper auto repair methods and techniques, you will be able to get your car back on the road in short order. Review the above information as needed, and you will always know how to handle a crisis with your vehicle.…

Have you noticed all the stressed babies? Maybe one in 30 I see has glowing eyes, which I take as a sign of thriving. What's up? Perhaps ignorance about babies and their needs. Here are 10 things to know.
1. Babies are social mammals with social mammalian needs. Social mammals emerged more than 30 million years ago with intensive parenting (a developmental nest or niche). This is one of the many (extra-genetic) things that evolved other than genes. This developmental nest is required for an individual to develop properly. Intensive parenting practices for babies include years of breastfeeding to develop brain and body systems, nearly constant touch and physical presence of caregivers, responsiveness to needs preventing distress, free play with multi-aged playmates, and soothing perinatal experiences. Each of these has significant effects on physical health.
2. Human babies are born "half-baked" and require an external womb. Humans are born way early compared to other animals: 9 months early in terms of mobility and 18 months early in terms of bone development and foraging capacities. Full-term babies have 25% of adult brain volume and most of it grows in the first 5 years. Thus, the human nest for its young evolved to be even more intense than for other social mammals because of the underdeveloped newborn, lasting for 3-5 years. Humans also added to the list of expected care a village of positive social support for both mother and baby. Actually, human brain development lasts into the third decade of life, suggesting that social support and mentoring continue at least that long.
3. If adults mess up on the post-birth “baking,” longterm problems can result. Each of the caregiving practices mentioned above has longterm effects on the physical health but also social health of the individual. For example, distressing babies regularly or intensively (by not giving them what they need) undermines self-regulatory systems. This is common knowledge in other cultures and was so in our past. In Spanish, there is a term used for adolescents and adults who misbehave: malcriado (misraised).
4. Babies thrive on affectionate love. When babies receive food and diaper changes and little else, they die. If they receive partial attention and stay alive, it is still not enough—they won’t reach their full potential. Urie Bronfenbrenner, who emphasized the multiple systems of support that foster optimal development, said that babies do best when at least one person is crazy about them. Others have noted that children grow best with three affectionate, consistent caregivers. In fact, babies expect more than mom and dad for loving care. Babies are ready for a community of close, responsive caregivers that includes mother nearby.
5. Babies’ right hemisphere of the brain is developing rapidly in the first three years. The right hemisphere develops in response to face-to-face social experience, with extended shared eye gaze. The right hemisphere governs self-regulatory systems. If babies are placed in front of screens, ignored or isolated, they are missing critical experiences.
6. Babies expect to play and move. Babies expect to be “in arms” or on the body of the caregiver most of the time. Skin-to-skin contact is a calming influence. After learning this one of my students when at a family gathering took a crying baby and held it to his neck, which calmed it down. Babies expect companionship not isolation or intrusion. They expect to be in the middle of community social life. They are ready to play from birth. Play is a primary method for learning self-control and social skills. Companionship care—friendship, mutual responsiveness and playfulness—builds social and practical intelligence. Babies and caregivers share intersubjective states, building the child’s capacities for the interpersonal “dances” that fill social life.
7. Babies have built-in warning systems. If they are not getting what they need, babies let you know. It is best, as most cultures have long known, to respond to a baby’s grimace or gesture and not to wait till crying occurs. Young babies have difficulty stopping crying once it starts. The best advice for baby care is to sensitively follow the baby, not the experts.
8. Babies lock their experiences into procedural memory vaults that will be inaccessible but apparent in later behavior and attitudes. Babies can be traumatized from neglecting the list of needs above. They won’t forget. It will undermine their trust of others, their health and social wellbeing, and lead to self-centered morality which can do much destruction to the world.
9. Culture does not erase the evolved needs babies have. Babies cannot retract their mammalian needs. Yet, some adult cultures advocate violating evolved baby needs as if they do not matter and despite the protests of the baby. Everyday violations include baby isolation like sleeping alone, “crying it out” sleep training, infant formula, or baby videos and flashcards.* When violations occur regularly, at critical time periods or are intense, they undermine optimal development. These violations are encoded in the baby’s body as the optimal development of systems is undermined (e.g., immunity, neurotransmitters, endocrine systems like oxytocin). Surprisingly, some developmental psychologists think it fine to violate these needs** in order for the child to fit into their culture.
The rationalization of “culture over biology” reflects a lack of understanding not only of human nature but of optimal development. This has occurred in laboratories with other animals whose natures were misunderstood. For example, Harry Harlow, known for his experiments with monkeys and “mother love,” at first did not realize he was raising abnormal monkeys when he isolated them in cages. Similarly, at least one of the aggressive rat strains used in lab studies today was first created when scientists isolated offspring after birth, again not realizing the abnormality of isolation. Note how the cultural assumptions of the scientists created the abnormal animals. So it matters what cultural assumptions you have.
The culture-over-biology view may be doing the same thing with human beings. By not understanding babies and their needs, we are creating species-atypical human beings. We can only know this to be the case in light of knowledge about human beings who develop under evolved conditions (the "developmental nest" described in point 1): typically, small-band hunter-gatherers. They are much wiser, perceptive and virtuous than we humans in the USA today (see NOTE below).
10. Experiences that consistently violate evolution undermine human nature. When species-atypical childrearing occurs, we end up with people whose health and sociality are compromised (which we can see all over the USA today with epidemics of depression, anxiety, high suicide and drug use rates***). Such mis-raised creatures might do all right on achievement tests or IQ measures but they may also be dangerous reptiles whose world revolves around themselves. A lot of smart reptiles (“snakes in suits”) on Wall Street and elsewhere have been running the country into the ground.
(2) Be aware of the needs of babies around you and interact sensitively with the babies you encounter.
(3) Support parents to be sensitive to the needs of their babies. This will also require many more institutional and social supports for families with children, including extensive parental leave which other developed nations provide. It's an uphill battle right now but raising awareness is the first step.
* Note that sometimes violations (e.g., formula, isolation) are required under emergency conditions that are matters of life and death. Also note: In a way, USA culture forces parents into these violations because there is no extended family or community support to help provide for all the many needs of a baby.
**Of course they don’t think it’s a violation because they don’t take the set of mammalian needs seriously.
*** In the USA, everyone under 50 has numerous health disadvantages compared to citizens in 16 other developed nations (National Research Council, 2013).
NOTE: Of course, every human community is not perfect but when you provide young children with their basic needs, they are less aggressive and self-centered. They are less preoccupied with what they want because they got all they wanted when they needed it in early life. The baby nest described above makes for a smart, healthy, well-functioning body and brain, with high emotional intelligence and self control. They are more socially skilled and empathic towards others. All this makes getting along with others so much easier. All this will have to be explained more thoroughly in another post, citing the anthropology research that shows what people in small-band hunter-gatherer communities are like.
NOTE on BASIC ASSUMPTIONS: When I write about parenting, I assume the importance of the evolved developmental niche (EDN) for raising human infants (which initially arose over 30 million years ago with the emergence of the social mammals and has been slightly altered among human groups based on anthropological research).
The EDN is the baseline I use for determining what fosters optimal human health, wellbeing and compassionate morality. The niche includes at least the following: infant-initiated breastfeeding for several years, nearly constant touch, responsiveness to needs so the young child does not get distressed, playful companionship, multiple adult caregivers, positive social support, and natural childbirth.
All these characteristics are linked to health in mammalian and human studies (see Narvaez, Panksepp, Schore & Gleason, 2013, for a review.) Thus, shifts away from the EDN baseline are risky. My comments and posts stem from these basic assumptions.
Please walk beside me through this day. Clear the heavy air with the lightness of Your Presence. Guide my hands and steady my heart that I may give comfort when I cannot give hope, that I may give relief when I do not have a cure, and that I may radiate Your healing peace when the limits of science, time, and the human body overwhelm us all.

MODERN TAKE: Dear Mister Shakespeare was commissioned by the British Council and the GREAT Britain campaign
THIS MONTH, Dear Mister Shakespeare, a short film commissioned by the British Council and the GREAT Britain campaign launches in celebration of Black History Month.
As the UK’s principal cultural relations organisation, the British Council operates across more than 100 countries and territories worldwide, connecting millions of people with the UK through programmes and services in the arts, English language and education.
This is part of a collection commissioned for Shakespeare Lives, a global programme celebrating William Shakespeare’s legacy on the 400th anniversary of his death.
Inspired by the English writer’s tragic play, Othello, Dear Mister Shakespeare takes the form of a rhetorical letter to Shakespeare. The film is written and performed by Kenyan-born, London-based filmmaker and visual artist, Phoebe Boswell and directed by Shola Amoo, a graduate of the National Film and Television School.
Together, they challenged and engaged with Shakespeare’s famous Moor – who is often portrayed as a black character – bringing to the fore Shakespeare’s ability to both stereotype and subvert audience expectations.
Phoebe: Shakespeare really examined the inherent nature of people - our weaknesses, strengths, prejudices, glories - which is why his work is timeless, and has consistently been revisited, reworked, and renewed. I think it is always useful to look to history to understand how to progress.
What was fascinating, alarming, disappointing, and deeply important to me when exploring how Shakespeare wrote Othello in the 1600s, was that even though the historic atrocities that constructed these racial power imbalances that still haunt and govern us today hadn’t yet occurred, the fear of the ‘dark other’ was still present. That’s a lot to think about, when contemplating what progress and a redressing of racial power imbalance might look like in the future.
Shola: I saw the play as an ongoing conversation; the racial themes in Othello resonate strongly within our society today. A key importance of Shakespeare’s writing is the ability for different generations and cultures to reinterpret his work.
The play’s contemporary relevance was clear to me in an age of rising racial inequality and rising black consciousness, represented by Black Lives Matter and other equal rights groups. The concept of the fear of the “other” is also visible in the UK today in the anti-Islamic and anti-immigration rhetoric within the far right and unfortunately much of our mainstream media.
My aim with the film was to play with the contemporary perception of the “other”, our fears our misconceptions, framed by the play’s historical context. I wanted to create a visual exploration of the unique nature of blackness in the UK inspired by similar thematic work made in the USA.
Phoebe: Ira Aldridge was one of the first black actors to play Othello and that was met with outrage by many. Paul Robeson spoke passionately about how important a role Othello is for the black actor. It remains perhaps the most important role. This of course then brings up the lack of central roles for black actors and how #oscarssowhite and the lack of visibility for black actors still permeates so heavily.
We are still lumbered with the issues surrounding blackness in white spaces, and the pressures of black masculinity, which are so inherent in Othello. I just wanted to question and draw parallels to all these things in our contemporary time. And so I wrote this rhetorical letter to Shakespeare, asking him about his process of construction in the ‘drawing’ of the character.
Shola: Yes, it’s an integral part of my practice. My identity shifts and morphs on a daily basis and requires constant questioning and critique, which I explore through my work. I’m interested in how individuals manage the relationship between their identities and the societal meta-narrative, which governs how we are all perceived.
Phoebe: My identity affects my practice, in a sense that it informs it. Navigating the complexity and nuance of ‘identity’ is central to my work; with a personal history defined by transient middle points and patterns of migration. My work is anchored in an exploration of the notion of ‘home’, what it means to belong or not to belong, and in the fluid state of diasporic consciousness.

Contact Action Karate for all of your Nazareth, Bethlehem, Easton, and surrounding area karate needs.
I’ve decided to throw a Halloween party again this year, and I’ve offered my guests an optional theme: undead Disney. Basically, they are supposed to choose a Disney character and make that character undead (e.g. zombie Snow White or vampire Mickey).
I chose Tinkerbell, a fairy from the 1953 Disney animated film Peter Pan. So naturally, my significant other is going to be Peter Pan. (He’s a good sport, considering that means we’re both going to be wearing tights and a green dress.) And our dog, Oreo, is going to be Tick-Tock.
Who’s Tick-Tock, you ask? Tick-Tock the crocodile that eats Captain Hook’s hand, as well as an alarm clock (hence the name). In fact, Tick Tock tries to eat pretty much everything he sees. That’s one reason why I thought he’d be a fitting character for Oreo to portray.
According to Disney Wikia, Tick-Tock was born 20 years before the events of Peter Pan, hatching on the shores of Neverland and adopted by the a fairy named Rosetta. Years later, Peter Pan cut off Captain Hook’s hand while in battle, then proceeded to feed the hand to Tick-Tock as a snack.
Sometimes when you look into the details of Disney stories, they’re a bit shocking, to say the least. For example, the entire premise of 101 Dalmatians is that a rich woman wants the pelts of 101 dalmatian puppies to make a fur coat. And did you realize that in Junglebook,the reason the boy Mowgli is making friends with a bear in the first place is because his village was attacked by a tiger? In the Little Mermaid, a bitter sea witch is turning people into immobile slugs, and in The Lion King, the villain orchestrates the death of his brother, then is killed by his nephew.
I love all of these movies. But you have to admit, a Disney-themed Halloween party is starting to make more and more sense.
So for costumes, I successfully sewed a sparkly, lime green Tinkerbell dress (after two pathetic prototypes), then moved on to transform my dog into Tick-Tock, a giant saltwater crocodile.
Cut the back bigger than the front because it has to stretch over the dog’s entire back, which compared to its chest, is much wider and longer.
I found felt and fleece scraps in three different shades of green at a Marden’s discount and surplus store, then got to work. I was able to make a rough pattern by examining a few dog coats I purchased for Oreo in the past, but eventually, I had to rely on Oreo being a good boy and remaining still as I pinned the cloth in the right places.
Basically, I made Oreo a tank top. (Dogs typically don’t like things on their heads, tails or feet, but some dogs, such as Oreo, don’t mind shirts/coats.)
Make it like you would a human tank top, with seams running up the sides. This means you’ll have to cut a front piece and a back piece, then sew them together.
In general, you’ll cut these pieces in the shape of a tank top. But dogs are shaped differently than humans. You’ll want to make the back piece longer and wider than the front piece. Why? The back piece will cover up the dog’s entire back, while the front piece should stop at the end of the rib cage so the dog doesn’t catch it with its back feet or pee on it.
To cut these pieces, you can measure your dog, or you can guess. I suggest cutting the two halves of the tank top so that they’re bigger than you think they should be. You can always cut it down. Also, the seams will eat up about an inch of the edges.
Use your dog as a model. You might be surprised how big of a neck your dog has. You may need to make adjustments.
Pin the two halves together, lining up their edges, on the sides and the shoulders (both sides of the neck), then sew (using a machine or stitching by hand). Materials such as felt and fleece are very easy to sew by hand.
The tank top should be a little loose so you can actually put it on your dog (head first, then the legs, one at a time).
If you want, you can sew an elastic into the front, along the bottom edge, so that its snug to your dog’s chest/stomach.
I understand that as far as sewing instructions go, those were pretty terrible. But at least you get an idea of my general thought process when trying to create something that I don’t actually know how to create. In other words, if I can do it, you can do it.
After constructing the basic dog tank top, light green on the bottom and dark green on top (like a crocodile), I made a ridge of spikes along the back of the costume with a long dark strip of cloth, which I sewed, cut and stuffed until satisfied. (I have no idea how to explain what I did.)
I was tickled with my creation until I realized that for some reason, Oreo looked more like a dinosaur than a crocodile. So I studied the photos of Tick-Tock again and realized that he has two ridges of spikes running down his back! I then looked at photos of real crocodiles and, indeed, they have two parallel ridges. Darn. Since I made the spikes smack dab in the middle of Oreo’s costume, there was no way I could fix it.
Luckily, Disney created a film in 2000 called Dinosaur, so I’ll pretend that’s what I was aiming for all along.
As for making Oreo undead, I’m not sure it’s wise to put fake blood on a dog and let him loose at a party. But I suppose, since Oreo will now be a dinosaur, it’s kind of a given that he’s undead, since that particular group of animals went into extinction millions of years ago.
Anyway, Oreo will be going to a kennel for the party. He’s not great with crowds of people he doesn’t know. Nevertheless, I wanted to include him in the theme. And now he has an awesome new outfit that you can bet he’ll wear regardless of whether it’s Halloween or not.
For an explanation for why Oreo wears coats this time of year and throughout winter, visit my posts: “Bangor business blends love of dogs and fashion” and “How cold is too cold for dogs?”

Chinese New Year. Sometime around late January or early February of each year is a holiday that is widely celebrated in Asian countries. This year it’s on Feb 8, 2016. If you are in the Philippines, you would most likely hear “Kung Hei Fat Choy” or other similar Chinese New Year greetings not just in Chinatown Manila but also its outskirts.
This is because the ethnic Chinese has become a huge part of Filipino culture, as manifested in food, language, and traditions. Just recently, Chinese New Year has been declared one of the non-working holidays of the Philippines. Hence, even non-Chinese Filipinos are quite familiar with Chinese New Year traditions.
Chinese New Year in the Philippines is celebrated pretty much the same way as in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and...
Why You Should Visit Samal Island. I’ve also written an article about Samal island for The Australia Times Travel Magazine. You can read more about this beautiful island there too. Hopefully, this would inspire you even more to visit Samal island. And oh, that’s the first time my article got featured in an international travel magazine so I’m really happy!
Why You Should Visit Samal Island. I know very little of Samal Island before. All I know was, it’s where the popular high-end resort, the Pearl Farm Beach Resort, is located. I happily discovered that this island is more than just Pearl Farm.
This had been only my second time in Mindanao. During the first time, I visited Cagayan de Oro, Camiguin and Bukdinon...
Camiguin Island. Measuring about 29 hectares, Camiguin Island is the second smallest island of the Philippine archipelago. The island is only about 23 kilometers long and 14 kilometers wide and is located about 90 kilometers north of Cagayan de Oro in Northern Mindanao.
Camiguin may be minuscule in size but huge in terms of topography. In it lie no fewer than seven volcanoes. Interestingly, this tiny pear-shaped island province had been formed by natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
The province has five towns and a very low population of about 75,000. The rich volcanic soil has given the province a lot of fertile ground conducive for vegetables and fruits. Its people boast of a very colorful and creative culture made up of various Visayan traditions.

Share my excitement and my discoveries as I delve ever deeper into the world of prints and printmakers
The painter and etcher Frederick Warren Freer was born in 1849 in Kennicott's Grove, Illinois, now part of Chicago. He studied art in Chicago before attending the Munich Academy under Wagner and Diez. Well-respected in his own day, Freer seems to be largely forgotten now, but I rank him among the most interesting of the New York Etching Club artists.
My only print by Frederick W. Freer is an evocative and tranquil scene in Polling, Bavaria, where Freer joined Frank Duveneck and his students in the summer of 1879. It is executed largely in drypoint, with great subtlety of tone. So far as I can tell Freer's preferred subjects in his paintings were intimate interiors with a mother and child, using his own wife and children as models, but he also painted landscapes. Freer returned to the USA in 1880, living in New York until 1890 when he returned to Chicago to become President of the Chicago Academy of Design. He died in Chicago in 1908.
I didn't know anything about Freer before reading this, but the New York Etchers belonged to a generation that started clubs everywhere they went. Shortly after the Moran clan began summering at Easthampton, an art colony sprang up there that included many of their friends. Ronald Pisano's "Long Island Landscape Painting" in two volumes, )1985 & 1990) includes many of these artists. Pisano was an independent scholar who would have loved the internet, but he died quite young.
Jane - I have both of Ronald Pisano's volumes, but haven't looked at them for probably 20 years - I will look them out. Thanks for the tip.
Neil, I used to have Pisano's books, including "The Tile Club", but I gave them to the library. I still take them out from time to time.
Needless to say (to those who know my book storage problems) I haven't been able to find them - they must be boxed up.
I am a writer who also runs the online original print gallery Idbury Prints. Among my books are Mythology (with Philip Wilkinson), English Folktales, The Cinderella Story, Victorian Village Life, and The New Oxford Book of Children's Verse.

On September 8, I had the privilege of participating on a panel regarding portfolio construction (“Beyond the 60/40 Portfolio”) at the Morningstar ETF Conference in Chicago. Not surprisingly, there were a lot of terrific discussions, and I took tons of detailed notes. One of my favorite sessions was the “Best Ideas” panel, which featured Mark Yusko of Morgan Creek Capital Management, John West of Research Affiliates, and Rich Bernstein of RBA. Morningstar’s Jeff Ptak did a great job moderating the panel.
As promised, I shared some of my notes from the Best Ideas panel in Friday’s On My Radar. More to come from the conference later this week. Stay tuned!

This presentation does not discuss, directly or indirectly, the amount of the profits or losses, realized or unrealized, by any CMG client from any specific funds or securities.

Hypothetical Presentations: To the extent that any portion of the content reflects hypothetical results that were achieved by means of the retroactive application of a back-tested model, such results have inherent limitations, including: (1) the model results do not reflect the results of actual trading using client assets, but were achieved by means of the retroactive application of the referenced models, certain aspects of which may have been designed with the benefit of hindsight; (2) back-tested performance may not reflect the impact that any material market or economic factors might have had on the adviser’s use of the model if the model had been used during the period to actually mange client assets; and, (3) CMG’s clients may have experienced investment results during the corresponding time periods that were materially different from those portrayed in the model.

Included are the common stocks of industrial, financial, utility, and transportation companies. The historical performance results of the S&P (and those of or all indices) and the model results do not reflect the deduction of transaction and custodial charges, nor the deduction of an investment management fee, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing indicated historical performance results. For example, the deduction combined annual advisory and transaction fees of 1.00% over a 10 year period would decrease a 10% gross return to an 8.9% net return. The S&P is not an index into which an investor can directly invest. The historical S&P performance results (and those of all other indices) are provided exclusively for comparison purposes only, so as to provide general comparative information to assist an individual in determining whether the performance of a specific portfolio or model meets, or continues to meet, his/her investment objective(s).

CMG portfolios may be more or less volatile than the reflective indices and/or models.
In the event that there has been a change in an individual's investment objective or financial situation, he/she is encouraged to consult with his/her investment professionals.

Water makes up 60 to 70% of our bodies Minerals, proteins, sugars, and other substances dissolve in this water forming colloids, which carry a subtile electrical charge. Thus water provides the electrical life force in all living things.
Even dispersed into a fine mist, water continues to carry this vital life force, maintaining its potency and power. It is literally good to the last drop.
Since water is alive it continuously needs to regenerate itself by dewing in a spiral or vortex motion which we see in the shape of a tornado's funnel.
Water is the potent in its densest state at a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius Above or below this magic temperature, water loses its maximum strength and absorbent ability. In its most potent form in forests or mountain streams, water is near 4 degrees Celsius but as it heats up, it becomes stagnant and powerless.
To be alive, water must be allowed, first, the freedom to flow in its characteristic spiral motion, and second, the freedom to approach its optimal cool temperature, of 4 degrees Celsius. The primary need of water to roll in a 3-dimensional, vortex causes river to meander in a gentle to-and-fro motion. The water naturally swings to one bank of a river, turns and moves across to the opposite bawls and then singing around again in a dancing rhythm of constant motion. Within every [lowing stream, water constantly circles in small vortices called eddies. Water desires to coil itself up and spin around an invisible internal shaft like a speeding wheel The same movement is seen in the waves of the ocean constantly rolling in spiral movements.
This rolling motion causes water to gather electrical force. As water moves across the Earth it cools itself and increases its internal power. Water stores this potential energy within itself and then gives the energy freely to all-living things. Through this perpetual motion, water constantly exposes its "skin" to the air. Thus it constantly spins around upon itself like a whirling top.
Just like a spinster spinning her thread, Mother Nature attempts to twist water into a thread of life, which then becomes a sparkling strand of living electricity. We see this electricity as glimmering threads of light in swift mountain streams, especially on cold moonlit nights. Victor Schauberger an Austrian forester and expert on water, demonstrated how running water has the capacity to excite and illuminate light bulbs using this principle inherent in water.
The centripetal, inward-directed movement of water causes it to become rejuvenated and creates the sucking action evident in a whirlpool. As the water accelerates more toward the center of the vortex, the electrical potential increases to very high levels. This concentrated power within water can become the power of future technology -- the vortex power of water
The greatest damage that can be done to water is to straighten out its natural meanderings. An example is the Rhine River, which was straightened causing it to flow faster. Erosion resulted. Moreover, the eroded soil became toxic wherever it was deposited and thus could not be used for crop growth. When rivers are straightened' the water tends to die. The Danube River was "regulated" and forced to flow along man made channels causing the water to lose its ability to sustain life. In addition, the river level steadily dropped.
A more common way that we destroy water is by pumping it through straight pipes into our homes and offices. When healthy spring water is pumped by conventional centrifugal pumps under pressure, it rapidly loses its energy and electrical potential. It then becomes the breeding ground for microorganisms and bacteria which must be eradicated with toxic chemicals such as chlorine and fluorine. Unfortunately, the unwary American consumes this chemically treated, dead water. Furthermore, American farmers constantly pour tons of devitalized water onto their crops, stunting growth and vitality.
Human arrogance causes us to try to conquer Mother Nature rather than to learn form her. Luckily we can learn from her. We can regenerate water by swirling and coiling it in its characteristic spiral motion It then undergoes a diamagnetic energy transformation and regains its electricity, its good tasted, and its life-giving power
When water is brought to fields in canals and pipes that allow the water to flow in a natural meandering spiral fashion, crop fields have increased by 30 to 40%. Water thus delivered using the principle of vortex flow has turned salty marshes and sour swamps into productive sweet soils
If we do not make use of this knowledge, pollution will destroy water. Many aquifers and ground waters in America are now polluted. If we destroy water, we destroy ourselves. We must care for water and keep it alive simply because it is nonrenewable. No Life can exist on Earth without clean, healthy water. Therefore it is absolutely essential to keep water alive.
Yet our current technology is almost exclusively built on the principle of exploding centrifugal forces which lead towards the destruction of Nature and eventually the death of Earth. The combustion engine in every car, bus, and truck is a perfect example of this principle. This engine is only one side of Nature's law of motion.
The other side is the up building force contained in the principle of implosion centripetal, inward-directed movement which constantly renews life and supports growth
Every surfer has experienced the vortex power in action. Living water is a constant rolling exchange of gravity and levity The waves move rapidly, and yet the water remains relatively still In this paradox is the magic of water and the life that it gives.
It is this magic in water that causes its own natural purification In Stockholm there is a beautiful example of this process. Sewage treatment plants are located in a park where people walk, play and have picnics. Natures biological systems are at work treating the water. Micro-organisms break down the organic matter which remains after the solid non biodegradable materials have been removed.
A Similar process is to be used to treat the terribly polluted water of Providence, Rhode Island. As a result, 99 to 100% of the toxins are removed. Micro-organisms in the roots of reeds in the water break down the organic matter. Sludge is aerated and over 90% of the solids are reduced. The plants even eliminated some heavy metals by retaining these metals in the reed stalks.
Vortex technology can be used to rebuild America's agriculture. The same destructive power of water that is demonstrated in tornadoes and hurricanes can now be harnessed for the service of all humanity. The power inherent in the cyclonic movement of water can become the source of unlimited power in our future technology.
We need to listen to the lesson Mother Nature shows us. If we learn from the natural movement of water, we will be able to save our ailing Earth. In water we can see not only the illness but also the cure if we are willing to learn the lessons Nature offers.
The spiral vortex is reflected in every movement of the universe from the shape of the galaxies down through storm clod formations to the swirl of the ear, the pumping of the hart, and the tremendous power in atomic and subatomic matter. The science of tomorrow will be based on the principle of life - the principle of implosion and the geometry of the vortex.
If we are willing to learn Mother Nature's lesson, water will again be honoured as the magic source of life.
"Since water is alive it continuously needs to regenerate itself by dewing in a spiral or vortex motion which we see in the shape of a tornado's funnel."
"A more common way that we destroy water is by pumping it through straight pipes into our homes and offices. When healthy spring water is pumped by conventional centrifugal pumps under pressure, it rapidly loses its energy and electrical potential."

Vaccination is one of public health’s greatest achievements, but today’s sociopolitical climate promotes unfounded fears. In turn, this fear-mongering has led to outbreaks of otherwise rare infectious diseases, such as measles and whooping cough. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines protect against two HPV strains that cause 70 percent of cervical cancers, which itself is the second-most common type of cancer in women worldwide. Immunization has the potential to eliminate these viral strains, which would save lives and reduce health care costs — but, unfortunately, vaccine horror stories are a dime a dozen on the Internet, and HPV vaccines like Gardasil are popular targets for vaccine opponents.
Of 57 million Gardasil doses given in the United States, 40 confirmed deaths have occurred in recipients. However, these deaths were not caused by vaccination.
There are many claims flying around that Gardasil causes serious side effects, including death. However, claims that Gardasil can lead to death aren’t supported by good evidence. Generally speaking, people who make these accusations obtain their information from a publicly accessible database called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which collects claims of adverse events from anyone — including health care providers, patients, or family members.
Most people don’t realize that the phrase “adverse event” cannot be used interchangeably with the term “side effect.” An adverse event is something that occurs after a vaccination — such as a headache, seizure, depression, or death. It could happen one second after being injected with a vaccine or more than a year afterward. It could be a coincidence, or it might be caused by vaccination. For example, if two weeks after receiving a flu shot I get a headache, I could legitimately claim it is an “adverse event,” even if my headache had nothing to do with the shot. An adverse event is only called a side effect if it is found to have been caused by vaccination.
Despite its occasional misrepresentation in print media, social media, and the blogosphere, VAERS is not a source of information about verified side effects — it is a database of adverse events that have been self-reported by the public. Anyone can submit a report to VAERS — heck, I could claim that the flu shot gave me telekinetic powers in addition to that headache, and it would be recorded in the database. That doesn’t mean that you should worry about coming down with a nasty case of telekinesis after getting a flu shot at the corner drug store. Continue reading →

EADN is a partner of the GDN. The EADN Steering Committee nominates its representative to serve on the GDN Board of Directors. The first representative was Dr Kyung Tae Lee, President of the Korean Institute of International Economic Policy who served until late 2001 when he became the Korean ambassador to the OECD. The EADN Steering Committee then nominated Dr Chalongphob Sussangkarn, President of the Thailand Development Research Institute, to represent EADN. After Dr. Chalongphob’s term ended in December 2005, Dr. Carolina G. Hernandez was selected to represent EADN for a period of 3 years. Currently, Mohamed Ariff from Malaysia Institute of Economic Research represents EADN on the GDN Board of Directors.
Dr Chia Siow Yue, Director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore is the founding Regional Coordinator of EADN and her institute served as the EADN Secretariat. When Dr Chia retired as Director of ISEAS and moved to the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA), the EADN Secretariat was relocated to SIIA.
At its 10 October 2003 meeting, the EADN Steering Committee accepted Dr Chia's proposal to rotate the EADN Regional Coordinator and Secretariat on a periodic basis among the EADN member economies. It was agreed that each Regional Coordinator and Secretariat would henceforth serve a five-year term. The new Regional Coordinator and Secretariat would be appointed on a competitive basis. The eligibility criteria and terms of reference were drawn up with the guidance of the GDN Director. The call for proposals were posted on the EADN and GDN websites and EADN country coordinators were asked to canvass among their member institutes for possible candidates, who would have to submit proposals to the EADN Secretariat. A selection committee comprising the GDN Director, the EADN Regional Coordinator and the Asian Development Bank Chief Economist agreed to accept the proposal from Dr Chalongphob Sussangkarn of the Thailand Development Research Institute.
The EADN Steering Committee endorsed the appointment of the new Regional Coordinator and Secretariat at a special meeting on 10 July 2004. The transfer to the Thailand Development Research Institute was thus effected on 1 September 2004.
As of July 2010, the coordination of EADN was transferred to Dr Josef Yap and the secretariat moved to the Philippine Institute for Development Studies in Manila. Dr Yap will serve as Regional Coordinator for five years.
EADN is governed by a Steering Committee comprising of the Regional Coordinator (Chairman) and country coordinators. The Steering Committee meets once a year during the EADN Annual Forum. In between, communications and decisions are by email. The Steering Committee assists the Regional Coordinator with the governance of EADN.
Country coordinators are nominated by member institutes of their respective countries during the Second EADN Forum in June 2000 and serve an indefinite term. They assist the Regional Coordinator in disseminating information from the EADN Secretariat and GDN, process applications for EADN membership, and identify resource persons and researchers for GDN and EADN research projects.

The Adidas Yeezy Boost is the first Kanye West sneaker from adidas. The shoes are officially called the Adidas 750 Boost and was released in limited numbers on February 14th for $350. A second release will take place on February 21st on adidas.com. The worldwide release took place on February 28th and restocks are expected over the next few months. The Adidas Yeezy Boost Sale has fulfilled expectations. adidas created the Confirmed app to avoid release hysteria and still, people are already camping out in Europe a full work week ahead of when the shoe is scheduled to hit overseas on February 28th. The chukka-like aesthetic has made headlines for the wrong reasons recently with a faulty zipper unit breaking prematurely, but the three stripes seem to have fixed the issue. Kanye recently revealed that a black pair of the adidas Yeezy Boost is planned, and here we see a mixture of both worlds as the grey suede upper sees a variation of a black outsole. The upper of the Yeezy 3 remains unchanged expect for minute details like a premium gold zipper, black velcro accents on the strap and upper shroud, and of course the shoe’s bottom. Check out more of this early Yeezy sample after the break and let us know if you’re a fan of the alternate black sole by penning your thoughts in the comments.

VirusTotal is an excellent online virus scanner that analyzes your files with 40 different antivirus engines.
VirusTotal comes in handy especially handy when you don’t have any desktop antivirus app installed on the computer, or you need an extra layer of security for certain files. All you need to do is upload the file to the VirusTotal site via a simple form and wait for the results. If the same file has been recently submitted to VirusTotal, the system will give you the chance to review the analysis, instead of scanning it again.
The whole process can take a while, depending on the file size and the current workload on VirusTotal’s servers. You can see the results in real time, as the file is scanned by all the antivirus engines. The final report includes the complete list of results from 40 antivirus engines, plus user comments and tags – if available for that program.
You can leave user comments anonymously, but if you join the VirusTotal community – which is free – you’ll be able to sign them with your username, see safety ratings, get disinfection tips and more.
The only drawback to VirusTotal, if any, is that the maximum file size is 20 MB. Other than that, it’s an excellent tool that provides you with a complete safety report about almost any file.

Eating well shouldn't be a chore, but a pleasure! I offer nutritional information, hints and recipes to spark some ideas on how to make your meals healthy and delicious.
I've spent years researching nutritional information, food ideas and recipes, because cooking and eating - especially with family & friends - are some of life's great pleasures. And guess what- healthy food doesn't have to be boring! It can be exciting and delicious!
Yesterday was a grey, cool day, and I was feeling rather low thanks to my chronic illness, which flared up again recently. Mid-afternoon I found myself craving old-fashioned British style comfort food from my childhood. The craving was so strong I could almost smell and taste my grandmother’s wonderful treacle tart, which seemed to hover just the other side of my window glass.
Coming from British background, and with a Scottish grandmother who cooked most of our meals and was a dab hand at perfect light pastry, our food was solid, hearty meat and vegetable dishes, followed by the most delicious cakes and puddings, pies and tarts imaginable.
Shaking myself awake, I considered what comfort food I could have, given that I can’t have treacle tart, for a myriad of reasons connected with the dietary restrictions of my illness. Plus the fact that a whole treacle tart is way too big for one person!
So I went browsing through my recipes, and knowing that I’d be finishing the last of the delicious garlic and rosemary roast lamb - a comfort food I wrote about before – I decided on basic baked egg custard, creamy but not bland, making good use of the oven, which could reheat the lamb and roast vegs under the custards.
Baked egg custard was staple pudding of my late 1950s childhood, and I learnt to cook it by the time I was 10. It’s high in calcium and protein, plus vitamins A, B, C and D, phosphorus and zinc from the eggs. When I had my children, it was a regular pudding, being nourishing and easy for small children to eat, while remaining delicious enough for adults to enjoy. It also went well with home-bottled or canned fruit. Of course that was a pudding for four of us, so in recent years I’ve adapted it to make two single servings.
*Any milk you prefer; I use soy, it’s a matter of taste, although almond or oat milk might be rather thin-tasting.
*** Since we didn’t have vanilla beans back then, I’m happy to keep using proper vanilla extract. If you prefer the pod/seed trick, infuse them in the slightly warmed milk for 10 minutes before adding to the beaten eggs and sugar.
Grease a 4-cup size dish and stand it in a larger baking dish. Beat together the eggs, sugar, cream and vanilla essence, until they are well beaten. Warm the milk to blood heat, and pour into the egg mixture, whisking them all together.
Pour the custard mixture into your dish and top with ground or grated nutmeg. Fresh nutmeg smells divine as you’re grating it, and the ‘megs’ keep in an air-tight jar forever. Carefully pour cold water into the larger baking dish, to bring it halfway up the sides of the inner dish.
Bake in the middle of a 150C (300F) oven for about 40 minutes, or until just set. It’s easy to overcook – take the custard out while still a little wobbly, as it will firm up. If your oven is fan-forced, set the temperature 20 degrees cooler.
To make individual servings, divide the custard mixture between 4 1-cup ramekins, stand in cold water as before, and bake for 25-30 minutes until just set.
Still on comfort food, here’s a rich, most, almost fudgey chocolate cake, still using the basic ingredients of the 1950s and early 1960s, before cake mixes and chocolate chips. It’s a tweaking of one put out decades ago by Cadbury cocoa. Like all my baking, this can be made with gluten-free flour. Just take care when mixing the flour in, as it’s harder to mix through completely than wheat flour.
In a large saucepan, place the water, sugars, butter and cocoa. Heat this mixture gently, stirring until the butter and sugar have melted and the whole mixture comes together as a glossy dark brown liquid. Then bring to the boil and simmer for two minutes. Take it off the heat and immediately stir in the bicarb (baking soda). The mixture will froth up, which is why you need a large saucepan to contain the volume. Leave to cool for 20-30 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat the oven and grease a 20cm (8 inch) cake tin. Sift together the flour into a large bowl, beat the eggs.
When the cocoa mixture is cool, alternately stir in the sifted flour and eggs and mix together until blended, but do not beat.
Pour into your greased cake tin, and bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer poked in the centre comes out clean.*
* I bake this in a square Pyrex casserole, so I reduce the oven temperature by 10 degrees, to prevent the cake overcooking. It will also go on cooking in the Pyrex for a little longer after it’s taken out of the oven.

They say this will be the Chinese century, and all those immigrants packed in the basement probably wish that will raise their wage enough to move out of it. The city of Prato hosts the biggest Chinese community in Italy, most of which lives along Via Pistoiese. Unluckily, some of the economic changes that followed the heavy immigration led to tensions in the local textile industry. Many of the big clothing brands would rather buy a cheaper textile Chinese craftwork - sometimes even made in China - and slap a Made in Italy label on it, rather than pay a decent wage.

This video will show you the 3 most powerful techniques for attracting love. I will provide practical tips for aligning yourself to then attract the best person to resonate with. Transcript below... "Welcome back to another video. My name is Aaron and I help people expand their consciousness. Now in this video I'm going to be sharing with you three techniques for attracting love using the law of attraction. Now I believe that this video can be the missing link for so many people understanding that the process is more about how we embody the feeling of love so that that transmits to other people and then we're more likely to attract it. I'm going to give you tools in order to do that, going to give you practical understanding that you can actually apply to make it something that is real for you. " "The first part of it and the number one technique I have is to understand how to embody self-love and how that transmits to other people. Now the idea behind this is something that science is starting to prove as well, it is something that is called mirror neurons. Which means that when we go out to other people, the way that we think is literally being entrained with other people and they can feel how you feel about yourself. They can, in a way, pick up on that, so the idea is that however you feel is going to be how people feel about you. It's going to be something that's projected out to other people. " "Now the idea is that as I say in almost all my videos, we don't necessarily attract that which we want, but we always get a reflection of who we are being. What this means is that part of who we are being is not only the action we take, the self-image we have, but it's also the emotions that we are feeling. What we must learn to do is to embody the emotion of feeling love for who we are and knowing that we are already 100 percent whole and complete. Now the technique and the way that I want to share this with you has to do with understanding the RAS, or the reticular activating system in our brain, which is a fancy word for our selective focus. " "The more we're focused on the positive aspects of ourselves, the more we're focused on things that we're grateful for, maybe personality traits that we're thankful for, the more that we begin to feel that about ourselves and the more that's translated to other people. The idea is that a lot of times we're focused on the weaknesses we have and what that causes is negative emotion, that causes resistance and that causes us to detract from the people that we actually want to attract. The simple way to do this is to every day sit down for five or ten minutes and focus on what you're grateful for in your life, focus on your strengths and what you're good at. " "I think the word confidence actually breaks down to mean trust. Trust in yourself, trust and know that the more you focus on your strengths, the more that you buy into who you are and the more that other people will feel that off of you and then they'll buy into you as well. The idea is to simply feel that emotion by tailoring your focus and focusing on what you're grateful for. All of us have insecurities and when you have insecurities what you can do is you can reframe it, you can start to look at it as a positive light. " "Like if you're talking about freckles, if you're talking about anything at all, look at it and realize that you are already whole and complete, that it makes you unique for who you are and then you start to move onto things you can actually focus in a positive way on. Now the second one I have for you is also a very powerful way to let go of the beliefs you have around relationships and who you attract. Understand that more important than just the law of attraction is also understanding that our beliefs and our definitions are creating our life experiences. " "If we believe that we only attract a certain type of girl, if we believe we only attract a guy that treats us a certain way, the idea is that what is happening is that belief, that definition is continuing to perpetuate the same cycle. In a way we're getting a skewed sample. It's almost like we're meeting those people and we're seeing them because that's reaffirming that belief that we have. The idea is to simply write down on a piece of paper what those beliefs are and then as you look at them, realize that they are no longer what you prefer to experience. " "They are no longer the conditioned thinking that you prefer to stay perpetuated within. What you then do is you take yourself out of the conditioned thinking and you start to intend for what you want. Get specific for the kind of character traits that you want in your significant other, get specific with the kind of person that you think you deserve and as you do this, you're shifting it from the pattern of what you've...

OPEN ME FOR TIMELINE MENU Law of Attraction 101: https://youtu.be/6d-6NuOHFCs How to Stop Worrying: https://youtu.be/qrxoii6EBEw PROOF IT WORKS: https://youtu.be/fgzeR7bILSk We’re going to start the manifesting love series with my seven basic rules for attracting love. These seven steps will help you find the love of your life, your soul mate, get back your ex, find someone new, or remind you that you should be the love of your life. And a note, this process can be done to an existing relationship as well. I used it in my current relationship, and I tell you how at the end of the video. How to Manifest Real Love STEP #1 (1:31) Write down everything you love about yourself and everything you believe you have to give in a relationship. STEP #2 (2:10) Raise your vibration by closing your eyes and feeling the way you want to feel when you have that person in your life – confident, secure, steady, happy, comfortable, content, accomplished, harmonious. STEP #3 (3:24) Now, write down a list of everything you would want your ideal relationship to be like. You can write things like, “we make each other laugh. We have common interests. He exposes me to new experiences. She loves my mother. We are affectionate. We are honest and loyal.” Keep writing that list for as long as it feels good, and as long as you follow the rules step by step, you are in the process of creating. STEP #4 (4:26) Review the list of things you want in a relationship and the list of qualities you believe you bring in to the relationship. If those lists are compatible, you are ready and open for love and it is coming to find you. S STEP#5 (5:02) If the lists aren’t compatible, for example, you wrote down that your perfect relationship is spontaneous and adventurous, but you yourself aren’t spontaneous or adventurous, it’s time to work on yourself. In essence, you should become your own soul mate. STEP #6 (6:05) Stop thinking in a state of lack. When we think about how we don’t have something, we’ll just get more of that lack, because you are focusing on not having it. Don’t focus on the fact that you are single, focus on everything you wrote down at the beginning, how much good you bring to the table, and how much abundance you have in your life, and more will come. STEP#7 (7:41) Don’t wait for it or look for it, go out and live your life and believe that it’s on its way to you. Don’t wait on anyone. You want to be interesting once that person comes along, don’t you?! Open yourself up wide for new opportunities and new people. Keep your vibrations high, and have an amazing start of the last month of the year. I have a good feeling about this one.

Mwah xxx PS I leave you with the lyrics to our first dance: Maybe it's intuition But some things you just don't question Like in your eyes I see my future in an instant and there it goes I think I've found my best friend I know that it might sound more than a little crazy but I believe I knew I loved you before I met you I think I dreamed you into life I knew I loved you before I met you I have been waiting all my life There's just no rhyme or reason only this sense of completion and in your eyes I see the missing pieces I'm searching for I think I found my way home I know that it might sound more than a little crazy but I believe
When I knew I was ready for a relationship, I used Law of Attraction to manifest one of the most beautiful people I have ever met, and then he became my boyfriend. I specifically said that I wanted this relationship to be my soulmate relationship. I felt ready in that I was in a really good place in my life, emotionally and otherwise -- I was happy and excited about my life and also ready to share that with someone else. : ) I had a short little feel-it-real session where I describe how I imagined resting my cheek in my boyfriend's hand and also feeling his hand caress my hair. The gestures, though simple enough, felt so profoundly loving and really encapsulated for me the dominant feelings I wanted to experience in this relationship. It wasn't so much a visualization as it was just an emotional experience tied to physical gestures - it was short but deep. I really felt a shift after I finished this little experience -- I felt that he had somehow arrived. The next thing I did was pull some pictures from my Pinterest page that emotionally matched how I wanted to feel in my relationship. I include some of these at the end of the video, but there were at least twice as many. I spent a couple of hours, over a few days, making these photos. I originally intended to set them to music, like a Mind Movie, but I only got so far as adding text to the photos. Ultimately, I enjoyed the process so much, that it really didn't matter that they never became a Mind Movie -- they felt powerful enough just as they were. I met my boyfriend really soon after this, though I sincerely just thought I had met my best friend. We were platonic friends for a couple of months before I sort of dramatically woke up one day while we were out together and realized that this person whom I had thought was my really close friend, was suddenly making my heart explode! He took my hand at one point and I never saw him the same way again. It really has felt like Sleeping Beauty, and I was awakened to this incredible dream of love right in front of me. It's true that even though it feels so supportive and healthy and conscious, and even though it feels like someone looked at my most sincere dreams and sculpted an amazing man out of them, it still requires work and growth. I told him that I read somewhere that love is like a powerful detox in that it brings out all the impurities to be dissolved. I see all my insecurities and fears very clearly, and it's not always super comfortable, but we both are really supportive of each other in learning to process and heal these residual emotions we both experience. And I'm so thankful for that-- It feels like a true partnership in that way (and so many others). We're still learning each other, still learning our balance, but it's such a different experience when you're with someone who also has a healthy relationship with himself, who is willing to be open and vulnerable and honest, who is also strong and deeply compassionate. It has felt really good to grow more deeply into our true selves, together. : )

Under the Law of Attraction, the complete order of the Universe is determined, including everything that comes into your life and everything that you experience. It does so through the magnetic power of your thoughts. Through the Law of Attraction like attracts like. What you think about, you bring about. How is this so? Under laboratory conditions, cutting edge science has confirmed that every thought is made up of energy and has its own unique frequency. And when this energy and frequency of a single thought radiates out into the Universe, it naturally interacts with the material world. Of course, it has long been known that matter, or physical objects, are also just packets of energy at the sub-microscopic, quantum level. And so, as your thought radiates out, it attracts the energy and frequencies of like thoughts, like objects, and even like people, and draws those things back to you. It follows then that your THOUGHTS… BECOME… THINGS! It’s the Law of Attraction. How to harness this all-powerful and universal Law of Attraction in order to create the life of your dreams? Well now, that is The Secret.

Everything is energy…that includes everything you can see, taste, touch, smell and feel! Actually, there is nothing that isn’t energy! The most powerful energy in the Universe is love. It is the “purest” form of energy with the highest vibration and the greatest intensity. The heart is the center of love. What you feel in your heart will be felt throughout the body, then projected in your own experiences, and then felt out in the world. When you open your heart you will experience life through your heart. Studies have shown that thoughts and feelings turn genes “on” and “off”. Remember, like attracts like, so feelings of love turn on positive genes…the ones that help you maintain balance and stay healthy. Strands of DNA are lengthened (that is what you want to happen) when you create feelings of love, gratitude, and compassion and are shortened by feelings of fear, anger, and frustration. The shorter they are, the more DNA codes are turned off. Research has shown that you create your reality by choosing your thoughts and feelings! First you create in the body and then out in the world. So the question becomes…what are you thinking and feeling throughout your days, weeks, months, and years? How often do you feel love? Negative emotions create an erratic, disordered heartbeat while positive emotions create a smooth, coherent pattern in the heart. Your emotional state is communicated throughout your body by the electromagnetic wave known as the heartbeat. Then all the cells are synchronized to the vibration of the beat. A positive (high vibration) beat actually helps cells store energy and negative (low vibration) depletes energy from the cells. Being aware of what you are thinking and feeling throughout your day and then making sure you focus on the positive, is one of the best ways to remain healthy and happy look at this site. It does not require medication or heavy, strenuous workouts…it just requires monitoring what you are thinking and feeling to ensure that it is GOOD!

This powerful guided visualization takes you on a feeling journey into the life of your companionship with someone who loves you and you love equally. Always start with loving yourself as true love will come to those who feel it on the inside first. Caring for, loving and appreciating yourself as a beautiful and wonderful BEING is the beginning of you attracting someone else who also recognizes how wonderful you are. Take the perspective of your Source and allow your positive expectation to guide you to a powerful loving relationship. As you THINK and FEEL, so shall you BECOME. Close your eyes, relax and breathe deeply, (for best results listen with headphones). Neuroscience suggests that If you can get yourself into a relaxed meditative state and then from that place really feel what it is like to be living the life you want with the loving relationship you wish for, then your brain doesn't know the difference between your experienced reality and the one you are thinking about. Once you have told the new story about how you feel about your love, those things will find their way to you by the Law of Attraction. “Start telling the story of your amazing life, and the law of attraction must make sure you receive it!” ― Rhonda Byrne, THE SECRET This guided visualization meditation is designed to help you practice new thoughts in the direction you really want to go. Make the switch from your default settings of lack, insecurity and not enough-ness, to feeling the abundance and prosperity that is your true and natural nature. You are a powerful Creator.

https://11newlaws.com/quiz /\ / \ Law of Attraction Quotes Book Love Money Relationships Affirmations Video Success Story Documentary Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6V5wscs1UE Something you must see if you want life change, watch it over and over again and learn Thinking Your Way to Success Your drive toward wealth will be let first and foremost by your thoughts. Thinking is the most potent weapon a person has to make their dreams a reality. Doing so, however, requires constant clarity and quality of thought over a period of time. Part of learning to revere thought over form is to realize that sometimes our senses deceive us. Most people view the world by site. However, the common phrase “your eyes can trick you” holds true in many situations. That applies to any over-reliance on a primary sense. For instance, a blind person’s ears can be just as deceitful. As humanity matures, it is becoming clearer that believing goes before seeing. It is well documented that belief can have a powerful effect on the physical body in a number of situations. It is helpful to conceive thought as an actual substance that can be channeled in whatever ways we wish. Indeed, humans only currently use about 10% of our brains. Imagine, then, how much further we have to go in harnessing the power of thought. While our understanding of thought is still limited, we do know that by thinking positively and grandly, we can attract such people to us and vice versa. People holding similar qualities of thought are drawn together by the Law of Attraction. Those who are constantly promoting success with their thoughts will draw success to them. If one dwells on only defeat, one will perpetuate that defeat. In order to bring success to us, we need only think of good outcomes. It is not helpful to worry about the bad. If we concentrate all of our energy on our desires, the negative outcomes will be pushed aside. Becoming consumed by all the negative possibilities will eventually bring them to pass, thus the saying, “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” uttered by President Roosevelt on his first inaugural, while the great depression was tearing at the fabric of our nation. He knew that fear, if allowed to fester, would grow into something much more dangerous. With that in mind, it is important to replace your fears with thoughts of a more positive nature. Worry and fear can cripple your mind and prevent it from reaching its potential. That is why it is critical to use your thoughts, to organize them and discipline your mind so that your thoughts are constantly your own and are projecting in a manner which will enhance your life and bring you closer to your desire.

I wasn't "looking for" anything just was flipping the channels with the remote late one nite and came across Oprah Winfrey speaking powerful words of truth never had something to draw me like that before ,only when I was a young child , we as children believe and dreamed with out a care never knowing the harm that would come to us, if we stop believing in are hopes and dreams, but I happened ,it happened all over again I remember me. As a small child and this feeling came over me ,it was a very lite feeling of a cool breeze and a warm feeling of comfort inside. Now Iam saying to myself but, speaking this out of my soul ,out of my mouth I know this feeling I was here before.....I AM home again ,I begin to cry tears of greatfulness and joy . May I speak to you all ,I was about 12 when my life changed ,Iam sorry......I lost the person that gave me hope and instilled in me visions hope, mountains of dreams and rivers of waters that if stepped into them you would became one with it. She was my Great Gram. Always said Love and forgive with the soul and She a lways told me to look up because thats where blessings and hopes and good dreams and words of tomorrows come from. And prosperity grows and as we grow As children we plant this seeds in hearts and our souls and as we look up with gratefullness our seeds grow with us .Gram always said, never,ever look down unless your helping someone up and still, don't look down just help them up and share your seeds so someone else can grow...wow, 33 years has past and i was sleep all that time.Because I would not forgive Gram for leaving me. Ever lesson that has came in my life for the past 33 years WHILE A WAS SLEEP has showed me who..I AM. Yours Truly....I AM GREATFULL ..AMEN..

A growing sector of travel, ecotourism features trips to locations offering more than a beach and a cocktail, but an experience, coupled with learning and respect for the environment and culture of the region. Ecotours delve deeper and venture to locations that average vacationers seldom visit. The basics of “responsible travel” include direct donations to local charities and conservation efforts, the employment of indigenous people, use of local goods and services, and the creation of awareness about the people, their culture and the location. Essential to this is low-impact travel, small groups and a direct focus on nature and culture. Some are sponsored and/or endorsed by animal and cultural conservation groups.
South American ecotours are abundant, and range from the Bolivian salt flats to the sea lions of the Strait of Magellan; three of the more popular destinations are the Galapagos Islands, Machu Picchu and the Amazon.
A one-week ecotour of the Galapagos Islands costs approximately $5,000 US; it concentrates more on the biodiversity of the archipelago than the “evolution” cachet experienced by standard tour groups. The focus is on the Charles Darwin Research Center on Santa Cruz Island. Travelers spend time at the Center to learn about the preservation of the Islands’ wildlife. Ecotourists have the opportunity to thoroughly explore the Center, including the library, museum and tortoise-rearing facility, and to speak with the scientists and keepers of the animals.
Visits to nesting grounds, and areas of flora and fauna concentration form part of the tour, which includes the less commonly visited islands, such as Espanola, with its ornithological delights and albatross breeding grounds, Floreana, an island of beaches and extinct volcanoes, Santiago and Bartolome. Seldom seen by Galapagos tourists, South Plazas Island is on several ecotour itineraries. With its flat topography, the result of it being formed by uplifted, as opposed to volcanically created, rock, colorful land iguanas and prickly pear cactus forest, it is a unique location. Travelers will see harems of sea lions, among the largest population in the Galapagos, and cliffs dotted with swallow-tailed gulls. It’s a nature-lovers treasure trove.
A two-week junket that covers a vast range of experiences and vistas begins with a flight from Lima, Peru to Puerto Maldonada, followed by a short drive to the headwaters of the Amazon River. Here, ecotourists visit Refugio Amazonas on the Rio Tambopata and explore the renowned clay lick, home to hundreds of brightly colored Macaws.
Travelers sail on the river in a private boat to Cuzco where they have time to acclimatize to the mountain elevation and air before setting out for a trek through the Sacred Valley and on to awe-inspiring Machu Picchu.
The ecotour ends with a five-day hike, using local Spanish- and English-speaking guides, and llamas as pack beasts, around sacred Mount Ausangate. Mountain lodges form the nightly accommodations, giving trekkers an intimate perspective of life in the High Andes, living among the mountain people for nearly a week.
Bound by respect for people, places, flora and fauna, ecotours challenge the norms of travel, creating “responsible” tours and resulting in experiences that truly are once-in-a-lifetime events, and leave travelers with profound understanding not had by any other means of travel and touring.

Photosynthesis is a process during which energy from light is harvested and used to drive synthesis of organic carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water, generating oxygen. Photosynthesis is the only way that radiant energy from the sun can be converted into organic molecules for plants and animals to consume.
Second step of photosynthesis is called Calvin’s cycle. Because it does not require light, so it is called dark reaction. During dark reaction, the ATP and NADPH generated by light reaction are consumed to fix carbon dioxide into organic carbohydrates. The first fixed carbohydrate is a three carbon compound 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA). The final product is a high-energy 3 carbon compound glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) which can be used to synthesize a broad range of organic molecules. An important intermediate molecule for carbon dioxide fixation is ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), and the enzyme catalyzing the CO2 fixation is Rubisco.
A limiting factor is a factor that controls a process. Light intensity, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration are all factors which can control the rate of photosynthesis. Usually, only one of these factors will be the limiting factor in a plant at a certain time. This is the factor which is the furthest from its optimum level at a particular point in time. If we change the limiting factor the rate of photosynthesis will change but changes to the other factors will have no effect on the rate. If the levels of the limiting factor increase so that this factor is no longer the furthest from its optimum level, the limiting factor will change to the factor which is at that point in time, the furthest from its optimum level. For example, at night the limiting factor is likely to be the light intensity as this will be the furthest from its optimum level. During the day, the limiting factor is likely to switch to the temperature or the carbon dioxide concentration as the light intensity increases.
As we can see, there is a close relationship between the action spectrum and absorption spectrum of photosynthesis. There are many different types of photosynthetic pigments which will absorb light best at different wavelengths. However the most abundant photosynthetic pigment in plants is chlorophyll and therefore the rate of photosynthesis will be the greatest at wavelengths of light best absorbed by chlorophyll (400nm-525nm corresponding to violet-blue light). Very little light is absorbed by chlorophyll at wavelengths of light between 525nm and 625 (green-yellow light) so the rate of photosynthesis will be the least within this range. However, there are other pigments that are able to absorb green-yellow light such as carotene. Even though these are present in small amounts they allow a low rate of photosynthesis to occur at wavelengths of light that chlorophyll cannot absorb.
Glycerate 3-phosphate is reduced during the reduction reactions to a three-carbon sugar called triose phosphate. Energy and hydrogen is needed for the reduction and these are supplied by ATP and NADPH + H+ (both produced during light-dependent reactions) respectively. Two triose phosphate molecules can then react together to form glucose phosphate. The condensation of many molecules of glucose phosphate forms starch which is the form of carbohydrate stored in plants. However, out of six triose phosphates produced during the reduction reactions, only one will be used to synthesise glucose phosphate. The five remaining triose phosphates will be used to regenerate RuBP.
During carbon fixation, carbon dioxide in the stroma (which enters the chloroplast by diffusion) reacts with a five-carbon sugar called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) to form a six-carbon compound. This reaction is catalysed by an enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (large amounts present within the stroma), otherwise known as rubisco. As soon as the six-carbon compound is formed, it splits to form two molecules of glycerate 3-phosphate. Glycerate 3-phosphate is then used in the reduction reactions.
C4 cycle is the pathway adopted by C4 plants to conserve the carbon dioxide released via photorespiration. It adopts a new enzyme (PEPC, Phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase) which does not react with oxygen; it also adopted a separated compartment for CO2 up taking and fixation.
Photosynthesis is a process where by energy from light is harvested and used to drive synthesis of organic carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts and can be divided into two steps: light reactions which require light and dark reactions which do not require light. During light reaction, light energy is captured by photosystems and electrons are transferred among the electron receptors. ATP and NADPH are generated. During dark reactions, CO2 is fixed using ATP and NADPH generated by the light reactions and organic carbohydrates are synthesized via the Calvin Cycle. When the CO2 is first fixed into a 3 carbon compound 3PGA, it is called C3 pathways and these plants are called C3 plants. The disadvantage of C3 plants is that they undergo photorespiration and thus waste some energy gained in light reactions. C4 cycle is the pathway adopted by C4 plants to bypass photorespiration.
The diathesis-stress predictions outlined in cognitive theory have not received more consistent support in part because multi-factorial research, comprising different levels of analysis, has rarely done justice to the many considerations unique to each level. This concern applies to the manner in which both life stress and cognitive vulnerability have been traditionally assessed: often via self-report measures in which the target construct and the disorder under study are blended.
One of the most prominent diathesis-stress theories was developed by APS Fellow Aaron Beck, who proposed that depression onset may be attributed largely to negative cognitions and corresponding patterns of information processing. Beck’s model hypothesizes that individuals who experience adversity in childhood develop negative self-schemas that involve concepts like loss and inadequacy. These schemas are thought to remain dormant until an individual experiences a stressful life event that is reminiscent of the original stressor, at which point the schemas become activated.
It is also possible for stress to be caused by not having enough to do. When people with co-occurring disorders have nothing purposeful or interesting to do, they tend to have worse symptoms and are more prone to using substances. So a lack of meaningful involvement in life-in areas such as work or parenting, for example-can be another source of stress.
the theory, the predisposition, stress factors, modifying protective factors, application of the model, history, and a unifying model No one knows exactly what causes essay art concerning spiritual the introduction in schizophrenia, and there are a number of existing theories seeking to explain the origins of the disease.
Stress in the environment can worsen biological vulnerability, worsen symptoms, and cause relapses. Stress is anything that challenges a person, requiring some kind of adaptation. Serious stressful events include losing a loved one, getting fired from a job, being a victim of crime, or having conflicts with close people.
The diathesisâstress model the diathesis stress model is a psychological theory that attempts to explain a disorder as the result of an interaction between a predispositional vulnerability.
The causes of schizophrenia have been the subject of much debate, with various factors proposed and discounted or schizophrenia diathesis stress model modified.
Some people are biologically vulnerable to certain psychiatric disorders: bipolar disorder, major depression, schizophrenia, or anxiety disorders (panic, post-traumatic stress), for example. This vulnerability is determined early in life by a combination of factors, including genetics, prenatal nutrition and stress, birth complications, and early experiences in childhood (such as abuse or the loss of a parent). This is why some families are more likely to have members with a particular psychiatric disorder. Although vulnerability to psychiatric disorders is primarily biological in nature, people can take steps to reduce their vulnerability, including taking medication and not using alcohol or drugs. It's also worth noting that the greater a person's vulnerability to a particular disorder, the earlier it is likely to develop, and the more severe it may become.
Film buffs will recognize that the subheadings in this article are movie titles. In keeping with that theme, I will close by saying that longitudinal em­piri­cal work, guided by theoretical insights and based on sound measurement, is our best bet and, perhaps, our only ticket to an entirely new film, titled “Diathesis-Stress Theories: The Next Generation.”
A number of culprits have been implicated in the etiology of depression. They seemingly span all levels of analysis and include genetic, biological, physiological, cognitive, and social factors. Cognitive and social factors routinely have been considered primary suspects, kept in the lineup by theorists who have adopted a diathesis-stress perspective to explain depression onset. (The diathesis-stress model views psychological problems to be the result of stress affecting an individual who has a pre-existing vulnerability for developing a specific kind of problem.)
The diathesis stress model of schizophrenia or also known as the diathesis stress theory is proposing that the.

​The implementation phase of the requirement to declare a producer for all imported food in a Full Import Declaration (FID) will commence from 1 June 2016. An Imported Food Notice was published in March 2016 to provide a transition phase between March 2016 and June 2016 for industry to comply with the new requirement.
This new requirement will assist the department’s Imported Food Inspection Scheme (IFIS), industry with improved referral or release of food consignments and Australia’s other food regulators, such as state and territory health authorities, to respond effectively to incidents linked to imported food, such as the hepatitis A virus outbreak in February 2015 linked to imported frozen berries from China.
Implementing the requirement from 1 June 2016 will be done by tariff chapter, with the requirement first applying to those tariff chapters that represent the lowest frequency of food imports. Inspection data has been reviewed to develop a timeline for each tariff chapter that covers food, which is generally covered in chapters two to twenty two.
12 Oil seeds and oleaginous fruits; miscellaneous grains, seeds and fruit; industrial or medicinal plants; straw and fodder
15 Animal or vegetable fats and oils and their cleavage products; prepared edible fats; animal or vegetable waxes
4 Dairy produce; birds' eggs; natural honey; edible products of animal origin, not elsewhere specified or included
Tariff codes within tariff chapter’s 2 – 22 for which the overseas producer does not need to be declared
The below list of tariff codes within chapter’s 2-22 will not require a producer code when lodging a FID in the ICS:
The below list of tariff codes fall outside chapters 2 – 22, but will require a producer code to be declared when lodging a FID in the ICS.
3503 – Gelatin (Including gelatin in rectangular (including square) sheets, whether or not surface-worked or coloured) and gelatin derivatives; isinglass; other glues of animal origin, excluding casein glues of 3501
For the purposes of lodging a FID for imported food, the producer of an imported food is the commercial or individual’s premises or area in the country of origin where the goods were grown, caught, manufactured or processed. The producer may also be referred to as the manufacturer, processer, packer or establishment.
Generally, the producer will conduct the final processing or packaging of the food and their name and contact details will appear on the final bulk or retail packaging.
The producer of the food MAY be the same as the exporter/supplier. However, the producer is NOT a third party premises where finished food products are consolidated for export, such as a warehouse or freight forwarder.
What if my overseas supplier does not provide the details of the producer, for commercial or other reasons?
No. Where a food consists of ingredients from multiple sources, the producer that should be declared is the commercial or individual’s premises that completed the processing of the finished food product.
The producer is the commercial or individual’s premises where the goods are packed into the final bulk or retail packaging.
Raw/unprocessed meat, seafood, seaweed, fruit, vegetables, eggs, nuts, seeds or coconut is packed into the final bulk or retail packaging at Premises A. Premises A should be declared as the producer and the name and contact details for Premises A can appear on the final bulk or retail packaging.
The producer is the commercial or individual’s premises where the goods were processed into the finished product and packed into the final bulk or retail packaging.
Raw/unprocessed meat, seafood, seaweed, fruit, vegetables, eggs, nuts, seeds or coconut is sourced from Premises A and sent to Premises B for processing into finished products. Premises B should be declared as the producer and the name and contact details for Premises B can appear on the final bulk or retail packaging.
The producer is the premises where the goods receive the final processing and are packed into the final bulk or retail packaging. The name and contact details for the producer can appear on the final bulk or retail packaging.
Coffee, tea, herbs, spices, rice, cereals, flour, malt, sugar, cocoa, salt, oils etc is sourced from one or more sources and packed into the final bulk or retail packaging at Premises A. Premises A should be declared as the producer and the name and contact details for Premises A can appear on the final bulk or retail packaging.
A processed food or beverage may consist of ingredients from multiple sources. The producer is the commercial or individual’s premises where the goods were processed into a finished product and packed into the final bulk or retail packaging.
Ingredients for a processed food or beverage are sourced from Premises A, Premises B and Premises C for processing into finished products by Premises D. Premises D should be declared as the producer and the name and contact details for Premises D can appear on the final bulk or retail packaging.
The producer is the commercial or individual’s premises where the goods were processed into a finished product and packed into the final bulk or retail packaging.
For many consignments of imported food the rate of inspection under the Imported Food Inspection Scheme is based on the compliance of previous consignments sourced from a particular producer. Therefore, before creating a new producer, it is important that licensed customs brokers utilise the Wildcard and Like Match functions in the ICS to ensure the producer to be added does not already exist.
Exercising due diligence in this area will mean that future consignments may benefit from a reduced rate of inspection, where an existing history of compliance exists.
From 20 March 2016, licensed customs brokers have access to add producer codes in the ICS. External release notes 16.4.01 on the Department of Immigration and Border Protection website provide instruction on how to add a producer code in the ICS.
Utilise the Wildcard and Like Match functions in the ICS to ensure the producer to be added does not already exist.
There are three fields called Name, Locality and Country Code that must be completed when creating a new producer via Cargo Interactive:
Name - The Name field can hold 250 characters and must include the full name of the producer where possible. Where required use abbreviations such as Pty Ltd or P/L for Proprietary Limited.
Locality - The Locality field can hold 40 characters and must include an accurate reflection of the physical address (20 Export Park, San Jose, California) instead of a broad locality (California). Where required use abbreviations such as St for Street or Bldg for Building. A Post Office box is not an acceptable address.
Country Code – The Country Code field must include the country where the producer is based. A search function is available to select the correct country code.
This must be done via a form on the department’s website. The existing producer can be used in a FID directly after the form has been submitted and the amendment will be processed by the department as soon as possible.
This must be done via a form on the department’s website and the deletion will be processed by the department.
Guidance for importers that broker their own goods on how to add, amend or delete a producer code in the ICS
Importers that broker their own goods do not currently have access to add, amend or delete a producer code in the ICS. This must be done via a form on the department’s website and the deletion will be processed by the department. The department has requested the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to add functionality to the ICS that will allow importers that broker their own goods to add producer codes.
Goods within tariff chapters 2 – 22 that fall into one of the categories below may still be referred to the Imported Food Inspection Scheme (IFIS), as they have been prior to the introduction of the requirement to declare the producer. When this occurs, the importer can provide evidence (a declaration, import permit etc) about the end use to an Authorised Officer who will consider if the goods may be released from the IFIS without inspection or analysis.
Generic producer codes have been added to the ICS for certain goods that are exempt from the IFIS under Section 8 of the Imported Food Control Act 1992, including ship’s or aircraft’s stores, or food that is imported for private consumption or as a trade sample.
Food imported for ship’s stores only. Section (1)(c) of the Imported Food Control Act 1992 00224506 Ship's stores only
Food imported for aircraft’s stores only. See definition at Section (1)(c) of the Imported Food Control Act 1992 0004997P Aircraft's stores only
Food imported for private consumption only. See definition at Section (7)(2) of the Imported Food Control Act 1992 0005531X Private consumption <10KG/10L
Food imported for a trade sample only. See definition at Section (7)(3) of the Imported Food Control Act 1992 0007593X Trade sample <20KG/20L not for consumption
Food may also be imported to Australia that has an end use other than human consumption. Example – an import of tariff code 18040000(05) for Cocoa butter, fat and oil may be used in the production of food for human consumption but can also be used in the production of cosmetic products. Similar examples exist for animal feed, therapeutic ingredients and industrial use.
Importers should contact their overseas suppliers and ensure that the producer is clearly identified on the commercial documentation for each type of imported food in a consignment.
Importers are responsible for providing the customs broker with sufficient information to accurately declare the producer of the food being imported.
Importers should provide details of the producers they source imported food from and request their customs broker to ensure these producers are registered in the ICS.
Customs brokers should ensure that importers provide sufficient information to accurately declare the producer of all imported food.
Customs brokers should request their clients to provide details of the producers they source imported food from and ensure these producers are registered in the ICS.
Will this increase the number of FIDs that are referred to the Imported Food Inspection Scheme for inspection, or inspection and analysis?
No. Imported food will continue to be referred to the Imported Food Inspection Scheme at the rates specified in the Imported Food Control Regulations 1993. These rates of referral are 100 per cent of risk food, 100 per cent of food subject to a holding order and five per cent of surveillance food.
No. The profile changes will be communicated to your 3rd-party software via the regular EDI reference file update process. Contact your 3rd-party software provider if you are unsure of where to declare the producer in a FID.
Yes. Organisations who use Customs Interactive (the web-based component of the ICS), or who use the services of a bureau will also need to declare the producer for all imported food. Contact the Department of Immigration and Border Protection if you are unsure where to declare the producer when lodging a FID in Customs Interactive.
The FID may be incorrectly referred to the department and will need to be assessed before the goods can be released. For risk food, the department’s import system will not apply the correct rate of inspection and the importer’s goods may be subject to unnecessary inspection and analytical testing of samples.
What happens if at an inspection the producer on the labelling is found to be different to the producer in a FID?
Risk food - The department officer will cease the inspection and advise the importer or agent that the producer must be amended in the FID. The FID must be amended before a reinspection of the goods can occur.
Holding order food - The officer will conduct a visual and label inspection and advise the importer or agent that the producer needs to be declared correctly in future FIDs.
Surveillance food - The officer will complete the inspection and advise the importer or agent that the producer needs to be declared correctly in future FIDs.
This requirement is being introduced to assist the department’s Imported Food Inspection Scheme (IFIS) and Australia’s other food regulators, such as state and territory health authorities, to respond effectively to incidents linked to imported food, such as the hepatitis A virus outbreak in February 2015 linked to imported frozen berries from China.
This new requirement will also reduce the number of FIDs incorrectly referred to the IFIS. A review of the department's records has found that many lines of imported food are incorrectly referred to the IFIS and the officers must still assess these incorrectly referred FIDs before releasing the consignment. The department has investigated how this can be improved and has established that the number of incorrectly referred FIDs will reduce if the producer is declared for all imported food.
Declaring the producer for all imported food will deliver benefits for customs brokers and importers in several stages of the import process:
Customs brokers and importers will benefit from a more targeted profiling and referral process in the ICS for consignments of imported food, particularly for goods subject to a holding order. The department expects a reduction in the number of FIDs that are incorrectly referred, which will expedite the IFIS border clearance processes.
Less time will be required for officers to compare the information lodged in the FID with the supporting documentation for the consignment. Customs brokers and importers will receive Food Control Certificates quicker and can deal with food that is not required to be inspected or analysed.
Authorised officers will have more information about the goods prior to inspection and this will reduce the time required for physical inspection and collection of samples for analysis.

PROMAU, since years dedicates all its energies to research, develop and improve its wide range of fabricating machines, sold world-wide with the registered trade brand "DAVI", with the result to have achieved the largest sale amount in turnover and number of units produced per year.
Flexibility is the main characteristic of the MCO machine which responds to the needs of generic fabricators with limited volumes of plate rolling. The dual pre-bend MCO unit is without doubt the most common on the market, well known by end users as a simple and most economical machine capable of satisfying many different bending requirements especially indicated when rolling is not the companies core business.
In the MCO the pre-bending on the leading and trailing ends is performed without removing the plate from the machine but by simply transferring the same by rotating the rolls from one side to the other to make the pre-bending. One of the MCO's benefits is the possibility to curve symmetrical profiles in between the main side frame thanks to the free passage left between the rolls.
The movements of he machine are entirely hydraulic including the yoke opening and closing that is performed to evacuate the shell after it has been finished. In order to guarantee an excellent plate traction (independent from thickness and material) all three rolls are motorized.
The three hydraulic motors and three planetary gearboxes (one for each roll) are couplet directly on a grooved bar. This allows an economical and efficient mechanical power transmission to the rolls thus ensuring smooth and precise plate positioning. All the MCB rolling machines are equipped with electronic rolls parallelism "Servo Tronic" that substitute completely the obsolete mechanical torsion bars used on old generation units. Automatic speed compensation to ensure correct rotational speed is controlled by the hydraulic system thus avoiding slippage on the rolls.
The MCA rolling machine line is the ideal apparatus to bend plate up to 10 mm thick and up to four metres wide. It is accurate, user friendly and fast (plate advancement speed of six mt/min) and represents the best available on the market today. The MCA also represents the ultimate in terms of design and innovation with advantages not available on other models. The leading edge is automatically calculated (when CNC is supplied) and this results in the shortest leading edge flat end on the market. The MCA can roll the plate without removing, turning or reintroducing the plate as required by a single leading pre-bending machine used for this range of plate thicknesses. Unlike three roll models that require pre-bending on both ends, the MCA only requires that leading edge is pre-bent.
Another important advantage is the possibility to make a shell in a single pass. The operator needs to identify only the lateral rolls position whereas on the three roll machine it is necessary to identify the six or nine positions to bend successfully a single shell. The MCA concept from its inception has been designed for a complete automization package. Even the basic model is equipped with programmable visual displays with the possibility to memorize the lateral rolls position and (with the exception of the plate advancement which is performed manually) to perform an automatic cycle.
Another interesting characteristic of the MCA is the possibility to introduce material horizontally easily and quickly. The MCA can be equipped together with in-feed tables, loading stations and transfer units. In this case the rolling machine becomes the centre for automatic bending with a high level of productivity resulting in drastic reduction in cycle times.
All the MCA rolling machines are equipped with electronic rolls parallelism "Servo Tronic" that substitute completely the obsolete mechanical torsion bars used on old generation units. The MCA rolls machines all use the ultimate state of the art DAVI technology: PSG, PLT, EST and "Roll by Wire". The DAVI technology not only represents an effective innovation but also reflects the trend in all AVI products towards user-friendly, programmable solutions to assist our customers with highly productive reliable competitive products.
The MCB rolling machine line is the ideal apparatus to bend plate from 10 mm to 200 mm thicknesses with widths varying from two to up to six metres. It is accurate, user friendly and fast (plate advancement speed of six mt/min) and represents the best available on the market today. The MCB also represents advantages not available on other models. It can automatically pre-bend the leading edge leaving the shortest possible flat end. The MCB can roll the plate without removing, turning or reintroducing the plate as required by a single leading pre-bending machine used for this range of plate thicknesses. Unlike three roll models that require pre-bending on both ends, the MCB only requires that leading edge is pre-bent. Another important advantage is the possibility to make a shell in a single pass. The operator needs to identify only the lateral rolls position whereas on the three roll machine it is necessary to identify the six or nine positions to bend successfully a single shell.
The MCB concept from its inception has been designed for a complete automization package. Even the basic model is equipped with programmable visual displays with the possibility to memorize the lateral rolls position and (with the exception of the plate advancement which is performed manually) to perform an automatic cycle. It is possible to retrofit a powerful CNC control even after the model has been purchased that are widely recognized as the best CNC on four roll equipment currently available worldwide. Once equipped with CNC the MCB becomes a powerful and extremely accurate bending system capable of high productivity levels.
Another interesting characteristic of the MCB is the possibility to introduce material horizontally easily and quickly.

Early this month I blogged about Another Reason to Ride, and here it is late in the same month and I am again reminded of why I ride.
People ask us often why we would put ourselves through the grueling effort of training and conditioning, never mind the time investment that it takes to ride the Pan-Mass Challenge route from Sturbridge to Provincetown on an often hot weekend in early August. In addition, when a rider commits to a ride, each rider commits to a certain fund-raising minimum which is not a trivial amount. Fund-raising without corporate donations is often the most difficult as the average donation is smaller. A rider really puts themselves “out there” to ask everyone they know for donations to support the cause.
However, often the “…Reason to Ride” becomes close to home with the diagnosis of a close family member with Cancer. That is what happened to me yesterday as I found out that my niece Sherri who lives in Missouri is undergoing chemo and radiation treatment for lung cancer.
I ride “In Memory of” Karl Nawskon, nephew who died of pancreatic cancer about a year ago, and I ride “In Support of” Sherri Ehlenberger as she battles her lung disease. Training and riding the PMC is nothing compared to battling cancer. I ride in the hope of making cancer history.

Awwww is shazcuck sticking up for his cuck brother krispcuck? Boy it was fun having 3 cuck brothers on 1 team today. Eurocuck and cuckeye tried to 2 vs 1 me several times and lost each time. Shazcuck had to use panzer and camp wr. The cuck brothers still lose miserably!
Majestically, he paced to and fro, keeping a wary eye on the snow forts and the gaily clad figures behind the banks. Then, to his surprise, he saw Chet Morton walking slowly toward him.
Officer Riley eyed Chet suspiciously. The fact did not escape him that Chet had one hand behind his back.
Chet seemed to aim at one of the forts. But his foot appeared to slip and the snowball smacked Con Riley's helmet with deadly accuracy, knocking it off into the snow.
Riley emitted a roar of rage and astonishment. Snow was trickling down his neck. He stooped merely long enough to pick up his helmet and thrust it back on his head, where it rested at a ridiculous and rather precarious angle.
"It's tough luck we weren't able to nab Slip Gun," Frank said, as the brothers spurred their horses down the trail.
There was no sign of the horseman they were pursuing as they pounded through the streets of Lucky Lode. The boys' fears mounted when they drew in sight of Hank's cabin. Although darkness had fallen, no lights showed in the windows.
No one answered. Without bothering to light the oil lamp, the boys blundered through the darkness and hastily checked the two sleeping rooms and the kitchen.
“Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan; that is Bet El, he and all the people who were with him. He built there an altar and called the place El Bet El.” With these words, the Bible informs us that Jacob is the first to have made a promise (in this case 20 years earlier; cf. Gen. 28:20-22) and to have kept it. The fulfillment of the first promise was to honor a commitment to return to a place designated for prayer. Why?
The ability to make promises is a feature of humanity which distinguishes us from the rest of the natural world. Other animals do amazing things but, as far as one can tell, making and keeping commitments is beyond their reach. Commitment depends upon at least three prerequisites. In order to make a promise, one must be able to anticipate what lies ahead. To avoid breaking a promise, one must be able to remember what has transpired. To fulfill a promise one must see oneself as having accountability. In Pirke Avot it is said, “Watch out for three things and you won’t come into sin: Know from where you came, to where you are going, and before whom you will give justification and an accounting.” These three traits are the hallmark of the covenantal personality. To reflect, to aspire, and to face the verdict are the very essence of prayer.

“Mirror, mirror on the wall…” Is the Yayoi Kusama Show the prettiest of all? – Wander with PandaLove
Everyone is talking about the “mirror exhibit.” The exhibit is at the Hirshhorn Museum in DC, which ends on May 14, 2017.
After 3 weeks of trying to get tickets online including using 3 different browsers every Monday at Noon to avoid waiting in line for tickets, I realized it was an utter fail. The tickets are sold out within seconds. There is literally no chance of getting it online, so Nguyen was kind enough to wait in line.
Surviving the ticket line. The exhibition opens at 10 AM along with the box office. Nguyen got in line at 8:45 am on a Wednesday and there was still about 50 people in front of him. He said there were people had the folding chairs in line. That’s serious business, if people start lining up early on weekdays, think of how early they line up on weekends?!? We went again the next week with a friend, which ended up ticket-less. People have been lining up at 6 AM!
They only give about 600 tickets a day. Each person can ask for 4 tickets, so if you do the math, if you are not in the first 200-250, you will not have a chance.
One person=Four Tickets. Yes, each person can request up to four tickets. You don’t have to be in line to get the tickets necessarily if you have a nice friend willing to wake up really early.
You are confused. The first time you go into the exhibit, you don’t know what to do. You can count your first exhibit as a tester.
Don’t just get in the first line you see. The best decision we made is to work our way backwards. Hardly anyone was in the last lines and by the time we finished, there wasn’t anyone in the first exhibit either. The only ones with a long line were the ones with the hanging lights.
20 seconds goes by quickly. They are very strict about the time in each exhibit. The minute you walk in, the staff member clicks a timer.
Go in groups of 2 or 3 people. They will ask you if you are a group of 2 or 3. We decided that Nguyen should go alone because maybe he will be paired up with his dream woman. Think about how romantic it would be to say you met the love of your life in the infinity mirror room and within 20 seconds you fell in love? So, on one exhibit it worked, Nguyen got paired up with a cute girl, but then I turned around and another guy walked in. When Nguyen came out, we found out the girl lied. They were together.
The exhibits are tiny. The exhibits are a small room, the walkway fits one person comfortably, you might be able to squeeze two people in.
Don’t forget all the artwork around the exhibits. There are other art pieces all around the exhibits and there is also the main exhibit upstairs as well.
Go again if you didn’t get the right angle. After waiting in line for so long, if you don’t get the pictures you want, go back until you get it because you may never get another chance to visit.
Pick the earliest time slot. As the day goes on the exhibit gets busier. It’s empty first thing in the morning or during the middle of the day.
Don’t go into the sticker room until the end. You might get distracted with all the stickers and want to start there, but once you enter, you cannot go back in, so make sure it is your last stop.
Is it worth waiting in line for that long? I will be honest, no…It is not worth the wait. The line is about 3-4 hours long just to get tickets and then the entire exhibit is another 2-3 hours.
If you have the time, I would say go to it for the experience, but if you miss the exhibit, it’s ok.
So…You can’t get tickets online, you cannot get in line at 6 AM? There are two other ways that I know of to get tickets, but please read the terms and conditions. Here is the membership information:
$50 Day Membership. There is a separate line to purchase a membership, but it is only good to enter the day of for you and a guest. You should come about 9 AM to wait in the “membership” line. But the catch is…it is only valid for students, senior citizens, and military. The $50 is also tax-deductible.
$250 Exhibit Membership. This allows you and 3 other guests a one-time visit anytime during the exhibit. You also get an annual membership for 2 and $115 of the fee is tax-deductible.
Parking is a B*t@h. Don’t let your wonderful experience end with your car being towed. The streets around the area have a 2-hour limit and during certain hours’ cars are not allowed at all. You can go a few blocks over and park in a garage or along the streets. The closest parking I found was by Capital Grille.
If you get to see the exhibit, I hope these tips helped you! If you cannot make it before May 14, you can walk through my experience below:

It is compensation payable under a scheme set out in the Workmen's Compensation Act of India, monitored by the Ministry of Labour.
In view of new dimensions of legal liability exposures any business can fall victim to the high cost of liability from simple slip and fall accidents to personal injury and reputation damage claims. That’s why every business needs the type of coverage that Commercial General Liability insurance offers and it is generally a company’s first line of defense against liability arising out of its operations.
Commercial General Liability (CGL) policy covers third party liabilities arising from various business operations, be it premises, products and completed operations and/or advertising and personal injury.
As a manufacturer supplying products, you are always susceptible to the possibility that your product could cause damage to a third party – either property or a person. A small defect could open you up to massive claims.
In such a case, product Liability Insurance is vitally important for product manufacturers. The policy not only protects your organisation from claims but also covers legal costs associated with defending these claims against your organisation.

How many watts has it got, man. The system power amplifier takes the very low power output from the processor and boosts it up to a level that can drive the system loudspeakers. What that level actually is - people have argued for years about that. The power requirements are determined mainly by 3 factors:
All other factors being equal (room and speakers), doubling the power will increase the sound level by 3db (db or decibel is a measure of sound level). 3 db is a noticeable but small increase in sound level. Most people will feel that a sound level is twice as loud when increased by 10 db. What all of this means, is that if you have 100 watts of power, and want the sound to be twice as loud, you need 1000 watts to get there. The difference therefore, between a 100 watt amp and a 120 watt amp is insignificant, if 100 won't get the job done, you will need 200 - 300 to see any meaningful increase.
On other than fairly high end systems, the processor and amplifier (as well as an FM tuner) is usually combined into one unit, the Audio/Video Receiver. The quality of the best A/V Receivers is suitable for all but the very best ($$$) systems.
A typical home theater (or music surround) system consists of 6 (sometimes more) separate speakers - 3 across the front, 2 in back and one or more subwoofers. Newer systems have up to 9 speakers. The price range here is huge, a few of the cheapest systems are almost useless, many low end systems however, sound fairly good (when compared to some of the small, cheap speakers in some lower end TVs). Speakers systems are somewhat like the amps discussed above, sometimes spending twice as much only buys a small increase in performance. How much you spend is really based on how critical a listener you are, and how loud you like it . Complete 6 piece systems are available from many manufacturers, or with some knowledge a very good system can be "pieced" together.
We recommend a subwoofer for most systems, the sound and feel of the low bass they produce really helps "put you there" in movies and music. Small in-wall type speakers and a hidden sub can produce very good sound and be almost invisible in most rooms.

Although A Christmas Carol was published in London by Chapman and Hall on 19 December 1843 just in time to capture the burgeoning Christmas book trade, another first edition of the same book, albeit without most of Leech's celebrated illustrations, was published at about the same time (or perhaps even somewhat earlier that same month) as the result of a recently negotiated understanding between the Baron Christian Bernard Tauchnitz in Leipzig and the author:
Dickens had early proofs of his new works sent to Tauchnitz, and this edition was advertised in Germany on December 8, 1843 as appearing "later this month, simultaneously with the London edition." In fact, [bibliographers] Todd and Bowden state that the Tauchnitz printing could have proceeded the Chapman and Hall edition by several days. ["ABE Books."]
Page: 14.9 cm (height) by 10 cm (width). Frontispiece, "Marley's Ghost": 9.9 cm (height) by 8.5 cm (width)
This edition of the Carol is volume 91 of Baron Tauchnitz's "Collection of British Authors," started in 1841 and designed for purchase by English-speaking travellers on the Continent. According to Paul Davis in Charles Dickens A to Z, Baron Tauchnitz ("A publisher who had Dickens's whole and constant trust," as Sadrin remarks) customarily paid a British or American contributing author fifty pounds in lieu of royalties. Anny Sadrin in The Oxford Reader's Companion to Dickens notes that Tauchnitz "was licensed to publish for continental circulation only" (209), and that, although he had already published Pickwick, Oliver, Nickleby, and American Notes, only in 1843 did Baron Tauchnitz actually approach Dickens directly to come to some formal arrangement about receiving early proofs of The young author's work as it was coming out in London. This edition of A Christmas Carol may be the first fruits of the arrangement with the writer and his Continental publishers who were prohibited from selling into the other copyright markets of Great Britain and her colonies. Between 1841 and the novelist's death in 1870 Tauchnitz published the entire range of Dickens's novels, short fiction, and the non-fiction works of volume length — to say nothing of the works of Sir Edward G. D. Bulwer-Lytton, Anthony Trollope, William Makepeace Thackeray, and George Meredith. Since "the first Baron Tauchnitz (1816-1895) often secured . . . advance proofs of work then in press [his firm] . . . thus occasionally produced variant texts preceding those customarily regarded as 'first editions'" (Todd 780). Such would seem to be the case in the Tauchnitz edition of a Christmas Carol, which would have enjoyed copyright protection in the German states.
Charles Dickens even sent one of his sons to Tauchnitz to learn German. The renowned Leipzig house continued to publish a range of English-language texts, including bilingual dictionaries in English and other European languages, until the RAF's bombing of Leipzig in 1943. "Only a surprisingly small number of Tauchnitz reprints seem to have seeped back into the British market, despite their cheapness and attractive format" (Sutherland 619). Todd estimates that between 1841 and 1943 the firm published in its "Collection of British and American Authors" alone some 750 writers in 5,370 volumes, "eventually achieving a total issue exceeding 40 million copies" (780), to which one might add a limited number of rare editions in such series as "Young Readers" (30 volumes, 1860-1883), "German authors in English translation (51 vols., 1867-1892), and . . . abridged English texts and accompanying German commentary for use in schools (41 vols., 1886-1917; 52 vols., 1926-1939)" (Todd, 780).
The text of the Tauchntiz Christmas Carol exists in two related forms: the 1843 volume, probably published prior to the Chapman and Hall volume of 19 December 1843, and a composite of the Carol accompanied by the next two Christmas Books, The Chimes and The Cricket on the Hearth (Leipzig, 1846).
The scans presented here are from the 1846 octavo edition since the condition of the illustration in the 1843 edition renders it unsuitable for scanning because the onion sheet is stuck to the illustration. Both editions look the same, and the 1846 edition does indeed include not only a title-page with its actual date of publication, 1846, but also a reproduction of the original title-page of 1843 after the illustration. The 1846 anthology has an enlarged version of the title-page and does not mention the title in vogue after 1852, The Christmas Books; rather, it reads: "A Christmas Carol in Prose; The chimes; the Cricket on the Hearth." With a coloured Etching. By Charles Dickens. Leipzig: Tauchnitz, 1846.. The "Preface" to the 1846 edition is identical to that of the expanded 1846 edition, and the pagination for A Christmas Carol is also identical to that of the first part of the 1846 edition: 78 pages. However, the 1846 edition's reproduction of the 1843 title-page has substituted "Copyright edition" for "Edition sanctioned by the author." Apparently, Tauchnitz published The Haunted Man and The Ghost's Bargain: A Fancy for Christmas-Time late in 1848, the timing again suggesting an arrangement similar to that between author and continental publisher for the Carol.
This collection will be particularly distinguished by its correctness of text, elegance in exterior and cheapness in price; it is therefore hoped that the friends of the English language and literature will be gratified with this edition.
In bringing forth this edition the publisher has been solicitous to render it a popular one; — convenient in its form and valuable in its content it will prove to be adapted not only for the public in general but for the use of schools in particular.
Both the 1843 and 1846 editions stipulate that the text belongs to Tauchnitz's "Collection of British Authors," but only the 1843 text has the above explanation.

Haute 100 Lister Lenny Kravitz has paired up with Sky Ferreira, the young triple threat singer, model and now actress for Eleven Paris’ Fall/Winter 2013 campaign. The French fashion house has chosen the duo and photographer Mathieu Cesar, who is famous for black and white shots, to bring about a raw edginess evocative of 90’s grunge days. The campaign is a little bit rock and roll and a little bit indie, a perfect reflection of the collection that is marked by modern leather motos (like the one worn by Kravitz in the photo) oversize boyfriend coats, printed shirts and graphic tees.
Aren’t familiar with talented French photographer Mathieu Cesar? You should be! Check out some of his work, which includes shots of Daft Punk and fashion for Christian LaCroix and Jean Paul Gaultier here:

On our third and final day of the exclusive charters for the SAP conference, guests on our morning cruises from Anaeho’omalu Bay saw a pod of Spinner Dolphins who were in “resting mode”. We also all got to spend time with a Mom/Baby pod. Mom seemed to be unaccompanied by an escort, and unlike most Moms, when it was time for her to dive, she showed her flukes. This might have been because the calf was rather large, and she may have been comfortable diving a bit deeper (bigger calves may be able to dive more deeply too). We got a chance to deploy the hydrophones during theses early cruises, and the singing whales must have been very close by, because the sounds we heard were really loud.
On our second cruises, the whales were a bit more active at the surface. We saw several breaches (none closer than about 300 yards), but did get to see one whale double pec slapping on his back. This whale started the activity about 150 yards from us, but by the time he was done, he was maybe half that distance from our idling boat.
Meanwhile, guests departing from Kawaihae on our first cruise of the day saw 3 different Mom/Baby pods, and only one of them was accompanied by an escort. All three of these pods were just south of the harbor, and though they weren’t interacting with each other, they were in close proximity. On Alala’s final charter of the day, one of those Mom/Baby pods was still in the area. We got to watch a pod of three other whales approach Mom and Baby and for a little while there was a frenzy of aggressive activity as they tried to figure out exactly who was going to get to be the primary escort.
Ocean Sports Whale Fact of the Day: Humpback Whales have massive tongues. An 80,000 pound Humpback has a two-ton tongue! Taste buds appear to be atrophied…and they are unable to protrude their tongues from their mouths.

Million Climate Jobs Monthly Meetings have been taking place at AIDC´s premises since 2012. Approximately 25 participants attended the meeting on 5th May 2017.
This time we welcomed Muna Lakhani as our main speaker. He is the Branch Coordinator of Earthlife Africa in Cape Town and the National Coordinator of the Institute for Zero Waste Africa. His input was titled “Waste to energy? Wasted energy!“.
The process of converting waste to energy is called by different names, e.g. pyrolysis, thermal treatment, incineration, waste recovery through energy recovery. Behind all this is the burning of solid waste in an incinerator in order to produce power. Just recently a waste to energy conversion plant has been opened in Athlone, this is just one of many waste to energy convertion plants.
There are a number of reasons why converting waste to energy in this way is not effective or efficient.
One unit of electricity generated in an incinerator is even more costly than one unit produced in a nuclear power plant.
Burning waste produces even more of the climate-damaging Carbondioxide than burning coal. Besides that, the incineration of plastic produces Dioxine. Although waste plant operators make you believe that Dioxine emissions can be avoided by very high temperatures, this is not the case. Moreover the ash, that makes up a quarter of the waste´s weight, is very toxic. It has to be stored under special conditions and there is always the danger of leaks.
The Dioxine builds up in the food chain and in our bodies. Dioxine is very toxic and causes health problems such as cancer, lung problems, heart diseases, brain damage birth defects hormone disruption and reproductive abnormalities.
Waste is not worth nothing. Many components, e.g. plastics, paper and metal, could be recycled. If you burn them instead, you create more need for new plantations to produce new paper, for more fossil fuel extraction to produce new plastics and for more mining for metals.
The incinerators rely on more and more waste coming in as fuel. Every attempt to reduce waste endangers their business model.
From a job creation point of view incineration does not make sense at all. Burning waste as well as dumping it in a landfill needs far less workers than recycling.
Incineration treats the problem of waste from the end not from the beginning. Instead of burning waste, we should reduce it. There are various ways, e.g. recyling, reusing, or repairing.
In contrast to solid waste incineration organic waste can be converted into energy in a sustainable way. Sewage, food waste and garden waste can be fed into a biogas digester. In the absence of oxygen, the material breaks down. The methane produced in this process can be collected and used for heating and cooking. The solid leftovers can be used as fertilizer. This sustainable process wastes nothing and has little to zero negative impact on the environment.
Biogas digesters can be built in almost any size, from a small single-household model to a plant that uses the organic waste of a whole neighbourhood. Building a biogas digester is not rocket science and has the potential to create jobs within the community.
Muna gave us an example of best practice in the Eastern Cape. The plant uses the sewage of a school´s water flushed toilets. The solid part is degraded in the biogas digester. The water, which is still rich in nutrients, is used to grow algae, that are finally fed into the biogas digester as well. The produced gas is used for cooking meals for the school children. The solid remains manure a vegetable garden, thatproduces vegetables for the school feeding scheme.
The school profits from the biogas digester on multiple levels.It does not only improve the nutrition, but also the learning conditions. The students benefit from the safe dignified toilets. Female learners attendance has improved, because the girls now have a hygienic place during their period.
Comrade Sizwe says, that NGO-presentations do not change the living condition of the vast maiority of waste pickers on the ground. What they need most is not access to waste, but access to land and equipment to work. REIPPs do have the potential to provide jobs, but at the moment this often does not happen in a gender-equitable, sustainableand transparent way. More engagement between the NGOs, the unions and the REIPPs is needed in order to improve this.
Women from Makhaza in Khayelitsha reported, that there is a small biogas digester in their area and inquire, whether it could possibly be used for waste water treatment. According to Muna, it is probably not big enough, though wastewater in general is a good base for biogas digestion.
Progressive Youth Movement committed to approach SAPSU teachers to inquire, whether a plant similar to the one that Muna presented as good example can be built at their schools.
Comrades expressed interest in building a small biogas digester for their family in rural Eastern Cape. Muna placed his services at our disposal for every further technical question. He can be contacted at:
Five coal fired powerplants, namely Kriel, Komati, Hendrina, Camden and Grootvlei, are supposed to be closed down soon in order to accomodate renewable IPPs. NUM and COSATU have started a campaign to protect worker´s jobs there. The campaign targets the Government, ESKOM and the IPPs and calls the Government to stop proceeding with the IPPs.
The powerstations are due to be closed down anyway because they have already exceeded their life span. ESKOM now just gives a different reason. That might well be a political move, as ESKOM apparently is against renewable energy. The parastatal refuses to sign the remaining IPP contracts since July 2016.
On short term stopping renewable energy IPPs could save some coal jobs, but in the long run the IPPs provide cheaper energy and more jobs. The NUM/COSATU campaign should shift its focus to demand a proper plan by the government for a just transition rather than against IPPs. In order to avoid misconception by the trade unions it is important to provide them with good objectives and unbiased information.
AIDC is concerned about the unions´ negative response to renewable energies and has started to bring together IPPs and unionists. In this context the rival unions NUM and NUMSA agreed on the importance of renewable energy. It was agreed on these meetings to continue. NUM is seeking for a meeting with their policy makers in order to change the union´s formal position on renewables. Besides that a pamphlet adressing the factual backgrounds is planned to be produced, so that unionists are no longer misled by ESKOM´s twisted information.
Another outcome regards the Integrated Ressource Plan (IRP) policy review.After the consultation period the Government now seems to delay the update, probably in order to keep the space open for nuclear. A letter to the Minister of Energy was sent out, asking the question when the update is going to take place. So far there has not been an answer, but the EFF has comitted to take the letter and turn it into a parliamentary question. That means that the Government is obliged to answer within 3 weeks.
Lucia gave us a brief insight, how far she has already got with her new film project. She collected suggestions for improvement. She promised to finalise the film by the next Climate Jobs Meeting
The City of Cape Town has reviewed its Free Basic Water Policy. So far every household qualified for a monthly allocation of 10500l Free Basic Water. Now only “indigent“ households with a maximum monthly income of R2800 are supplied with FBW.
Arising from the last Meeting EMG has written a letter asking for the reasons for the policy review. After the community had the chance to comment on the letter, it was sent to the Department of Water and Sanitation. So far there has not been a response.
The upcoming water indaba (16th May) gives the opportunity to voice our concerns. Besides that a day of action as well as asking the EFF to make the letter a parliamentary statement was up for discussion.
The next meeting is going to take place on Tuesday 23rd May 2017 with Tasneem Essop speaking on the just transition.
AIDC was formed in 1996 in response to the democratic transition in South Africa and the new opportunities and challenges it brought those seeking greater social justice within the democracy.
Over the years AIDC has played a leading role in various civil society responses to ongoing inequality including facilitating the launch and building of the South African Jubilee 2000 debt cancellation campaign, and the Right to Work Campaign.

Birth control pills usually contain progestin and estrogen, which are both sex hormones. Progestin-only birth control pills (POPs) are sometimes called the mini-pill because they don’t contain estrogen. If you are concerned about taking estrogens because you have high blood pressure, migraines, heart disease, or a history of blood clots, but still would like to take an oral contraceptive, this may be an option for you. It is also a good choice if you are a new mother and breastfeeding.
POPs are used in the same way as other birth control pills. They come in packs of 28 pills. You take one pill at the same time each day and after the last pill in the pack is taken, you start a new pack the next day; there is no skipping days. Because there is a slightly greater risk of becoming pregnant on progestin-only pills, you must be very careful to take each pill at the same time each day and never miss a day. If your period is late and you missed one or more pills or took them late, you may need to take a pregnancy test.
The effects of POPs are easily reversible and after stopping these pills your chances of getting pregnant should not be delayed. Continue reading →
Desserts have always been the best part of the meal for me - sometimes, the only part. My sweet tooth is insatiable. My grandma Martha Nonnemacher inspired me to bake as a teenager. I enjoy creating desserts, eating them, and sharing the moment with others. I got the opportunity to put my passion into action on season 4 of The Next Great Baker on TLC. Check out my short video Meet the Bakers.
Years ago, I received two family toffee recipes, which I tweaked a bit and made my own. I began making my toffee during the holiday seasons, handing it out as gifts to friends and family, and selling it at craft fairs. The response was sensational! And thus my dream came true, a marriage of passion and confection, the launch of Aimee’s Toffee.
My other passion, besides desserts, is supporting Going Global Inc., and going with my dad, Dennis Nonnemacher, on missions trips he leads to help orphans and widows around the world. Some of his favorite places to serve are Nepal, Myanmar, and the Andaman Islands. I’ve visited some of the orphanages, and my heart fell in love with the children and the countries.
It’s my desire that the proceeds of Aimee’s Toffee help the kids. So far, I’ve been able to send a few thousand dollars to help meet the basic needs--food, clothing, and education for the children, and I can’t wait to do more. Aimee’s Toffee is truly "sweet for you, sweeter for orphans." Watch a short video.
Thank you for visiting my website. I hope this glimpse into my heart causes your sweet tooth to be activated. Join in the cause to help feed and care for children globally. Buy Aimee’s Toffee!

The teams are then split for a two tee start and the day begins! With an interesting course of challenges including our in house Nearest the Pin and Longest Drive competitions, it is great way to build relationships and have some friendly banter on the green. Then head back to the Clubhouse where you can relax at the bar and go over the day’s events with your team mates, before settling down for the late afternoon BBQ and the days awards!

The link between creative industries and social entrepreneurs have not been very strong so far. Together, we can change that!
What happens when creatives and social entrepreneurs collaborate for 48 hours in an inspiring space?
1001vienna happens in one weekend and brings local and international creatives together to collaborate on social impact topics. 7-10 teams are working on 8 selected topics, learning from each other and helping social ventures and activists to amplify their stories.
The name is inspired by the Persian story collection One Thousand and One Nights (also referred to as “Arabian Nights”) with characters like Aladdin, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves or Sinbad. Shahrazad connects the different tales.
She’s a brilliant woman who outsmarts a bloodthirsty king by telling him a story each night before he goes to sleep. She ends each tale on a cliffhanger maintaining suspense to keep her husband interested and herself alive.
By introducing an open and collaborative working environment, Impact Hub Vienna supports the creative potential of entrepreneurs for positive change both in Austria and the CEE region as well as acting as the central location for the Global Impact Hub operations. In addition to serving as a co-working, meeting & event center for impact-driven individuals and organizations, Impact Hub Vienna helps their members maximize their individual and collective impact by providing them with a unique local and global ecosystem of resources, knowledge and connections.
Impact Hub Scaling unites 8 Impact Hubs from around Europe with a common goal, to help social entrepreneurs scale and increase their impact. Up to 100 participants are immersed into the Impact Hub network. During the year long program these social entrepreneurs acquire the knowledge and skills that are required to scale their social enterprise and their social impact. This is done via networking, peer to peer learning, group coaching and individual mentoring. Each Scaler’s journey is unique therefore each Scaler gets bespoke coaching in the areas they need most.
“Our headquarters for the weekend will be Impact Hub Vienna, located in the bustling 7th District. They offer a unique ecosystem of resources, inspiration, and collaboration opportunities that support the development of a more sustainable world. After opening their doors in 2010 Impact Hub Vienna has gone from strength to strength, growing their numbers and their impact steadily to now over 450+ active members. This lead to them growing their space in 2015 to over 1200m2.”
Once, a long time ago, I read the poem of a poet from Chile that said : “irias a ser muda que Díos te dio esos ojos?” Well, I had this poem hidden in the back of my mind until today, when my eyes met yours for the first time.
But I must confess that, despite all their magnetism, my eyes did not stop at the expression of your eyes; they wondered all over your gorgeous body, as if I were an old digger searching for a huge gold mine engraved in the mountain. You are very beautiful and I can foresee all the treasures hidden under the fabric that covers your skin; I can imagine the sweetness of your lips and the softness of your perfect body.
Pretty girl with deep eyes, can you see the turmoil your expressive pupils have installed in my heart? Your eyes are not only deep but they also reveal a unique sensuality...
I don`t know if and when I will see you again. After all, parties at a friend`s place or even events that coincide with our agendas or our personal tastes don`t happen that often.
Anyway, I would like to meet you again and as soon as possible. Who knows, maybe I would give you a poem along these lines: “My girlfriend is so pretty, her eyes are like little stars in the sky”. Because that`s exactly what your eyes are like, you know?
I`m not going to say anything further just that in order for the poem to be complete, you`d have to agree to be my girlfriend.

The publication of an article in a peer-reviewed journal is an essential building block in the development of a coherent and respected network of knowledge. It is a direct reflection of the quality of the work of the authors and the institutions that support them. Peer-reviewed articles support and embody the scientific method. It is therefore important to agree upon standards of expected ethical behavior for all parties involved in the act of publishing: the author, the journal editor, the peer reviewer, and the publisher. So, AENSI Publication is taking care of implementing all of authorship, reviewing and publishing policies without any conflict of interest during papers editing and publishing.
We are committed to ensuring that commercial revenue has no impact or influence on editorial decisions. In addition, AENSI Journals will assist in communications with other journals and/or publishers where this is useful to editors. Also, we are working closely with other publishers and industry associations to set standards for best practices on ethical matters, errors and retractions--and are prepared to provide specialized legal review and counsel if necessary.
The peer review process is at the heart of the success of scientific publishing. As part of our commitment to the protection and enhancement of the peer review process, our journals have an obligation to assist the scientific community in all aspects of publishing ethics, especially in cases of (suspected) duplicate submission or plagiarism.
Start searching your road as early as you like on the morning of the event (i.e., any time after midnight). Look and listen for as many bird species as possible, stopping not later than 11 AM. Only species observed from midnight to 11 AM will count.

You must stay within fifteen feet of the edge of your chosen road. Any birds seen or heard whle you are beyond that range will not count. If your road has a break or a shift, you can only count the birds observed from your road, not the connecting ones.

OUTLAW DIVISION! Too many rules for you? Don't like birding as a team? Don't want to commit to being part of a team because of a potential schedule conflict? Please participate anyway. Only teams that follow all the rules are eligible to win, but we are happy to have others participate and we will be interested in hearing about the birds you find.

“The focus on positive vs. negative thoughts is juvenile. It’s minor-league foolishness. And it leads people to obsess about their own minds. People aren’t passive magnets that attract and repel. That’s utter nonsense.” (The Underground, Jon Rappoport)
First, positive thoughts attract positive results in life, and negative thoughts attract negative results. This is mainly a descriptive overview. It doesn’t apply to people who consciously do something to change their own thoughts. It’s a “philosophic” basis for understanding why people get what they get in life.
Therefore, one assumes, if a hundred thousand people are dying of thirst during a drought, they brought that on by thinking a whole lot of negative thoughts.
People who advocate the law of attraction tend to dislike such examples. They sometimes hedge their bets by asserting that external events (e.g., a drought) are quite real and they never claimed otherwise.
This produces a blurry line between events that “just happen” independent of what people are thinking, and events which are the result of negative or positive thoughts.
The second version of the law emphasizes that people, by changing the nature of their own thoughts, automatically affect what they get in life.
Certainly, this isn’t achieved by a person entering his own mind like a surgeon with a scalpel, pruning away the negative. The interior landscape is far too large, the flows of thought are too mercurial, and quite often, what seems like a successful surgery later turns out to be a dud: the old excised thoughts return.
But there are meditations and repetitive affirmations. Some advocates of the law recommend them. Focus on thinking about what you truly want. Clarify such thoughts. Repeat them to yourself over and over. Affirm them. Or concentrate on an object of desire.
Doing this in a dispassionate way hardly calls up very much energy. It’s about as effective as trying to move forward in an active ocean while sitting in a paper boat and paddling with a soup spoon.
What, though, happens if you really believe you can get what you want by thinking positively about it over and over, or by focusing on it?
And this is a whole other territory. Suppose you ardently believe that by visualizing a purple rose sitting on a boiled egg, you will become rich? Suppose you believe that a pink bulldog dropping down from the sky holding the string of a large balloon will give you a new house?
There is no blanket conclusion possible. It all depends on who is believing and how they are believing and with what power they are believing, and with what conviction, and with what passion, and with what “belief in their belief.”
I have seen, and you have, too, I’m sure, people who achieve remarkable things based on what they believe.
And it doesn’t matter whether they are engaged in “changing their thoughts from negative to positive.” The law of attraction itself is irrelevant.
Furthermore, people who hold very strong beliefs act on them. They don’t sit in a room and power up that belief-engine and wait for something to happen. They aren’t involved in some “snap-of-the-fingers” manifestation. They take massive and sustained action.
And in that act of creating, during a life lived, at some point along the line they experience remarkable collisions of events—the fancy label is synchronicity. People and situations come to their aid.
In large numbers of people, the ordinary notion of the law of attraction helps to make them passive. They wait. They think. They re-think. They spin wheels.
Some of them begin to believe they have to banish the negative, and this process leads them into confusion and discomfort of a high order, because it doesn’t work. Thoughts, untold numbers of floating random thoughts, are the wrong target. They’re a dime a dozen, and there are billions of dozens. Who cares?
And those who preach the “philosophy” are, sometimes, merely interested in controlling the flock. The more androidal members of the flock will, now and then, say, “Did you hear about Bob? He’s in the hospital. Too many negative thoughts.”
Living a creative life through and by imagination is a whole other process. It’s the major leagues. It’s the expression of life-force in a voice that tears away the curtain of consensus reality.
This kind of life quite naturally, without effort, defuses trillions of sputtering thoughts because they don’t matter. Negative? Positive? Makes no difference. It’s a puerile distinction.
In living a life through and by imagination, one’s past, one’s experiences, feelings, thoughts, memories—they’re all fuel for the fire. In that fire, a soul forges what he will invent, what new reality he will make.

The Drewlo buildings are actually quite good quality rental stock (imo). They provide lots of people with reasonably priced housing. I suspect if you were to compare 'per square foot' rental prices of their buildings vs City Center or 1 Vic, you would find that the Drewlo buildings are serving an entirely different demographic.
And yes, their buildings are not 'fashion forward'. However, they are building quality buildings that are somewhat of a timeless design. They may not have all the glass and fancy finishing, but they are built to last. It remains to be seen if we can say the same about some of the shiny new buildings that have popped up.
And we need multiple demographics, and housing for them. So if Drewlo builds some reasonably-priced mixed-use rental housing at King and Madison, I think that will be a very good thing for downtown.
My main interest is in how the Drewlo buildings interact with the street. The architecture is forgettable and that's OK. They're offering good rental housing, which is a pretty big deal.

Same here. Not all architecture can be award-winning, and it’s okay if some isn’t, even in the core. But at an urban location such as King and Madison (and even outside of the cores, I think), we don’t want big setbacks and especially not parking in front that can hamper the street experience for everyone.
If they want to appeal to council based on being mixed-use, it only makes sense for it to count as such if it is built in the form of mixed-use, i.e. street-fronting, not hidden behind parking. Similarly, there is the noted concern of Drewlo getting sound levels experienced by residents due to the highway down to acceptable levels; putting parking next to the highway vs. putting the buildings next to the highway is a very simple way to help alleviate (or worsen) this.
Rental buildings in Ontario as a whole tend to be a lot older and in dire need of renovation. If you want quality, you have to pay for it. Drewlo seems to offer an alternative to that.
(12-02-2014, 11:48 AM)jgsz Wrote: I was inquiring about buildings by Drewlow Holdings Inc and it appears there may be more than four buildings on Fallowfield Dr. Here is part of their email:
I wonder if this is driven by the future LRT stop at Block Line and Courtland. It would be interesting to find out how much land they own in the area.
I know this is old -- I believe there will be two more at 18 floors a piece, IIRC. Address will be Blockline,
And if you go out that way, that part of the ground is a lot lower than the other four buildings, so at 18 floors, it might appear to have the same height as the other towers, or at least close to it.
Have the two additional towers been confirmed? If so with the potential full build out of Virerra Viillage this area will see a significant density increase.

Just a little inside knowledge, but apparently the timeline was sometime in 2018. But you know how inside information is...not always reliable.

Hong Kong is an dynamic and eccentric city. I believe most of my family and friends here would concur. There is no other asian city as extravagant as this. And definitely no replacement (sorry, but "whatever" to Taipei and Shanghai).
Hong Kong is deep. It may be physically small, but the thought behind the many communities here are very knowledgable and realistic. In fact, its very intense and in your face. I would never compare it to other metropolitans like Manhattan which is probably a lot broader and varied, but Hong Kong is definitely not just another city. Hong Kong is crazy and I love it. Its where I grew up and call home.
I finally got my own Flip Flaps. Hehe. I got the orange, blue, and white one. Its something about the charming plastic bold colored scheme that has me. They remind me of the old Mario Bros. backgrounds. Those 8 or 16-bit flowers that only move back and forth in the background as you play. I plan to place mine by my desk to accompany me while I program hardcore next year..haha.
Many mega blockbuster games are taking on the shelves this holiday season. If I had to choose one among all these great games...Half Life 2 by Valve is the winner. I don't think the game is perfect, but I like the direction the developers of this game have taken. Their source engine has helped simulate a world more closely resembling our reality:
Characters - Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial "muscles," human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.
Physics - From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.
Graphics - Source’s shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.
AI - Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.
I'd like to add that level design is also worth noting. It keeps the adrenaline rushing and the game is fast paced consistently. Other things include all those little things like shooting the birds and breaking/throwing random objects throughout the world.
The minimum specs of this game, however, are pretty high. And I do advise playing it on a cutting edge PC. I wouldn't waste the time otherwise.
Note: My pick was among games like Halo 2, Metal Gear Solid 3, World of Warcraft, GTA: San Andreas, NFS Underground 2, Sims 2, etc... I do still need to check out Prince of Persia: Warrior Within and Gran Turismo 4 before the year end.
During my drive back up to Vancouver from LA earlier this week, I got into an accident on the I-5 and trashed my car. I was at Portland then, and my ML had to be towed. It was not the most exciting experience at all. Thank God nobody was injured and insurance is paying for the vehicle damages. I ended up taking the train to Seattle (with my three huge suitcases) where my Mom came to pick me up the following day.
Theres still so much to learn. On top of nearly killing myself, I wasn't able to deal with the aftermath of the accident. I was blank and still shocked over the event. It made me feel worthless, spoilt, and young. Next time around, I will take care of my own consquences in a more adult manner.
I will be starting my Computer Science Masters degree at game school DigiPen this coming January 2005. I'm definitely excited about moving to Redmond, WA and starting school again. I know its not going to be easy at all...but to say the least, I know I will enjoy studying a lot more this time through....I hope...
Its been a while since I've written an entry. Mainly due to my temporary time away from the computer and television to allow my eyes heal "properly" from the lasik...
I don't know about you all, but I definitely heavily rely on my computer in my life(and sometimes the television). I felt handicapped all throughout this time because more than half of my motivations required my computer. I couldn't find/download music, play games, chat, blog, surf the web, read the news, etc.... The computer and internet is probably one of the best educational systems introduced in my life. Its definitely my primary instrument of work and source of entertainment. I mean, seriously, the internet itself on my computer is a portal to the world!! My laptop, which I bring around with me all over the place, is "a mobile world" that follows me whenever I am within WiFi boundaries.
But yeah, my point is that I am a slave of my PC. And if you are reading my blog, chances are that you are too.
I'm sure some of you are sick of my music blabbering all the time (who wouldn't be by now?) But somehow, somewhere I realized I had never mentioned what about music that has me swept off my ground...so here goes an exert from my diary...
In my world, music is life. I doubt there is a more accurate definition of music than that inside my dictionary. It embraces all my emotions. Music is merely just a hobby or interest of mine. It could inspire, motivate, be an adventure, be a form of escape, be a medium of communication, be a learning experience, trigger memories, etc... Music is art.
It's pretty interesting to know that my passion for music didn't grow until 6-7 years ago. Not like it didn't exist in my life up until then or anything, I just simply didn't find it particularly interesting compared to sports or computers or whatever.
I speculate a big part of the upbringing of music in my life was having to have gone to America. Not only was it culturally a whole new experience, I had heaps of free time at boarding school to listen to music. Hmmmm.
The guitar would probably be another good reason of cultivation of my music. The guitar has always been something I've wanted to learn for myself. It gave me much self satisfication. It was and is still a challenge to me (to get better and better and better). Hopefully one day it would be a medium for me to express what I truly hear inside my head. =)
Love music. Share it. I honestly believe if some of you spent more time listenning to it, it would become much more rewarding than you had thought.

The route uses a combination of road and shared paths, riders regroup at several points. All meet at the Boatshed Cafe (South Perth foreshore) around 9:30 for coffee afterwards. Numbers permitting there will be a second ride afterwards with riders all going as one group.
WCMCC training rides are not races, they are recreational rides which provide an opportunity to develop fitness and group riding skills. Taking place on a mix of shared paths and roads, safety and respect for other traffic is of prime concern.

St. X High School is trying to renovate its library by adding seven classrooms and creating extra spaces for college kids to work together. Whereas there are various options to pursue in continuing education after high school, after doing research, you and your teen will start to get a better idea of what the most effective fit is for them. The method can be challenging, however there are many folks out there dedicated to serving to ease the method. College counselors might be extremely helpful and provide you and your student with a wealth of information. It can be tempting to cave into social pressures and pursue probably the most prestigious degree, but on the finish of the day, what may very well be higher in your teen than pursuing a profession by means of an training the place they really feel pleased and fulfilled? That, after all, is what makes the training price it.

This Word of Mine should be a blessing for My People. I outline to you the form and the constancy with which those who say they love Me must conduct themselves. The fact that I address My People is not looked upon with pleasure by some. In this Revelation My Holy Spirit insists on what is not to My liking so that you do not misinterpret freedom and not transgress the Law.
"And in the latter days, God says: I will pour My Spirit on all flesh and your children and your daughters will prophesy; your young people will see visions and your old ones will dream dreams” (Acts 2,17).
These Words are forgotten and they point the finger at Me if I do not tie Myself to what those who direct My People want. My Word is not welcomed with gratitude due to the deviant interests that exist and form part of the world and its machinations.
I have been exchanged for human gods who stand out on social media, you attach yourselves to them with great affinity because you live by what is immediate and what causes you distraction and pleasure ...
My People, I suffer with you and I grieve at what happens on Earth, as well as for what you will face as part of the evil behavior of man against man.
Evil has come to workplaces in order that My children are conditioned, and has touched the minds of the leaders of companies so that with a heart numbed by power and foolishness, they are those who prohibit My children from keeping images of Me or of My Mother or My Saints in the places where workers spend a great part of the day.
You need to understand that the devil, at this precise instant, wants to distance you from My Truth; he does not wish to be discovered, since the destruction being proposed has not reached the level desired by him.
My Images are condemned, destroyed, forcing those who profess obedience to My Mandates to destroy whatever exists of Me. This generation continues to walk alone by itself and with the one who keeps its destructive plan in motion: satan.
Evil has penetrated and hardened hearts in all strata of society and even within My Church, in order to undermine it, and it is because of this that I invite you once again not to lose heart, to be perseverant, "to pray in season and out of season" (I Thessalonians 5:17), to remain vigilant so as not to deviate from My Path.
My People constantly see the straw in the eye of others and not the beam in their own (cf. Lk 6, 41-42) and because of this, dissatisfaction leads them to commit injustice against their brothers and sisters and to bitterly criticize those who, as laborers and vinedressers, as committed laity, bring them the honey that I make explicit in these Revelations and in others that are of My Will.
SO, AS YOUR GOD, I INSIST ON THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN SO THAT MY PEOPLE WAKE UP. It seems that it is a minority who accept the explanation of My Word, fulfill it and obey it. But this is not the reality, it is rather that man remains silent out of fear.
This generation’s error is the lack of love, therefore those who wish to follow in My Footsteps are not well regarded by the rest of society. The elderly who possess wisdom are despised, youth does not take advice well, materialism urges them to continue under that rule by which they look at the god of status. These are the fruits of disobedience and attachment to materialism.
This generation has become sick by accepting forms of modernism with which it has degenerated, rejecting My Commands.
The misery that some of those who call themselves christians carry in their souls is revealed through power or influence against their fellow men.
My beloved People, struggles, uprisings, protests and lack of control are the product of anger, hatred and the lack of values in man because he does not know Me. Everyone gives what they have inside at the instant: some give love and others anger, which is not My Will.
My People, the countries are experiencing the most varied and strange natural phenomena, the waters of the seas will move and assault the earth, the winds will increase their intensity. My People, where there is heat, cold will come, and where there is cold, heat will come. My children are not prepared for these variations.
The Middle East is a cradle of massacres, scourges and destruction. Man has become contaminated within by anger, which will be brought to Europe with greater tenacity.
In some countries the streets will seem desolate, when they are taken over by terrorism, an evil coming from the devil.
Pray, love Me, fulfill the Divine Law and be instruments of peace. Receive Me properly prepared so that these communions be infinitely multiplied.
Prayer is heard in My House, it is not unheard. You must pray with the heart, not out of duty or in appearance, but "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24).
Do not forget that from My House you will receive the necessary help if you are properly disposed. MY ANGEL OF PEACE, WITNESS OF MY LOVE, WILL GIVE YOU WHAT IS MINE.
“Blessed is the person who remains steadfast under trial, for when they have stood the test they will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.”

Luxury fixtures elevate products with high quality finishes, and sleek, modern designs. Luxury design is not only timeless, but stands apart. Capture the essence of the brand without words.

Luxury custom displays can come in many shapes and sizes, but our experts will work with the overall vision to ensure the finalized design is perfect.
Luxury design encompasses the aesthetic of a particular brand and conveys it subtly to customers. Through the use of subdued colors and simple lines, luxury fixtures provide a neutral and elegant way to display product. Luxury fixtures can create a retail environment that highlights a sense of space, soft light, and warmth. Custom designs are not distracting from the product, but provide a modern alternative to a traditional retail fixture. Luxury custom designs can be newly created for a single focus product or for a full department. The versatility of timeless fixtures is the ability to transition from season to season. Quality luxury fixtures reflect the timelessness of the product. Minimalist designs are preferred for a luxury setting for the plain yet bold lines.

This article is a reprint from LynnPierce.com April 22, 2009. I'm posting this entire cancer section on my personal story in response to requests on my Facebook page.
There have been a lot of email requests asking for books I would recommend after the posts about my breast cancer. This whole thing has come out of left field from the posting of a youtube.com video last Saturday. But it is almost the 10 year anniversary of my breast cancer diagnosis.
Breast Cancer? Breast Health! by Susan S. Weed gave me the best education of anything I read at the exact time I needed it.
Diet For a New America by John Robbins was the straw that broke the camels back in terms of my 15 years of nutritional research that convinced me to stop eating meat almost 20 years ago.
Spontaneous Healing by Andrew Weil and Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom by Christiane Northrup were 2 of the mind/body books I pulled off my book shelf immediately after diagnosis.
This one is a little different. Sanctuary, The Path to Consciousness by Stephen Lewis & Evan Slawson is not going to be everyone’s cup of tea.
It came to me in a different way as well. 9 years ago I was surprised when the author’s office called me and told me Michael Beckwith had given them my cell number and asked them to send me this book, so they needed my mailing address. I didn’t recall ever having discussed this with Michael Beckwith, but I’m pretty sure I had talked to Rickie Byars Beckwith about how I had cured myself of breast cancer. So I think that had something to do with why he sent me this book. Check it out, but I know, just like the monks in the video that started this whole conversation, it may blow your mind.
I have been studying health and nutrition and the mind/body connection since 1981, so my library is pretty big on this. If there are boks that have been really impactful for you in dealing with breast cancer, you’re welcome to comment and post them here.

The Health Tech Alliance team got the chance to listen to Jeremy Hunt in conversation with Andrew Neil, where the Health Secretary gave an insight into his plans for the NHS and discussed in frank terms, the future of funding.
The Daily Politics host questioned Hunt on whether the NHs was still ‘the envy of the world’, when outcomes lagged behind many other European countries, particularly in cancer survival rates. He admitted that outcomes must improve but stated that the NHS was the envy of the world, not necessarily for its outcomes but for its values, citing the fact that access to healthcare regardless of wealth, set us above others in Europe.
When questioned by the Daily Politics host on the need to improve outcomes, Hunt referred to the recently promised £20bn of NHS funding, but warned that this money alone would not transform the NHS and that productivity must improve too and agreed with Neil that the amount promised would merely allow the NHS to “tread water unless it is spent differently from the past”.
The Health Secretary said that NHS England were being given 6 months to draw up a 10-year plan to improve productivity, confirming that the money was indeed conditional on a suitable plan that met minimum requirements. Neil grilled him further, asking if the Government was willing to deny the funding if the plan was not suitable, but Hunt assured his host and the audience that the expectations were discussed with NHS Chief Exec Simon Stevens, who believed it was do-able.
The Government’s claims of a ‘Brexit dividend’ were not forgotten by Neil, who probed on whether the majority of the NHS bonus would be paid by such a dividend, to which the Health Secretary admitted that it would not, at least not for 2020 or 2021 when we still had clear payments to make to the EU. He admitted that taxes would go up to fund the spending boost and stated that the Prime Minister had been upfront about this, arguing that if voters are given the choice of lower taxes or better public services, people will choose the latter.
Asking his final question, Neil questioned on whether health would indeed be his last job in British Politics. To this, Hunt’s answer was coy, but he stated that if it was his last job, he would be immensely proud.

In a bathroom remodel, like in any other renovation work, the structures have to be considered highly. Anything that would undermine the integrity of the structures should be pointed out to an an architect.
Flooring or vanities may need to be refinished and not replaced to achieve a bathroom remodeling dream.
Bathtub refinishing saves the expense of replacing a bathtub. It may costs about $300 to buy a new bathtub, but it may cost between $2500 to $3000 to replace an old bathtub. The reasons are obvious.
Home improvement tear outs account for about 47% of the junk that ends up in the landfills. Tearing makes a lot of mess and involves, walls, tiles, plumbers and their respective sub-contractors. All the Latham NY tear out adds up to quite some money when compared to refinishing, re-using and recycling.
Bathtub refinishing costs between $450 -$650 compared to about $2500 to replace a bathtub. The savings is over 80% the cost of replacement. That is why many hotels, homeowners, apartments, retirement homes, and government agencies are choosing bathtub refinishing as a big part of their green bathroom remodeling.
When bathtub refinishing is incorporated as a big part Latham NY of the bathroom remodeling process, less waste goes to the landfills. This is an environmental benefit to the environment. Additionally, when old but sturdy wood cabinets in your bathroom are refinished, instead of being replaced, trees are saved, that benefit us in so many ways. Bathtub refinishing, combined with green bathroom remodeling benefits are savings in money, time and environment.
With the popularity Latham NY of HGTV and other remodeling shows, a lot of people think that they can be the weekend warrior. Take a hard and careful look at your bathroom remodeling project. If all you are doing is cosmetics, you may be able to do the renovation yourself. Remember that all tasks are not created equal. It may be easy to install a new toilet, but installing new bathtub or tiled shower is Latham NY for the professionals.
The process of hiring a professional contractor to tackle your bathroom renovations can make your head spin pretty quick.
First, there are many bath renovation companies out there. Look under ‘General Contractors’ or ‘Bathroom Remodeling’ in the phone book and you will see what we mean…there are hundreds of bathroom remodelers and general contractors in each area. On top of that, there are hundreds of other great contractors that remodel bathrooms but are not in Shower Remodel Cost Latham NY the phone book.
Second, it is pretty easy to go around calling yourself a professional bathroom remodeling pro. People don’t necessarily need an office or a lot of fancy equipment or tools to start a business. Therefore, individuals that have done some repairs on a few houses or rooms can try to trick you into believing they are a highly skilled and experienced bathroom remodeling professional. If they have a truck, a tool belt, and Latham NY a business card they could fool a lot of people!
Finally, there are many different types of contractors that remodel bathrooms. There are handymen, general contractors, builders, construction companies, and companies that specialize in only bathroom renovations.
o Asking your friends and neighbors to see if they have had good or bad experiences with local contractors. Simply knowing that another person has Shower Remodel Cost Latham NY had a good experience with a contractor prior to calling them lessens your chance of hiring a problem.
o Call 3 or 4 companies to bid on your remodeling project. This will help you determine fair market price for your job. This does not mean you should always go with the lowest price. You should go with the company you feel most comfortable with and who you feel will do the best job. If an Latham NY individual is offering a real low price you should ask yourself, “why?”.
o Decide exactly what you want to do to remodel your bathroom. At a minimum you should have a few general ideas before calling a contractor. They can help you make some final decisions, but you need to be able to explain your basic needs before letting them talk you into things.
o Try to decide if your work can be accomplished by a Latham NY handyman, or if it is more involved. If you are simply laying some tile, painting, and changing some fixtures you should feel confident that a quality handyman could handle this work. If you are talking about tearing things up and changing the entire bathroom around, then your best chance of success is by hiring an experienced general contractor.
o Make sure the company has insurance. There is a chance for injury and for destruction of Latham NY your house when remodeling a bathroom. As mentioned above there are many fly-by-night contractors that may not be insured. Ask them for their insurance company’s phone number and call them to prove they are insured. If you skip this part you could be held liable for an uninsured worker’s injury while working on your house. You could also be left with the bill for tons of repairs if an uninsured contractor leaves you with Latham NY a destroyed bathroom or house!
o Ask if the bath remodel contractor will be able to handle all of the work you require themselves, or if they will have to sub some of the work out to other companies (such as a plumber). If they are subbing jobs out, make sure that their contract states that they are still directly responsible for all work. In other words, you will not have a situation where a Latham NY plumber installed your new toilet incorrectly and the contractor is telling you that it is not his problem. What happens if you can’t get in touch with the plumber they hired after the job is complete? You want one person to be held responsible.
o If your bathroom remodel requires a general contractor, or you simply decide to hire a company that states that they are general contractors, make sure they have a valid General Latham NY Contractors License
o Always get a statement of work performed in writing. Keep this filed away. Make sure the statements clearly state what work is to be performed.
o Ask if the bathroom remodeling comes with guarantees. These are factors to weigh when looking at the total cost estimates left by different contractors.
o Some contractors require an upfront payment. Agree to a payment schedule (which is a written document that clearly states how much and when Latham NY payments are due). Make sure your payment schedule is discussed and documented on your contract prior to beginning work. Stick to this schedule even if the contractor asks for early payment. You do not want to get into a situation where you have paid for the majority of the bathroom remodeling work, but the majority of the remodeling in your bathroom is not completed!!…these situations often end in unfinished or poorly finished jobs.
o Check Latham NY in on your bathroom remodeling progress regularly- try to catch potential problems or misunderstandings before it is too late.
Remodeling a bathroom is a significant expense, and one that you only want to do once. Never is this more true as it relates to shower enclosures. Properly done, your new shower will provide years of enjoyment and comfort. It is important to understand the proper way to construct a shower. Even if you hire a contractor to perform this work, you Bathroom Makeovers Latham NY will be able to sleep better at night knowing that your shower was installed correctly.
Traditionally, shower floors are constructed by first installing a rubber pan liner and mortar bed. The finished tile is installed over the mortar bed. Virtually every shower we have seen that was constructed using this technique leaked water. This is a bad situation, as water promotes the growth Latham NY of mold and mildew and has the potential for rotting wood which provides a home for nasty things like termites.
Another common problem are shower curbs that leak water. It’s easy to understand why if you know how they are built. If you cover wood with a rubber membrane, and then attach the membrane with nails, each nail hole is an opportunity for Bathroom Remodeling Contractors Latham NY water to penetrate and cause damage.
Shower walls do not fair much better. Most shower walls are constructed using greenboard or cement board as a backing. To make matters worse, drywall screws or standard nails are used to fasten the wall backing instead of stainless steel screws which are rust-proof. Tile grout is not impervious to water infiltration. Over time, grout can crack Latham NY and allow water to get behind or underneath the tile. This will cause deterioration of whatever tile backing was used.
And last but not least, many showers have recessed nooks for things like soap or shampoo bottles. They are a common source of water problems in showers because they are hard to waterproof.
Installation of a vent fan in your shower is a very Latham NY good idea, as this will eliminate the excess humidity that gets generated from taking a hot shower. Many vent fan units incorporate a light as well.
Prior to installing your new shower, you should inspect the framing for any existing water damage and repair as necessary. Minor mildew or mold can be cleaned with bleach.
Wood that has rotted should be replaced. Using Latham NY a straight edge, check the wall stubs for any bowed studs. If you find any, replace the stud.
If your shower will incorporate nooks, then purchase one of the size that fits your needs and install it into the framing cavity.
Installation of a vapor barrier is very important and something that many contractors will forgo. Run a thin bead of construction glue on Latham NY each stud and wall plate. Using 6 mil plastic, attach the sheet to the wall studs. Be sure to seal the top and bottom of the vapor barrier to the upper and lower wall plates with duct tape. The vapor barrier prevents condensation from forming between your walls.
Fortunately, there is a way to build a leakproof shower that will last forever. Schluter Latham NY Systems is a company that provides an engineered solution to creating shower enclosures. They manufacture a shower kit that contains everything you need to create a waterproof shower enclosure. A waterproof composite floor pan with an integrated drain is used to create the shower floor. The floor pan is pre-sloped ensuring that after your shower, any remaining water flows to the drain Latham NY and leaves your shower floor dry. The shower curb is also constructed with a composite curb.
The shower floor tile should be installed first. It is a good idea to use a tile between 4-6″ square on the shower floor. Using Latham NY a smaller tile means more grout lines and therefore more potential for water to get through the grout. A larger tile will not conform to the slope of the floor. The tile should be installed with thinset mortar. Do not use Mastic adhesive in your shower.
Install the shower wall tile next. Your tile supply house sells a product called grout-caulk. This should Latham NY be used wherever the shower walls join (the corners) and where the shower walls meet a horizontal surface (the floor, the ceiling, the shower bench). Houses do shift slightly over time, and grout caulk will not crack due to minor movement.
Finally, grout your tile using a sanded grout. Be sure to use a tile sealer over all tile surfaces after grouting.

1. Wall Tiles: Most contractors will tell you that 4 by 4 inch wall tiles are outdated. Replace them with 8 by 13 Latham NY inch glazed ceramic tiles. The new tiles will be attractive and will help prevent mold. They will also keep your lower walls from being damaged by splashes from faucets. As part of your bathroom remodeling, paint the upper walls, and run a decorative border of tiles between lower wall tiles and the upper, painted wall.
2. Floor tiles: Visible, light flooring can create a feeling of increased space. If your bathroom Bathroom Makeovers Latham NY remodeling project is, at least in part, because your bathroom seems small, install 12 by 12 inch light-colored floor tiles diagonally.

3. Heated Floor: Before you lay those floor tiles, consider heated floor as part of your bathroom remodeling project. Your whole family will appreciate them, and when it comes time to sell your home, heated bathroom Latham NY floors will be an enormous selling point.
4. Vanity: Use your bathroom remodeling as an opportunity to get clean, free lines. Replace the vanity with a new “floating” type that does not touch the floor. Choose one with a granite or marble countertop. If you like the granite when you’re done, your bathroom remodeling project can prepare you for replacing kitchen countertops later. You may want a granite vanity top with Latham NY one of the new vessel sinks.
5. Faucets: Faucets at the sink and tub are a wonderful place to begin a bathroom remodeling project. Once thought utilitarian, faucets have become stylish fixtures. At little cost, you can replace yours with vintage Victorian faucets, or sleek bamboo faucets resembling the bamboo fountain in an Asian garden.
6. Toilets: Relocating a toilet can call for major bathroom remodeling. Replacing it, however, is a simpler Latham NY task, and can quickly update an old bathroom. If you want to further update your bath, consider adding a bidet. This bathroom remodeling project may require a contractor.
7. Lighting: Much bathroom remodeling falls short of its goal because overhead lighting is allowed to remain. While moisture resistant can lights above tub or shower can be helpful, an overhead light should be replaced by wall lights to increase the value of Latham NY your bath.
8. Shower: If space allows, consider adding a separate shower to your bath area. Keep the tub for a spa-like retreat, but install a shower, too, with body sprays. If you like the natural, spa idea, look for a shower that has stone surround tile. This bathroom remodeling idea is bound to increase the value of your home.
9. Colors: The simplest bathroom remodeling project, and often an effective one, Latham NY is to change the colors in the bathroom. If the bathroom remodel is being done to increase home value for sale, avoid unusual color combinations. Apply the tried and true 60-30-10 rule to your colors: 60 percent of your bathroom should be a dominant color, 30 percent a secondary color, and 10 percent an accent color.
Bathroom remodeling ideas are many because people have many different tastes. Different locations also inspire Latham NY different ideas. Bathroom remodeling in Seattle is bound to be different from bathroom remodeling in Pensacola. Many things will come to bear on your bathroom remodeling ideas, but in the end, you should create something peaceful and functional for you and your family.

It has been directly elected every five years by universal suffrage since 1979. Although the European Parliament has legislative power that such bodies as those above do not possess, it does not have legislative initiative like most national parliaments. While it is the "first institution" of the European Union (mentioned first in the treaties, having ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level), the Council has greater powers over legislation than the Parliament where codecision procedure (equal rights of amendment and rejection) does not apply. It has, however, had control over the EU budget since the 1970s and has a veto over the appointment of the European Commission.
The European Parliament has two meeting places, namely the Immeuble Louise Weiss in Strasbourg, France, which serves for plenary sessions and is the official seat and the Espace Léopold/Leopoldwijk complex in Brussels, Belgium, the smaller of the two, which serves for preparatory meetings and complementary, non-plenary sessions. The cost of having all MEPs and their staff moving several times a year from one place to another has been of concern to some. The Secretariat of the European Parliament, the Parliament's administrative body, is based in Luxembourg.[3]
The President of the European Parliament (its speaker) presides over a multi-party chamber, the two largest groups being the European People's Party-European Democrats (EPP-ED) and the Party of European Socialists (PES).
The Parliament, like the other institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on September 10, 1952. One of the oldest common institutions, it began as the "Common Assembly" of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 parliamentarians drawn from the national parliaments of member states, having no legislative powers. This change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell of the University of Manchester:[1]
For much of its life, the European Parliament could have been justly labelled a 'multi-lingual talking shop'. But this is no longer the case: the EP is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world both in terms of its legislative and executive oversight powers.
Its development since its foundation is testament to the evolution of the Union's structures without one clear "master plan." Some such as Tom Reid of the Washington Post said of the Union, "nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU."[4] Even the Parliament's two seats, which have switched several times, is a result of various agreements or lack of agreements.
The body was not mentioned in the original Schuman Declaration, it was instead proposed by Jean Monnet on the second day of negotiations as an institution which would counterbalance and monitor the executive while providing democratic legitimacy. The wording of the ECSC Treaty demonstrated the leaders desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by using the term "representatives of the people" and allowed for direct election. Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a European Political Community. In this the "Ad Hoc" Assembly was established with extra members but after the failure of the proposed European Defence Community their project was dropped.
Despite this the European Economic Community and Euratom were established in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the "European Parliamentary Assembly." The three communities merged in 1967 and the body was renamed to the current "European Parliament" in 1962. In 1970 the Parliament was granted power over areas the Community's budget, which were expanded to the whole budget in 1975.
Under the Rome Treaties, the Parliament should have become elected. However the Council did not put in place the necessary agreements and only did so after the Parliament threatened to take the Council to the European Court of Justice. However, the Council did not agree on the envisaged uniform voting system.[5]
In 1979, its members were directly elected for the first time. This set it apart from similar institutions such as those of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe or Pan-African Parliament which are appointed. After that first election, the parliament held its first session on July 11, 1979, electing Simone Veil MEP as its President. Veil was also the first female President of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.
The Parliament quickly made use of its legitimacy. For example in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the "draft Treaty establishing the European Union" (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur Altiero Spinelli MEP). Although it was not adopted, many ideas were later implemented by other treaties. Further more the Parliament began holding votes on proposed Commission Presidents from the 1980s, before it was given any formal right to veto.[6] Since the election the membership of the European Parliament has simply expanded whenever new nations have joined (the membership was also adjusted upwards in 1994 after German reunification). Following this the Treaty of Nice imposed a cap on the number of members to be elected–732.
Like the other institutions, the Parliament's seat was not yet fixed. The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would remain in Strasbourg but must also hold part sessions in Brussels. This two seat arrangement was contested by Parliament but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.
The Parliament had been gaining more powers from successive treaties, namely through the extension of codecision procedure, and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission.[7] The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and miss-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning on mass, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of an impending censure from the Parliament.[8]
In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted pressure on the Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the Civil liberties committee, rejecting Rocco Buttiglione from the post of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That was the first time the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the Barroso Commission to take office.
In addition to the extension of codecision, the Parliament's democratic mandate has given it greater control over legislation against the other institutions. In voting on the Bolkestein directive in 2006, the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The Financial Times described it in the following terms:[9]
The European parliament has suddenly come into its own. It marks another shift in power between the three central EU institutions. Last week's vote suggests that the directly elected MEPs, in spite of their multitude of ideological, national and historical allegiances, have started to coalesce as a serious and effective EU institution, just as enlargement has greatly complicated negotiations inside both the Council and Commission.
In 2007, for the first time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini included Parliament in talks on the second Schengen Information System even though MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated he would like to include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they would gain in 2009 under the Lisbon Treaty.[10]
The Parliament and Council are essentially two chambers in the bicameral legislative branch of the European Union, with legislative power officially distributed equally between both chambers. However there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor Council have the power of legislative initiative. In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). While Parliament can amend and reject legislation, and make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law.[11]
The Parliament also has indirect influence, through non-binding resolutions and committee hearings, as a "pan-European soapbox" with the ear of thousands of Brussels-based journalists. There is also an indirect effect on foreign policy; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for post-war Iraq reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of Iranian nuclear development, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States.[12]
With each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament have expanded. Its powers have been primarily defined through the Union's legislative procedures. The method which has slowly become the dominant procedure (about three-quarters of policy areas) is the Codecision procedure, where powers are essentially equal between Parliament and Council. Codecision provides an equal footing between the two bodies. Under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council. They then send amendments to the Council, which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a "common position." That proposal may either be approved or further amendments may be tabled by the Parliament. If the Council does not approve these, then a "Conciliation Committee" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a common position. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, again by an absolute majority.[13] In addition to codecision, the Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the Bolkestein directive in 2006.[9]
Other procedures include: Cooperation, meaning the Council can overrule the Parliament if it is unanimous; Consultation, which requires just consultation of the Parliament; and Assent procedure, where the Parliament has a veto. The Commission and Council, or just Commission, can also act completely independently of the Parliament, but the use of these procedures are very limited. The procedure also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to maneuver in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person/group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue recommendations and opinions which are merely non-binding, declarations. There is a further document which does not follow normal procedures; this is a "written declaration" which is similar to an early day motion used in the Westminster system. It is a document proposed by up to five MEPs on a matter within the EU's activities used to launch a debate on that subject. Having been posted outside the entrance to the hemicycle, members can sign the declaration and if a majority do so it is forwarded to the President and announced to the plenary before being forwarded to the other institutions and formally noted in the minutes.
The legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority, powers gained through the Budgetary Treaties of the 1970s. The EU's budget is divided into compulsory and non-compulsory spending. Compulsory spending is that resulting from EU treaties (including agriculture) and international agreements; the rest is non-compulsory. While the Council has the last word on compulsory spending, the Parliament has the last word on non-compulsory spending.
The institutions draw up budget estimates and the Commission consolidates them into a draft budget. Both the Council and the Parliament can amend the budget with the Parliament adopting or rejecting the budget at its second reading. The signature of the Parliament's president is required before the budget becomes law.
The Parliament is also responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets, on the basis of the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the Santer Commission.[14][5]
The President of the European Commission is proposed by the Council (in practice by the European Council) and that proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a simple majority), essentially giving the Parliament a veto but not propose the head of the executive. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member-states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.[6] In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but it did seem likely when the Barroso Commission was put forward. The resulting pressure forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to parliament.[15] That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also voted along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public, who previously gave the lowest ever turnout for the Parliament's elections.[16]
The Parliament also has the power to censure the Commission if they have a two-thirds majority which will force the resignation of the entire Commission from office. As with approval, this power has never been used but it was threatened to the Santer Commission, who subsequently resigned of their own accord. There are a few other controls, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer questions from MEPs, the requirement of the President-in-office of the European Council to present their program at the start of their presidency, the right of MEPs to make proposals for legislation and policy to the Commission and Council, and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. "Commission Question Time" every Tuesday).[6]
The Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the Maastricht Treaty.[17] The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA detention flights—the former led to the creation of the European veterinary agency. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to court if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors[18] and the president and executive board of the European Central Bank. The ECB president is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.
The European Ombudsman is elected by the Parliament, who deals with public complaints against all institutions. Petitions can also be brought forward by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The Committee on Petitions hears cases, some 1,500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to resolve the issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.[19]
The parliamentarians are known in English as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every five years by universal adult suffrage and sit according to political allegiance, about a third are women. Prior to 1979 they were appointed by their national parliaments. The number now stands at 751, with each member state having at least six and at most 96 MEPs.
As states are allocated seats according to population, the total number of MEPs should be 732; however, after January 1, 2007 there were 785 MEPs. This was due to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, as the allocation of seats does not take into account members that join mid-term. Under the existing rules the number of members would have been reduced again to 732 following the 2009 election[20] however the rules were due to be changed under the Lisbon Treaty. Instead, there would be 751 members, however the President would no longer be counted as a voting member once in office so in practice there would be 750 members.[21] In addition, the maximum number of seats allocated to a state would be lowered to ninety-six, from the current ninety-nine, and the minimum number of seats would be raised to six, from the current five. These seats are distributed according to "degressive proportionality," meaning that the larger the state, the more citizens that are represented per MEP.
Before 2009, members received the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs are entitled to a pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and traveling expenses, based on actual cost In addition to their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials traveling abroad, and by other state governments the facilities of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and in other states they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offense. The Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.[22]
MEPs in Parliament are organized into seven different parliamentary groups, including fifteen non-attached members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party-European Democrats (EPP-ED) and the Party of European Socialists (PES). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats together. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament.[23]
Groups are often based around a single European political party such as the socialist group. However they can include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents, like the liberal group. For a group to be recognized, it needs 20 MEPs from six different countries. Once recognized groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on Committees, creating an incentive for the formation of groups. However some controversy occurred with the establishment of the Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) due to its ideology; the members of the group are far-right, so there were concerns about public funds going towards such a group. There were attempts to change the rules to block the formation of ITS, however that never came to fruition. They were, however, blocked from gaining leading positions on committees–a right that is meant to be afforded to all parties.[24] When this group engaged in infighting, causing the withdrawal of some members, its size fell below the recognizable limit causing its collapse.[25]
Given that the Parliament does not form the government in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. For much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the People's Party and Socialist Party. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, there have been some occasions where real party politics have emerged, like the resignation of the Santer Commission;[8]
When the initial allegations against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the Community budget, President Jacques Santer stated that a "no vote" would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence. PES supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. PES leader, Pauline Green MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a government-opposition dynamic, with PES supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down.[8] Politicization such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the London School of Economics noted that;[1]
Our work also shows that politics in the European Parliament is becoming increasingly based around party and ideology. Voting is increasingly split along left-right lines, and the cohesion of the party groups has risen dramatically, particularly in the fourth and fifth parliaments. So there are likely to be policy implications here too.
During the fifth term, 1999 to 2004, there was a break in the grand coalition resulting in in a center-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties.[26] This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and PES.[27]
Elections have taken place, directly in every member-state, every five years since 1979. Occasionally, when a member joins mid-term, a by-election will be held to elect their members. This has happened four times, the last time was when Romania and Bulgaria joined in 2007 (see below). Elections take place across several days according to local custom and, aside from having to be proportional, the electoral system is chosen by the member-state. This includes allocation of sub-national constituencies; while most members have a national list, some, like the UK and France, divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member-states according to their population, with no state having more than 99, but no fewer than 5, in order to maintain proportionality.
The proportion of MEPs elected in 2004 who were female was 30.2 percent; in 1979 it was just 16.5 percent. There were a number of proposals to "dress up" the 2009 elections to attract greater public attention to them. These included most notably the idea of linking them more closely to the Commission presidency. This would be by having political parties running with candidates for the job, so the largest party would essentially be forming the government, as in the parliamentary system of government. It is hoped such changes would add legitimacy and counter the falling turnout[28][29] which had dropped consistently every year since the first election; from 1999 it has been below 50 percent.
Each year the activities of the Parliament cycle between committee weeks where reports are discussed in committees and interparliamentary delegations meet, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups and session weeks where members spend three days in Strasbourg for part-sessions. In addition six two-day part-sessions are organized in Brussels throughout the year. Four weeks are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks. The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority. Its meetings are partly controlled by the treaties but are otherwise up to Parliament according to its own "Rules of Procedure" (the regulations governing the parliament).[30]
During sessions, members may speak after being called on by the President, with a time limit of one minute. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates.[31][32] Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting.[33] Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case however, that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. Each MEP in turn is called by name, in alphabetical order, to state their support or opposition. This is a historical system used when the Parliament was much smaller in membership and is rarely used now. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example when the President is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online.
Members are arranged in a hemicycle according to their political groups who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the center, and in the very center is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers also act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited in the same manner as the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.
The President is essentially the speaker of the Parliament. The President presides over the plenary when it is in session and the President's signature is required for all acts adopted by co-decision, including the EU budget. The President is also responsible for representing the Parliament externally, including in legal matters, and for the application of the rules of procedure. He or she is elected for two-and-a-half-year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term.[34]
In most countries, the protocol of the head of state comes before all others, however in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol of its President comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depends upon the President. President Josep Borrell MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona which had engraved upon it parts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights among other things.
A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP, one of the founding fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide De Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The two female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen.
During the election of a President, the plenary is presided over by the oldest member of the Parliament. In 2004 and 2007 this was Giovanni Berlinguer MEP. While the oldest member is in the chair, they hold all the powers of the President, but the only business that may be addressed is the election of the President.[35]
Below the President, there are 14 Vice-Presidents who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are a number of other bodies and posts responsible for the running of parliament besides these speakers. The two main bodies are the Bureau, which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues, and the Conference of Presidents which is a governing body composed of the presidents of each of the parliament's political groups. Looking after the financial and administrative interests of members are six Quaestors.
The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees consisting of 28 to 86 MEPs each (reflecting the political makeup of the whole Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to be presented to the plenary.[36] The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.[8]
Committees can also set up sub-committees (e.g. the Subcommittee on Human Rights) and temporary committees to deal with a specific topic (e.g. on extraordinary rendition). The chairs of the Committees coordinate their work through the "Conference of Committee Chairmen".[36] When co-decision was introduced it increased the Parliaments powers in a number of areas, but most notably those covered by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Previously this committee was considered by MEPs as a "Cinderella committee," however as it gained a new importance, it became more professional and rigorous attracting more and more attention to its work.[5]
Delegations of the Parliament are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 34 delegations made up of around 15 MEPs, chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do. They include "Interparliamentary delegations" (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), "joint parliamentary committees" (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the delegation to the ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.[36] MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue and through election observation in third countries.[37]
Speakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the EU's 23 official languages, ranging from English and French to Maltese and Irish. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated. Citizens may also address the Parliament in Basque, Catalan/Valencian and Galician.
Usually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translator's native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, including minor ones, since 1995 translation is sometimes done the opposite way, out of a translator's native tongue (the "retour" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be translated via a third language for lack of interpreters ("relay" interpreting)–for example, when translating Estonian into Maltese.
Interpreters need to be proficient in two other Union languages besides their native language. Due to the complexity of the issues, translation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question).
While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, the translation and the cost of it has been criticized by some. A 2006 report by Alexander Stubb MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from €118,000 per day (for 21 languages then—Romanian and Bulgarian having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day.[38] Although many see the ideal single language as English due to its widespread usage, there is a campaign to make French the single tongue for all legal texts, due to its more precise legal language, overcoming ambiguity between translations of legislation.
The Parliament is based in three different cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament.[3]
The Strasbourg seat is seen as a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany (Strasbourg having been fought over by the two countries in the past), but questions over the cost have been raised. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the Council of Europe (with which the "mutual cooperation" is continuously "fostered"[39]), Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions.
There is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is due to the fact that the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the 'capital' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing through numerous figures, including the Commission First-Vice President who stated that "something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol–of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions."[40] The Green party has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by Jean Lambert MEP and Caroline Lucas MEP; in addition to the extra 200 million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268 tons of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. In 2006 there were allegations of irregularity in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented which harmed the city's image further.[41] However the Parliament, the only assembly in the world with more than one seat, does not have the right to choose its own meeting place. This is left up to the Council with the possibility of a change being vetoed by one state.
The Lisbon Treaty largely retains the reforms outlined in the rejected Constitutional Treaty.[42] Overall, powers would be increased. For example, nearly all policy areas would fall under co-decision procedure (now called the "ordinary legislative procedure") meaning that the Parliament would have practically equal powers to those of the Council (now officially the Council of Ministers). In the remaining minority of areas in which the powers remain unequal, the Council must consult the Parliament and/or seek its approval on the legislation. The Parliament also gains greater powers over the entirety of the EU budget, not just non-compulsory expenditure, through the ordinary legislative procedure. Composition of the Parliament will change little, however the minimum number of seats are to be increased from five to six, and the maximum number reduced from 99 to 96. There will also be basic rules on the distribution of seats in the Parliament, rather than negotiated at each enlargement. Decisions about the composition of the Parliament will remain the work of Council but made based on a proposal from the Parliament itself.
In addition to the institutional reforms brought by the Lisbon Treaty, in 2007 the President set up the Special working group on parliamentary reform to improve the efficiency and image of the Parliament. Some ideas include livening up the plenary sessions and a State of the Union debate. One of the group's key reform ideas, extra debates on topical issues, was rejected by MEPs[43] causing liberal leader Graham Watson MEP to withdrew from reform group.[44] However MEPs did back a proposals for greater use of the European symbols, following their rejection in the Lisbon Treaty. It was suggested the Parliament take the avant-garde in using the symbols as it had done in adopting the flag in 1983, which was three years before the Communities as a whole.[45] An interim report was presented in September 2007 which proposed cutting down time allocated for guest speakers and non-legislative documents. In 2006, 92 "own initiative" reports (commenting rather than legislating) were tables and 22 percent of debating time was spent debating such reports, while only 18 percent was spent on legislative bills.

A wetland is a transitional environment between permanently aquatic and terrestrial environments that shares characteristics of both environments and where water, which covers the soil or is near the surface for substantial parts of the year, is the key factor in determining the nature of the ecosystem and soil. Although wetlands have aspects similar to both wet and and dry environments, they cannot be classified unambiguously as either aquatic or terrestrial (Barbier et al. 1997). Wetland do not have to be wet all the time, but generally are at least periodically covered by or saturated with water. Among types of wetlands are swamps, marshes, and bogs (defined below). They are found on every continent except Antarctica and from the tundra to the tropics (EPA 2006a).
The great variety of wetland types and the difficulty in defining their boundaries makes establishment of a precise definition difficult and controversial (Barbier et al. 1997). As Barbier et al. (1997) note: "How often and for how long does land have to be flooded before it is considered a wetland? The problems are compounded by the fact that many wetlands evolve over time, starting as open water, but infilling with sediment and vegetation eventually to become dry land." Nonetheless, the importance of establishing a working definition has led various intergovenmental and governmental bodies and academicians to establish definitions. Some of these are reproduced in the definitions of wetlands below.
Wetlands provide innumerable economic, ecological, cultural, recreational, and aesthetic values. The rich biodiversity of wetlands has led to their being described as "biological supermarkets" and "nurseries of life"; their chemical and hydrological functions have led to their characterization as "the kidneys of the landscape" (Barbier et al. 1997; Mitsch and Gosselink 1993). They offer goods such as fish, timber, and peat; supply water; provide flood control; are important for groundwater recharge and discharge, water purification, and nutrient retention; are habitat to a great amount of flora and fauna; and add to the human wonder of nature.
Despite these many values, the historical view of wetlands was that they were "wastelands." Such a perspective found value in draining, diking, and otherwise modifying them in order that the lands serve intensive agricultural, residential, or industrial uses. Some wetlands were lost via mining, waste disposal, pollution, or redirecting the water for more valued purposes. It is estimated that 50 percent of the world's original wetlands have been lost, and 54 percent (87 million hectares) of original wetlands in the United States (Barbier et al. 1997). France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have reported losses from 57-66 percent in the twentieth century (Barbier et al. 1997).
The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, which has been adopted by over 150 nations since being placed into placed into force on December 21, 1975, utilizes the following broad definition:
Article 2.1. "For the purpose of this Convention, wetlands are areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water, the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres." (Article 1.1)
Article 2.1 of this Convention further notes that areas designated wetlands "may incorporate riparian and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and islands or bodies of marine water deeper than six metres at low tide lying within the wetlands."
In the United States, for regulatory purposes related to the Clean Water Act, wetlands are defined by the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Army Corps of Engineers as (EPA 2006b):
"those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions .
On the other hand, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service defines wetlands as follows (Cowardin et al. 1979):
"Wetlands are lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. For purposes of this classification wetlands must have one or more of the following three attributes: (1) at least periodically, the land supports predominantly hydrophytes; (2) the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil; and (3) the substrate is nonsoil and is saturated with water or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of the year."
Mitsch and Gosselink (1986) recognize wetland as an environment "at the interface between truly terrestrial ecosystems and aquatic systems making them inherently different from each other yet highly dependent on both."
Wetlands are found under a wide range of hydrological conditions, but at least some of the time water saturates the soil. The result is a hydric soil, one characterized by an absence of free oxygen some or all of the time, and therefore called a "reducing environment." Plants (called hydrophytes or just wetland plants) specifically adapted to the reducing conditions presented by such soils can survive in wetlands, whereas species intolerant of the absence of soil oxygen (called "upland" plants) cannot survive. Adaptations to low soil oxygen characterize many wetland species.
Intertidal wetlands are found in coastal areas where air temperature, wave action, salinity levels, and sediment movements are moderated by the locational features of the estuarine environment and ecosystem. Wetlands are a vital part of the ecosystem that provide clean drinking water for millions.
There are many types of vegetation in wetlands. Marshes are dominated by soft-stemmed vegetation, while swamps in the United States are dominated by woody plants (EPA 2004). White cedar, tamarack, and white pine are examples of trees found in swamps in the United States. Fens, freshwater peat-forming wetlands, are covered mostly by grasses, sedges, reeds, and wildflowers, while bogs, characterized by spongy peat deposits, have evergreen trees and shrubs and a floor covered by sphagnum moss (EPA 2004). Peatland can be dominated by red maple, silver maple, and elm trees. Some types of trees in peatland can exhibit lower trunks and roots that have adapted to the wet surroundings by forming buttresses. These are strange raised roots that resemble knees. Below the canopy, there are often limited amounts of shrubs such as speckled alder, winterberry, and sweet gale.
Plants such as cattails, bulrushes, sedges, arrowhead, water lilies, blue flag, and floaters like common duckweed may be found in various wetlands. Pondweed is also another type of plant that grows in wetlands, but it is not easily seen.
A bog or muskeg is acidic peat land (peat bog). It is a freshwater wetland, often formed in old glacial lakes and characterized by spongy peat deposits (EPA 2004).
A moor was originally the same as a bog but has come to be associated with this soil type on hill-tops.
A fen is a freshwater, peat-forming wetland with chemically basic (which roughly means alkaline) ground water. This means that it contains a moderate or high proportion of hydroxyl ions (pH value greater than 7).
A carr is a fen that has developed to the point where it supports trees. It is a European term, mainly applied in the north of the United Kingdom.
A fresh-water marsh's main feature is its openness, with only low-growing or "emergent" plants. It may feature grasses, rushes, reeds, typhas, sedges, and other herbaceous plants (possibly with low-growing woody plants) in a context of shallow water. It is an open form of fen.
A coastal salt marsh may be associated with estuaries and along waterways between coastal barrier islands and the inner coast. The plants may extend from reed in mildly brackish water to salicornia on otherwise bare marine mud. It may be converted to human use as pasture (salting) or for salt production (saltern).
A swamp is wetland with more open water surface and deeper water than a marsh. In North America, it is used for wetlands dominated by trees and woody bushes rather than grasses and low herbs, but this distinction does not necessarily apply in other areas, for instance in Africa where swamps may be dominated by papyrus.
A dambo is a shallow, grass-covered depression of the central and southern African plateau that is waterlogged in the rainy season, and usually forms the headwaters of a stream or river. It is marshy at the edges and at the headwater, but maybe swampy in the center and downstream.
A mangrove swamp or mangal is a salt or brackish water environment dominated by the mangrove species of tree, such as Sonneratia.
A bayou or slough are southern United States terms for a creek among swamp. In an Indian mangrove swamp, it would be called a creek.
A constructed wetland is artificially contrived wetland, intended to absorb flash floods, clean sewage, enhance wildlife or for some other human reason.
A pocosin is a bog-like wetland dominated by fire-adapted shrubs and trees, found mainly in the southeastern United States on the Atlantic Coastal Plain.
In the United States, the four general categories of wetlands, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, are marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) produces and provides information on the characteristics, extent, and status of U.S. wetlands and deepwater habitats and other wildlife habitats. The NWI also produces periodic reports on the status and trends of wetlands in the conterminous U.S. The NWI website includes a Wetlands Mapper in which users can view, download, or print maps of digital wetlands information.
The Pantanal is an example of a wetland system that involves a variety of wetland types. An immense alluvial plain, the Pantanal is considered by many to be the world’s largest, freshwater, wetland system. It is situated along the northernmost part of the Paraguay River and its tributaries and becomes extensively flooded during the rainy season. It extends through millions of hectares of central-western Brazil, eastern Bolivia, and northeastern Paraguay in central South America. Estimates of its size range from 140,000 square kilometers (54,000 square miles) to 210,000 square kilometers (81,000 square miles), making it larger than many countries. Within the Pantanal are diverse types of riverine, lacustrine, and palustrine wetlands, as well as large rivers, lakes, and other standing water and terrestrial ecosystems. Riverine refers to river-related environments, and lacustrine to lake-related environments, while palustrine include inland wetlands that lack flowing water, such as inland marshes, swamps, bogs, and fens.
Wetlands are among the world's most productive environments and provide innumerable economic, ecological, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values. We can look at such values in terms of wetland components, functions, and attributes (Barbier et al. 1997).
Components. The components of wetland systems include such economically beneficial goods as fish, timber, peat, and wildlife. Wetlands likewise provide water supply for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, and the structure of wetlands may allow for economical water transport. Some wetland systems offer enriched agricultural land as a result of improving the soil fertility through periodic inundation of flood waters. Fish and wildlife provide opportunities for leisure fishing activities and tourism. Barbier et al. (1997) report that two-thirds of the fish we eat depend upon wetlands at some stage of their life cycle. In Vietnam and Thailand, the Melaleuca wetland forests provide many diverse products, including medicine (Barbier et al. 1997).
Functions. Wetlands also fulfill important functions, such as flood control, groundwater recharge and discharge, water purification through retention of sediments and pollutants, storm protection, water table maintenance, and stabilization of climate. Nutrient retention occurs when nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus accumulate in the sub-soil or vegetation and allow eventual circulation back into the atmosphere. Wetland may serve as sediment settling ponds.
By absorbing the force of strong winds and tides, wetlands protect terrestrial areas adjoining them from storms, floods, and tidal damage. Wetlands remove nutrients from surface and ground water by filtering and by converting nutrients to unavailable forms. Denitrification is arguably the most important of these reactions because humans have increased nitrate worldwide by applying fertilizers. Increased nitrate availability can cause eutrophication, but denitrification converts biologically available nitrogen back into nitrogen gas, which is biologically unavailable except to nitrogen fixing bacteria. Denitrification circulates the nitrogen back into the atmosphere. Denitrification can be detected in many soils, but denitrification is fastest in wetlands soils (Ullah and Faulkner 2006).
Attributes. An attribute of wetlands is biodiversity. Being transitional between aquatic and terrestrial environments, and involving complex interactions among such components as water, soils, topography and biotic communities, wetlands help to preserve biodiversity. This provides not only for a more stable system, but tourism and aesthetic appreciation also are often tied to biodiversity. Many wetlands also provide habitats for resident and migratory fish and wildlife. There also are cultural aspects. For example, the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq have lived in harmony with the marshes at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and they have a spiritual connection that goes beyond the direct use of the wetland products (Barbier et al. 1997). Likewise, the Fens of East Anglia and Somerset levels in the United Kingdom are important for cultural heritage (Barbier et al. 1997).
The Pantanal of South America provides an example of the above. As a wetland system of exceptional size, the Pantanal embodies many of the aforementioned values in a big way. It has one of the most impressive freshwater fisheries on the earth, serving an exceptional biogenetic reservoir. The Pantanal supports a large number of species and also an abundantly high concentration of animals, perhaps the highest in the New World and comparable to the densest animal populations in Africa (Andrade et al. 1985; Pádua 1991). The Pantanal not only provides an extensive water supply and transport system for its inhabitants, but it serves to remove sediments and pollutants, thus improving the water quality for millions of people downstream. The reduced water velocity in the Pantanal, and its storage of water, create excellent circumstances for mineral uptake by plants, microbial processing, and the settlement of sediments and chemicals such as heavy metals, which are sorbed to sediments (Gottgens 1998). Flood control is another major value of the Pantanal. The Pantanal has a regulatory effect on the Rio Paraguay, extensively reducing and delaying the height of the flood peak and thus reducing the flood risk downstream. Because of the Pantanal, the flood peak of the Paraguay is as much as two to three months later than the Paraná into which it empties, avoiding the cumulative impact of these two flood peaks combining downstream.
Intertidal wetlands provide an excellent example of invasion, modification, and succession. The invasion and succession process is establishment of seagrasses. These help stabilize sediment and increase sediment capture rates. The trapped sediment gradually develops into mud flats. Mud flat organisms become established encouraging other life forms changing the organic composition of the soils.
The mangroves establish themselves in the shallower water upslope from the mudflats. Mangroves further stabilize sediment and over time increase the soil level. This results in less tidal movement and the development of salt marshes. The salty nature of the soil means it can only be tolerated by special types of grasses (e.g. saltbush, rush, and sedge). There is also changing species diversity in each succession.
In the salt marshes, there is greater species diversity, nutrient recycling, and niche specialization making it one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth.
In intertidal wetlands, the majority of natural stress comes from salinity and tidal movements. The intertidal wetlands must be able to survive extreme conditions of mainly salt water at high tide, fresh water at low tide, and times of flood and brackish water at other times. The saline water is a very difficult condition for plants to survive in. The gray mangrove accomplishes this by excluding salt in the root system, salt glands in the leaf, and waxy leaves to minimize water loss. However, it is vulnerable to changes in salinity levels.
Changes to tidal movements through increased run-off or altered drainage can cause the roots of mangroves to be inundated for longer than normal periods affecting their pneumatophones. It can also be pushed past its threshold level if water quality is changed. Thus, even healthy ecosystems are vulnerable to change.
Some species such as oysters and mollusks have been used as indicator species, with any decline in their numbers indicating the ecosystem is under stress. A change in nutrient levels may also affect primary productivity and thus bring about change.
Historically, humans have made large-scale and small-scale efforts to drain wetlands for development or flood them for use as recreational lakes. Wetlands are often filled in to be used by humans for everything from agriculture to parking lots, in part because the economic value of wetlands has only been recognized recently. For example, the shrimp and fish that breed in salt water marshes are generally harvested in deeper water.
As a result, 50 percent of the world's original wetlands are believed to have been lost. Barbier et al. (1997) report that in Portugal 70 percent of the Western Algarve has been converted for agricultural and industrial development and that in the Philippines, 67 percent of the country's mangrove resources were lost between 1920 and 1980. they likewise report a loss of 67 percent of the wetlands in France between 1900 and 1993, 66 percent of the wetlands in Italy between 1938 and 1984, and 60 percent in Spain between 1948 and 1990. They report 54 percent of the United States's original wetlands have been lost, while the Environmental Protection Agency (2004) notes that the United States loses an additional 60,000 acres of wetlands every year, and this is a leading cause of species extinction.
Humans can maximize the area of healthy, functioning intertidal wetlands by minimizing their impacts and by developing management strategies that protect, and where possible rehabilitate those ecosystems at risk.
Since the 1970s, more focus has been put on preserving wetlands for their natural function—sometimes also at great expense. One example is the project by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to control flooding and enhance development by taming the Everglades, a project that has now been reversed to restore much of the wetlands as a natural habitat and method of flood control. Fifty years after ditching and diking the Everglades and affecting the flood-and-drought cycle, over 50 percent of the "River of Glass" has been lost, largely due to conversion to intensive residential and agricultural purposes, and the number of one-legged wading birds plunged by up to 95 percent or more (Swarts 2000). The estimated price tag to restore this is in the many billions of dollars.
Exclusion—Those responsible for the management of wetland areas often facilitate public access to a small, designated area while restricting access to other areas. Provision of defined boardwalks and walkways is a management strategy used to restrict access to vulnerable areas, as is the issuing of permits whilst visiting.
Education—In the past, wetlands were regarded as wastelands. Education campaigns have helped to change public perceptions and foster public support for the wetlands. Due to their location in the catchment area, education programs need to teach about total catchment management programs. Educational programs include guided tours for the general public, school visits, media liaison, and information centers.

After a lengthy delay between announcement and actual shipping, Canon has finally introduced the EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x.
This is a telephoto zoom lens, very much at the top end of Canon's range. It has a built-in switchable teleconverter which is operated by flicking a lever at the rear of the lens barrel, converting it to a 280-560mm f/5.6 lens.
The lens is designed for professional sports and wildlife photographers and includes an array of advanced features including Power Focus for movie shooting, and IS 'mode 3' that only applies stabilisation at the point of exposure, aiding panning.
It also offers weathersealed construction, 4-stop image stabilisation, and a minimum focus distance of 2m.
A quick guide to MTF charts (which only measure contrast and resolution. Canon's guide to their MTF charts)
Remember that MTF charts are good for comparing similar lenses, so comparing ones from the 14mm f2.8L and 300mm 2.8L won't tell you much at all, whilst comparing the EF14 2.8L with the EF14 2.8L II will show meaningful differences. Note that other manufacturers may have different ways of displaying such information that may or may not match up with the Canon figures.
London, UK, 14 May 2013 – Canon today adds a new category to its range of high-performance super-telephoto lenses, with the introduction of the EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x to Canon’s acclaimed L-series.
The EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x features a flexible 200-400mm focal range with a fixed f/4 aperture, 4-stop optical Image Stabilizer and for the first time in a commercially available lens, a built-in 1.4x extender. These features combine to provide an outstandingly versatile lens for professional sports or wildlife photographers. A robust magnesium alloy design, environmental protection and specialised lens coatings also make it ideal for mobile use, combining with the finest quality optics to deliver exceptional results, even in the harshest conditions.
The reach of the EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x is boosted by its internal 1.4x extender, which is engaged or disengaged at the flick of a lever to provide an extended focal length of 280mm to 560mm – allowing photographers to get even closer to distant action. Ensuring the highest image performance, the optical design includes both fluorite and Ultra-low Dispersion (UD) lens elements, which help minimise chromatic aberration and eliminate colour blurring. Advanced anti-reflection SubWavelength Structure Coating (SWC) and Super Spectra Coating also reduce ghosting and flare. Thanks to the use of the latest optical technologies, image performance is unaffected when the integrated extender is used.
With a constant f/4 aperture the use of high shutter speeds to capture fast-paced action or a low-light scene is possible. A newly designed optical Image Stabilizer, which provides users with a four stop advantage, while IS ‘Mode 3’ applies image stabilisation only at the time of exposure – ensuring that photographers can pan with fast-paced action without IS overcompensating for movement. This feature is ideal for sports photographers, who typically have only a split-second to capture a subject in front of them.
The EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x features Canon’s pioneering ring-type Ultrasonic Motor providing fast, silent autofocusing. For those who prefer to fine-tune focus themselves, full-time manual override allows photographers to manually focus at any moment when using AF. The Power Focus (PF) mode also increases versatility during movie shooting with the EOS-1D C or EOS-1D X, enabling photographers to achieve an accurate pull-focus effect at one of two speeds, simply by twisting the focus recall ring and stopping at a pre-set distance.
Designed to answer professional demands for superior image quality and versatile zoom range, the EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM Extender 1.4x a boasts a premium-quality design befitting Canon’s industry-renowned L-series lenses.
The tough magnesium alloy chassis ensures that, despite the inclusion of the 1.4x extender, the lens is a similar weight to lenses of comparable focal length. Fluorine coatings on the front and rear lens elements also reduce the ability of dirt to cling to the lens surface, while a dust and water-resistant construction allows photographers to shoot in challenging weather conditions. The combination of outstanding optical performance, versatility, weight and tough construction will make it an essential part of any professional sports or wildlife photographer’s kitbag.
United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, 7th February 2011 – Canon today announces the development of a telephoto zoom lens featuring an integrated focal length extender – the EF 200-400mm f/4L IS USM EXTENDER 1.4x The lens will be displayed for the first time during CP+, held in Yokohama, Japan.

I hope you’re feeling better by now. The election, and all the associated nastiness, is over for a while. Now it’s time for transition, and hopefully, getting back to whatever passes for “normal.” It was a nail-biter, and for some reason, I couldn’t stop eating BF’s ice cream. (I didn’t eat all of it, just a little.) We stayed up until 3:00 am or so watching the results, and back-checking CBS News on our phones against what was showing up on Facebook in our feeds. Bizarre–I’ve never done that before, but we finally hit the sack once it was all over. Good thing we didn’t have anything planned for the next day, and he was off work. No more sugar-laden ice cream, and the weight is going back down again, thank heavens.
We’ve been doing some renovation type of cleaning in the Casa, which includes having one of his, um, ex-girlfriends finally come get her stuff out of his house. She’s got some of it, but some still resides for a few more days. (What are we, Public Storage?) His daughter took the things she wanted and I helped her clear out stuff she didn’t want. All that’s left is his friend from the Navy. Well, with moving stuff around and out, painting the back room for my soon-to-be studio office, and clearing car parts out of the house, we’ve set up a little breakfast area by the kitchen:
This is my IKEA Tarno patio set that we just put there and put a tablecloth over, and BF decided to add my tiny lamp (Lampan, also from IKEA.) I repaired the miniblinds which had been damaged by a passed-on pooch, and cleaned the window really well. Know what? It’s kind of nice to have breakfast right there, or dinner. When we get things better situated, we’ll put my regular dinette there, and I’ll repair more of the miniblinds, now that I know how. (Looked it up on eHow and learned on the fly.) The blinds are closed so you don’t see that the Casa “beautification project” has not yet carried over to the patio out front.
After my trip to New Orleans on Sunday, where I bought some lovely pork chops, chicken sausage and chicken thighs for us, BF decided Monday to get. . .one of those “kits” to make tacos for lunch on Tuesday. I kid you not. At least he had the sense to get the crunchy taco kit, which has corn tortillas. No word about “gluten free,” but there was no wheat or its derivatives in any of the ingredients that I saw, so I was glad about that and reluctantly took part. (It does say that it was partly produced with GMO ingredients; my guess is the corn, which I rarely eat.) He asked me to brown the ground beef to get started, and of course, twenty minutes later, we had tacos–because he went into the living room to watch more TV. GRRR. . .but I got the job done.
Dinner was Mustard Pork Chops in the Crock Pot, which I may post soon. It was pretty good, and worthy of doing again. Because he really wanted. . .tacos. . .the chicken shifted to lunch on Wednesday, where I made him, for the first time, Nigella Lawson’s Pollo alla Cacciatora, or “The Hunter’s Stew,” which, in Nigella’s case, is “lazy hunter’s stew.” (It only takes 30 minutes.) Although it’s long been a comfort food favorite for me, this was his first taste of it. Thumbs up–he likes it, and I can make it again for him. (Thanks.) The next day for dinner at work, he took some with a cup of rice, since he thought it “needed” some. No problem, I cooked up a small batch of white rice for him and added it to the container. Along with a slice of made-from-scratch pound cake from his friend’s birthday, he was all set for work.
Now, if you’re interested in making this “hunter’s stew,” I want to point something out that’s not immediately obvious: although the printed recipe calls for a half-cup of pancetta cubes–which is perfectly acceptable, albeit expensive and hard to find here–you can also slice up 3 or 4 slices of bacon in place of it. That’s the way I’ve always made it since I saw the original show. The show may be on YouTube; you’d just have to look for it.
I’ve been in the larger Winn-Dixie in Hammond, and indeed they do have more organic produce. Surprise–they even have fresh sushi. I still hate sushi, but–they have it! I did some recon in the morning, and then did some shopping later in the day, mostly meat, eggs, butter, cheese, etc. I almost–ALMOST–thought I was in Kroger. And I kept saying “I live down in La Marque. . .” which, of course, is in Texas. Well, it’s probably because I felt like I was in Kroger. I sure do miss my HEB, though–the pork loin roasts I used to get on sale for $3 in HEB are something like $12 here. What’s up with that? I did find a nine-pound pork loin that was about 3 feet long, but we don’t have any place to store that monster. Another time.
Rouse’s has purchased a rival grocery store chain, so there will soon be a Rouse’s in Hammond for me to visit, right near that Winn-Dixie. That’ll be good, too.
A quick look at the calendar tells me that Thanksgiving is coming. It’s next week! I really have lost my sense of date and time. For the first time in I don’t know how many years, I won’t be cooking turkey. That’s OK, I cook turkey all year long (I just wish I could get turkey thighs here; maybe Albertson’s has them.) I asked BF the other night what our plans were for Thanksgiving; he said his brother usually does a big spread, and we would attend. (Just have to figure out what I’m going to wear.) Well, if I’m allowed, I’ll bring some of that fantastic Cranberry-Ginger Relish and maybe one or two other small things, but I warned BF that I would likely eat before I went. Longtime readers know that things like sweet potato pie, sweet potatoes with other abominable things added to it and all things bread, pie and gravy are not coming my way. I’ll be happy to have some turkey–maybe a little mashed potatoes, too–but no gravy, please! Gravy, to me, kills the taste of everything under it. So this will be interesting, and maybe I’ll pull the Nordic Track out in the morning before we go.
So, what do you do when you’re hosting such an occasion and have health concerns to consider? (Besides panic, that is.) Or, surprise, his new girlfriend is a vegetarian, and he’s going vegan soon too? Knowing this in advance helps, of course, but sometimes you don’t, so having some extra vegetable dishes helps (just don’t use chicken stock!) I’ve written about these kinds of things before, and you can also get some help on Martha Stewart’s website, under “All Things Thanksgiving.” Sur la Table has also published its annual Thanksgiving Guide, and it’s available online or as a free download to print. BF and I caught a bit of the Rachael Ray Show the other day, and someone named Clinton Kelly was making dishes you could make in advance: Turkey Meatballs, a Roasted Vegetable Soup (which looked pretty good, actually), which you could make in advance and freeze, then serve from the Crock Pot and some popover kinds of things with smoked salmon. The Quinoa Pie with Butternut Squash is really good, too. Of course, if you’re looking for something specific, please check out the worlds’s biggest idea database, Pinterest.
One thing I can’t emphasize enough is getting started on your Thanksgiving planning early. Get that turkey NOW, if you haven’t already. Get your brine mix, or make it, NOW, because the turkey has to thaw first, AND you have to make the brine ahead of time. Buy your ingredients early, especially the unusual stuff, like puff pastry or something else that everyone will be looking for like fresh or dried sage. Doing potluck? Ask and assign people a specific dish–dressing, veg, cornbread, whatever–so you avoid the problem of everyone stopping at the grocery and picking up a cake or cupcakes at the last minute. All dessert and little turkey does *not* make happy dinner guests, you know? A broad variety of different vegetable dishes, and maybe including maybe a pilaf or risotto (using vegetable stock) can keep everyone happy and well-fed while including the vegetarians and not calling them out for it.
Brining a turkey? Here’s one from Ree Drummond, The Pioneer Woman (warning: it has brown sugar) and one from Martha Stewart’s website. If you want to brine a turkey–and I highly recommend it–get going. Now. Juniper berries might be hard to find soon.
It’s also a great time to dust off the slow cookers and the waffle makers if you’re not using them regularly. Make sure all your appliances work before the big day, too. And isn’t there something you can slow-cook or waffle ahead of time? (Cranberry Ginger Relish can be made a few days in advance, thank heavens.)
Yes, it’s time to get your thinking cap on. Quick. Whether you’re hosting or just attending, it’s time to take inventory so your Thanksgiving will go well and everyone, including yourself, will enjoy themselves. (Here’s some advice I wrote about last year that may help.)
Here’s another tip: READ your recipes and understand them before you shop and get started. Case in point: last night I decided to make something new for me and BF. Seems he’s never had eggs with tomatoes in his life, despite his claim of “I’ve been all around the world!” So, I found this recipe for Skillet Eggs and Tomato Sauce in one of the Everyday Food cookbooks last night, and asked him if he’d like to try it. He said he would try it, with a bit of reluctance in his voice. (Next question I asked: “Do we have any anchovies?” Oh, the look on his face was priceless.) In the book, this recipe makes two servings, not the four that’s on the website. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize that the book called for a HALF can, 28 ounces, of tomatoes. Skimming over the ingredients, I just figured I could use two cans of tomatoes, 14.5 ounces. That’s pretty much the same, all right? WRONG–it was, indeed, way too much tomato, and that was his first comment. (I ate them, though.) I noticed the difference when I put the book away–and then made a note of it. He said he’d like to have it again, with half as much tomatoes. Done. (And maybe an anchovy, too, but don’t tell BF–I hide that kind of stuff in a drawer of the fridge.)
The point: please READ carefully and understand before you do something dumb like I do sometimes. Especially for Thanksgiving. OK? Don’t forget the hot mess I made when I invited The GER over a few years ago. It can happen to you. READ. Please.
Remember last time, when NM handed me a bunch of apples to take home? Well. . .I did put them in the Crock Pot, and darnit, they were pretty tasty! I made them at the same time as the pork chops, but not because I had pork chops. BF wasn’t wild about them cooked, he’d rather have fresh. But, it’s fall, and it feels like fall, so I wanted to try something different.
I actually made two batches, in two different slow cookers, to see what would happen with two different sweeteners–SomerSweet and Agave Syrup. I think this would make a great lower-carb/gluten-free alternative to the traditional apple pie. Either for everyone, or just for guests like me who would rather keep the calorie count down.
If you’re planning to have an apple dessert, or more than one, for Thanksgiving, this is an easy one to toss in and forget for a while. I actually made it a second time with bigger, fresh red apples so I could take pictures and show you how it’s made.
When I cruised through Pinterest to find apples in the Crock Pot, I didn’t find much in the way of healthy versions–mostly, they were loaded with sugar. GRRRR. . .but of course, we have alternatives in our world, don’t we?
Yes, that’s the same sherry vinegar I have around to make Cranberry Ginger Relish, but since I don’t use it often, and it only takes a small amount, I decided to try it in this apple dish. You could use red wine vinegar, or just leave it out if you wanted. But I found that the sherry vinegar added a nice depth of flavor that’s not often in apple dishes.
The first time I made this, I used just cinnamon. I decided to use apple pie spice for this incarnation, because I’m glad I did. I made some using this recipe, but because not everything is unpacked, I couldn’t find any allspice. So, it was back to Winn-Dixie for more after I picked up BF from work Sunday afternoon. He wanted some hot chocolate because the weather had turned cold. While he was prowling around looking for that, I went to the spices. Hmmm. . .should I get the stuff called “natural,” which is a rather nebulous word on food products, or get the brand I frequently bought in Houston?
I picked up that bottle that was $1.64 and put it in the little hand basket. Then BF returned to the spice aisle and was of the impression that I’m not getting what I wanted. He then said to me, “Look! Here’s all the ‘allspice’ you could ever want, right here!”
Oh, he was so funny, gesticulating towards all those spice blends. Giggling, I took the little bottle out of the hand basket and showed it to him:
BF was in the Navy, you know. Fortunately, he was *not* on KP in the galley (kitchen), or he would have been keel-hauled for making that mistake. He only had to put up with me laughing at him all the way home.
This apple pie spice mix recipe from Life Made Sweeter is quick and easy, and I made a double batch to make sure I had enough:
And use it like you would the store-bought stuff. No sugar or other additives to worry about. (Of course, yesterday, I found another carefully packed box marked “Amy Pantry,” which had not one, but two bottles of allspice. GRRR.)
Now, I’ll bet you’re wondering if there’s a deliberate reason for a black and white crock. Well, yes, and I used it–the black one was mine, a replacement during a Karma of Spare Parts incident, last year, I think, when I sent the 4-quart crashing to the floor on a Sunday. They no longer had white, so black it was. The white crock belongs to BF. The difference came in handy: the black one had apples cooked with Agave Syrup, and the white one had apples cooking in SomerSweet.
And cooked it on low for about 4 hours. What happened? Well. . .it was interesting, and BF gave me his honest opinion (I only had to needle him a little bit.)
Hmmm. . .looks like Miss Food Blogger forgot to take a picture of the results. Oh, well. I had three things going on at once. . .and we just ate them!
While BF would prefer eating apples raw, he said that the apples cooked with SomerSweet were a little less sweet, and still somewhat crisp, although they weren’t hard like a fresh apple. The agave syrup crock apples were softer and sweeter than the others, and that’s the one he preferred.
If I had cooked them longer they would have probably been a lot softer, and maybe even soft enough for applesauce. But peeling all them apples? No thanks. It was just something to use them up the first time.
Agave syrup works for a lot of different things, including a replacement for honey, with less of an insulin spike than honey would give. (Remember: I’m not a doctor, I just read about these things.) SomerSweet’s primary ingredient, erythrytol, is a sugar alcohol that’s also quite sweet and works like regular sugar, also without the insulin spike.
For you and your guests who don’t want pie or other heavily-sugared dessert, baking apples in your Crock Pot may be a good alternative to have around, and in the Crock Pot, couldn’t be easier. But why wait for Thanksgiving? Apples are in season now, and available all year around–make some this week or this weekend, and see how you like it. Tweak it to make it yours, and offer it with pride on Thanksgiving Day. It’s one of those things you can set and forget. You may be asked to make it again next year, or even before then–and what would be wrong with that?
Now for another side dish that’s also low-carb. Spaghetti Squash. Have you tried it? I have. They’re hard as a rock and can be somewhat dangerous to cut, especially the larger ones. Easiest method I knew of, until now, was to cut it in half, scrape out all the seeds and strings, coat the inside with a touch of olive oil, and roast at 350F cut side down for an hour. I used to use the toaster oven to roast even the larger ones, but now I don’t have a toaster oven. What to do? Well. . . .
I also follow a blog called Half Baked Harvest. I found a recipe there a while back, and I may have posted it here, but I can’t find it now. HOWEVER–a few weeks ago, this recipe for Crockpot Spaghetti Squash with Lasagne Bolognese showed up and got my attention. I haven’t made the Bolognese sauce yet, but I might one day.
Tieghan makes up her sauce, adds it into the Crock Pot, then puts the whole, untouched spaghetti squash right on top the sauce. No kidding. So I pulled out the big one and put the (little) squash in it, because the ovals were needed for the apples.
I just pulled off the sticker, washed it off, dropped it in, turned it to low and left it alone for a good 8 or 9 hours.
Either use a good potholder or wait til it cools, then cut it in half to remove the seeds. Once you’ve got the “guts” out of it, scrape out the “spaghetti” with a fork into your serving bowl:
Mix it up well, and if needed, re-heat in the microwave or on top the stove, or leave in the oven to keep it warm:
And you’ve got delicious and perfectly cooked spaghetti squash for your vegetarian guests. (You could also use olive oil if you don’t want to use butter.) But don’t be surprised if the non-veg folks dig into it–spaghetti squash is delicious when cooked well and seasoned right. (If only I could get BF to try a bite of it; he hates squash across the board.)
So, did I give you some new ideas for a great Thanksgiving meal? Alternatives for your guests, maybe? Or just something different and deliciousi for dinner this weekend? (November also has 29 *other* dinners to prepare besides Thanksgiving, you know.) I hope this helps, and I hope everyone has a tasty and happy Thanksgiving next week.
Now, if you’re thinking to yourself, “Amy, there you go again, banging on about SomerSweet again. You have the last three cans of it in existence!” Well, here you go. I hope to finish the post on a new replacement for SomerSweet for you, but I want to reach out to the company and find out more from them. I will tell you that I found it in Whole Foods in Mandeville, it’s called Swerve, and the company is located in New Orleans!

Marisa Anderson is a gifted musician who hails from Sonoma, California but currently calls Portland, Oregon home. Though somewhat under the radar, Anderson is renowned as one of the finest guitarists in the world. Emerging as a lively interpreter of Delta blues and Appalachian folk music, Anderson has been embraced by free and improvised music aficionados for the history of guitar styles and techniques that flow through her fingers. Her latest album is bolstered by electric piano, pedal and lap steel guitar and finds Anderson exploring the west, as it sits and as it stands in a contemporary, border conscious America. The record is called Into the Light and it’s one of the finest records of 2016. Marisa has been touring extensively since its release in July and she recently played Guelph so I invited her over to our home for pizza and a far-reaching conversation in our living room about her frequent visits to Guelph, playing Hamilton, Ontario and the Hamilton controversy and confusion, research and misinformation, bubbles, implied and overt threats, identity politics discourse, Patton Oswalt on nomenclature and content, broad brush finger-pointing, missed messaging and selective hearing, fear and outspokenness, communicating thoughts and ideas as an instrumentalist, spiritual and Christian music, church-y and state-y, growing up queer in a religious household, splintered identities, a childhood in Sonoma and wine country, working in the service industry, music and swimming, rebellion and recorder, getting into guitar, Bill Monroe, John Denver, Rush, Sousa marches, guitar reverence and understanding it as a shape-based instrument, Appalachian folklore and story songs, words and country sounds, Chet Atkins, guitar styles, sustainability, many sounds and one pair of hands, writing and singing at one point, “The House Carpenter/Demon Lover,” “Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye,” folk traditions and definitive versions, intangible histories and empirical art, instrumental music as “cinematic,” Into the Light as the soundtrack to a non-existent film about the concept of feeling or being alien and migration, border psychology, belonging, music as an idea and emotional processor, contextualizing mysteries, gentrification in Portland, Oregon, urban growth boundary, distance and fodder, new work, coming back to a new America after time away, the vote recount, local levels, an uprising of common decency, the song “He Is Without His Guns,” a happenstance recording, self-quality control, and then it was into the night.

Kids are even MORE HARD WORK. But in the end you gain something more powerful and precious than instant gratification. TRUE LOVE. I agree if everyone felt that marriage is ok to just walk away from when times get tough, or you are just tired of trying, or something or someone better comes along what a sad world we would live in. But that IS the celbrity world. That IS how they view marriage, sadly, so that is not surprising that a celebrity would say that..

There is plenty of coverage if you are wearing this wig over your own hair.. Thus, there is a dualism between the true aspect of everything and the physical side, false but ineluctable, with each evolving into the other: as God must compress and disguise Himself, so must humans and matter in general ascend and reunite with the Omnipresence. Rachel Elior quoted Shneur Zalman of Liadi, in his commentary Torah Or on Genesis 28:21, who wrote that «this is the purpose of Creation, from Infinity to Finitude, so it may be reversed from the state of Finite to that of Infinity». Kabbalah stressed the importance of this dialectic, but mainly (though not exclusively) evoked it in cosmic terms, referring for example to the manner in which God progressively diminished Himself into the world through the various dimensions, or Sephirot human hair wigs.
Of late, controversy has raged on whether the oft-quoted hadith "Do not compel your children on your norms (or customs) because they have been created for a time which is different from your time." allegedly from Imam Amirul Mu.mineen (a) was in fact his statement or was it attributed to him? A reliable research scholar has probed this and he avers that the first scholar who raised doubts about this so-called hadith
was Shahid Murtaza Mutahhari in the Sixties. In one of his speeches he said that this hadith is not to be found in any Shi'a source of hadith, not even later collections in which weak ahadith were also included such as Biharul Anwar. New software's of hadith reveal that this is not
found in any of the early four collections of ahadith: Al-Kafi, Man la Yahdhuruhul Faqih, al-Istibsar or Tahdhibul Ahkam. Nor is it in the famous Nahjul Balaghah nor in the later collections either, not even in 110 volumes of Biharul Anwar! So it is not in a single Shi'a collection of ahadith.
Some Shi'a writers and speakers have often , quoted it, but it goes back to a non-Shi'a source, in the 20th volume of Sharh Nahjul Balaghah by a Sunni scholar, Ihn Abil Hadid al-Mu'tazili (d. 656 AH). After writing the commentary on the sayings of Imam' Ali AS in Nahjul Balaghah, Ibn Abil Hadid, in the last volume of his book, starts a new section, more or less an addendum, where he has compiled sayings of Imam 'Ali that had not been included in Sayyid Razi's compilation of Imam AS' sayings in Nahjul Balaghah. Ibn Abil Hadid, however, began that last section with an interesting disclaimer: "This is the end of what [Sayyid] ar-Razi, Ahul Hasan (I'.a.) has compiled from the sayings of Amirul Mu'minin (a.s.) in Nahjul Balaghah, and we have given its commentary by the help of Almighty Allah. And now we shall mention what [Sayyid] ar-Razi has not mentioned from what the people have attributed to him [i.e, Imam 'Ali AS]. Some ofthem are famous and some of them are not that much famous but have been attributed to him, and some of them are from sayings of wise-people other than Imam 'Ali AS. But as they sound similar to his words of wisdom and consisted of useful words of wisdom, we did not want our book to be devoid of it since it is like an addendum to the book, Nahjul Balagha." (Sharh Nahjul Balaghah, vol. 20, p.251.)
Quoting a statement without any sanad (an ascription) and with a disclaimer mentioned earlier does not give any credence to that statement. And that is why it cannot be attributed to Imam' Ali AS without proper verification. Shahid Murtaza Mutahhari in his 1966 speech said: "Lately a statement is been attributed to the Master of the Pious as follows: 'Don't raise your children on your morals because they have been created for a time which is different from yow' time.' This statement has not been seen [in collections of hadith] in the sense that it is not in Nahjul
Balaghah, not in the Four Books, nor is it found in the later compilations of hadith books which have included weak ahadith such as Biharul Anwar. This statement has become popular ouly recently, that is, the attribution of this statement to Amirul Mu'minin is not more than 60 years old. This hadith is not found in the books that have been written a century ago. An old history book, Nasikhut Tawarikh, in the section on biography of Plato [the ancient Greek philosopher], quotes Plato's statement that 'don't raise your children on your morals as they have been created for a different time'. This may explain that the first person to attribute this statement to Amirul Mu'minin AS perhaps has made a mistake or was from a group who had an agenda." (Islam wa Muqtaziyat-e Zaman, vol. 1, p. 274)
Many ahadith have been attributed to The Prophet SAWW by the hadith manufacturing plants of the Umayyads and Abbasids. One such is the "Khulafau Rrashidun" hadith that has been proven to be a fabrication to justify Mu'awiyah's dynastic rule and the succeeding Abbasid regime. This is not to say that we should not ponder Plato's statement or apply it if it is beneficial, but to attribute it as a hadith from Imam Ali AS sans any verifiable chapter and verse evidence is misleading.

I knew she already had something in mind for me to do and she was about to tell me, but not before funning with me a bit before she told me her secret. She started to add some more cream to her latte, giving me that mother like squint while asking me what I was doing while we were in our business advertising, marketing and promotion courses. Well, I did learn a lot from my business courses, but so much has changed in so little time. While I was in college I was planning to open up a brick and mortar coffee shop, not selling specialty coffees online! Lisa asked me what I had learned about advertising in our courses at college. I told her I remembered how important advertising was, but at the time I was focusing on a brick and mortar shop – not an online business coffee store.
She giggled a bit and put her hand out. She said that all I had to do was take what I learned from commercial advertising to Internet advertising. Both commercial advertising for a coffee shop and Internet advertising for my online shop had numerous similarities. Lisa reminded me about making sure that my Internet advertisements reached my target customers – those interested in coffee or those who would buy them as a gift. Those are my main customers, I thought to myself. She told me in order to reach them I would need to make sure that my Internet ads would reach those people such as on other websites related to coffee, newsletters for coffee lovers, etc. Lisa said she had found several advertising campaigns that worked extremely well for her but she did have to do some work to find the most successful ones. I gave her a look and snidely asked, “You had to do research to find successful advertising campaigns with all of the knowledge you have?” She returned a bad look and smiled reminding me that the Internet consumers seem to be changing on a regular basis. You need to research several different ad campaigns to find the most successful ones for your online business. “How do you find the ones that are best for you?” I asked.
She reminded me about this advertising class we had where our professor had us do an assignment on recording the effects of advertising campaigns to get rid of those that had little or no effect and keep the ones that were working. Ah, I remembered then. It is important to keep track of certain aspects of each different ad campaign (hits, costs, revenue, and ROI) to make sure we didn’t waste money on those that didn’t work and kept the ones that brought in more sales. She smiled, touching my hand, exclaiming that I finally got it! She raised a finger toward my face and in a mother-like tone reminded me to test different ad campaigns and I would find the best Internet advertising for my business. I smiled, took notes and we enjoyed the rest of our coffee break.

Fantastic new campaign of Jack & Jones promoting its new line of jackets. It’s hilarious how the video deals with the situation, reversing the roles and showing that women can be bitches and unfeeling. And Jack & Jones helps you if you want them to be that toy…

Attached is the October 2010 edition of the Integrated Visualization and Analytics Community (iVAC) Newsletter. The Basic/Futures Research (BFR) Program believes that regular communication is one of the most effective ways to enable our Data and Visual Analytics enterprise to flourish.
The iVAC Newsletter is envisioned as a coordinating function for the various activities coming out of the BFR program, international university partners and other government agencies. The thought is to present and share knowledge of these initiatives, accomplishments in various areas (technology, publications, new funding, etc.), up-coming conferences and events, and other significant happenings to the entire community.
I love the story of the woman who had bled for twelve years and approached Jesus through a crowd. Upon touching his cloak immediately she was healed. As a young person who was just beginning to attend church I remember first hearing this story described in a sermon by Dr. Harry Fifield of the First Presbyterian Church of Atlanta.
After the woman was healed, Jesus asked, “Who touched my clothes?” She fell at his feet and Jesus, speaking through her anxiety, told her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.” Mark 5:34*
Harry let us absorb that for a few moments and then asked a question that changed my life and continues to speak to my heart, “Are you crowding Jesus or touching him?” Are you one among the crowd Sunday morning, merely chatting with your friends, “Hi Bill, Hi Jenny, Hi Marty,” or are you touching Jesus – connecting to Jesus by means of your faith in and following of Jesus?
I recall hearing of a congregation that spoke of three kinds of people: the churched, the unchurched, and the overchurched. The unchurched are people who do not relate to a congregation in any meaningful way, even if they are members of a church. The churched are the normally involved church members. By their definition, the overchurched are not people who spend too much time in church work. The overchurched are people who experience church without experiencing God.
As one who has spent much of his life in the swirl of church busyness, I find Harry’s question helps me remain churched but not overchurched. It continues to center me on the Lord who loves me.
When Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome arrived at the tomb of Jesus early in the morning they were stunned to discover the rock in front of the tomb had been moved. A young man dressed in a white robe told them Jesus had been raised and was not there. Mark 16
The various translations of the Bible use several words to describe the feelings of these women such as alarmed, terror, amazement, trembling, astonishment, and bewildered.
I find these words are in themselves a wonderful testimony to the reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Someone writing a nice starry-eyed ending to the story would have pictured the women overcome with joy and happiness. Instead they experience raw shock.
The huge stone was moved. Their beloved Jesus was gone. They are told not only that Jesus lives but also that he is going to Galilee ahead of them and that they would see him again.
Jesus is alive – right here right now with you wherever you are reading this. Allow this to be the Easter of your life. Open your life anew to this Lord who loves you and know and experience the love he has for you.
Our heart's desire is to be a "paraclete" in your life and in your congregation – as those who our good Lord would call alongside you to help and encourage you!

I’m unsure if IF contributed to my most up-to-date eczema breakout (due to the adrenal/strain link) given that the breakout was about a month immediately after I began often fasting.
Now assuming that I keep in mind, considering the fact that a kid of 10, I are already mostly non dinner particular person. But 10 years ago, I grew to become quite committed to yoga, and inside the evening, it's my pranayama and meditation practise, for this reason, my last food has to be six hrs beforehand, meaning close to 2pm, the food must end. I liked the emptiness in the human body as it helps to obtain deep spiritual insights.
This rendition in the widespread folktale contrasts two life and also the sample is evident. (See site 8.)
I'm 43, not overweight and possess completed owning Young children. My intervals are frequent. My snooze is nice, but Potentially not perfect, however I don’t think that is because of IFing, I can be Erroneous even though.
Pretty awesome post but it appears that you identify IF as generally caloric restriction. My interpretation of IF, based upon evolutionary principles, is extremely distinct. The IF I practice just isn't about restricting energy – it’s about WHEN I get my energy & the type of metabolism which i want to take care of. It’s about breaking the insulin/blood glucose roller coaster, lowering insulin levels (a result of too many carbs or proteins in the diet) & optimizing ketotic metabolism. I get the many calories I want & need to have (satiety based, approx.2200-2800 Kcals) from 2 foods (lunch & late supper) & someday a late afternoon snack (plus my morning product). I exercise IF everyday (5-6 days/wk)… among 9pm to noon…. I do Use a cup of coffee w/ 1/four cup raw cream every single early morning. When scenarios present – I may well not try to eat for 16-28 hrs, however I don’t plan this for a plan.
This startled me as the report MDA cited was for me on the list of strongest proponents of sexual intercourse-specific variances in reaction to fasting.
Oddly, I regained my cycle soon after three decades of hypothalamic amenorrhea even though IF’ing – and I dropped my period of time check it out although eating 3 foods per day(breakfast lunch and supper).
You will find even fewer human studies. Human reports on alternate day fasting have not been carried out on Females of reproductive age in any way, nor have any studies analyzed reproductive responses to fasting.
Uterine action was monitored daily with vaginal smear tests; cyclicity was scored as common, irregular, or absent. The moderate Strength-restriction weight loss plans (twenty% CR and IF) noticeably increased the proportion of animals displaying irregular cycling patterns, Whilst the 40% CR animals displayed an Pretty much full lack of estrous cyclicity.
(Inside the identify of science, I'd Fortunately revert to my prior wicked strategies for the couple months, have some blood exams then IF for an appropriate time then get analyzed once more… if anybody is serious about a research group during the making amoungst these bloggers!)
Reply Anna on February 21, 2016 at six:07 am I’m glad I look at this just before embarking on IF as a woman, as I will now be sure you simplicity into it and listen to my entire body. I have a question, and this may sound like over-simplified pondering, but when I normally have breakfast at 8am, and now approach on delaying it till 12pm for IF, can this 4-hour hold off have these types of extreme destructive effects on my overall body? 4 several hours just doesn’t seem like a really while to me! : )

When a user adopts their first Webkinz pet, they are given basic items such as a room, a welcome balloon, a food item, a piece of furniture for their pet, and 2000 in "Kinzcash". Kinzcash is the Webkinz World version of virtual currency. Each pet has levels of happiness, health, and hunger that decrease as time is spent with that Webkinz. They can be increased by feeding, playing with, exercising, and bathing the pet. If these meters get too low, the webkinz becomes sick and must take the special medicine purchased at the clinic. Don't worry though, your webkinz toy will never die, no matter how bad the circumstance.
Much of the gameplay involves the making and spending of Kinzcash. Earning Kinzcash involves playing multiple minigames, including quizzes and arcade games. This virtual currency can then be used to purchase items for your webkinz!
The online game is free to use for one year after the purchase of your first, then a person must purchase another toy to continue playing. There is a grace period of 14 days where users can still access their account after which their account will be deactivated. Members then have a minimum of 30 days to renew their account before deletion. Adopting a new pet will give the user another year of access plus some extra Kinz Cash to use at the W shop!
Webkinz are not only cute stuffed animals, they include hours of fun on the computer. After purchasing a webkinz pet, go to http://www.webkinz.com to adopt it, name it, and create a home for it to play in. Ms. Birdy will guide you through registration at the adoption center. You'll receive your pet's biography letting you know its favorite foods and secret wishes too! Dr. Quack gives your pet an examination and from there you keep your pet healthy by feeding it, playing with it, and buying it things at the W Shop (with fake money). You will automatically receive 2000 in kinz cash (fake money) when purchasing a pet, however, you can play educational games at the arcade or Quizzy's Question Corner to receive more kinz cash. This is one of the hottest and most popular toys of 2014. Webkinz reindeer are a great gift for Christmas or any time.
Webkinz are stuffed animals originally released by the Ganz gift company in 2005. The toys are similar to many other small soft toys, however they come with a special code on their labels that allows access to the "Webkinz World" website to "adopt" a virtual version of the pet for virtual interaction. There are also smaller versions of the toys called Lil' Kinz.

This is how we look this morning! Figgy wants my attention and I'm trying to type here. I finally fed him, cause every time I put him down, he jumped back up.
Speaking of cats.. I hit one the other night on my way home from work. It was devastating to me. I felt so bad. I know it wasn't my fault and I'm not blaming myself.. It just made me sick. She just ran out in front of me. I wont go into the rest of the horribly details. But, I was dropping f- bombs.. and crying. The lady whose cat it was said she was 15 years old, was sickly and lived outside. Well, if you know me, you know I was a total wreck about it. When I got home, Tony was handing me bunches of toilet paper to blow my nose and wipe my face. I am not a crier generally, but omg.. you would have thought a person died. In fact, I have to admit I cried more about hitting that cat then I have when some people have died! why is that ? I don't know. anyways.. some sweet little pies of mine gave me flowers and cookies that night! And you know what? I felt immediately better!
All of the little pie people in my life are so stinking precious.. I can hardly stand it! You should see how big our little Sera is getting! they are all getting so big! I need to get new pictures of all the kids so I can make Halloween paper dolls like I did for the 4th!
And speaking of Halloween.. I know its only august and I'm loving summer so not really in a hurry... but Halloween is creeping into my brain! And I'm looking forward to Halloween decorating and crafting... soon!
But before that, I'm looking forward to our family vacation. In two weeks we will be heading to a lake house on Seneca lake. We're all going. Well, I'm not sure about Rob and Tiff and the girls. I think they might be coming for a night or a couple days. I hope so anyways! I have to find that out.
The kids gave this little family vacation to Tony and I for Christmas. So we've been waiting and thinking about it since December! Well, I have been, I don't know how excited Tony is! LOL!! You know I'll be taking tons of pictures and having a good time with my family! And will probably be ready for another vacation alone afterwords! lol!!
so for now, I off from work today and Monday and looking forward to lots of things this weekend. I'm off to the chiropractor this morning, then back to work on bears.. hoping to make it to the lake for a little bit, later and then to a bridal shower tonight. Tomorrow is an all day beach day and a girls night with some girlfriends! The rest of the weekend is a little bit up in the air.. but I have plans cooking up!
I'm afraid I'am like you on the death of an animal! So Sad! Have a great vacation! Yes you will probably need that trip for two later!
Wow, that vacation with your family sounds like so much fun! You will be tired out from that, I'm sure:) I'm worn out just spending the afternoon with one grandson!
So sorry about the kitty. I'm sure I would feel the same, but it was good that the cat-mama wasn't too upset.
I don't like running over animals either. I hit a puppy once...not in a fence not on a leach just running around and it was instant.... I was mad at the owners for not taking care of it. Cats are more free roaming, so very hard to contain their roamings. But dogs and puppies are a bit different. Just have to forgive yourself since you had no control over what happened. Blessings, xoxo, Susie
Sad about the kitty cat, but you couldn't help it when it ran right out into the street. Good that the owner understood, and that your little sweeties brought you some goodies to help cheer you up!
Hope you have a terrific vacation with your family! And then plan another one by yourself or with some crafty friends to start on those Halloween wonders!
I'm glad you have found peace with the kitty cat incident. It's rough but it was an accident. You keep thinking about that Halloween decorating and Lake house trip!!! Keep smiling because you make us all of us smile!
I know how devastated you were about the cat. Hugs!! I'm so happy for you about your upcoming lake house vacation. It's well deserved and I can't wait to see what Halloween decorations you will be creating this year. I need to work on my blog. Everything fell apart when my father in law got sick and died. Looking for my happy groove again!
just obsessed about stuff... especially about creating.. and buying craft and art supplies! also about bears.. miniature bears.. miniature anything.. dolls, my family, decorating (all styles and especially for holidays!) LOVE all holidays, my house, folk art, colors, animals, flowers. I love creative people and enjoy seeing what they are making! Part of what makes blogging so fun. I wish I could play and create every day, which I do but I mean all day everyday.. which I cant because I'm a social worker and I work full time! I have 4 adult children (pretty amazing for a 29 year old huh?) and an old biker husband.. and two precious siamese kittens! (who are naughty!) Hope you'll enjoy your visit here and come back often! be sure to leave comments so I can find my way back to visit you too!

Sunon introduced acoustics engineering in the year 2000 to transform the traditional school of Sound Pressure and Sound Power into
the more advanced theory of Sound Quality. Sunon’s Sound Quality analysis and research is performed by Head Measurement System (HMS) .
The HMS system records and simulates the auditory senses of the human ears, where the sounds, vibration, rotation speed, and electrical
signals are measured. The software subsequently performs time domain and sound quality parameter analysis to assist the acoustics
engineers in allowing Sunon products to feature a more favorable sound quality. The expertise and experience of the acoustics engineer
combined with the software analysis will result in an even more user-friendly environment that is rivaled by none.

There are books you hold gingerly, somehow aware that they exclude a charisma, demanding respect if not immediate understanding. That’s the feeling on first encountering Robert Stone's Dog soldiers, a book that has as much to offer now as when it was first published.
Robert Stone died last week. He was seventy-seven and in his time had written eight novels, two short story collections and a memoir. Not a huge count. Contemporaries such as Larry McMurtry, who attended the same university writing programme as Stone, have published well into the double digits. Hard living had something to do with that, but the fact is Stone's books are monoliths. Volumes carved out of hard truths, unflinching in their attempt to appreciate the harsh reality of his time and place. They must have demanded a great deal from him.
You can see some of the character which drove the creation of those books in online interviews. There is one from toward the end of his life. Stone is at a promotion event for his last novel, Death of the black-haired girl. He looks exhausted, flattened by the years and the chronic pulmonary disease from which he eventually died. His thoughts are unfocused and seem to wonder. The book he holds trembles along with his shaking hand. The host mentions Graham Greene and Stone suddenly springs into relief. He’s filled with piss and vinegar, furious scorn;
“I hate Greene. I hate Greene’s soul. I hate his guts. I hate everything he represents. I hate his hatreds. I hate his contempt’s. I hate his falseness. I really have a deep despising of Greene….So my feeling about Greene is really one of considerable despising, as I’m sure his would be about me. I mean Graham Greene was a really good writer, there’s no way around that. I wish I could do something about that….I don’t feel unconnected to Greene but my connection to Greene is really one of hostility and rejection, because I think he made claims to knowledge and to insight that he was not properly entitled to…”
The rant is not without humour, Stone has a twinkle in his eye as he delivers it, but at the core is contempt for lack of truth. It’s pure and it’s the opinion of a man that does not write ‘entertainments’.
The knowledge at the centre of Stone's rancour is probably esoteric as much as political. Greene's problematic Catholicism does not match up with Stone's search for a truth, (or, probably, with Ston'es early life experience in a Catholic orphanage after his mother was hospitalised with schizophrenia.) His novels are full with questers, mystics but theirs is not a guilt ridden struggle with conscience, or a way of getting your leg over, but rather a search for transcendental reality. It’s a quality which became more developed as Stone's career progresses and is most apparent in novels such as Outbridge reach, Damascus gate and Bay of souls. In his Paris Review interview Stone described himself as a theologian but it would probably be closer to the mark to say his inclinations were gnostic, not interested in theory but, rather, direct spiritual experience.
In a memoir on The Jewish Daily Forward website Abe Mezrich talks of Stone's fascination with the Kabballah. Mezrich attributes Stone's attraction to the teaching that God is a force withdrawn from the universe, likening it to Stone's own experience of being abandoned by his father soon after birth. The rooting of the numinous in concrete, painful experience is one which Stone returns to again and again in his writing. The process is perilous, dangerous and quixotic, the cost is huge, but for Stone this is where the spark is found.
Stone was also concerned with place. His novels are set in Central America, Mexico, Jerusalem, Haiti, Vietnam and the open Atlantic Ocean. Even in the American novels settings are marked, New Orleans and California in the late 60s. Places with character. Places with their own mythologies. There is a romance in their portrayal, appreciation of strange dangers and exotic attractions, of the tiny details and customs that make up their charisma. Stone himself admitted that his luck of productivity could be at least partly attributed to his wanderlust, something that it is hard to begrudge given the tantalising lucidity in which he presents these locales.
Though there was pleasure to be had in his sense of place, that satisfaction was always eclipsed by serious purpose. Stone was concerned with those areas for their political significance, for the ready example they offered of 20th century American adventurism and its consequences. It seems a pity that we are to be robbed of his vision just as his novels reached the cusp of our modern world. The Death of the black-haired girl portrays the post 9/11 world but does not touch on the many wars in the Middle-East or the moral fallout of these conflicts on the world and American society. It seems that had he lived and produced one more novel Stone might have shown that we have not learned much over the course of his lifetime. That we have come full circle and back to the Dog soliders years.

Description View of Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson speaking at a re-election campaign fundraiser for Congressman Andrew Young (not pictured), at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Atlanta, Georgia.
Notes Andrew Young is a minister and civil rights activist from Atlanta, Georgia. Mr. Young was executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and an ally of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1973-1976, and was Ambassador to the United Nations in the administration of President Jimmy Carter. He later served as mayor of Atlanta from 1982-1989, and was instrumental in securing bid for the 1996 Olympic Games.
The Capitals are based in Edmonton, Alberta, and are currently inactive as they do not belong to any league. The team was founded in 2005 as the Edmonton Cracker-Cats and, with their provincial brethren the Calgary Vipers, joined the Northern League as part of that league's attempt to expand its footprint in Canada.
The Cracker-Cats moved to the Golden Baseball League in 2008 and were sold to Daryl Katz, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers, in 2009. The team adopted the name Capitals after Katz's purchase and also adopted the same colors as their corporate sibling.
The Cracker-Cats began as an expansion team in 2005 as a member of the Northern League. The name "Cracker-Cats" is derived from the oil industry term fluid catalytic cracking ("cat cracking" for short), which is part of the process of refining crude oil into gasoline by converting high boiling hydrocarbons into smaller molecules. They played the first game of their inaugural season on May 20, 2005, on the road against the Kansas City T-Bones. Their first home game did not take place until one week later when they hosted the Sioux Falls Canaries in front of 7,894 fans. [1]
On June 13, 2006, a string of bean balls in the first two innings touched off two major brawls between the Cracker-Cats and their provincial rivals, the Calgary Vipers. After Edmonton's Greg Morrison was hit by a Calgary pitch for the fourth time in five games, the Cracker-Cats responded by throwing at two Calgary players. The resulting melee was so violent that the umpires sent both teams off the field, and suspended the game for over an hour to consult with league officials. When the Cracker-Cats refused to return to the field afterward, the game was declared a forfeit and the Vipers were awarded a 9–0 victory even though Edmonton was leading 1–0. As a result of the suspension, Cracker-Cats manager Terry Bevington resigned. [2] The league came down hard on both teams, as both managers and seven players were suspended a total of 79 games. Morrison blamed Calgary manager Mike Busch for the incident, believing that Busch held a grudge after both Morrison and another former Viper, J.P. Fauske defected to the Cracker-Cats after leaving the Vipers after a falling out with the Calgary manager late in the 2005 season. [3]
On July 18, 2006, Stubby Clapp was named Most Valuable Player of the Northern League All-Star Game. On September 3, 2006, the 'Cats finished their second season six games back in the wild card race and missed the playoffs.
The 2007 season was a major disappointment. Al Coates, a sports broadcaster, was named general manager of the Edmonton Cracker-Cats for the 2007 season, [4] and despite adding three former Major Leaguers, Ryan Radmanovich, Mike Johnson, and Lou Pote, the 'Cats finished 38–58 and last in the league.
After three years in the Northern League, the Cracker-Cats joined the Golden Baseball League on October 24, 2007. This occurred just after the rival Vipers jumped to the league. On June 30, 2008, The 'Cats set a new attendance record of 8,676 fans against the Vipers. [5]
On August 22, 2008, the Cracker-Cats clinched a playoff spot by defeating the Orange County Flyers 13–4 and won the second half. They faced the Vipers, who won the first half, in the first-ever North Division Championship Series, but were swept by Calgary 3 games to 0.
On February 4, 2009, the Cracker-Cats were purchased for $400,000 by Katz Baseball Corp. led by Daryl Katz who also owns the National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers. [6] A new name was drawn from a contest, renaming the franchise the Capitals.
The Capitals were one of six former GBL teams to join the newly formed North American League in 2010 and began play in 2011. The Capitals won the league championship in the inaugural season of the NAL. On February 21, 2012 the Katz group announced that the Edmonton Capitals have withdrawn from the North American League, citing that only four teams had registered for the 2012 season. [7] They also went dark for the 2013 season after being unable to find a new league to play in. They are exploring options for the 2014 baseball season. [8]

28For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. agreement, covenant.
29But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
The Lord’s supper is little talked about in some churches today. There are several views as to what it means. Some Churches don’t even practice it anymore. This is a command made to all believers who have repented, accepted Christ, and have been baptized. Its meaning? This ceremony of taking bread and wine, is to remember Jesus Christ’s Death and the New Covenant we have in Him: Jer 31:31-33, Heb 8:6-13, Heb 10:15-21, Heb 12:24, Heb 13:20. The bread symbolizes His body, and the wine symbolizes His blood that He shed as Jesus became the FINAL PASSOVER LAMB. *Note: Jesus was crucified during the Passover feast, and He gave up the Ghost on the 9th hour (3pm) which is when the passover lamb is slaughtered; Luke 22:7, Luke 23:44-46.
17Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
18For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
19For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
21For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
22What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? what shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
23For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
24And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
25After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
27Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
29For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
32But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
The Lord’s Supper is not to be taken lightly. One must examine themselves before taking part. Have you committed you life over to Christ? Have you obeyed Christ in Baptism? Are you living the life of a Christian? The Bible offers a warning to those who participate in an unworthy manner.
Not to be confused with the Roman Catholic communion it is the Breaking of bread. During the Lord’s Supper we eat the bread and drink the wine which symbolically represent the body and the blood of Christ. We remember and announce His death till He returns. We also now share something in common, we all share the same faith, and belong to the same body of Christ. Ironically today the Lord’s supper has changed a bit. Beliefs and views differ. Here’s a look at Three such views. Only “C” is Correct.
a)The bread and the wine become the actual body and blood of Christ. The Catholic term for this is Transubstantiation.
b)The bread and the wine are unchanged elements, but Christ's presence by faith is made spiritually real in and through them.
c)The bread and the wine are unchanged elements, used as symbols, representing Christ's body and blood, in remembrance of his enduring sacrifice.
Communion: 1) is to have or share in common; mutual participation. 2) A mutual sharing of thoughts, feelings, etc. 3) Religious fellowship as between church members or autonomous churches 4) A body of christians having a common faith and discipline; denomination.
16The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?
53Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.
54Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
57As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
58This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.
Why do we need to symbolically eat the body and blood of Christ? Let’s go back in time to the Jews when they were in Captivity in Egypt. God commanded they sacrifice a young, spotless male lamb, and to paint the blood in three places on the front door, and to afterwards, eat the lamb during the passover.
5Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:
6And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
7And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.
When Jesus went to the cross for us, He became the final Passover Lamb forever Heb 10:11-14. And now during the Lord’s Supper in remembrance of His enduring sacrifice we eat the bread and drink the wine, which symbolically represents His body and precious blood that He shed on the cross for us.
Today most people love to celebrate Christmas more than you hear people talk about the Lord’s supper.
If you study the word, and follow Jesus instructions you’ll find out that Christmas (per say) isn’t taught in the Bible. Christmas actually derives from Christ-Mass and was ordained by the Roman Catholics around 394 AD to cover up the already ongoing pagan holidays of Saturnalia, and the winter solstice on Dec 25th. The Catholic Encyclopedia: "The well-known solar feast of Natalis Invicti"-the Nativity of the Unconquered Sun-"celebrated on the 25th of December, has a strong claim on the responsibility for our December date"! Source: Babylon Mystery Religion by: Ralph Woodrow. Tradition has kept Christ-Mass going strong, but turning Jesus back into a baby and reliving His birth every year isn’t true Biblical doctrine, especially since Jesus was not born on December 25th. Jesus, the Son of God was born in the flesh! Amen! Yet Jesus instructs us to remember His death more than His birth. Speaking of the RCC, they practice what seems to be the Lord’s supper but in fact it’s something very different, with a different meaning. Examine below the Transubstantiation.
4And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
16And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
17Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
Below are the traditional elements of the Lord’s supper from my Baptist background. But I’m not sure why we cannot have an actual breaking of bread and a real cup of wine or grape juice? To me these tiny elements resemble the Catholic mass.

Adelaide Airport is an international is located 7.8 kilometres from Glenelg. Please visit www.adelaideairport.com.au for more information.
Public transport facilities in Adelaide and Glenelg are easily accessible with frequent bus and tram services, however everything in Glenelg is nicely placed within walking distance from the Hotel Venue. Taxis are readily available and are reasonably priced.
Metro Adelaide now includes services provided by trams, buses and trains. View the Metro website to see inclusions.
The only tram route is the Glenelg tram, a 15-kilometre (9.3 mi) route from Hindmarsh, through the centre of Adelaide, to the beachside suburb of Glenelg. Trams run at approximately 15 minute intervals at off-peak times, and as often as every five minutes during peak hour periods.

Two challenges are prominent in post-consumer food waste programs: 1) food & beverage (F&B) packaging and 2) consumer responsibility for food waste disposition.
The Ei task force SMAT –Sustainable Materials ACTION Team - provides SFCI support for F&B packaging. At the present juncture, SMAT recommends single-use F&B packaging is BPI Certified compostable to avoid contamination in the food waste stream. The exception is pre-packaged beverages, such as soft drinks, water and beer.
Ready to expand their recycling practices to the next dimension, Georgia World Congress Center (GWCC) Director of Sustainability Tim Trefzer requested the Ei SMAT to present a comprehensive Compostable F&B Packaging Education Session to Levy Restaurants' downtown campus, including the GWCC, Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, Phillips Arena and the under-construction Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The Georgia Dome is the SFCI – Event Venue Pilot.
Under Doug’s direction, SMAT crafted a powerful two-hour session that included ample time for Q&A and discussion throughout the presentations. On April 8, 2015 the SMAT members converged on Atlanta for the Levy education session.
The ZWA Blog article Compostable F&B Packaging: integral to zero waste programs and soil rebuilding, is an overview of the session and the important role packaging plays in zero waste programs; the Ei FB album, 04-08-15 Compostable F&B Packaging Education Session, gives a pictorial recap. Below is an overview of the presentation.
Integral to the Zero Food Waste Journeys success was an August 2015 two-hour Compostable F&B Packaging Education Session modified for annual outdoor events.
Deep learning simplified by taking supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to the next level using the Python ecosystem
Transfer learning is a machine learning (ML) technique where knowledge gained during training a set of problems can be used to solve other similar problems.
The purpose of this book is two-fold; firstly, we focus on detailed coverage of deep learning (DL) and transfer learning, comparing and contrasting the two with easy-to-follow concepts and examples. The second area of focus is real-world examples and research problems using TensorFlow, Keras, and the Python ecosystem with hands-on examples.
The book starts with the key essential concepts of ML and DL, followed by depiction and coverage of important DL architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), deep neural networks (DNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and capsule networks. Our focus then shifts to transfer learning concepts, such as model freezing, fine-tuning, pre-trained models including VGG, inception, ResNet, and how these systems perform better than DL models with practical examples. In the concluding chapters, we will focus on a multitude of real-world case studies and problems associated with areas such as computer vision, audio analysis and natural language processing (NLP).
By the end of this book, you will be able to implement both DL and transfer learning principles in your own systems.
Hands-On Transfer Learning with Python is for data scientists, machine learning engineers, analysts and developers with an interest in data and applying state-of-the-art transfer learning methodologies to solve tough real-world problems. Basic proficiency in machine learning and Python is required.

For Black History Month, Glen Munro highlights some of the notables to land the incomparable accolade - part 1 of this piece was published yesterday at 6.30pm GMT
Some of the world’s most famous names have been recipients – but black winners are not often widely acclaimed. The Voice highlights the achievements of some of them, below:
In 1977, she started a grassroots movement aimed at countering the deforestation that was threatening the means of subsistence of the agricultural population. The campaign encouraged women to plant trees in their local environments and to think ecologically. The so-called Green Belt Movement spread to other African countries and contributed to the planting of over 30 million trees.
In its citation, the Norwegian Nobel Committee noted Professor Maathai’s contribution to “sustainable development, democracy and peace”. The committee added that Professor Maathai “stands at the front of the fight to promote ecologically viable social, economic and cultural development in Kenya and in Africa”, adding: “She has taken a holistic approach to sustainable development that embraces democracy, human rights and women’s rights. She thinks globally and acts locally.”
“I believe the Nobel committee was sending a message that protecting and restoring the environment contributes to peace; it is peace work."
At the age of 35, Martin Luther King Jr was the youngest African-American to win a Nobel Prize. The Georgia-born minister received the award in 1964 for his non-violent resistance to racial prejudice in America.
King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, resisting laws which gave whites priority over blacks on bus seating.
The preacher helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a civil rights organisation, in 1957 serving as its first president. With the SCLC, King also led an unsuccessful 1962 struggle against segregation in Albany, Georgia, and helped organise the 1963 nonviolent protests in Birmingham, Alabama.
King also helped to organise the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous “I have a dream” speech.
During King’s acceptance of the Nobel Prize he said that questions as to why the civil rights movement received the award had been asked, when it had not yet won the very peace and brotherhood which is the essence of the Nobel Prize. In conclusion he said:
“Non-violence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time; the need for man to overcome oppression and violence without resorting to violence and oppression."
Derek Alton Walcott was a St. Lucian poet and playwright, who received the 1992 Nobel Prize in Literature.
His works include the Homeric epic poem Omeros (1990), which many critics view as Walcott’s major literary achievement. Omeros is divided into seven books. Soon after its publication in 1990, it received praise from publications like The Washington Post and The New York Times Book Review, the latter of which chose the book as one of its ‘Best Books of 1990’.
The Nobel Committee said Derek Walcott received the award “for a poetic oeuvre of great luminosity, sustained by a historical vision, the outcome of a multicultural commitment”.
The former US President was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 2009 for his “extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples” according to a statement from the Nobel Prize committee. The statement went on to say:
“The Committee has attached special importance to Obama’s vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons. Obama has as President created a new climate in international politics.”
Barack Hussein Obama was the 44th and President of the United States. He was the first African-American to hold office.
Obama previously served as a United States Senator from Illinois, from January 2005 until he resigned following his victory in the 2008 presidential election. He served two presidential terms.

Gia Jordan is getting herself filled with some serious man sausage. She's been craving it, and she knew if she could get her personal trainer to come over to her place, she could just be waiting for him in some insanely sexy lingerie. It should be enough to get him hard, and once he's hard he'll be all hers because he won't be able to resist her with his hard tool in her hand, and then in her mouth. She meets him at the door and lets him in, and when he sees her in the sheer and vinyl that she chose he falls right into her trap.
Ashley Blue has been talking to her friend Johnny Thrust and she's been saying that she hasn't had any fun lately because she can't find a dick massive enough for her to really enjoy. She's had hefty ones, she's had big ones but what she needs is a leviathan of a cock to fill her like no other ever has. He's got a friend, Trent Tesoro, who happens to have one a little bigger than even he does and he figures if that's not enough, maybe the two of them working together will be what she needs to get off.
You've really got to wonder when you look at a beautiful blond milf like Bethany Cute. What is her husband thinking? Leaving a lusty and highly sexed housewife like this at home all day, up to no good? You know that she's going to fall for the first dick that comes along! Today's man is Johnny Thrust - the man of the hour, coming to give Bethany the dominating fucking that she needs. Obviously she is sick of the lame treatment that she gets from her wimp husband, and she loves it as Johnny throws her around the room, bending her over and giving it to her and then rolling her over to look her in the eyes while he choke fucks her.
A oversize, chesty model and her boyfriend are fooling around in the backyard while he is chasing her around. He finally chases her into the house where he pins her to the dining room table. He gives some special attention to her large melons and then starts taking off her pants. She sits up on the table with her legs spread while he goes down and starts lapping up her beaver with his tongue. He fingers her and gets her horny muff all moist for him. Then as he sits in the chair, she unbuttons his pants and swallows his hard dickhead. After that she mounts him on top and rides his lap while her big cannons are bouncing up and down.
Nasty Asian model Lana Craft is your typical Oriental slapper - great body, loves to fuck and is hungry for white meat. She can't believe how mammoth stud Donny Long's prick is, and sucks it with great enthusiasm, working it to maximum hardness in anticipation of getting it in her hungry cooche. She gets on top and slips it in, gasping as it hits her cervix and stretches her out to the max. He pumps her hard like an animal in several positions before she gets on top again and slips his slippery cock into her butt. She screams as he screws her tender asshole, then gets back on her knees and jacks his massive load out with both hands.
Incredible Asian hottie Lyla Lei gets her turn for a nasty ass fucking in this brutal interracial clip. She starts off loosening up her butt with two different sex toys in preparation for the anal assault that she's about to receive. Her stunt cock of the day Ben English walks in and she sucks his cock to a full erection. He proceeds to slam her asshole with no warm up whatsoever. He bends her over and taps her doggy style, lies behind her and ruts her from behind, and finally positions her upside down for the deepest penetration possible before he blows on her face. The dirty slut loves having her face covered in cum.
If porn scenes where real life, then every tramp over 40 would be sitting at home, masturbating and thinking about getting some fresh shaft. That's exactly what happens in this sex movie, as beautiful blond babe Lexi Carrington virtually jumps on dude Scott Lyons.

Having recently observing moral degeneration, corruption, and great distance from pure Islamic instructions, one gets wounded spiritually. Such a spread of social lesions challenge us to propose fundamental solutions, through various strategies, as moral observation over deviated behaviors and stabilizing ethics in the society to pave the way for individuals’ perfection.

This optimism motivates the members of the society to confront moral declination and work on social reformation, finally to result in a bright future.

Obviously proud of their new home, the Johnsons had meticulous photographs taken of each room, of the backyard, and of the street. Large and detailed, though some showing their age with some striping and fading, the photos are almost a time machine window into a lost age. Most of the rooms are empty of people, but the collection is made poignant by the hundred-year-old picture of Estelle Marie Johnson as a vibrant teenager, the shot of a bedroom with a child's doll that belonged to a long gone little girl, and two of the exterior photos where a little girl in a white dress is standing, with a big bow in her hair. This is Dorothy Johnson, Estelle Marie's little sister and Katharine Free Liappas's great aunt. There is one photo in the set taken about ten years earlier than the others and in a different house. This is a late nineteenth-century portrait showing Minnie Barnes Guiteau Johnson with her elder daughter, Estelle Marie, as a very young child.
Benjamin Johnson built the house at 2241 S. Hobart Blvd., Los Angeles CA 90018, in 1910. The name of the architect is unknown. Benjamin Johnson and his wife, Minnie Barnes Guiteau Johnson, with their two daughters, Estelle Marie Johnson and Dorothy Johnson were the first residents. They lived in the house until the death of Benjamin Johnson in 1918.
Benjamin Johnson was a merchant who was educated at Los Angeles High School and USC. He arrived in Los Angeles at the age of five in 1876 when his father, Gen. Edward P. Johnson, moved the Johnson family from St. Paul to Los Angeles. After completing his education, Benjamin Johnson served in all departments the Los Angeles Furniture Company, of which his father had part ownership. Benjamin Johnson rose to the position of president of the company, which he held for two years until he sold his interest in 1909. Then with his brother, Edward P. Johnson, Jr, he founded the Los Angeles Public Market Company, which at that time was one of the largest wholesale public markets in the world, covering eighteen acres of land. The market extended from Sixth Street to the Santa Fe Railroad and from Alameda to Mills Street. It was the clearing house for all types of produce grown in Southern California. The remnants are now known as the Los Angeles Grand Central Market on Broadway. The Los Angeles Public Market stabilized and standardized central trading point prices and developed new methods for handling crops. Benjamin Johnson took a leading part in these accomplishments and was credited with advancing the development of California commerce throughout the United States.
Among his many other interests, he was an avid fan of theatre and had partial ownership in the original Belasco Theatre on Main Street where a repertory company was established. The company included the young Leo Carrillo who went on to a distinguished career as a character actor in film and television. The company actors and guest artists, like the great tragedienne, Helena Modjeska, were often guests at the Johnson home at 2241 S. Hobart Blvd. Benjamin Johnson was a veteran of the Spanish American War, where he served as captain and quartermaster in Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders. In that war, he saw action in both Cuba and the Philippines. At the time of his death of a heart attack at the age of forty-seven he had reenlisted in his regiment and was preparing to embark with the regiment for the European theatre of war. He received a funeral with full military honors.

After being all cooped up for a cold and snowy indoor season, many Ivy Leaguers decided to toss out great performances at various meets across the county. These performances include some alterations to the record books, including a new conference record in a freshman’s outdoor collegiate debut.
It’s not even April and we have our first new conference record for the 2015 outdoor season. Down in Raleigh, N.C., Brown freshman Josie Natrasevschi had a great season debut, as she threw a new meet, school, and conference record in the discus throw. On her last throw of the competition, Natrasevschi threw 176-05 to surpass Michigan State freshman Katelyn Daniels’ 175-00 for the event win in cold, wet conditions. The mark bests the former conference record set last year by Harvard now-sophomore Nikki Okwelogu (174-10).
Brown had great showings in both the track and field events. Brown has four athletes now sitting at the top of the conference standings with their performances from this meet: Henry Tufnell in the 800m (1:52.25 – good for 4th at the meet), Will Sheeran in the 1,500m (3:51.75 – 19th overall), freshman Natalie Schudrowitz in the 1,500m (4:29.34 – 13th overall, 2nd fastest freshman), and Natrasevschi. Brown also raced the 4×800 relays. Their men’s team of Max Haensel, Ned Willig, Mike Wyman, and Martin Martinez finished 3rd with 7:38.94, while the women’s team of Schudrowitz, Taylor Worthy, Abigail Jones, and Clare Peabody finished 4th with 9:15.97. Other top 5 finishes include Courtland Clavette in the men’s discus throw (177-01, 3rd overall) and Alexandra Stanton in the women’s 400m hurdles (61.80, 4th overall).
Dartmouth also has four athletes that are now sitting at the top of the conference standings due to their performances from this meet. Molly Shapiro managed to surpass 40-feet in the triple jump for the first time down in Raleigh, jumping to a new personal best of 40-03 ½ to finish 3rd in the meet and land on top of the conference event listing. Same goes for freshman Colin Minor in the hammer throw – he threw 194-10 to finish 7th overall (6th collegian) at the meet. Reid Watson and Curtis King are our early leaders in the women’s 5,000m and men’s 10,000m events, respectively. King finished 3rd in the 10,000m with a new PR of 29:24.06, only 4 seconds away from winning the event. Watson was the top Ivy finisher in the 5,000m, as she finished 19th overall with a new PR of 16:31.36. The Dartmouth women also finished well in the sprinting events. Jennifer Meech edged out teammate Kailtin Whitehorn in the 200m final standings as the women raced in different heats. Meech finished 3rd with a time of 25.39, while Whitehorn finished 4th with 25.44 (note – both races were into strong headwinds of -3.6 and -2.2 m/s, respectively). Both women joined Marissa Evans and Anna Kikut in the 4×100 relay, where they finished 4th overall with a time of 46.87.
Harvard sent four distance runners to the Raleigh Relays, where they all ran their first 5,000m races of the season. Thomas Purnell came within 2 seconds of cracking the 14:00 barrier, finishing in 14:01.81 as the 7th fastest runner and 4th fastest collegian in the field. His teammate, Dan Milechman, finished 24th overall (17th collegian) with a time of 14:19.38. In the women’s Whitney Thornburg finished 23rd overall (2nd Ivy finisher) with a new PR of 16:34.61, while teammate Courtney Smith finished in 16:51.68, which was good for 36th overall.
A small contingent of Harvard, Cornell, and Penn’s track and field teams kicked off their outdoor season at the 88th edition of the Nike Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays, at the Mike A. Myers Stadium in Austin. In one of the largest turnouts in Texas Relays history, more than 7,000 athletes participated in this competitive event, including 214 collegiate teams, with representation from 34 states and nine countries.
Harvard’s Madison Hanson opened the four-day meet with the heptathlon event. Hanson’s total score of 5,210 was a new personal best for the junior and places her at #7 in the Ivy League record books. Harvard’s Autumne Franklin had a standout performance in the 400 meter hurdles where she took third in the finals, with a time of 57.69. Her teammate Jackie Modesett also competed in this event, running a personal best of 60.06. Modesett and Franklin also ran the 100 meter hurdles, clocking a 14.19 and 14.38 respectively.
In the sprints, Harvard’s Danielle Barbian captured the fourth place title in the women’s 100 meter invitational dash. Blazing down the track in 11.46 (+3.7 wind-aided), Barbian posted a new personal best and the fastest time in Harvard and Ivy League history (had it been wind-legal). Later in the meet, Barbian also competed in the women’s 200 meter invitational race where she continued her momentum running a 24.15 (+4.6 wind-aided). Harvard’s Ashley Collinsworth secured one of the top 20 times in the 100 meter prelims running 11.87 in the event. The Crimson quartet of Franklin, Modesett, Collinsworth and Gabrielle Scott finished 10th in the 4×400 meter relay, 3:43.01, just one place shy of qualifying for the final round.
Cornell’s men’s team claimed several podium finishes in the field events. Stephen Afadapa edged out his freshman teammate Myles Lazarou in the high jump. Both Afadapa and Lazarou cleared 6’9” to place seventh and eighth respectively. Stephen Mozia heaved a 192-02 discus throw and tossed a 60-11 1/2 shot put to earn a pair of fourth place titles in these events. Mozia finished two inches behind conference rival Sam Mattis of Penn in the discus, as Mattis finished in 3rd with a best throw of 192-04.
David Melly represented Cornell in the men’s 3,000m steeplechase, running over the last barrier in time for a sixth place finish in 9:08.72, which is his second career best in the event. Cornell’s Wynndham Curtis posted a personal best in the 110 meter hurdles by finishing the race in 14.66. Teammate Max Hairston ran a 15.21 in his first race back from injury.
A pair of alumni from the Class of 2014 also got the chance to compete in Austin last week. Duncan Dickerson, Columbia alum who is attending graduate school at Rice University, threw 198-00 in the hammer throw placing him eighth overall. Meanwhile, Brown alumnus Evan Weinstock won the decathlon in a new personal best of 7,557 points, besting runner-up Harrison Williams of Stanford by 39 points.
A small group of the Harvard Crimson mid- and long-distance runners stayed close to home this past weekend, as they traveled to nearby Tufts University for the Snowflake Classic on Saturday. Of the 8 athletes competed, five of them finished in the top six of their respective events, including two event wins. Tyler Spear (8:52.62) and Elianna Shwayder (10:00.24) claimed the 3,000m event titles in their respective races. Ben Huffman held off Northeastern’s David McDonald for second place in the men’s 1,500m (4:04.20), while Sarah Angell (4:56.72) and Lizzy Thomas (4:58.77) finished 5th and 6th in the women’s 1,500m event.
Penn traveled to College Park, MD this weekend to participate in the Maryland Invitational. Their second outdoor meet of the year was scored and yielded some good results, despite the cool temperatures. Overall, the women placed second with a total of 124.5 points, while the men had a 3rd place effort with 121 points as host Maryland won both competitions.
There were four first place finishes by the women, highlighted by freshman Candace Taylor’s run in the 400m (56.78). Freshman Molly Minnig vaulted a winning jump of 10-00. All-American Kelsey Hay had the winning throw of 145-04 in the javelin while Cleo Whiting won the 1,500m in 4:36.72. In fact, ten of the top eleven 1,500m competitors were Penn-affiliated as alum Jess Carlin (Penn ’08) came in 2nd (4:40.81) and Ashley Montgomery finished 3rd (4:41.36). Multi-eventer Noel Jancewicz concentrated on the high jump and came in 2nd with a jump of 5-05 3/4.
The men had three first place finishes. John Li and freshman Mike Benz tied in the pole vault in 12-11 ½. Noah Kennedy-White claimed the discus title with a throw of 162-09, and the 4x100m team of Wyatt David, Kyle Webster, Harrison Scharf and Ben Bower sprinted to the title with a time of 42.81. There were also multiple 2nd place finishes: David in the 100m (11.28), freshman Jeff Wiseman in the 400m (50.00), Sam Kaplan in the javelin (173-02), Marcus LaRoche in the shotput (49-10 1/2), and Nick Tuck in the 1,500m (3:55.71).
Princeton sent their women throwers over to nearby Monmouth to compete. Brielle Rowe finished in the top 5 in two events – 3rd in the discus throw (135-06) and 5th in the hammer throw (156-01, personal best). Rowe’s hammer mark currently lands her in the top 6 of the conference event standings. Kennedy O’Dell also competed in the discus, finishing 8th overall with a throw of 111-11. But O’Dell’s best finish of the weekend was in the shot put, as she finished 4th with a throw of 41-01 ½ that is the 4th best throw in the conference so far this season. Sarah Waszkewitz (8th, 120-05), and multi-eventers Ariel Becker (13th, 102-07) and Kerry Krause (18th, 82-08) competed in the javelin throw and rounded out the Princeton competitors at this meet.
On Saturday, a small group of Columbia athletes braved the snowy weather and opened the outdoor season at Stony Brook University. The meet featured some unusual events and only scored the top three individuals and first place relay. The men were fifth overall with 11 points, while the women tied for first with host Stony Brook with 26 points.
On the men’s side, there were two event victories for the Lions. In his 1,500m debut, freshman Ryan Thomas won with a time of 4:04.81. In what must have been a very cold 2,000m steeplechase, Casey Adams crossed the line almost 12 seconds ahead of second place, winning in 6:05.31. Also scoring points was sophomore Johanan Sowah in the 600m run, placing third in 1:22.73.
The women had scorers in seven of the thirteen events, including three event wins. In the 300m dash, Mariella McCormack placed third in 42.19. Brittney Wade was the runner-up in the 600m run with her time of 1:37.49. Sarah Hardie, Indoor Heps champ in the 1,000m dash, was right behind Wade, finishing fourth in 1:38.46. Freshman Erin Melly won a very close 2,000m steeplechase in 7:12.55, just 0.01 seconds ahead of second place.
The Lions dominated the 3,000m run, claiming four of the top five spots. Natalie Tanner led the pack with her win in 10:09.01. This time places her eighth in the Heps event listing. Her classmate Samantha Siler was next over the line in 10:12.47. Henna Rustami, a Columbia sophomore running unattached in this meet, finished in third place (10:16.34). Pegah Kamrani (10:16.36) and Emily Krasinski (10:25.23) rounded out the sweep.
In the field events, Joanna Koronios won the hammer by over 22 feet with her throw of 158-07. This is currently fifth in the conference. Lauren O’Connor was third in the javelin with 102-07. Alexis Yeboah-Kodie was the runner-up in the long jump with 16-01.50.
Cornell headed to Irvine, Calif. for their annual spring break training trip. Less than 48 hours after their flight landed, they suited up for their first outdoor meet of the year, the UC Riverside Spring Classic. While they didn’t have to deal with the cold and snow like many teams back here on the East coast, they did have to deal with adverse conditions on the other end of the spectrum. But despite the blazing sun and temperatures in the 90s, the Big Red had a solid showing in their outdoor debut.
The women kicked things off in style as they racked up a total five event wins and thirty top 10 finishes en route to taking the team title. Highlighting the field events was Indoor Heps Pole Vault Champion Eve Bishop with her 12-11 ½ clearance. Her finish, good for second place, breaks into the top 10 all-time record books for the outdoor event. Liz Chrissy also took second in the high jump with her height of 5-03. Gaynelle Boham won the triple jump with her leap of 38-04, while Kacie Hargett opened up her sophomore year nicely by taking third in the javelin (122-09).
There were a number of great performances on the track as well. In the 200m, Udeme Akpaete was second (24.22) while senior teammate Zena Kolliesuah was third (24.32). Freshman Taysia Radoslav had a great day as she took the win in the 400 hurdles. Her time of 59.83 broke the Cornell freshman record. Elyse Wilkinson continued her improvement so far this year with a solid run of 2:11.55 and fifth place showing in the 800. In the 1500m, juniors Claire DeVoe (4:33.19) and Kristen Niedrach (4:33.54) competed well to finish third and fourth respectively. Cornell went 1-2 in the 3,000m steeplechase as Corey Dowe took the win in 11:05.58, followed closely by teammate Bori Tozser in 11:17.95.
Cornell also had a pair of strong showings in the relays. The 4×100 squad of Adrian Jones, Akpaete, Kolliesuah and Katie Woodford placed first with a time of 45.66. That performance moves them to #3 all-time at Cornell and #6 all-time in Ivy League history (EDITOR’S NOTE: due to the website’s philosophy of recognizing the best relay teams in the record books, we do not double-count relay squads if they have three or more of the same relay members as a faster squad. Jones, Kolliesuah, and Woodford are members of the 2nd-best all time relay performance of 45.55, set last year). The 4×400 also took the victory with the quartet of Radoslav, Emily Woodford, K. Woodford and Akpaete running a fine time of 3:40.90.
The men had a small group competing at UC Riverside but they finished fourth as a team with 80 points with four runner-up and eight top 6 finishes. An all-freshmen 4×100 led off the meet with a strong second place showing with Ryan Weigel, Stanford Cooper, Michael Smith, and Brailin Paulino running a time of 41.60. Paulino also claimed the runner-up spot in the 200 with 21.94. In the other sprint relay event, Tobenna Attah (49.4), Cooper (48.7), Larry Gibson (49.3) and Smith (48.8) ran 3:16.72 in the 4×400 to place third. Attah also placed in the open 400m, finishing third with a time of 47.94. Austin Jamerson finished second in the 110 hurdles in 14.92. The final top 6 showing on the track was Jon Phillips’ 5th place finish in the 3,000m, running a personal best of 8:35.09.
A number of freshmen grabbed top 6 finishes in the field events. Mark Zavrl was second in the javelin at 192-08. Jacob Shaffer was fourth in the discus at 156-11. Andrew Robinson scored twice: he was sixth in the discus at 151-07 and fifth in the shot put at 50-07 ¼. Oseoba Airewele (fourth, 45-02 ¼) joined sophomore John Enkler (fifth, 45-01 ½) in scoring in the triple jump.

I know we are starting to repeat ourselves, but these performances are just good. It was hard to pick the best of the best ones as there were many great performances. An additional perk of these performances – we get a better idea of possible match ups at Outdoor Heps. Speaking of Outdoor Heps, are you coming to Philly?
Dartmouth ‘s Colin Minor covered a lot of miles this past weekend. On Friday, he was down at Princeton’s Larry Ellis Invitational where he won the hammer throw with a new personal best of 199-00 (second best mark in the conference listing). He then traveled almost 300 miles northeast to Lowell, Massachusetts overnight to participate in the University of Massachusetts – Lowell George Davis Invitational, where he showed his consistency in the event as he won in 192-09 in windy conditions. At Lowell, he led a 1-2-3 Big Green finish in the hammer.
Two men will be sharing the prize this week, as these are the two men who made changes to the record books. Penn’s Thomas Awad showed off his wheels again at the Larry Ellis Invitational as he ran a speedy 3:40.68 in the 1500m to finish 2nd behind Villanova’s Jordan Williamsz (3:39.53). When converted to a mile-equivalent time (1.079 ratio), Awad’s time of 3:58.11 is consistent with his 2014 Penn Relays mile time of 3:58.34. It is unlikely that Awad will race another individual 1500m (unless it is at Outdoor Heps), but that kind of closing speed at the end of a 5000m or 10km can be deadly to his opponents.
Cornell’s Rudy Winkler improved his personal best in the hammer throw by over 2 feet at the Cornell Outdoor Upstate Challenge on Saturday. He won the event on his first throw, but he reached the new PR of 216-04 on his fifth throw of the competition. This two-foot PR moves Winkler does not change his position in the all-time record books (5th best), but he is now ranked 14th in the country (his previous best of 214-03 would rank him 21st in the current rankings).
It only took Harvard’s Nikki Okwelogu two outdoor meets this season before she grabbed the outdoor shot put record. At the Virginia Challenge, Okwelogu won the event with a new personal best of 55-00 3/4, breaking the former conference record set by Brown’s Amber Knighten back in 2001 (54-07 1/4). Okwelogu broke the mark on her second throw of the competition, but she did not win the event until the final throw of North Carolina’s Sarah Howard (who has a season’s best of 55-09 that is ranked 5th in the country) did not beat Okwelogu’s best mark. Okwelogu is now ranked 8th in the country.
Brown’s rookie Natalie Schrudowitz is lingering on the outside of the top-10 all-time in the steeplechase. At the Virginia Challenge, she finished 5th in the event (7 seconds back of Yale’s Kira Garry, who finished in 4th) with a new personal best time of 10:18.18. In order to make it into the top-10, Schrudowitz needs to surpass 10:16.38. We have a feeling that she could do that by the end of the season, as she will have great competition at both Outdoor Heps and NCAA Preliminary Round (see below for more).
Princeton’s Megan Curham just dominated the 5,000m race at the Larry Ellis Invitational on Friday night. She won by over 30 seconds, getting a new personal best of 15:54.03, the 5th fastest in conference history and 16th fastest time in the country. Guess who’s right behind her in the national rankings? Conference rival Dana Giordano of Dartmouth, who ran 15:54.05 at the Mt Sacs Relay in California. Will both women go head-to-head in the 5,000m at Outdoor Heps, or will we need to wait until a later meet (like NCAA Preliminary Round)?
The women’s steeplechase record book is probably going to go through the most rewrites this season. Princeton’s Elizabeth Bird became 4th Ivy Leaguer to break the 10:00 barrier in the event with her winning time of 9:58.33 at the Larry Ellis Invitational. Bird moved from 8th all-time to 4th all-time with that performance. Yale’s Kira Garry had no problem moving into that 8th all-time slot though, as she ran a new personal best of 10:11.59 at the Virginia Challenge to finish 4th in the race. Garry previously had the 10th best all-time performance of 10:17.52. And as we shared earlier, Schrudowitz is lurking just outside the top-10 all-time. We predict that these three WILL likely battle at Outdoor Heps.
Columbia’s Olivia Sadler has been chasing after the Columbia school record in the 1500m all outdoor season, a record held by Devon Martin (4:18.04, set in 1990). Sadler came close to breaking that record on Friday night at Larry Ellis, as Sadler ran 4:18.36 to finish 2nd overall in the event. The time ranks her 21st in the country and 8th all-time, right behind Martin. Will Outdoor Heps provide a fast enough pace for her to get the school record, or would she have to wait until the NCAA Preliminary Round? Hard to say as these races can be more tactical than fast…
Cornell’s top hurdler Max Hairston is back. At the Upstate Challenge, Hairston won both the high and intermediate hurdle events in top-10 conference ranking times. His winning time in the 110 hurdles was wind aided, but his 14.15 time is second in the conference listings. Meanwhile, his 400m hurdle winning time of 54.54 ranks him 9th in the conference listings. This is not his first meet of the season, but this is the first meet where he looks like the hurdler that we know. He is the defending Outdoor Heps 110 hurdle and 400 hurdle champion – can get back to his 2014 form in time to defend his titles?

Asthma affects as many as four hundred thousand people in this country alone, and Ireland has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the world. The month of May marks the beginning of the peak season for asthma and allergy sufferers, and has therefore been designated Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month.
The tendency to develop asthma is genetic, but the disease itself is usually precipitated by environmental influences. The environment we live in and the stressors we are exposed to have changed a great deal in recent years, and this has caused more and more people to develop the condition. Factors which can adversely affect the development of the immune system in early childhood, such as excessive use of antibacterial cleaning products, frequent courses of antibiotics, and vaccinations given when the child is unwell, may increase the risk of asthma in later life. Other triggering factors include anxiety, infection, allergies, pollution, frequent use of certain drugs such as paracetamol, poor diet and excessive salt intake.
Asthma sufferers develop hypersensitivity of the lungs, which causes spasmodic constriction of the bronchi and production of excess mucus. This leads to a sense of constriction in the lungs with wheezing and coughing. Research has revealed that many people with asthma find it difficult to control their symptoms. More than half of all sufferers regularly experience problems during the day due to coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath, and more than a quarter suffer from sleep disturbance. More than 40% of children with asthma regularly have to take time off school and 20% of adults miss days at work due to the illness.
However with the right treatment it is possible to effectively control the symptoms of asthma. Medical herbalists take a holistic approach to treatment and provide individually tailored prescriptions, which combine a number of different herbs. For example, antispasmodic and broncho-dilating herbs such as lobelia help to reduce constriction and wheezing, anticatarrhal and expectorant herbs such as elecampane deal with excess mucus production, while antimicrobial herbs such as thyme help to treat infections and reduce the need for antibiotics. Coughing can be reduced with herbs such as coltsfoot, and antiallergy herbs such as nettle are also helpful.
If you suffer from asthma, it is important to avoid foods which commonly cause allergic reactions, such as dairy products, wheat, eggs, and nuts. It is also helpful to avoid foods that are high in histamine, such as tomatoes, red-skinned berries, citrus fruits, fermented foods and preserved meats. However, it is important to eat plenty of other fresh fruits and vegetables since studies have shown that high antioxidant diets can reduce the frequency and severity of asthma and allergy symptoms.
Reduce exposure to airborne irritants such as dust, animal hair, traffic fumes and cigarette smoke, and avoid excessive use of medicines such as paracetamol and antibiotics unless absolutely necessary. Ensure the diet includes plenty of oily fish and fresh fruit and vegetables and take a good quality supplement which contains antioxidant nutrients such as vitamins A, C and E, selenium, zinc and magnesium. Probiotics, particularly those containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium infantis, have also been shown to reduce allergic conditions such as asthma
Brian Livingston, Chiropractor at The Lismore Clinic, has received an award for 20 years service, by the McTimony Chiropractic Association. Brian trained at the McTimoney College of Chiropractic in Oxford, and worked in a very busy clinic in the UK for 9 years. On moving to Ireland in 2004, he spent a couple of years working at The Lismore Holistic Centre, before joining the team at The Lismore Clinic in 2006. Since then he has used his vast knowledge and extensive experience in the treatment of musculoskeletal problems, to help many people, both from the local area and those who travel from a miles away to see him, based on his excellent reputation.
McTimoney chiropractic was developed by a chiropractor called John McTimoney in the 1950s. He pioneered a new technique for adjusting the bones which consists of an extremely light, fast and usually painless movement. The adjustment encourages the bone to return to its correct alignment without forcing it or stressing the joint.Like osteopathy and other forms of chiropractic, McTimony helps to correct misalignment of the joints due to injuries, strenuous exercise, overuse of certain joints or muscles, poor posture, or degenerative diseases such as arthritis. However, there is no violent manipulation involved and the treatment is suitable for people of all ages, including the elderly and young children.
Joints which move out of their correct position will often cause the surrounding muscles to go into spasm in an attempt to protect the joint against further damage, and to hold the body in the most ergonomic position possible. A shift in one part of the body will usually lead to a compensatory shift elsewhere in order to maintain balance. For example, a tilted pelvis will often result in a curve in the upper spine, while a deviation of the knee joint will cause pressure and pain in the ankle joint. The muscles around the site of compensation are also likely to tense up and this too can cause problems.Muscles which are in spasm become irritated and inflamed, leading to pain and stiffness.
Either the muscles or the misaligned bones themselves may also pinch the nerves or blood vessels in the surrounding areas, leading to problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica and headaches. McTimony chiropractic can help to relieve problems affecting the muscles and other soft tissues around the joints, as well as misalignment of the bones themselves.Orthodox treatment for musculoskeletal problems such as arthritis and injuries usually consists of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs. These can be very helpful for managing severe pain in the short term. However, they do not address the underlying cause of the pain, may be associated with side effects such as gastritis and stomach ulcers if used long term. In severe cases, surgery may be offered. However, most people consider this to be a last resort.
McTimony chiropractic can help to reduce the need for analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, and in some cases surgery may be avoided altogether. Brian Livingston, chiropractor at The Lismore Clinic says that, “the number of treatments needed varies depending on the nature and duration of the problem. A recent injury will generally heal more quickly than a long-standing problem, but typically people need between two and six sessions.” The most common problems that Brian treats on a regular basis include back, neck and joint pain, injuries, tension headaches and sciatica. “I also use other techniques including massage to relax the muscles and specific exercises to help maintain the adjustment,” he adds.

There never can be any true peace—while sins are unforgiven. The sinner with his life's sin unforgiven, can never have true peace. He is sleeping over a volcano. But when sin is forgiven—there is peace with God.

Its straightforward ethos is conceptualized in the simple design and operations of the machine. You can conveniently pour up to 44 ounces or 1.3 liters of water into the water tank, then add spoonfuls of your favorite coffee grounds to the basket, and finally flip the switch and sit back as you see the water slowly travel from the tank over to the shower head
Create coffee without limits. De’Longhi combination coffee espresso machines bring together the technology of espresso, steam, and drip coffee to give coffee lovers the freedom of choice with every cup. The sophisticated 3- in-1 design allows you to tailor each cup of coffee to suit your mood. Our combination coffee espresso machines will never make you choose between creamy cappuccinos and perfectly brewed drip coffees. It’s time to heighten your expectations.
A Bosch coffee brewmaster celebrates the preparation of coffee. They operate their coffee machine with absolute confidence, and every step in the procedure is precise down to the last detail. Thanks to the innovative technology in the new Bosch Built-In Coffee Machine, with Home Connect, it’s easy to become a coffee Brewmaster. Whether you are preparing a frothy latte macchiato for one, or a variety of beverages while entertaining a group, creating delicious espresso and coffee beverages is now easier than ever before.
An early variant technique, called a balance siphon, was to have the two chambers arranged side-by-side on a sort of scale-like device, with a counterweight attached opposite the initial (or heating) chamber. Once the near-boiling water was forced from the heating chamber into the brewing one, the counterweight was activated, causing a spring-loaded snuffer to come down over the flame, thus turning "off" the heat, and allowing the cooled water to return to the original chamber. In this way, a sort of primitive 'automatic' brewing method was achieved.
The tall tower is fixed on a rectangular base, with a water tank that looks something akin to a trapezoid. The hard plastic funnel allows your favorite paper filters to fit inside of it. It is recommended that you use type 4 paper filters, however. You also have the option to use permanent gold filters if you want to move away from reoccurring costs.​
Here at the Strategist, we like to think of ourselves as crazy (in the good way) about the stuff we buy, but as much as we’d like to, we can’t try everything. Which is why we have People’s Choice, in which we find the best-reviewed (that’s four-to-five-star reviews and lots of ‘em) products and single out the most convincing. Here, the best coffee makers on Amazon, according to the people (note that reviews have been edited for length and clarity). Note that we’ve already talked to coffee snobs to find out their favorites, and also picked out the best espresso makers, too. And if you’re curious about coffee grinders, pour-over coffee set-ups and French-presses, we’ve got those as well.
When everyone in the family likes different styles of coffee, or for those days when you want something different from the usual, this machine is the next best thing to a coffee shop. It can make single-serve cups of coffee or fill the included glass carafe. The built-in frother transforms hot or cold milk into a silky smooth froth in just a few seconds for blended or layered drinks.
“Self-identified coffee snob. Couldn’t be happier. Easy to operate, functions as advertised, instructions are clear. The metal filter included does what it needs to do. I recommend a relatively coarse grind (imagine the feel of cornmeal) with the metal filter to get the full flavor of the coffee. If you’re a bit of a coffee snowflake (no disrespect intended) and don’t like the ‘mud’ at the bottom of the cup, you should stick with the paper filter. Either way, the coffee maker itself does the job nicely.”

“I LOVE my Breville. I am a career barista. I have had this machine for almost a year now and waited to write a review until now so I wasn’t blinded by the initial excitement of purchasing a home espresso machine. I love to buy more expensive coffee from third-wave roasters, and this machine is so easy to dial in, I come away with professional shots almost every time. While this may be due to my experience in the shop, I will say that my husband is not a barista and picked up dialing in pretty fast using the Breville guides [that were] included. My only complaint is that the steaming wand is not the best. It takes a couple tries starting it up to get it going full blast some mornings, but I have always been able to achieve latte art. That is a very small complaint considering this machine is half the price of its competitors but still can create some awesome coffee. I’d highly recommend it for baristas on a budget.”
CR’s take: Our highest-rated drip brewer with an insulated, thermal carafe, the Ninja Bar Brewer CF085 has plenty to recommend it. CR’s testers find that it offers superb brew performance and is very easy to use. In our member surveys, Ninja drip coffee makers received an Excellent rating for owner satisfaction. (We don’t yet have enough data to judge reliability.) This model has a full suite of features, including an unusual over-ice brew mode for making iced coffee. Ninja claims its thermal carafe will keep coffee hot for 2 hours, and the machine comes with a milk frother and a standalone French-press brewer. These features come at a price, of course; the Ninja Bar Brewer is the second most expensive model on this list.
Carafe style. Heavy coffee drinkers should look for a model with a thermal carafe. These coffee machines can keep your coffee warm for hours without having to sit on a burner, which can scald the liquid. Glass pots are not insulated and must sit on a heated burner to keep the coffee warm, so they’re an ideal choice for those who need only one or two cups a day. Some coffee drinkers insist that a glass carafe results in a better-tasting cup of joe.
Enjoy a cup of instant coffee with the Bodum Columbia Double Wall Stainless Steel French Press Coffee Maker. This coffee maker includes a French press & Bodum coffee scoop. It is available in multiple sizes allowing you to choose the one best suited to your preference. This coffee maker is made from premium quality stainless steel, nylon, silicone, and plastic, which ensures that it is sturdy and durable. This coffee maker is part of the Columbia collection, and sports a silver finish that is...
This coffee maker is excellent. How could it not be? Its SCAA-certified, and the technology is practically identical to the 12-Cup brewing system. Lots of what we love about the 12-Cup, from its single-dial programmability to its auto-pause brewing to its multi-port shower head, is pretty much the same. Plus, it brews eight cups in a much swifter nine minutes, and is $100 cheaper.
If your busy life keeps you from making coffee by hand, you can also consider a capsule machine such as a Nespresso coffee maker. These machines use small capsules or pods of coffee, so you don’t have to worry about measuring grounds and adding them to your device. Simply add a capsule, fill up the reservoir and press the On button. If you’re more of a traditionalist, a stovetop espresso maker might be the right option for you. This type of maker uses your stove to heat up water, which then steams up and passes through a capsule of grounds above the reservoir. The steamy espresso then collects in an upper reservoir at the top of the maker. These espresso makers are very popular in Europe and require no electricity to function.
This Good Housekeeping Seal star features an all-black body, a 12-cup glass carafe, a reusable filter and a backlit LCD screen with digital touchpad controls. You can program the clock to automatically brew coffee in the morning. It'll make a hot pot very quickly, but drink up — the keep warm feature didn't keep the coffee as warm as other models in our tests.
With these incredible coffee pots from HSN, you'll have an amazing way to start your day. Whether you're serious about your java, or just drink the occasional cup when you're feeling tired, you'll enjoy brewing with these premium coffee and espresso makers. Delight in the richness of coffee from freshly ground beans prepared in a French press, or make silky smooth cappuccinos at home for a fraction of what they cost at that trendy cafe. Treat friends and family to a delicious cup after a large home cooked meal. With a coffee espresso machine from this collection, your kitchen will be the hottest coffeeshop on the block.
Let’s circle back to that extra-long brew time. There are two factors that didn’t make it an automatic “no” for us. The first is that the OXO On 12-Cup is programmable. Like our experts say, grinding coffee in advance isn’t going to make the most perfect cup of coffee. But the fact that you can program the machine’s “wake-up time” to start brewing and have coffee ready when you are takes the sting out of the wait.
The dishwasher-safe, BPA free model from Takeya can brew up to a quart of concentrated cold brew coffee. It not only yielded one of the best tasting brews, it also aced our usability tests. The brewer is easy to set up, offers a durable build, and is simple to clean and store for later use. It is also the only brewer that is air-tight while it brews, allowing you to easily store the brewer on its side in a packed fridge.
In our quest to find the best, we pitted 10 highly regarded coffee makers against each other. These are the machines that regularly make it on best-of lists, earn accolades, and/or are recommendations from the coffee experts we talked to over the course of this review. We aimed for multi-cup carafes — no single serves — and drip machines only. (We didn’t want to muddy the results with French press, pour-over, or espresso. Those are for other reviews.)
There’s also no way to adjust the temperature of the water on the Bonavita, or tinker with any of the other variables some of our other top picks gave access to. And that’s the other downside to this excellent machine: What you get is what you get, and if you do want to experiment with the flavor of your coffee, it will depend entirely on the beans you buy and the size you grind them to. Good thing the coffee it brews right out of the box is so dang good.
As with any appliance, newer models are constantly getting rolled out. The newer Nespresso VertuoPlus coffee machine became available since I got my original Pixie. But I'm so pleased with mine — from the important stuff (like how well it makes my coffee), to the superficial stuff (like how it looks) — that I can't think of a single reason why I should change what I've got going on right now.
Feature-filled and powerful, the K475 Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker features customizable settings including strength and temperature control to deliver a truly premium brewing experience. Brew five different cup sizes – from 4 to 12 oz. with K-Cup(R) pods – plus the ability to brew a mug or carafe, the product brews a perfectly sized beverage for any occasion. Brewing your favorite beverage is easy thanks to the large color touchscreen, complete with separate settings for specialty...
The Bonavita is a simple, compact machine (about 12 inches x 12 inches) for only $190, and it makes coffee that ranked in the top three in our taste test. Its philosophy seems to be “everything you absolutely need, nothing you don’t.” That means it’s SCAA-certified for water temperature and brew times, boasts pre-infusion capabilities, and has a flat-bottom filter basket that extracts grounds evenly. That’s it.
It can take a little while to get to know the ins and outs of a new coffee maker. In CR’s labs, each drip coffee maker we test brews roughly 65 cups by the time our engineers are through with it. And brewing is just one of many aspects we look at. We test for handling and convenience, too, so you can choose a model that helps you sail through morning madness.

The Strategist is designed to surface the most useful, expert recommendations for things to buy across the vast e-commerce landscape. Some of our latest conquests include the best women’s jeans, rolling luggage, pillows for side sleepers, ultra-flattering pants, and bath towels. We update links when possible, but note that deals can expire and all prices are subject to change.
This is an easy-to-use coffee maker that'll add some retro style to your countertop. It includes a pause-and-pour feature for times when you need caffeine before the brewing process is done — and after brewing, it keeps your coffee piping hot for 40 minutes (you can monitor the length of time on the indicator gauge on the front display). Available in black, cream, white and red.
The best part about this machine is that it comes with everything you need (except the beans). You don't have to spend an extra $100+ on a good grinder or $25-$100 on a milk frothing pitcher and tamper. You will pay a bit more for it than other machines on this list, but it's well worth it — especially now that this machine costs $548.96 instead of $999.99.
The Mr. Coffee DRX5 coffee maker gives you the advanced action to delay-brew your coffee, enabling you to wake up to coffee waiting for you. The auto pause and grab a cup option allows you to get a cup of coffee before the brew cycle is finished, with the machine halting the brewing process so you can pour a cup and then complete the process once you reinsert the carafe into the chassis.
For example, if your coffee tastes a bit salty or sour, the grounds are under-extracted, which can be remedied by a finer grind. But what if only some of your grounds are too coarse, and others are too fine – and maybe some are just right? Having uniform grind size throughout your brew basket makes it easier to isolate and adjust this variable in order to get the level of extraction you want. The only way to achieve that is with a burr grinder. Miller — as well as a handful of our other experts — recommends the Barazata Encore Coffee Grinder ($129).
Some machines come with all the accessories you need to make espresso, but others don't. Check to see if your machine includes any accessories before you buy them. You will need a grinder to have freshly ground espresso, a milk frother or a milk frothing pitcher if you like foamy milk for cappuccinos or lattes, and a tamper to press down the coffee grounds before you make espresso. We explain why you need each one and recommend which ones to buy below:
CR’s take: This unassuming, inexpensive Hamilton Beach coffee maker might be easy to miss, but it can brew a mean cup of joe at a fantastic price. In a basic black-plastic finish, it has the essentials—it’s programmable and offers auto-shutoff—and it offers solid brew performance in a decent time frame (10 minutes). Hamilton Beach machines even earned a Very Good rating for predicted reliability. At around $25, this simple model will get the job done.
We’re the largest online retailer of espresso machines and it’s no secret why. We love coffee. We love that first sip in the morning, the one that you’ve got to fight to get to your mouth because 8 hours of sleep seems like a pipe dream. We love that rush, when the caffeine kicks in and you know that you’ve got the day in the palm of your hand. We love the art – brewing, roasting, tasting – and the journey that each coffee drinker takes in search of their perfect joe. We’ve been sharing that love with the world since 1997 and we hope you’ll pull up a cup and join us in celebration of nature’s most perfect beverage, coffee!

“Last night was a perfect test of the single-cup concept. I had already programmed and prepped my 3 a.m. standard coffee brew, however, I still wanted a cup of coffee. I switched over to the single cup and brewed my cup, then switched back and pressed the program button to ensure it would still brew the main pot at 3 a.m. Worked like a charm!! Before, I would have had to brew the entire eight cups that were ready, toss out most of it, and set up my morning brew all over again.”
Percolators began to be developed from the mid-nineteenth century. In the United States, James H. Mason of Massachusetts patented an early percolator design in 1865. An Illinois farmer named Hanson Goodrich is generally credited with patenting the modern percolator. Goodrich's patent was granted on August 16, 1889, and his patent description varies little from the stovetop percolators sold today. With the percolator design, water is heated in a boiling pot with a removable lid, until the heated water is forced through a metal tube into a brew basket containing coffee. The extracted liquid drains from the brew basket, where it drips back into the pot. This process is continually repeated during the brewing cycle until the liquid passing repeatedly through the grounds is sufficiently steeped. A clear sight chamber in the form of a transparent knob on the lid of the percolator enables the user to judge when the coffee has reached the proper color and strength.
That said, it’s not as elegant to use as the OXO machines. (Nor is it as nice to look at. One tester described its tall, bulbous body and squat carafe as “UFO-like.”) Take its eight-button controls, for example, which you use to toggle among brew modes, scroll up and down within the menu, and engage a manual brewing feature. Programming it to start brewing at a certain time was about as intuitive as setting an alarm on a clock radio — easy enough, but more technical than sleek. OXO definitely feels like the future; Behmor is more, “If it ain’t broke, why fix it?”
On August 27, 1930, Inez H. Pierce of Chicago, Illinois filed patent for the first vacuum coffee maker that truly automated the vacuum brewing process, while eliminating the need for a stove top burner or liquid fuels.[1] An electrically heated stove was incorporated into the design of the vacuum brewer. Water was heated in a recessed well, which reduced wait times and forced the hottest water into the reaction chamber. Once the process was complete, a thermostat using bi-metallic expansion principles shut off heat to the unit at the appropriate time. Pierce's invention was the first truly "automatic" vacuum coffee brewer, and was later incorporated in the Farberware Coffee Robot.
It’s obvious, but easy to forget: If you don’t clean out your coffee machine’s carafe after each use with soap and water, you’ll always end up tasting a little bit of yesterday’s now-bitter brew. Thermal carafes need to be hand-washed, but all the plastic components of our top picks — brew baskets, lids, etc. — are dishwasher-safe if you keep them on the top rack.
For coffee lovers that enjoy a bold brew, the strong brew button increases coffee's strength and intensity and the 52-ounce water reservoir means you can brew 5 cups before refilling. Four cup sizes allow you to make 6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces of your favorite beverages in under a minute, while the Quiet-Brew technology feature minimizes noise during use. Just pop in a pod and select your brew size to enjoy a perfect brew every time.
CR’s take: Like the model above, the Cuisinart Burr Grind & Brew takes whole coffee beans and grinds them fresh for each pot. It features programming, brew-strength control, a water filter, a permanent coffee filter, and auto-shutoff. This model earns a great rating for carafe handling. The stainless steel finish and glass carafe certainly elevate the experience of using it. Cuisinart brewers also received an Excellent rating for owner satisfaction. But the performance and finish come at a premium—this machine costs significantly more than the Black+Decker Mill & Brew.
There were lots of innovations from France in the late 18th century. With help from Jean-Baptiste de Belloy, the Archbishop of Paris, the idea that coffee should not be boiled gained acceptance. The first modern method for making coffee using a coffee filter—drip brewing—is more than 125 years old, and its design had changed little. The biggin, originating in France ca. 1780, was a two-level pot holding coffee in a cloth sock in an upper compartment into which water was poured, to drain through holes in the bottom of the compartment into the coffee pot below. Coffee was then dispensed from a spout on the side of the pot. The quality of the brewed coffee depended on the size of the grounds - too coarse and the coffee was weak; too fine and the water would not drip the filter. A major problem with this approach was that the taste of the cloth filter - whether cotton, burlap or an old sock - transferred to the taste of the coffee. Around the same time, a French inventor developed the "pumping percolator", in which boiling water in a bottom chamber forces itself up a tube and then trickles (percolates) through the ground coffee back into the bottom chamber. Among other French innovations, Count Rumford, an eccentric American scientist residing in Paris, developed a French Drip Pot with an insulating water jacket to keep the coffee hot. Also, the first metal filter was developed and patented by French inventor.

When you buy a machine with coffee credits you will receive a code with credits to buy coffee from curated roasters in the Spinn app. The credits will be uploaded in your account settings of the app. The credits allow for easy browsing and discovery of local and national coffee roasters. The credits will be used for automatically ordering when your Spinn machine is running low.
Although it's very easy to use — you just fill the portafilter with grounds, attach it to the machine, and press the button to start — The Gaggia Classic isn't as flexible or intuitive as the Breville Barista Express. The user manual is less detailed, too, so you have to have a basic idea of what you're doing or browse the internet for tips. The machine has a one-year warranty if you run into problems.
Cuisinart's premium single-serve brewer offers freedom of choice! Choose the ideal temperature and enjoy a cup of coffee, tea, soup or cocoa.

The drip tray pulls out to accommodate travel mugs and the 72-ounce water reservoir eliminates the need for frequent refills! With Cuisinart's premium single-serve brewer you'll get sensational brew cup after cup.
For many of us, the daily grind can't begin until we've had that first cup of piping hot coffee—so the right brewer is at the top of the list. The most basic coffee makers make at least a decent cup, but a little more money buys conveniences such as programmability, a thermal carafe to keep coffee hot longer, settings that let you adjust brew strength, and more.
The Brazil French Press coffee maker, designed in the early 80's, was Bodum's first coffee maker and quickly became a symbol of what Bodum stands for. Attractive and functional design at an affordable price!

“Quite possibly the best investment I’ve made in an appliance to date. This powerful machine makes THE BEST COFFEE. I’m a coffee snob, so Keurig never impressed me, and I don’t have the space to purchase a full espresso machine. The Ninja system is compact, but offers a variety of brewing settings.

Rancilio Coffee Machine. Great Machine - producing espresso and cappuccino. Or even flat whites, hot chocolate etc. I have had this machine for around four years but stopped using it when I changed to stove top pots. Lovely addition to any kitchen. Comes with original instructions and spares - also complimentary coffee pods. Heavy. Re-listed due to mind changer.
With the introduction of the electric drip coffee maker for the home in the early 1970s, the popularity of percolators plummeted, and so did the market for the self-contained ground coffee filters. In 1976, General Foods discontinued the manufacture of Max Pax, and by the end of the decade, even generic ground coffee filter rings were no longer available on U.S. supermarket shelves.
Other coffee brewing devices became popular throughout the nineteenth century, including various machines using the vacuum principle. The Napier Vacuum Machine, invented in 1840, was an early example of this type. While generally too complex for everyday use, vacuum devices were prized for producing a clear brew, and were popular up until the middle of the twentieth century.
Inspired by professional machines, this high-end coffee and espresso maker is designed to be simple to use. It has an intuitive touchscreen and a sleek design with an aluminum finish that will look good on display in your kitchen. All it takes is the touch of a button to produce cappuccino or latte comparable to your favorite coffee shop, or you can produce warm milk froth or hot water for your hot chocolate or other drinks.
You can check out our best milk frothers here. Some of you will stick with the machine's frothing wand, but you'll still need a milk frothing pitcher, so we recommend this one from Rattleware. Should you want a better tamper, we recommend this one from Rattleware. To save money on the coffee grinder, you can try this manual Hario Skerton Ceramic Coffee Mill, but if you want a high-end one, you may pay more than $200 for it.
“This is simply an amazing machine. I have had NO trouble with it whatsoever. … The quality of the espresso is better than what I get out of the coffee shops — using their beans. It took me a long time to tune in the perfect cup of espresso/latte/cappuccino, and there are variables, but mostly in the beans you buy. I had to buy a decent burr grinder, but considering the investment in the machine, another $150 for a good burr grinder is nothing. I only run filtered water through the machine. I love this machine. I have poured over 2,500 shots through it. Not a single problem with the machine. Many mistakes by the operator, but I will take my espresso out of this machine before any store bought cup-o-Joe.”
The Barista Express espresso machine uses a 15 Bar Italian Pump and a 1600W Thermocoil heating system to make rich espresso. Since it's a semi-automatic machine, the Breville automatically adjusts water temperature after steam to extract the most flavor out of your beans. The machine also has a 67 fl.oz (2L) water tank with a nice handle for easy removal, and it comes with a replaceable water filter.
The well-designed Braun BrewSense came closer to the gold standard for water brewing temperature than almost any other drip coffee maker in our testing, and delivered a rich, bold and hot cup of coffee. It has settings to program the coffee to brew ahead of time and you can adjust the brew strength and the temperature of the warming plate. Also available in black.
Only two optional settings are available: You can control the heating element under the carafe and turn down the temperature if desired. Other than that, the Moccamaster doesn't have—and doesn't need—anything else. Technivorm boasts that its heating element can get water between 196ºF and 205ºF, which specialists say is the ideal temperature for brewing coffee.
The machine itself is large, but not as monstrous as some of the other grinders I tested. It's also very bottom-heavy, which makes it feel more durable than other machines and means it won't rattle all over your counter while grinding. The heavy-duty translucent plastic collection cup generates less static cling than the glossy clear plastic cups I tested, and the chute that connects the burrs to the cup collects less debris than other models. Cleaning is simple: Just remove the top burr and use the included wire brush to remove residual grounds.
Breville Oracle Espresso Maker. Maintains temperature to within 1.35 degrees of optimum brewing temperature during extraction for fullest flavor. Model #BES980XL. Separate air pump allows for customized milk frothing: select latte or cappuccino and the machine automatically adjusts the amount of froth, while a sensor detects when milk has reached the ideal temperature.
Wayfair has hundreds of ways to satisfy your caffeine cravings. Whatever your preferred method of coffee delivery, we've got your covered with all kinds of coffee makers and coffee pots ranging from automatic programmable drip coffee makers and single serve makers to more traditional french presses and percolators. With the best brands in coffee, from Keurig to Cuisinart, we've got your morning caffeine covered. All you have to do is decide which coffee maker is best for you and your daily caffeine needs!
The Hamilton Beach 12-Cup BrewStation coffee maker offers convenient one-hand dispensing without a conventional glass carafe. There's no pouring or spills, and nothing fragile to break and replace. No matter how much you try, it’s impossible to get freshly brewed flavor from coffee that’s been sitting on a hot plate too long. That’s why the Hamilton Beach BrewStation was created, the only coffeemaker that keeps coffee tasting fresh for up to four hours. This best-selling coffee maker...
It also automatically pre-infuses the coffee, allowing the grounds to vent their CO2 and “bloom.” Remember, only half of the machines we tested had this feature, and it proved to pay off in our taste tests. The four machines we recommend all pre-infuse. Only one coffee maker without it, the Hamilton Beach, performed well at all in our taste tests — but that guy was so cheap and flimsy, part of the brew basket broke during our testing. Sorry, Hamilton Beach.
The Scoop Single-Serve Coffeemaker goes where no coffeemaker has gone before, brewing hotter, faster and better-tasting coffee than most gourmet machines out there. And, its benefits don’t stop there. The Scoop Coffeemaker utilizes the simplicity of ground coffee and brews a customizable cup quickly: an 8 oz. cup in less than 90 seconds or a 14 oz. travel mug in under two-and-a-half minutes. Aside from its versatility in using inexpensive coffee grounds to brew a great-tasting cup, The...

A birth control device inserted directly into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. Intrauterine devices are also an extremely effective form of contraception, with failure rates as low as 0.2 percent. They are also reversible, and they do not permanently affect fertility. However, they do not provide protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
Using an intrauterine device can cause vaginal dryness, particularly with hormonal IUDs (this is also common with other hormonal birth control treatments). Physicians often recommend water-based personal lubricants for patients who experience this symptom.
Isopropyl Myristate is a a ester (replacing the hydrogen of an acid by another organic group) of Isopropyl Alcohol and Myristate Acid. Used as a skin conditioner and fragrance in many personal lubricants or sexual products.

Hidden in plain (plane) sight! 9/11 must be the epitome of the cabalist-creed. Hollywood has been 'telling on themselves' for many long years. The images below represent the proof of this very fact. Plain as day! Many have seen most of these images/video more than a few times, nevertheless 'always remembering' is necessary. The alternative is ZNWO-inflicted mindlessness. The images below are just a relatively small sample of the Hollywood pre-tells that surround the September 11, 2001 day of infamy. How many does it take though? Especially when they say it straight up to the whole world...like Hulk Hogan and Randy Macho Man Savage did twelve years before the day:
Hulk Hogan, Randy 'Macho Man' Savage 1989 "...you're going to see the twin towers come crumbling down"
Clip reportedly dates from 1989 - a WWF event featuring a Tag Team match where the "Mega Powers", viz. legends Hulk Hogan and Randy 'Macho Man' Savage, were to face two opponents named "The Twin Towers"
:08 "Everybody knows the Twin Towers are big strong high buildings, larger than any buildings in New York City..."
:20 "But I'm telling you something right now [1989]...they may be earthquake proof, they may be typhoon proof, they may be tidal wave proof, but when the mega powers, the strongest force in the universe goes against the twin towers, it's going to be like a faultline going right through their foundation, and the richter scale is going to spin around 42 times, go into orbit, and you're going to see the twin towers come crumbling down..."

I found the bog this morning, after returning from the Guadalupe Mass at Mission Dolores in San Francisco. There were a number of babies and small children in the largely Mexican crowd. Your poem is a reflection of some of what I had just seen.
On behalf of my grandson who I honored in this blog entry, I thank you! The Mass sounds like it was wonderful – Ellen
While we were in Beijing, we wanted to see Olympic Park. This was an interesting thing to accomplish.
I don’t know if all tours are run like this in China or if we just got some bad tour mojo….. but …. yikes. Our travel agent planned an itinerary for our day and a half in Beijing. We asked to go to the Great Wall – the section that you walk up and luge down. That did not happen. We went to the wall and walked up but we also had to walk down. That was a big bummer!
He also coordinated visits for us to see the Summer Palace and Ming’s Tomb. I ask you – why would we go to stuffy ole Ming’s tomb when we could see where Michael Phelps made history? Duh? And why would we go to the Summer Palace when we could see the Panda bears. I mean, really. Honestly, if we would have had more time, we would have so gone to Ming’s Tomb and the Summer Palace but time was short and we were traveling with three younguns who love to swim – so priorities, right?
When we got on the tour mobile, we asked to make some changes to our original schedule. OOOOOOOppppps. Apparently that is not acceptable – well, it can be acceptable if you are willing to pay more. Huh? We wanted to change two sites for two other sites. In America, we call that a “no-brainer” – in China it is apparently called an “increase in fees”. Got it.
We were also told that we were going to be charged more money because we were not going shopping. You read that right – n.o.t. going shopping. Huh? We did not ask to go shopping. And, shopping was not on our original schedule. But, now we were going to pay to not shop. Hmmmmmm.
Oh, and our tour guide was happy to take us by an ATM machine so we could pay in cash. Yeah, how do you think that worked out for her?
So, very long, very frustrating story short – we made the changes and only had to pay extra for the zoo fees. Now, that makes more sense. And hubby had sense enough to suggest insist that our travel agent in Delhi be billed by our guide’s travel agency directly in Beijing – no cash transactions, thank you very much. So nice of you to offer though. tee hee. (Now you know I did not just marry hubby for his good looks.)
We quickly put it all behind us and walked in awe through Olympic Park. It is a pretty cool place. Most of the signage in China is in, well, Chinese – so it was fun to see this sign that we could actually read.
And then, of course, the water cube. Unfortunately it was not open – but we used our imagination. 😉 I could easily imagine Bear, Flower, and Angel diving off the same block that Michael Phelps used. Can’t you?
There were some pretty awesome statues throughout the park. And if you stand at angle with the sun in your eyes and lean to the left and lift one foot up, this guy absolutely resembles Michael Phelps.
Maybe he was trying to envision the swimming statue as Michael Phelps, too? What? He could be. Or, maybe, it’s just hard to hold a sailboat with no arms.
Sure, it’s nice information to know, but it didn’t so much help on the interpretation side of things.
Travel in China is different than what we have experienced in the rest of Asia. Truly, not many of the people we encountered spoke English. This lady and her sister were so kind to help hubby negotiate with a vendor for a better price on the stuffed mascots. If you plan to visit China, learn from our mistakes, you’ll want to know this about shopping with vendors in Beijing (and perhaps all of China). It is wise to have money in smaller denominations. Otherwise the vendors are likely to give you counterfeit bills as change. Wanna know how we know that? Go ahead. Take a guess.
We tried to buy her sister a set of mascots too but the only thanks she wanted was a picture with our family.
Next, we headed over to the zoo. Fun Fun. We have seen a panda or two at the zoo in Washington, DC, but the Beijing zoo has at least a dozen of them. And here was another sign we could read.
Anybear, we did have a wonderful afternoon and hope to go back some time and see more of the historical stuff.

In 1940, while he was struggling as an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Walker Percy wrote to his uncle and adopted father, William Alexander Percy, to give him the bad news about his grades.
William Alexander, who introduced his young ward to the writings of Marcus Aurelius and had himself gone to Harvard, did not care for one second about the grades. As he wrote back to Walker, “My whole theory about life is that glory and accomplishment are of far less importance than the creation of character and the individual good life.”
How lucky we might have been to get such a lesson from our own parents at that impressionable age! To hear, emphatically, that marks on a report card are not a reflection of who we are and that their recognition is such a hollow thing. Because it’s clear that most of us internalized the exact opposite: We think that fame and fortune are the marks of a good person. We connect them, like cause and effect. If/then statements in the logic of human existence. We chase these things, because like grades, they are quantifiable and easy to game.
But character? The trait the Stoics believed was like fate, the determining factor in life? Well, that we mostly ignore. We assume it will take care of itself.
It won’t. If we directed half the time we spend trying to advance our careers or ace a test, toward our individual moral improvement, the world would be transformed. And so would our individual lives–good lives.

We are very excited to announce that one of our speaker authors, Chris Nickson, has chosen the Leeds Unconvention as the venue for his latest book launch.
Chris will be officially launching the latest in his series of popular novels featuring Richard Nottingham and based in Leeds.
The newest addition to his bibliography is Fair & Tender Ladies and attendees at the Uncon will be able to get their first edition copy, and have it signed by Chris himself, before anyone else in the world!
Our final confirmed author for this year’s Unconvention marks a change from the standard line-up of fiction authors.
Dr. Alaric Hall is a lecturer in medieval English literature at the University of Leeds with a great interest in English and Scandinavian medieval literature, history, and language and……. elves.
For the Unconvention Alaric will be talking about the links between Tolkien and Leeds and it promises to be a very entertaining presentation.
The second author to be confirmed as speaking at this year’s Unconvention in Leeds is Chris Nickson.
Chris is the author of an acclaimed series of crime fiction books featuring the character Richard Nottingham, the Constable of Leeds in the 1700s. Chris was born and brought up in Leeds and plans to move back to the city later this year having spent 30 years living in America in the interim.
In addition to his Richard Nottingham series, Chris has further crime novels due for release later this year, has written numerous celebrity biographies and is a well respected music journalist and musician.
To find out more about Chris visit his author page on our website, or visit Chris’s own website here.
The committee are very pleased to announce that we have a first confirmed author for the 2013 Unconvention in Leeds.
First in the line up is Robert Twigger, a British author who now lives in Cairo and has been described as a “19th century adventurer trapped in the body of a 21st century writer”.

The flying trapeze use to be an exotic activity best left to professional circus performers. Not anymore. Soaring to new heights of poplarity, trapeze has become almost mainstream.
Think Yoga an Pilates, where participants learn to attune their bodies with their minds, then add a healthy dose of "Fear Factor".
For those hit with mid-life crisis, trapeze helps shake things up, sparing them the need to abandon carreers or spouses instead.
The trapeze was invented in the 19th century by Frenchman Jules Leotard, who also designed the eponymous outfit worn while on it. And it was Leonard who inspired the 1867 song "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze".
Daring young men and women, not always with the greatest of ease, are taking flying trapeze classes to give their fitness workouts a jolt.
Rather than targeting certain specific muscles as you would in a gym, all of your muscles will be worked at once, in each fl. A trapeze workout will utilize and stenghten muscles you didn't even realize you had, and you will have a blast doing it.
You'll swivel, swoop and soar as your instructor takes you through a series of challenging moves. It's an all over workout incorporating cardio, strength and flexibility. You'll work your abs, legs, arms, glutes and you'll probably even work some muscles you didn't know you had. All of that, plus you'll feel like you're flying.

The Puranas and great Epics – the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, have for centuries profoundly influenced Indian and life and culture. The various episodes therein are of very great significance. Sages and saints who wrote them were gifted with the rare power of anticipation of events to occur. A study of Epics, Puranas kindles hope in a person to hold up to God’s feet and obtain his guidance and help to enjoy a smooth journey through life. But it is to be noted that the great eighteen Mahapuranas alone consist of 3,71,000 Sanskrit verses approximately. The Epics Ramayana and Mahabharata consist of 24000 and one lakh Sanskrit verses respectively.
To go through in to such a vast ocean of knowledge is not possible for a knowledge seeker or a layman. Hence Vettam Mani’s Puranic Encyclopaedia is a boon to all the people of the world. It took him five years for him to compile this great encyclopaedia. To provide such a Comprehensive and well-nigh exhaustive book of study and reference with regard to episodes,
incidents, characters occurring in the many Puranas and such other work in Sanskrit are a monumental task.Vettam Mani has successfully achieved his goal.
The book in A4 size runs to 921 pages. All the subjects are arranged alphabetically. Culling out various facts from different Puranas, each subject is justified fully for its contents. Deep, extensive and exhaustive study, patient and untiring research are so very patent on every page of the book. Starting from ‘A’ one may go in for any subject he wants to refer to. Arjuna, Brahma, Abhimanyu, Cyavana, Dhanurveda, Drona, Duryodhana, Ekavira, Ganapati, Hariscandra, Iravan, Jambavan ,Rama, Krishna, Viswamitra, Vyasa, etc. The book covers well over 6000 topics. This is a must for all the libraries of the world.Every lover of learning and knowledge everywhere owes an eternal debt of gratitude to the compiler Vettam Mani. The book is published by Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited, Delhi, India

In the last few weeks I have taken both of my older girls to Hines Little Smiles. They are awesome! Not only are my girls no longer nervous about the dentist, they already are asking me when they get to go again. I would highly recommend them to anyone I know with children! Thanks!
My 3 year old son, who freaks out about EVERYTHING and hates his mouth being looked in, let alone touched, had his first dental appointment today with Dr Anderson. They made him feel so welcomed and comfortable that he sat through the entire process without even a flinch. Everyone was so kind and helpful, and amazing with both of my kids (3 and 6)! I will never take my kids anywhere else, and will recommend Hines to everyone I know with kids!!! Thank you all sooooo much!
We just had our first experience with Hines and couldn’t be more pleased. My son (3) was very unsure of the process but the staff was extremely patient and understanding. He had a successful visit and i am sure next time he will not hesitate so much! Thank you so much for what you do!
SALIVA IS SUCH an ordinary thing that you probably haven’t given it much thought, but it’s actually as important to the healthy function of our mouths as oil is to a working car engine. Saliva is an essential component of our ability to eat, taste our favorite foods, and speak, it’s crucial to a healthy immune system, and it’s our first line of defense against many oral health problems.
In a healthy mouth, saliva is produced continuously by the salivary glands, which are located under our tongues and in our cheeks. These glands produce between two and six cups of saliva every day! Saliva is 98-99 percent water, and the rest consists of proteins, digestive enzymes, antimicrobial factors, and electrolytes.
Depending on where food is in the digestive process, saliva goes through a few different stages: cephalic, buccal, oesophageal, gastric, and intestinal. When you smell something delicious and your mouth waters, that’s the cephalic stage! Actually eating moves it to the buccal stage, which helps us swallow food. The oesophageal stage helps move swallowed food down the esophagus.
The last two stages are less pleasant, but still important. If you’re about to throw up, your salivary glands work overtime in the gastric stage so that the stomach acid won’t do as much damage when it comes up and out with the partially digested food. The intestinal stage is similar, activating when the body doesn’t agree with food that reaches the upper intestine.
There are many reasons we have saliva, but the most important role it plays for your teeth is keeping your mouth’s pH balanced and flushing away remnants of food to keep everything clean. Eating food tends to make our mouths more acidic, and even though the enamel on our teeth is the hardest substance in our bodies, it only takes a pH of 5.5 to start dissolving it. Many of the foods we eat are far more acidic than that, which makes saliva critical in protecting our teeth.
The antimicrobial factors in saliva also fight bacteria, protecting us against gum disease and bad breath. Growth factors in saliva are why injuries in your mouth (like a burned tongue or a bitten cheek) heal faster than injuries elsewhere on the body. And those are just the benefits to oral health, but saliva does much more.
All of these benefits are why dry mouth is such a serious problem. It can happen for a number of reasons. Our mouths tend to go dry in stressful situations. We also tend to produce less saliva in old age. Drug use, smoking, and drinking alcohol can all cause dry mouth as well. Unfortunately, many prescription medications cause dry mouth as a side effect.
If you’ve been experiencing dry mouth for any reason, schedule an appointment with us. We can discover the cause and get that saliva flowing again so that you won’t miss out on any of its great health benefits!

RELATED: 9 Ways to Spot a Sociopath Does it feel like after years of living in black and white, you suddenly see the world in bursting color?
The excessive flattery and compliments play on your deepest vanities and insecurities—qualities you likely don’t even know you possess." We want the fantasy to be true, so we ignore that tiny warning voice in our heads.
Impulsivity is one of the key traits used to diagnose psychopathy As Robert Hare, Ph D, writes in his book, Without Conscience, “[t]he most obvious expressions of psychopathy—but not the only ones—involve the flagrant violation of society’s rules.
Not surprisingly, many psychopaths are criminals, but many others manage to remain out of prison, using their charm and chameleon-like coloration to cut a wide swathe through society, leaving a wake of ruined lives behind them.” A bit of spontaneity can be a great thing, but repeated reckless behavior is a sign that something's amiss.
In an interview with the psychologist Sue Stone, Psy D, explained that “[Psychopaths] have a parasitic lifestyle—they live off people." If you feel like you’re giving a lot of yourself to your partner, it could be that he's sucking the life from you.
Have you watched her lie to another human being—even if it was just a white lie—without blinking, and cool as a cucumber? If you notice your partner unflinchingly and convincingly distorting the truth, it's only a matter of time before she starts deceiving you, too. Being idealized by a psychopath is infatuation on steroids.
Has your tragic Prince Charming ever gazed at you with puppy dog eyes and told you he never thought he’d find happiness because he’s just too damaged?

Taken a while to get to review this product but the visual impact on opening the box was pretty shocking but visually awesome to say the least.
It actually (and I took my time doing this ok) measures: Length 10" FULL inches base to tip............YES!!!!!
The plastic insert was of no use to me & before my purchase I read the reviews & had decided to use it as a sleeve & NOT a strap-on, as I knew I wouldn't fit inside the hard plastic insert anyway.
I very carefully peeled back the base of the outer skin part from the plastic insert then gradually with some effort managed to take out the inner plastic portion making it a very usable sleeve/extension.
The inner length measures exactly 7 1/2" & is a full 2" wide inside. It looked too spacious but actually guys if you have a decent thickness then lube up your junk before you start to get excited & slip it inside the "sleeve" then squeeze out ALL the air from the tip towards the base you will find it gives a pleasant suction & with a little more shall we say 'manual effort' & blood flow I found the sleeve to fit perfectly AND it stays right there from the suction created.
Just remember to keep squeezing out the air so that when you are becoming fully erect it won't effect your performance & will absolutely stay on 'hands free' without any kind of problem during the most physical & demanding bedroom antics!!!!!!!

Для того, чтобы правдоподобно и красиво нарисовать кошку, совсем необязательно быть профессиональным художником. Несколько простых советов, как поэтапно нарисовать свою (или абстрактную) кошку, помогут вам освоить кошачью тему в живописи. Рисунок проще сделать карандашом, вам понадобится твердо-мягкий или твердый карандаш для контура и мягкий (B6 или близкий к нему) – для самого рисунка.
In the spring of 2015, a man fishing with his daughters saw what he thought was a crab floating in the water. The man decided to reel in the seemingly innocuous object, but what he discovered convinced him to immediately call the police. The crab turned out to be a human body— and the corpse was missing its head.
The body was discovered in the waters of South Padre Island, a barrier island off the coast of the southern tip of Texas. If this body had been found in any other part of the United States, a boating accident would probably have been the detectives’ first guess as to the cause of death. This body, however, was found in the waters along the US-Mexico border where the detectives are all too familiar with the ways of the Mexican drug cartel, who they immediately suspected for the murder and decapitation of the victim. The county sheriff, Omar Lucio, summarized it best: “Mexican drug cartel payback often comes at the end of a fine, sharp cutting instrument.”
Authorities later discovered that the victim was an employee of a tire shop in Edinburg, Texas, a border city an hour away from the island. They eventually realized that the tire shop had ties to the large Mexican Gulf Cartel and was a front for drug trafficking. The victim was about to disclose information about the operation to the authorities, but was murdered before he had the chance, and his head was sent to Mexico to prove that the execution had been completed. The police arrested the three tire shop owners, who happened to be brothers; all of them were indicted for murder, plead not guilty, and now face a future trial by jury.
So far, this has been a story of drug trafficking and cartel violence along the border— a story that many politicians, law enforcement officers, and local media are all too familiar with. Yet, this case is different from the typical stories of cartel shootings or drug busts because it draws attention to a border issue that is often neglected. It turns out that one of the three brothers indicted for the murder, Joel Luna, was a US Border Patrol Agent— an employee of the suborganization of the Department of Homeland Security that protects and secures the US border. This story that began with a mystery of a decapitated body is actually an example of the corruption that occurs on both sides of the border among the very people that have sworn to protect it.
In Mexico, this corruption is widespread, and is often blatant and unconcealed. In fact, according to the Global Corruption Barometer, Mexican citizens see the police as the most corrupt institution in the country. Police officers are especially susceptible to bribery by the drug cartels and other organized crime groups, and in some places the local police are just another enforcement arm of the cartel, carrying out kidnappings and murders on behalf of the organizations. According to Vice News, “municipal agents in the city of Iguala, Guerrero, attacked and then abducted 43 students in September 2014” before turning them over to the drug cartel. The same article even cites cases of local police kidnapping and threatening federal police officials that had been sent to investigate these abductions. One resident of Reynosa, Mexico, has stated that when he is stopped by an unidentified truck at night far from the city, he hopes that it is a cartel member stopping him and not the police. “A cartel member,” he said, “often just wants to see what you are doing to make sure you aren’t a member of a rival cartel. The police, however, could demand a bribe or worse.”
At the border on the Mexican side, the customs and border security officials comprise the corrupted. According to the GAN Business Anti-Corruption Portal’s “Mexican Corruption Report,” burdensome and complicated import procedures, forms, and tariffs mean that those transporting legal products across the border often find it easier to simply bribe customs officials. This has made border officials especially susceptible to kickbacks. The drug cartel will often bribe these same officials to overlook the transportation of drugs across the border.
Unlike in Mexico, border corruption in the United States is often concealed. However, while it is not widespread, it is far from being nonexistent. In the United States, the drug cartel is the corrupting agent in many cases, but human trafficking organizations also play a part. One reason that criminal organizations bribe agents is so that the agents will provide them with information, often in the form of patrol routes, shift schedules or, information about vulnerabilities in border defenses. While one may be tempted to label this as treason, that is not necessarily true; according to the New York Times, “[passing information to cartels] is not considered espionage or treason because they did not pass the information to a foreign government or state actor.” Regardless, agents that are found to have committed these acts are successfully tried and sentenced under anticorruption laws that explicitly apply to these scenarios.
Criminal organizations also bribe border agents to overlook and even participate in certain illicit actions, such as human smuggling or drug trafficking. This may be in the form of a recruited agent being handed a white envelop of cash by a car full of drugs at the border crossing in exchange for the agent quickly ushering them through and not inspecting the car or in the form of an agent assisting undocumented immigrants avoid apprehension after the agent receives a hefty bribe from a human trafficker.
Mr. Luna, the Border Patrol agent currently being tried for murder, allegedly participated in both forms of cartel assistance: providing information and aiding in the moving of contraband. In fact, he had also allegedly stored contraband in his own home. According to the Texas Tribune, police searched the Border Patrol agent’s private safe and found his badge and computer password next to “[US]$89,000 in cash, more than a kilogram of cocaine, 17 grams of meth, a scale, measuring spoons, and a ledger documenting the sales of narcotics and firearms and ammunition.” What police believe to be the murder weapon was also found in the safe— a gold plated gun with “Cartel del Golfo” engraved on one side and his brother’s cartel nickname, “El pájaro,” engraved on the other. According to Gus Garza, the lead prosecutor, cases like this cause him “to see… an effort to bring the culture of violence from across the river to South Texas.”
Statements like those of Mr. Garza raise the question of how common border agent corruption actually is. Has corruption already successfully permeated the United States Border Patrol? Is it too late to stop it?
The Center for Investigative Reporting lists 153 cases of corruption between the years of 2000 and 2013, a majority of which occurred in Texas. According to a review of court documents and agency investigations conducted by the New York Times, “In the last 10 years almost 200 employees and contract workers of the Department of Homeland Security have taken nearly [US]$15,000 in bribes while being paid to protect the border.” These employees committed offenses such as allowing drugs and people to be smuggled into the country, illegally selling green cards, and providing information to the cartel that included the name of an informant. The article makes sure to note that the financial assessment of money paid in bribes does not include the value of gifts or paid trips that were accepted by agents and purchased by the cartels.
While these employees, only represent about 1 percent of all Border Patrol agents and Department of Homeland Security personnel, according to the Texas Tribune, this number may just be the tip of the iceberg, as these acts of corruption are often hard to detect. Regardless, as Inspector General John Roth of the Department of Homeland Security stated about corruption, “one person can do a lot of damage.” The impact a small amount of corruption can have on an area such as border security can be great, leaving citizens vulnerable to acts of terrorism and cartel violence.
With hundreds of corrupt officials in the United States and thousands in Mexico, it is obvious that border corruption must no longer be ignored, lest it escalate into a much larger problem in both the United States and in Mexico.
In searching for a solution, Mexico has enacted various anticorruption measures, which have had varying levels of success. In 2009, Mexico fired more than 700 of its customs workers and replaced them with new ones. According to CNN, these new agents were issued psychological exams, took drug tests, and underwent background checks. They also received specialized training on detecting drug smuggling that previous agents had not received. The emphasis placed by the Mexican government was on creating a more professional customs force and improving the public perception of the agency— creating an illusion that a more virtuous and trustworthy agency had been formed. The strategy was hampered by the fact that many citizens have more daily contact with local police than customs officials and, since law enforcement is often lumped together and the corruption of the local police remained the same, public perception of customs officials did not change. This, combined with the fact that many of the new customs officials, almost a decade later, have been corrupted by the cartels themselves, has made the measures somewhat ineffective at reducing both public perception of corruption and corruption rates.
Still, this was a very ambitious attempt on the part of the Mexican government, and clearly demonstrated the federal government’s dedication to fighting corruption. Despite the government’s dedication, many anticorruption laws remain unenforced by the federal government mostly because there is no way to enforce these laws in local areas. Even sending in federal investigators, as previously mentioned, can be ineffective since corrupt local officials are not afraid to kidnap federal agents.
Since a vast majority of the United States Border Patrol is not corrupt, it would not be desirable or practical to fire a large portion of the Border Patrol and replace it with new members. Federal investigators, however, have the potential to be very successful in preventing corruption among Border Patrol members. According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a corruption task force was recently created to investigate potential cases of corruption among officials. Many cases of corruption could have been prevented had agencies taken the correct investigative and preventive measures in regards to employees, mistakes for which the FBI task force could compensate. For example, in the case of Agent Luna, large sums of unaccounted for drug money had been used to buy property. This could have been easily detected by the FBI task force and could have prevented further acts of corruption.
This solution, while potentially effective at reducing existing corruption, has the flaw of attempting to detect corruption after it occurs while doing nothing to prevent it. Such a method would have done nothing to prevent Mr. Luna from accepting bribes, for instance, instead would focus on catching him in the act. While fighting corruption after the acts occur may lower the number of corrupt officials in the short run, it does nothing to eliminate corruption in the long run because it ignores the underlying roots of the problem. Broad issues such as poverty and specific issues such as the proliferation of the Mexican drug cartels and human traffickers are all factors that perpetuate corruption. Border communities are among the most impoverished in both the United States and Mexico. It is this poverty and the allure of money that drives officials to accept bribes from the cartel and to turn to these illicit actions. Programs addressing poverty in these communities can be instrumental to reducing the amount of corruption found in border communities, and such programs must not be disregarded by governments. No matter how many corrupt officials are apprehended and punished, anti-corruption efforts are useless if poverty in these communities remain. No matter how many times corrupt officials like Mr. Luna are apprehended, the drug cartel will simply recruit another person in need of money to take his place.
In addition, one cannot ignore the drug cartels and human traffickers that perpetuate this corruption by exploiting and taking advantage of other human beings to achieve their illicit goals. So long as the cartels remain active and grow in strength, there will always be corruption among border agents. The struggle against the cartels and against human smugglers has been a long battle fought by both the Mexican and US governments, but they must not give up the fight. These criminal organizations must be defeated if the goal of eliminating border corruption will ever be reached.
The United States and Mexico must not ignore stories such as Mr. Luna’s which must be analyzed and used to fight the corruption spreading across borders. Even from this one case, much insight as to how corruption occurs, its prevalence, and how it can be stopped has been gained— and this case is just the tip of the iceberg. What begins as the tale of a headless body floating in the Gulf of Mexico can end with societal change, as we apply the lessons learned and use them to end the corruption occurring in border communities. There is a responsibility for the media to report these stories, for politicians to take them into account when crafting policy, and for civilians to educate themselves so that they can recognize corruption and report it. Corruption among the very people that take an oath to defend others must be eliminated.

“She was a combination of Little Nell and Lady Macbeth,” said Alexander Woolcott. Dorothy Parker (1893-1967) wrote short stories, poems, reviews, screenplays, and more. Perhaps most famously, she was part of the group of New Yorkers known as the Algonquin Round Table, which met every day for lunch and eventually grew famous for their witticisms, put-downs, and general high spirits. A woman of brilliance as well as deep contradiction, Parker at her best combined romantic optimism with a dark, biting pessimism that still feels modern.
In this episode, Jacke is joined by the President of the Literature Supporters Club for a field report of the Algonquin Hotel today and a discussion of Parker’s life, works, and top ten quips.

A statue of cooperative pioneer Robert Owen stands in front of the Manchester head office of the UK's Co-operative Bank.
Cooperative banking is retail and commercial banking organized on a cooperative basis. Cooperative banking institutions take deposits and lend money in most parts of the world.
Cooperative banking, as discussed here, includes retail banking carried out by credit unions, mutual savings banks, building societies and cooperatives, as well as commercial banking services provided by mutual organizations (such as cooperative federations) to cooperative businesses.
Cooperative banks are owned by their customers and follow the cooperative principle of one person, one vote. Co-operative banks are often regulated under both banking and cooperative legislation. They provide services such as savings and loans to non-members as well as to members, and some participate in the wholesale markets for bonds, money and even equities.[1] Many cooperative banks are traded on public stock markets, with the result that they are partly owned by non-members. Member control is diluted by these outside stakes, so they may be regarded as semi-cooperative.
Cooperative banking systems are also usually more integrated than credit union systems. Local branches of co-operative banks select their own boards of directors and manage their own operations, but most strategic decisions require approval from a central office. Credit unions usually retain strategic decision-making at a local level, though they share back-office functions, such as access to the global payments system, by federating.
Some cooperative banks are criticized for diluting their cooperative principles. Principles 2-4 of the "Statement on the Co-operative Identity" can be interpreted to require that members must control both the governance systems and capital of their cooperatives. A cooperative bank that raises capital on public stock markets creates a second class of shareholders who compete with the members for control. In some circumstances, the members may lose control. This effectively means that the bank ceases to be a cooperative. Accepting deposits from non-members may also lead to a dilution of member control.
Credit unions have the purpose of promoting thrift, providing credit at reasonable rates, and providing other financial services to its members.[2] Its members are usually required to share a common bond, such as locality, employer, religion or profession, and credit unions are usually funded entirely by member deposits, and avoid outside borrowing. They are typically (though not exclusively) the smaller form of cooperative banking institution. In some countries they are restricted to providing only unsecured personal loans, whereas in others, they can provide business loans to farmers, and mortgages.
The special (bank)s providing Long Term Loans are called Land Development Banks, in the short, LDB. The history of LDB is quite old. The first LDB was started at Jhang in Punjab in 1920. This bank is also based on Co-operative. The main objective of the LDBs are to promote the development of land, agriculture and increase the agricultural production. The LDBs provide long-term finance to members directly through their branches.[3]
Building societies exist in Britain, Ireland and several Commonwealth countries. They are similar to credit unions in organisation, though few enforce a common bond. However, rather than promoting thrift and offering unsecured and business loans, their purpose is to provide home mortgages for members. Borrowers and depositors are society members, setting policy and appointing directors on a one-member, one-vote basis. Building societies often provide other retail banking services, such as current accounts, credit cards and personal loans. In the United Kingdom, regulations permit up to half of their lending to be funded by debt to non-members, allowing societies to access wholesale bond and money markets to fund mortgages. The world's largest building society is Britain's Nationwide Building Society.
Mutual savings banks and mutual savings and loan associations were very common in the 19th and 20th centuries, but declined in number and market share in the late 20th century, becoming globally less significant than cooperative banks, building societies and credit unions.
Trustee savings banks are similar to other savings banks, but they are not cooperatives, as they are controlled by trustees, rather than their depositors.
The most important international associations of co-operative banks are the Brussels-based European Association of Co-operative Banks which has 28 European and non-European members, and the Paris-based International Cooperative Banking Association (ICBA), which has member institutions from around the world too.
In Canada, cooperative banking is provided by credit unions (UNI in French). As of September 30, 2012, there were 357 credit unions and caisses populaires affiliated with Credit Union Central of Canada. They operated 1,761 branches across the country with 5.3 million members and $149.7 billion in assets.[4]
The UNI movement started by Alphonse Desjardins in Quebec, Canada, pioneered credit unions. Desjardins opened the first credit union in North America in 1900, from his home in Lévis, Quebec, marking the beginning of the Mouvement Desjardins. He was interested in bringing financial protection to working people.
British building societies developed into general-purpose savings and banking institutions with ‘one member, one vote’ ownership and can be seen as a form of financial cooperative (although many de-mutualised into conventionally owned banks in the 1980s and 1990s). Until 2017 the Co-operative Group included The Co-operative Bank.[5] It still retains an insurance provider, The Co-operative Insurance, noted for promoting ethical investment.

Important continental cooperative banking systems include the Crédit Agricole, Crédit Mutuel, Banque Populaire and Caisse d'épargne in France, Rabobank in the Netherlands, BVR/DZ Bank in Germany, Banco Popolare, UBI Banca in Italy, Migros and Coop Bank in Switzerland, and the Raiffeisen system in several countries in central and eastern Europe. The cooperative banks that are members of the European Association of Co-operative Banks have 130 million customers, 4 trillion euros in assets, and 17% of Europe's deposits. The International Confederation of Cooperative Banks (CIBP) is the oldest association of cooperative banks at international level.
In Scandinavia, there is a clear distinction between mutual savings banks (Sparbank) and true credit unions (Andelsbank).
Credit unions in the United States had 96.3 million members in 2013 and assets of $1.06 trillion.[6][7]
Cooperative banks serve an important role in the Indian economy, especially in rural areas. In urban areas, they mainly serve to small industry and self-employed workers. They are registered under the Cooperative Societies Act, 1912. They are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and Banking Laws (Application to Cooperative Societies) Act, 1965.[8] Anyonya Sahakari Mandali, established in 1889 in the province of Baroda, is the earliest known cooperative credit union in India.[9]
Ofek (Hebrew: אופק) is a cooperative initiative founded in mid-2012 that intended to establish the first cooperative bank in Israel.[10]
Since the 19th century, Italy has had hundreds of "banche popolari" (popular banks) and "banche di credito cooperativo" (cooperative credit banks) which are different kinds of cooperative societies (governed by an assembly where every shareholder/member has 1 vote). As of 2016, the biggest was Banca Popolare di Milano (founded in 1865).[citation needed]
Starting in 2016, due to a new law, several cooperative banks will be forced to merge and/or be converted to società per azioni.
The more recent phenomena of microcredit and microfinance are often based on a cooperative model. These focus on small business lending. In 2006, Muhammad Yunus, founder of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, won the Nobel Peace Prize for his ideas regarding development and his pursuit of the microcredit concept. In this concept the institution provide micro loan to requires.

Idolatry literally means the worship of an "idol", also known as a cult image, in the form of a physical image, such as a statue or icon.[1][2][3] In Abrahamic religions, namely Christianity, Islam and Judaism, idolatry connotes the worship of something or someone other than God as if it were God. In these and several other monotheistic religions, idolatry has been considered as the "worship of false gods" and is forbidden.[4] In many Indian religions, such as theistic and non-theistic forms of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, idols (murti) are considered as symbolism for the absolute but not the absolute,[5] or icons of spiritual ideas,[5][6] or the embodiment of the divine.[7] It is a means to focus one's religious pursuits and worship (bhakti).[5][8][6] In the traditional religions of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, Africa, Asia, the Americas and elsewhere, the reverence of an image or statue has been a common practice, and cult images have carried different meanings and significance.[1]
The opposition to the use of any icon or image to represent ideas of reverence or worship is called aniconism.[9] The destruction of idols and images as icons of veneration is called iconoclasm,[10] and this has long been accompanied with violence between religious groups that forbid idol worship and those who have accepted icons, images and idols for worship.[11][12] The definition of idolatry has been a contested topic within Abrahamic religions, with some Muslims considering the Christian use of the cross as a symbol of Christ, and of Madonna (Mary) in some churches, as a form of idolatry.[13][14]
The history of religions has been marked with accusations and denials of idolatry. These accusations have considered statues and images to be devoid of symbolism. Alternatively, the topic of idolatry has been a source of disagreements between many religions, or within denominations of various religions, with the presumption that icons of one's own religious practices have meaningful symbolism, while another person's different religious practices do not.[15][16]
The word idolatry comes from the Greek word eidololatria (εἰδωλολατρία) which itself is a compound of two words: eidolon (εἴδωλον "image") and latreia (λατρεία "worship", related to λάτρις).[17] The word eidololatria thus means "worship of idols", which in Latin appears first as idololatria, then in Vulgar Latin as idolatria, therefrom it appears in 12th century Old French as idolatrie, which for the first time in mid 13th century English appears as "idolatry".[18][19]
Although the Greek appears to be a loan translation of the Hebrew phrase avodat elilim, which is attested in rabbinic literature (e.g., bChul., 13b, Bar.), the Greek term itself is not found in the Septuagint, Philo, Josephus, or in other Hellenistic Jewish writings.[citation needed] The original term used in early rabbinic writings is oved avodah zarah (AAZ, worship of avoda zara, or "pagan"), while avodat kochavim umazalot (AKUM, worship of planets and constellations) is not found in its early manuscripts.[20]
The earliest so-called Venus figurines have been dated to the prehistoric Upper Paleolithic era (35–40 ka onwards).[24] Archaeological evidence from the islands of the Aegean Sea have yielded Neolithic era Cycladic figures from 4th and 3rd millennium BCE, idols in namaste posture from Indus Valley civilization sites from the 3rd millennium BCE, and much older petroglyphs around the world show humans began producing sophisticated images.[25][26] However, because of a lack of historic texts describing these, it is unclear what, if any connection with religious beliefs, these figures had,[27] or whether they had other meaning and uses, even as toys.[28][29][30]
The earliest historic records confirming cult images are from the ancient Egyptian civilization, thereafter related to the Greek civilization.[31] By the 2nd millennium BCE two broad forms of cult image appear, in one images are zoomorphic (god in the image of animal or animal-human fusion) and in another anthropomorphic (god in the image of man).[27] The former is more commonly found in ancient Egypt influenced beliefs, while the anthropomorphic images are more commonly found in Indo-European cultures.[31][32] Symbols of nature, useful animals or feared animals may also be included by both. The stelae from 4,000 to 2,500 BCE period discovered in France, Ireland through Ukraine, and in Central Asia through South Asia, suggest that the ancient anthropomorphic figures included zoomorphic motifs.[32] In Nordic and Indian subcontinent, bovine (cow, ox, -*gwdus, -*g'ou) motifs or statues, for example, were common.[33][34] In Ireland, iconic images included pigs.[35]
The Ancient Egyptian religion was polytheistic, with large cult images that were either animals or included animal parts. Ancient Greek civilization preferred human forms, with idealized proportions, for divine representation.[31] The Canaanites of West Asia incorporated a golden calf in their pantheon.[36]
The ancient philosophy and practices of the Greeks, thereafter Romans, were imbued with polytheistic idolatry.[37][38] They debate what is an image and if the use of image is appropriate. To Plato, images can be a remedy or poison to the human experience.[39] To Aristotle, states Paul Kugler, an image is an appropriate mental intermediary that "bridges between the inner world of the mind and the outer world of material reality", the image is a vehicle between sensation and reason. Idols are useful psychological catalysts, they reflect sense data and pre-existing inner feelings. They are neither the origins nor the destinations of thought but the intermediary in the human inner journey.[39][40] Fervid opposition to the idolatry of the Greeks and Romans was of Early Christianity and later Islam, as evidenced by the widespread desecration and defacement of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures that have survived into the modern era.[41][42][43]
Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the Lord your God. Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary.
The Christian view of idolatry may generally be divided into two general categories: the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox view which accepts the use of religious images,[46] and the views of many Protestant churches that considerably restrict their use. However, many Protestants have used the image of the cross as a symbol.[47][48]
The veneration of Mary, Jesus Christ, and the Black Madonna are common practices in the Catholic Church.
The Roman Catholic and particularly the Orthodox Churches have traditionally defended the use of icons. The debate on what images signify and whether reverence with the help of icons in church is equivalent to idolatry has lasted for many centuries, particularly from the 7th century until the Reformation in the 16th century.[49] These debates have supported the inclusion of icons of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the Apostles, the iconography expressed in stained glass, regional saints and other symbols of Christian faith. It has also supported the practices such as the Catholic mass, the reverential use of the bread and the wine as representations of Jesus' body and blood, burning of candles before pictures, Christmas decorations and celebrations, and festive or memorial processions with statues of religious significance to Christianity.[49][50][51]
St. John of Damascus, in his "On the Divine Image", defended the use of icons and images, in direct response to the Byzantine iconoclasm that began widespread destruction of religious images in the 8th century, with support from emperor Leo III and continued by his successor Constantine V during a period of religious war with the invading Umayyads.[52] John of Damascus wrote, "I venture to draw an image of the invisible God, not as invisible, but as having become visible for our sakes through flesh and blood", adding that images are expressions "for remembrance either of wonder, or an honor, or dishonor, or good, or evil" and that a book is also a written image in another form.[53][54] He defended the religious use of images based on the Christian doctrine of Jesus as an incarnation.[55]
St. John the Evangelist cited John 1:14, stating that "the Word became flesh" indicates that the invisible God became visible, that God's glory manifested in God's one and only Son as Jesus Christ, and therefore God chose to make the invisible into a visible form, the spiritual incarnated into the material form.[56][57]
The early defense of images included exegesis of Old and New Testament. Evidence for the use of religious images is found in Early Christian art and documentary records. For example, the veneration of the tombs and statues of martyrs was common among early Christian communities. In 397 St. Augustine of Hippo, in his Confessions 6.2.2, tells the story of his mother making offerings for the statues and tombs of martyrs.[58]
The Catholic defense mentions textual evidence of external acts of honor towards icons, arguing that there are "different kinds of worship" and that the honor shown to icons differs entirely from the adoration of God. Citing the Old Testament, these arguments present examples of forms of "honor" such as in Genesis 33:3, with the argument that "adoration is one thing, and that which is offered in order to honor something of great excellence is another". These arguments assert, "the honor given to the image is transferred to its prototype", and that venerating an image of Christ does not terminate at the image itself – the material of the image is not the object of worship – rather it goes beyond the image, to the prototype.[60][59][61]
The Eastern Orthodox Church has differentiated between latria and dulia. A latria is the worship due God, and latria to anyone or anything other than God is doctrinally forbidden by the Orthodox Church; however dulia has been defined as veneration of religious images, statues or icons which is not only allowed but obligatory.[62] This distinction was discussed by Thomas Acquinas in section 3.25 of Summa Theologiae.[63]
The veneration of images of Mary is called Marian devotion (above: Lithuania), a practice questioned in the majority of Protestant Christianity.[64][65]
In Orthodox apologetic literature, the proper and improper use of images is extensively discussed. Exegetical orthodox literature points to icons and the manufacture by Moses (under God's commandment) of the Bronze Snake in Numbers 21:9, which had the grace and power of God to heal those bitten by real snakes. Similarly, the Ark of the Covenant was cited as evidence of the ritual object above which Yahweh was present.[66][67]
Veneration of icons through proskynesis was codified in 787 CE by the Seventh Ecumenical Council.[68][69] This was triggered by the Byzantine Iconoclasm controversy that followed raging Christian-Muslim wars and a period of iconoclasm in West Asia.[68][70] The defense of images and the role of the Syrian scholar John of Damascus was pivotal during this period. The Eastern Orthodox sect of Christianity has ever since celebrated the use of icons and images. Eastern-rite Catholics also accepts icons in their Divine Liturgy.[71]
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, "Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. Man commits idolatry whenever he honours and reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods, or demons (for example satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money etc."[72] The manufacture of images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and Christian saints, along with prayers directed to these has been widespread among the Catholic faithful.[73]
The idolatry debate has been one of the defining differences between Papal Catholicism and Anti-papal Protestantism.[74] The anti-papal writers have prominently questioned the worship practices and images supported by Catholics, with many Protestant scholars listing it as the "one religious error larger than all others". The sub-list of erring practices have included among other things Mariolatry or the worship of Virgin Mary as a form of idolatry, the Catholic mass, the invocation of saints, and the reverence expected for and expressed to Pope himself.[74] The charges of idolatry against the Roman Catholics were leveled by a diverse group of Protestants, from the Church of England to John Calvin in Geneva.[74][75]
Protestants did not abandon all icons and symbols of Christianity. They typically avoid the use of images, except the cross, in any context suggestive of veneration. The cross remained their central icon.[47][48] Technically both major sects of Christianity have had their icons, states Carlos Eire, a professor of religious studies and history, but its meaning has been different to each and "one man's devotion was another man's idolatry".[76] This was particularly true not only in the intra-Christian debate, states Eire, but also when soldiers of Catholic kings replaced "horrible Aztec idols" in the American colonies with "beautiful crosses and Mary idols".[76]
Protestants often accuse Catholics of idolatry, iconolatry, and even paganism for failing to "cleanse their faith" of the use of images; in the Protestant Reformation such language was common to all Protestants. In some cases, such as the Puritan groups denounced all forms of religious objects, whether in three-dimensional or two-dimensional form, including the Christian cross.[77]
The body of Christ on the cross is an ancient symbol used within the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran churches, in contrast with some Protestant groups, which use only a simple cross. In Judaism, the reverence to the icon of Christ in the form of cross has been seen as idolatry.[78] However, some Jewish scholars disagree and consider Christianity to be based on Jewish belief and not truly idolatrous.[79]
The two most common terms connoting idolatry in Sharia, that is Islamic law according to the Quran and the hadiths, are shirk (sh-r-k)[80] and Kufr (k-f-r).[81][82] A kafir, or unbeliever in Islam, is legally equivalent to a shirk in Islamic jurisprudence.[80] The one who associates with a kufr or shirk is called mushrik or mushrikun in the Islamic scriptures.[83] The Quran forbids idolatry.[83] Over 500 mentions of kufr and shirk are found in the Quran,[81] with some verses mentioning the destruction of idols and violence against idolaters during war:[84]
Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them, and take them (captive), and besiege them, and prepare for them each ambush. But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then leave their way free. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
The Islamic concept of idolatry extends beyond polytheism, and includes some Christians and Jews as muširkūn (idolaters) and kafirun (infidels).[85][86] For example:
They surely disbelieve who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. The Messiah (himself) said: O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Lo! whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, for him Allah hath forbidden paradise. His abode is the Fire. For evil-doers there will be no helpers.
Shia classical theology differs in the concept of Shirk. According to Twelver theologians, the attributes and names of God have no independent and hypostatic existence apart from the being and essence of God. Any suggestion of these attributes and names being conceived of as separate is thought to entail polytheism. It would be even incorrect to say God knows by his knowledge which is in his essence but God knows by his knowledge which is his essence. Also God has no physical form and he is insensible.[87] The border between theoretical Tawhid and Shirk is to know that every reality and being in its essence, attributes and action are from him(from Him-ness), it is Tawhid. Every supernatural action of the prophets is by God's permission as Quran points to it. The border between the Tawhid and Shirk in practice is to assume something as an end in itself, independent from God, not as a road to God(to Him-ness).[88] Ismailis goes deeper in the definition of 'Shirk, declaring it to don't recognize any sort of ground of being by the mystical potential intuitive knowledge of the human being. So on, most of Shias doesn't have any problem regarding paintings and veneation of the prophets and Imams.
Islam strongly prohibits all form of idolatry, which is part of the sin of shirk (Arabic: شرك‎); širk comes from the Arabic root Š-R-K (ش ر ك), with the general meaning of "to share". In the context of the Qur'an, the particular sense of "sharing as an equal partner" is usually understood as "attributing a partner to Allah". Shirk is often translated as idolatry and polytheism.[80] In the Qur'an, shirk and the related word (plural Stem IV active participle) mušrikūn (مشركون) "those who commit shirk" often refers to the enemies of Islam (as in verse 9.1–15) but sometimes it also refers to erring Muslims.[citation needed]
Within Islam, shirk is an unforgivable crime, if the person who committed it dies without repenting; God may forgive any sin except for committing shirk.[citation needed] In practice, especially among strict conservative interpretations of Islam, the term has been greatly extended and means deification of anyone or anything other than the singular God.[citation needed] In Salafi-Wahhabi interpretation, it may be used very widely to describe behaviour that does not literally constitute worship, including use of images of sentient beings, building a structure over a grave, associating partners with God, giving his characteristics to others beside him, or not believing in his characteristics.[citation needed] 19th century Wahhabis regarded idolatry punishable with the death penalty, a practice that was "hitherto unknown" in Islam.[89][90] However, Classical Orthodox Sunni thought used to be rich in Relics and Saint veneration, as well as pilgrimage to their shrines. Ibn Taymiyya, a medieval theologian that influenced modern days Salafists, was put in prison for his negation of veneration of relics and Saints, as well as pilgrimage to Shrines, which was considered unorthodox by his contemporary theologians.
According to Islamic tradition, over the millennia after Ishmael's death, his progeny and the local tribes who settled around the oasis of Zam-Zam gradually turned to polytheism and idolatry. Several idols were placed within the Kaaba representing deities of different aspects of nature and different tribes. Several heretical rituals were adopted in the Pilgrimage (Hajj) including doing naked circumambulation.[91]
In her book, Islam: A Short History, Karen Armstrong asserts that the Kaaba was officially dedicated to Hubal, a Nabatean deity, and contained 360 idols that probably represented the days of the year.[92] But by Muhammad's day, it seems that the Kaaba was venerated as the shrine of Allah, the High God. Allah was never represented by an idol.[93] Once a year, tribes from all around the Arabian peninsula, whether Christian or pagan, would converge on Mecca to perform the Hajj, marking the widespread conviction that Allah was the same deity worshiped by monotheists.[92] Guillaume in his translation of Ibn Ishaq, an early biographer of Muhammad, says the Ka'aba itself was addressed using a feminine grammatical form.[94] Circumambulation was often performed naked by men and almost naked by women,[91] and linked to ancient fertility rites.[95] It is disputed whether Allah and Hubal were the same deity or different. Per a hypothesis by Uri Rubin and Christian Robin, Hubal was only venetrated by Quraysh and the Kaaba was first dedicated to Allah, a supreme god of individuals belonging to different tribes, while the pantheon of the gods of Quraysh was installed in Kaaba after they conquered Mecca a century before Muhammad's time.[96]
A 1768 synagogue parchment with the Ten Commandments by Jekuthiel Sofer. Among other things, it prohibits idolatry[97]
Judaism prohibits any form of idolatry.[98] According to its commandments, neither is worship of foreign gods in any form or through icons allowed, nor is idolatrous worship of the God of Israel permitted.[98][99]
Many Jewish scholars such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi have elaborated on the issues of idolatry. One of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) on idolatry.[99] According to the Maimonidean interpretation, idolatry in itself is not a fundamental sin, but the grave sin is the belief that God can be corporeal. In the Jewish belief, the only image of God is man, one who lives and thinks; God has no visible shape, and it is absurd to make or worship images; instead man must worship the invisible God alone.[99][100]
The commandments in the Hebrew Bible against idolatry forbade the practices and gods of ancient Akkad, Mesopotamia, and Egypt.[101][102] The Hebrew Bible states that God has no shape or form, is utterly incomparable, is everywhere and cannot be represented in a physical form of an idol.[103]
Biblical scholars have historically focused on the textual evidence to construct the history of idolatry in Judaism, a scholarship that post-modern scholars have increasingly begun deconstructing.[15] This biblical polemics, states Naomi Janowitz, a professor of Religious Studies, has distorted the reality of Israelite religious practices and the historic use of images in Judaism. The direct material evidence is more reliable, such as that from the archaeological sites, and this suggests that the Jewish religious practices have been far more complex than what biblical polemics suggest. Judaism included images and cultic statues in the First Temple period, the Second Temple period, Late Antiquity (2nd to 8th century CE), and thereafter.[15][104]
The history of Jewish religious practice has included cult images and figurines made of ivory, terracotta, faience and seals.[15][105] As more material evidence emerged, one proposal has been that Judaism oscillated between idolatry and iconoclasm. However, the dating of the objects and texts suggest that the two theologies and liturgical practices existed simultaneously. The claimed rejection of idolatry because of monotheism found in Jewish literature and therefrom in biblical Christian literature, states Janowitz, has been unreal abstraction and flawed construction of the actual history.[15] The material evidence of images, statues and figurines taken together with the textual description of cherub and "wine standing for blood", for example, suggests that symbolism, making religious images, icon and index has been integral part of Judaism.[15][106][107] Every religion has some objects that represent the divine and stand for something in the mind of the faithful, and Judaism too has had its holy objects and symbols such as the Menorah.[15]
The ancient religions of India apparently had no use of cult images. While the Vedic literature of Hinduism is extensive in the form of Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads, and have been dated to have been composed over a period of centuries (1500 BCE to 200 BCE), there is no mention of temples or worship of cult images in them.[108] Beyond the textual evidence, no very early temples have yet been discovered in archaeological sites of ancient India that suggest the use of cult images. The early Buddhist and Jain (pre-200 BCE) traditions similarly suggest no evidence of idolatry. The Vedic literature mention many gods and goddesses, as well as the use of Homa (votive ritual using fire), but it does not mention images or their worship.[108][109][110] The ancient Buddhist, Hindu and Jaina texts discuss the nature of existence, whether there is or is not a creator deity such as in the Nasadiya Sukta of the Rigveda, they describe meditation, they recommend the pursuit of simple monastic life and self-knowledge, they debate the nature of absolute reality as Brahman or Śūnyatā, yet the ancient Indian texts mention no use of images. Indologists such as the Max Muller, Jan Gonda, Pandurang Vaman Kane, Ramchandra Narayan Dandekar, Horace Hayman Wilson, Stephanie Jamison and other scholars state that "there is no evidence for icons or images representing god(s)" in the ancient religions of India. Idolatry developed among the Indian religions later.[108][111]
According to John Grimes, a professor of Indian philosophy, Indian thought denied even dogmatic idolatry of its scriptures. Everything has been left to challenge, arguments and enquiry, with the medieval Indian scholar Vācaspati Miśra stating that scripture is not authoritative, only purportful scripture is.[112]
According to Eric Reinders, icons and idolatry has been an integral part of Buddhism throughout its later history.[113] Buddhists, from Korea to Vietnam, Thailand to Tibet, Central Asia to South Asia, have long produced temples and idols, altars and rosaries, relics to amulets, images to ritual implements.[113][114][115] The images or relics of Buddha are found in all Buddhist traditions, but they also feature gods and goddesses such as those in Tibetan Buddhism.[113][116]
Bhakti (called Bhatti in Pali) has been a common practice in Theravada Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to Buddhist icons and particularly images of Buddha.[117][118] Karel Werner notes that Bhakti has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and states, "there can be no doubt that deep devotion or bhakti / bhatti does exist in Buddhism and that it had its beginnings in the earliest days".[119]
According to Peter Harvey – a professor of Buddhist Studies, Buddha idols and idolatry spread into northwest Indian subcontinent (now Pakistan and Afghanistan) and into Central Asia with Buddhist Silk Road merchants.[120] The Hindu rulers of different Indian dynasties patronized both Buddhism and Hinduism from 4th to 9th century, building Buddhist icons and cave temples such as the Ajanta Caves and Ellora Caves which featured Buddha idols.[121][122][123] From the 10th century, states Harvey, the raids into northwestern parts of South Asia by Muslim Turks destroyed Buddhist idols, given their religious dislike for idolatry. The iconoclasm was so linked to Buddhism, that the Islamic texts of this era in India called all idols as Budd.[120] The desecration of idols in cave temples continued through the 17th century, states Geri Malandra, from the offense of "the graphic, anthropomorphic imagery of Hindu and Buddhist shrines".[123][124]
In East Asia and Southeast Asia, worship in Buddhist temples with the aid of icons and sacred objects has been historic.[125] In Japanese Buddhism, for example, Butsugu (sacred objects) have been integral to the worship of the Buddha (kuyo), and such idolatry considered a part of the process of realizing one's Buddha nature. This process is more than meditation, it has traditionally included devotional rituals (butsudo) aided by the Buddhist clergy.[125] These practices are also found in Korea and China.[115][125]

In Hinduism, an icon, image, statue or idol is called Murti or Pratima.[5][126] Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartaism favor the use of Murti (idol). These traditions suggest that it is easier to dedicate time and focus on spirituality through anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic icons. The Bhagavad Gita – a Hindu scripture, in verse 12.5, states that only a few have the time and mind to ponder and fix on the unmanifested Absolute (abstract formless Brahman), and it is much easier to focus on qualities, virtues, aspects of a manifested representation of god, through one's senses, emotions and heart, because the way human beings naturally are.[127][128]
A Murti in Hinduism, states Jeaneane Fowler – a professor of Religious Studies specializing on Indian Religions, is itself not god, it is an "image of god" and thus a symbol and representation.[5] A Murti is a form and manifestation, states Fowler, of the formless Absolute.[5] Thus a literal translation of Murti as idol is incorrect, when idol is understood as superstitious end in itself. Just like the photograph of a person is not the real person, a Murti is an image in Hinduism but not the real thing, but in both cases the image reminds of something of emotional and real value to the viewer.[5] When a person worships a Murti, it is assumed to be a manifestation of the essence or spirit of the deity, the worshipper's spiritual ideas and needs are meditated through it, yet the idea of ultimate reality – called Brahman in Hinduism – is not confined in it.[5]
Devotional (bhakti movement) practices centered on cultivating a deep and personal bond of love with God, often expressed and facilitated with one or more Murti, and includes individual or community hymns, japa or singing (bhajan, kirtan or aarti). Acts of devotion, in major temples particularly, are structured on treating the Murti as the manifestation of a revered guest,[8] and the daily routine can include awakening the murti in the morning and making sure that it "is washed, dressed, and garlanded."[129][130][note 1]
In Vaishnavism, the building of a temple for the murti is considered an act of devotion, but non-Murti symbolism is also common wherein the aromatic Tulsi plant or Saligrama is an aniconic reminder of the spiritualism in Vishnu.[129] In the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism, Shiva may be represented as a masculine idol, or half man half woman ardhanarishvara form, in an anicon Linga-Yoni form. The worship rituals associated with the Murti, correspond to ancient cultural practices for a beloved guest, and the Murti is welcomed, taken care of, and then requested to retire.[131][132]
Christopher John Fuller states that an image in Hinduism cannot be equated with a deity and the object of worship is the divine whose power is inside the image, and the image is not the object of worship itself, Hindus believe everything is worthy of worship as it contains divine energy.[133] The idols are neither random nor intended as superstitious objects, rather they are designed with embedded symbolism and iconographic rules which sets the style, proportions, the colors, the nature of items the images carry, their mudra and the legends associated with the deity.[133][134][135] The Vāstusūtra Upaniṣad states that the aim of the Murti art is inspire a devotee towards contemplating the Ultimate Supreme Principle (Brahman).[135] This text adds (abridged):
From the contemplation of images grows delight, from delight faith, from faith steadfast devotion, through such devotion arises that higher understanding (parāvidyā) that is the royal road to moksha. Without the guidance of images, the mind of the devotee may go ashtray and form wrong imaginations. Images dispel false imaginations. (... ) It is in the mind of Rishis (sages), who see and have the power of discerning the essence of all created things of manifested forms. They see their different characters, the divine and the demoniac, the creative and the destructive forces, in their eternal interplay. It is this vision of Rishis, of gigantic drama of cosmic powers in eternal conflict, which the Sthapakas (Silpins, murti and temple artists) drew the subject-matter for their work.
Some Hindu movements founded during the colonial British era, such as the Arya Samaj and Satya Mahima Dharma reject idolatry.[137][138][139]
Devotional idolatry has been a prevalent ancient practice in various Jaina sects, wherein learned Tirthankara (Jina) and human gurus have been venerated with offerings, songs and Āratī prayers.[140] Like other major Indian religions, Jainism has premised its spiritual practices on the belief that "all knowledge is inevitably mediated by images" and human beings discover, learn and know what is to be known through "names, images and representations". Thus, idolatry has been a part of the major sects of Jainism such as Digambara and Shvetambara.[141] The earliest archaeological evidence of the idols and images in Jainism is from Mathura, and has been dated to be from the first half of the 1st millennium CE.[142]
The creation of idols, their consecration, the inclusion of Jaina layperson in idols and temples of Jainism by the Jaina monks has been a historic practice.[141] However, during the iconoclastic era of Islamic rule, between the 15th and 17th century, a Lonka sect of Jainism emerged that continued pursuing their traditional spirituality but without the Jaina arts, images and idols.[143]
Sikhism is a monotheistic Indian religion, and Sikh temples are devoid of idols and icons for God.[144][145] Yet, Sikhism strongly encourages devotion to God.[146][147] Some scholars call Sikhism a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions.[148][149]
In Sikhism, "nirguni Bhakti" is emphasised – devotion to a divine without Gunas (qualities or form),[149][150][151] but its scripture also accepts representations of God with formless (nirguni) and with form (saguni), as stated in Adi Granth 287.[152][153] Sikhism condemns worshipping images or statues as if it were God,[154] but have historically challenged the iconoclastic policies and hindu temple destruction activities of Islamic rulers in India.[155] Sikhs house their scripture and revere the Guru Granth Sahib as the final Guru of Sikhism.[156] It is installed in Sikh Gurdwara (temple), many Sikhs bow or prostrate before it on entering the temple.[note 1] Guru Granth Sahib is ritually installed every morning, and put to bed at night in many Gurdwaras.[163][164][165]

Africa has numerous ethnic groups, and their diverse religious idea have been grouped as African Traditional Religions, sometimes abbreviated to ATR. These religions typically believe in a Supreme Being which goes by different regional names, as well as spirit world often linked to ancestors, and mystical magical powers through divination.[166] Idols and their worship have been associated with all three components in the African Traditional Religions.[167]
According to J.O. Awolalu, proselytizing Christians and Muslims have mislabelled idol to mean false god, when in the reality of most traditions of Africa, the object may be a piece of wood or iron or stone, yet it is "symbolic, an emblem and implies the spiritual idea which is worshipped".[168] The material objects may decay or get destroyed, the emblem may crumble or substituted, but the spiritual idea that it represents to the heart and mind of an African traditionalist remains unchanged.[168] Sylvester Johnson – a professor of African American and Religious Studies, concurs with Awolalu, and states that the colonial era missionaries who arrived in Africa, neither understood the regional languages nor the African theology, and interpreted the images and ritualism as "epitome of idolatry", projecting the iconoclastic controversies in Europe they grew up with, onto Africa.[169]
First with the arrival of Islam in Africa, then during the Christian colonial efforts, the religiously justified wars, the colonial portrayal of idolatry as proof of savagery, the destruction of idols and the seizure of idolaters as slaves marked a long period of religious intolerance, which supported religious violence and demeaning caricature of the African Traditional Religionists.[170][171][172] The violence against idolaters and idolatry of Traditional Religion practicers of Africa started in the medieval era and continued into the modern era.[173][174][175] The charge of idolatry by proselytizers, state Michael Wayne Cole and Rebecca Zorach, served to demonize and dehumanize local African populations, and justify their enslavement and abuse locally or far off plantations, settlements or for forced domestic labor.[176][177]
Inti Raymi, a winter solstice festival of the Inca people, reveres Inti – the sun deity. Offerings include round bread and maize beer.[178]
Statues, images and temples have been a part of the Traditional Religions of the indigenous people of the Americas.[179][180][181] The Incan, Mayan and Aztec civilizations developed sophisticated religious practices that incorporated idols and religious arts.[181] The Inca culture, for example, has believed in Viracocha (also called Pachacutec) as the creator deity and nature deities such as Inti (sun deity), and Mama Cocha the goddess of the sea, lakes, rivers and waters.[182][183][184]
The Aztec Tula Atlantean statues (above) have been called as symbols of idolatry, but may have just been stone images of warriors.[185]
In Mayan culture, Kukulkan has been the supreme creator deity, also revered as the god of reincarnation, water, fertility and wind.[186] The Mayan people built step pyramid temples to honor Kukulkan, aligning them to the Sun's position on the spring equinox.[187] Other deities found at Mayan archaeological sites include Xib Chac – the benevolent male rain deity, and Ixchel – the benevolent female earth, weaving and pregnancy goddess.[187] A deity with aspects similar to Kulkulkan in the Aztec culture has been called Quetzalcoatl.[186]
Missionaries came to the Americas with the start of Spanish colonial era, and the Catholic Church did not tolerate any form of native idolatry, preferring that the idols and icons of Jesus and Mary replace the native idols.[76][188][179] Aztec, for example, had a written history which included those about their Traditional Religion, but the Spanish colonialists destroyed this written history in their zeal to end what they considered as idolatry, and to convert the Aztecs to Catholicism. The Aztec Indians, however, preserved their religion and religious practices by burying their idols under the crosses, and then continuing their idol worship rituals and practices, aided by the syncretic composite of atrial crosses and their idols as before.[189]
During and after the imposition of Catholic Christianity during Spanish colonialism, the Incan people retained their original beliefs in deities through syncretism, where they overlay the Christian God and teachings over their original beliefs and practices.[190][191][192] The male deity Inti became accepted as the Christian God, but the Andean rituals centered around idolatry of Incan deities have been retained and continued thereafter into the modern era by the Incan people.[192][193]
The Polynesian people have had a range of polytheistic theologies found across the Pacific Ocean. The Polynesian people produced idols from wood, and congregated around these idols for worship.[194][195]
The Christian missionaries, particularly from the London Missionary Society such as John Williams, and others such as the Methodist Missionary Society, characterized these as idolatry, in the sense of islanders worshipping false gods. They sent back reports which primarily focussed on "overthrow of pagan idolatry" as evidence of their Christian sects triumph, with fewer mentions of actual converts and baptism.[196][197]
Yehezkel Kaufman (1960) states that the biblical prohibition of idolatry relates to the belief where the idols are considered gods. He adds that it is erroneous to assume that all idolatry was of this type, when in some cases, idols may have only been representations of gods. He cites a passage from 1 Kings 18:27, the Hebrew prophet Elijah challenges the priests of Baal atop of Mount Carmel to persuade their god to perform a miracle. The pagan priests beseeched their god without the use of an idol, which is evidence that Baal was not an idol, but rather one of the polytheistic gods that merely could be worshipped with or without the use of an idol.[citation needed]
The accusations and presumption that all idols and images are devoid of symbolism, or that icons of one's own religion are "true, healthy, uplifting, beautiful symbolism, mark of devotion, divine", while of other person's religion are "false, an illness, superstitious, grotesque madness, evil addiction, satanic and cause of all incivility" is more a matter of subjective personal interpretation, rather than objective impersonal truth.[15] Allegations that idols only represent false gods, followed by violence and iconoclastic destruction, state Regina Schwartz and other scholars, is little more than religious intolerance.[198][199] The philosopher David Hume in his Dialogue on Religion, wrote that pagan idolatry is premised on pluralism, tolerance and acceptance of diverse representations of the divine, while monotheism has been intolerant, attempted to destroy freedom of expression and has violently forced others to accept and worship their singular view of the divine.[16]

^ a b Such idol caring practices are found in other religions. For example, the Infant Jesus of Prague is venerated in many countries of the Catholic world. In the Prague Church it is housed, it is ritually cared for, cleaned and dressed by the sisters of the Carmelites Church, changing the Infant Jesus' clothing to one of the approximately hundred costumes donated by the faithfuls as gift of devotion.[157][158] The idol is worshipped with the faithful believing that it renders favors to those who pray to it.[158][159][160] Such ritualistic caring of the image of baby Jesus is found in other churches and homes in Central Europe and Portugual / Spain influenced Christian communities with different names, such as Menino Deus.[159][161][162]

See John Calvin (1537) The Institutes of the Christian Religion, Quote: "The worship which they pay to their images they cloak with the name of εἰδωλοδυλεία (idolodulia), and deny to be εἰδωλολατϱεία (idolatria). So they speak, holding that the worship which they call dulia may, without insult to God, be paid to statues and pictures. (...) For the Greek word λατϱεύειν having no other meaning than to worship, what they say is just the same as if they were to confess that they worship their images without worshipping them. They cannot object that I am quibbling upon words. (...) But how eloquent soever they may be, they will never prove by their eloquence that one and the same thing makes two. Let them show how the things differ if they would be thought different from ancient idolaters."

The definition of Shirk differs in Islamic Schools, from Shiism and some classical Sunni Sufism accepting, sometimes, images, pilgrimage to shrines and veneration of relics and saints, to the more puritan Salafi-Wahhabi current, that condemns all the previous mentioned practices.

The UN’s human rights body, UNCHR, has voted on Friday to send a team of international war crimes investigators to probe the killing of protesters in Gaza by the Israeli forces.
The resolution was announced after holding a special session on Friday and was backed by 29 members. Two members, the United States and Australia, voted against and 14 abstained.
According to the resolution, the council decided to “urgently dispatch an independent, international commission of inquiry to investigate all alleged violations and abuses of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the Occupied Gaza Strip, in the context of the military assault on large-scale civilian protests that began on 30 March 2018.”
The council also demanded that Israel immediately and fully end its illegal closure of the occupied Gaza Strip, which amounts to collective punishment of the Palestinian civilian population.
Since protests began on March 30, 2018, Israeli forces have killed more than 100 Palestinians, including 15 children, and more than 12 thousand have been wounded.

The thinking was it would be relatively warmer by then and it would be a chance to surf some proper waves. It was the only available time off work so ferries were booked. Sleeping bags were bought from the army surplus store and old tents dug out as no one could afford a hotel then or even a guest house, that’s if they would let us in!!!!!!!!
The chance to use the newly acquired ‘MALIBU’ boards in Cornwall was too good to miss. Rudimentary wetsuits were acquired over the winter, being diving based or just sleeveless tops. Beaver tails were all the rage, being early examples of neoprene up to ½” thick, ideal for being slammed into a sandbar.
Of course there were some who had surfed all winter without one and didn’t think much of these new fangled things, ‘what’s wrong with a thick woollen jumper!’, Ned was a great exponent of this philosophy especially after a few pints.
The boards were bought in the autumn of the previous year, at the end of the season sale at ‘The Paint Spot’ which was located in the Diggey, an old area of Newquay which is now the Co-Op behind Towan beach. They were ex-hire boards and ranged in size from 9’6” – 10’6”, single fin jobs, slightly heavier than today’s slithers, almost resembling aircraft carriers, but when going would really fly.
These boards were a huge advance on the heavy wooden boards in use at that time, plywood traditional belly boards used with swim fins were soon obsolete and Malibu long boards were the thing with one downside, no leashes then, probably a good idea as one of these boards tied to your leg would have caused quite a bit of damage.
The enthusiasm for going to Cornwall was all wound up with the emerging surf culture, Bilbo’s surf shop and factory where a board would be made there and then to your spec and meeting Rod Sumpter who had just come back from California coming 5th in the world championship!!!!!.
So the Thursday before Easter soon came round and arrangements were made. We were to meet up at the pub in Crantock not far from Trevella camp site in the evening, as some could finish work early and get a surf in before dark, while others were still travelling down having to work till late.
A far as I can remember there was myself (Rog Backhouse), Sue Ellis, John Ainsworth, Rusty Long, Colin Burgess, Geoff ‘NED’ Gardener and Kev Digweed, but as they say about the Sixties ‘if you remember it you weren’t there’.
What a motley parade of antiquated cars there were from a Mini, a Standard 10, an A35, and a Hillman Minx, all with strange wings attached to the roof. Today we take it for granted, dial in the post code set the nav, select the play list on the whatever, load the drinks holders and off you go, 4hrs max. Not then, just getting off the Island was a complete pain following the directions of the British Rail staff onto the old tea tray of a ferry running at that time. Rough waves would come right through the car deck and out of the stern. There were far more rusty cars on the Island than anywhere. On foreign soil, the great north island, which way to go?? Head west on the A35 not quite Route 66 but that’s all we had, no dual carriageways, roundabouts, traffic lights and endless little roads going right through the main towns all the way.
Dorchester, Bridport, Axminster, the tunnel at the top of Charminster, and on to Exeter, occasionally the road became three lanes, with a suicide lane for overtaking, scary. And so onto the moors and Launceston with its really scary left turn round the castle walls. Fish and chips in Bodmin and pray it wasn’t foggy over the last bit to Indian Queens and then the relaxing bit into Newquay, knowing it wasn’t far and waves were waiting.
You might tell that I’ve driven this route many many times, driving down after work on Friday and coming back Sunday late, through the construction of the many bi-passes and motorways over the years. The worst drive ever was being stuck in Exeter on a August Bank Holiday when it took 18 hours to get home.
Were there waves? Of course, Great Western was really going off and we dragged our weary limbs down the beach and caught some really good right handers at high tide. If you know it, you’ll know what I mean. After a good surf, down the town to get something to eat and dry the wetties in the launderette at Towan and a look at the new boards at Bilbo’s.
There was and probably still is only one pub, ‘The Sailors’ in Newquay and many a story was told in there and plans hatched for trips all over the world as this was the time of the Hippie trail to India, and new discoveries and no boundaries to limit the new found freedoms.
Off to Trevella to put the tents up and get ready for the night and then to the rendezvous at Crantock where we said we would meet to discuss where to surf in the morning. There was no such thing as a surf forecast then, no Magic Seaweed or mobile phones, just a hunch or a quick look at the back page of the Telegraph newspaper for their Atlantic pressure chart.
After a long wait Ned eventually arrived and had a quick pint to liven himself up and told us about why he had been held up. Not knowing the road that well he had to take evasive action while taking the infamous corner in Launceston, and guess what the constabulary were waiting for just that occasion. After greeting the officer with his best imitation of Neddy Seagoon, “Evening Gilbert” a long conversation took place about where he was going with that strange thing on the roof, and ‘next time be a bit more careful son’. Whew !! at least the officer was a bit more humane and interested than official!!!!
After a long day it was time to get some sleep, some sleep was not what we got. Every half hour a tremendous roar was heard and a large aircraft barely made it over the camp sight, what was happening? Are we at war? Have aliens landed? Eventually all the noise died down and a little bit of exhausted sleep was had, but it was freezing, Easter in England!!!!!!!.
Soon the noise started again and to add to the discomfort the wind got up and there was a heavy squall with hailstones and sleet, retreat to the cars was the only option. Morning eventually came, a cup of tea and off into Newquay for breakfast and to check the surf out, but considerably slower than the day before, a sort of malaise had set in.
Fistral was big and exposed to the wind so back round to Towan and some nice shaped waves, others were already out making it quite crowded, 6 people. After parking up, donning wetties and lugging boards down the beach, the tide was going out.
A confusion of coastguards, police and council workers descended on us. Were we illegally parked? Had ‘Neds’ encounter the night before stirred things up? Were we being invaded? We were told quite forcibly to clear the beach immediately, but why?
Someone eventually told us what was going on, the tanker Torrey Canyon had run aground in the Scilly Isles and was spilling thousands of gallons of oil all along the coast. Answers to all our questions, the aeroplanes that had kept us awake were Long Range Shackleton Reconnaissance planes flying out of RAF St. Mawgan. A long way to come for no waves perhaps the little old Isle of Wight waves weren’t that bad. This was to turn out to be the worst environmental disaster to ever hit Cornwall and even the whole of the South West, of course the Government had no idea of how to deal with it.
This was a serious wakeup call as spraying had an even worse effect on the environment eventually leading to the bombing of the wreck by Buccaneers of the Navy. Although pretty depressing, it has lead to more stringent rules and regulations being introduced over the years, with protest movements having great effect over authority. Yet time and time again it has happened and probably will in the future.
A long drive back through the Easter traffic and a final catastrophe, I had lost my return ferry ticket!!!!!!!!
There was a lull in visits down west, but after a couple months the beaches were deemed usable and trips continued through ‘67. But a slight hic-up came, my future wife ,Sue, refused absolutely and completely forever ever to go camping in a tent ever again which lead to the purchase of a split – screen 1200cc, 6volt Volkswagen, under-powered or what!!!!!!!!!!! Porthtowan for the National Championships, Aggie in the badlands and good old Crantock.
Throughout 67-68 surfing equipment was evolving at a rapid rate, with the influence of the Aussies, V-bottoms, shorter boards and new ways of attacking waves but that’s another story……

If the Neo recognizes the connection as a "smart" USB connection (by communicating with the host about power availability) or as a standard Openmoko charger (by recognizing an expected resistance across two of the connectors) then it will switch into 'fast charge mode', drawing 500 mA or 1000 mA.
The detection logic is done in software, one can bypass it. If the USB charger used is not signaling the phone its capacity to deliver 500 or 1000 mA, then one may use these scripts to force fast charge mode anyway. Please double check. Trying to draw 1A from an electric system rated lower will lead to overheating and physical damage.
The behaviour is pretty much the same as described below for the Neo 1973. There's also a 1000 mA mode for the Openmoko-provided wall charger. Please note, that the sys-fs path changed slightly. It is now /sys/devices/platform/s3c2440-i2c/i2c-adapter/i2c-0/0-0073/ .
See the GTA02 sysfs page for a description of how to set/get the bit controlling power charge from the FR. What you want to do is something like this:
1. If you see no icon on your desktop, just edit /usr/share/applications/battery.desktop changing the line
Beni wrote a small shellscript providing status output and the ability to change charge settings. Just download the script and execute it. You can fetch it here: http://beni.skyforcesystems.de/openmoko/fast_charge_gta02.sh
Be careful ! In the above script, setting 100mA charging will force 500mA charging. Just a bad copy/paste, but it could be a pain. Edit line 53, and replace 500 with 100.
Use a script. User:Wurp has written a python script to monitor for slow charge and automatically pop up a gui asking if you want to switch to fast charge, see next CheckFastrCharge.py below.
Your neo will detect when it is charging slowly and pop up a gui to ask if you want to switch to fast charge mode. It will take a few seconds to detect that you are charging slowly.
This will not work for the FreeRunner. Andy Green has a patch to give the FreeRunner the needed functionality, then I'll need to update my script after that becomes available.
checkFastCharge will remember if you select slow charge and not ask you again. If you accidentally selected slow charge, unplug the neo from the charger for several seconds, then plug it back in. Next time the script checks, it will ask again if you want slow or fast charge.
When you select fast charge, the script goes through a confirmation sequence, because fast charge can be dangerous for your hardware if the charger doesn't support 500 mA or more. Just click 'Confirm' four times to confirm that you want to go into fast charge mode.
(The above just creates /home/root/bin/checkFastCharge.py, /etc/init.d/checkFastCharge, and the links to make checkFastCharge start up automatically when the neo reboots.)
By default, the Neos will only draw 100 mA of power from a USB connection, in accordance with the standard. This is not much power. The Neo almost always draws more than 100 mA to operate. So the battery can actually go dead while the Neo is plugged in and you think it is charging. But:
In the previous sections, we learned how to control the circuit's input and output using digital interface. In this section, we will learn how to vary the output using an analog device called a potentiometer (also known as a variable resistor). A potentiometer is used to vary the voltage in the range of 0 ~ 5V. The MPU reads the voltage value in the range of 0-1023.This can be used to control the brightness of the LED (PWM simulation output interface). If the potentiometer is turned clockwise, the LED brightens gradually. If it is rotated anticlockwise, the luminosity fades.
If you have connected the input to digital pin instead of analog pin the circuit might not work properly.
Potentiometer has three pins in it . Check whether you have connected the middle pin to the analog interface or else the circuit might not work properly.
To control flickering frequency of the LED with a potentiometer upload the following code To Open the demo code:
Naukowcy zaobserwowali, że od połowy XX wieku powietrze ziemskie się ociepla. W ciągu ostatnich 12 lat średnia temepratura powietrza w Europie była wyższa o niecałe 1,5 stopnia Celsjusza w porównaniu z końcem XIX wieku. To zjawisko nazywamy efektem cieplarnianym. Uważa się, że przyczyną efektu cieplarnianego jest zanieczyszczenie powietrza spalinami i dymami przymysłowymi oraz erupcje wulkaniczne. Skutkiem ocieplania się klimatu są bardziej gwałtowne zjawiska pogodowe: coraz więcej powodzi, huraganów i gwałtownych burz.

Sorry for resurrecting an old thread but does anybody have any photos (the ones above have disappeared) of the specific COP used. I've got VW COPs but not sure if they are the right ones for my B18 - the plug tops (screw on caps) appear to be too small for the COP - I could try a different plug top I suppose?
Pictures gone with courtasy of photobucket wanting loads of money, they screwed my diary and probably many others that used photobucket to host their photos, does anyone know of a free photo hosting site???
Hello gents! I just wanted to share this bit of information for those of you who are running Honda B-series VTEC engines...
If you have ever thought about converting to a COP system, or have already converted and are not happy with the fitment of the coils you have selected, this might be of interest to you.
I have recently discovered that it is possible to modify an Audi/VW coil to fit perfectly on a Honda B-Series VTEC head. Once the modification has been performed, the coils fit correctly on the plugs and seal completely in the valve cover. They are designed to hold onto the spark plug heads, so it is not necessary to bolt them down or use a cap to hold them in place, which is very convenient.
The outer diameter of the sealing area is 32.75 mm when uncompressed. The minimum compressed diameter that can be had is 31.00 mm. I have attached a photo with a measure, as the exact length you may need could vary a touch.
As for the wiring, the coils have the pins numbered inside the connector. I have attached the factory track diagram which shows the pin functions as follows:
When wiring the coils, I would personally suggest grounding the #4 pins directly to the head and routing the #2 pins to the same grounding location that your ECU is grounded to. Pins #3 will be wired to the coil outputs of your ECU, and can be configured for wasted spark if your ECU only has one output per pair of cylinders.
I am using an AEM 30-1060U ecu, so for me it was just a matter of configuring 3 additional pins in the software as coil outputs and telling the ECU to fire them sequentially. Hondata offers a solution that works with their S300 systems (Hondata CPR). I am not 100% sure how they configure their software, so I cant be sure if you could use their box with CROME or NepTune. I know that some versions of MegaSquirt have multiple coil outputs available too. I could also imagine this working with the Haltech, Motec, ETC....
Also note that if you run Chrome as a Browser there is an extension you can download that will cause the Photobucket photos to show up
just qwick one pomp, i found IMGBB, i find it simple, i tyed others but my phone wouldent download them
I'm not sure what happened to Photobucket, but I would like to thank OZ for the thorough and complete restoration of this information. Although the ignition system seems like one small part of the engine package, it plays a very important role in the performance of the engine package as a whole.
I don't have any art shows scheduled for the remainder of 2007. I will post my 2008 shows as soon as I receive confirmation that I have been accepted to participate in them. (In Spring 2008)
.....while I was at the BLOGGER'S WEEKEND (well, more than one really, but this was one that involved me directly).
You may remember that some months ago....in February to be exact.....SIAN organised a VALENTINE'S. POSTCARD SWAP! Well, I only received five of the expected six postcards but didn't bother bothering Sian about it......you never know with the post here!
To be honest I hadn't really given it another thought, so imagine my surprise when JULIE walked in and, after getting herself and her few(!!!!!!) crafting supplies....honestly, you have never seen how much stash these ladies bring with them!.....organised at the table next to mine, she walked around to me with a little package, explaining that SHE was my missing Postcard sender and had just never got around to posting it, but knowing we would see each other here brought it ....along with a couple of other postcards, a notebook and lots of little embellishments! I DID laugh; it was just so totally unexpected and sweet of her....thank you again Julie.
I'm hoping to get a post written about what I actually ACHIEVED on the day....in between all that chatting, eating and drinking...in the next day or so!
Ack! I so wish you had let me know. My swaps come with a full guarantee and I would have been more than happy to send you one so that you had your six. I did it for someone else and it's my pleasure. I wish you had..
Brilliant! I was there, but didn't know about it, and it has really made me smile. Great honesty and courage on the giver's part and gracefulness on the part of the receiver :).
Oh how nice of her making sure you finally got it - good card considering! :) Looking forward to seeing some of the pages you got done - I probably would have been chatting so much I wouldn't have got anything done. :)
Living in rural Spain for almost eight years now, when I started this Blog my life really was lived pretty much 'in the slow lane'! Eight years on and I have found myself immersed in village life, and helping to look after our aging ex-pat community. Married for over 30 years to my first-love, who is patient-beyond-measure with the amount of space my scrapping 'essentials' take up in our house! A little white ball of fluff called Boo is my constant companion and puts up with my busy life with very few complaints!
My interest in photography started when I was given my first camera, a Kodak Brownie 127 on my 10th birthday back in 1965. It was a simple little plastic box camera but to me it was the coolest gadget ever.
It literally used a roll of film in a protective light-proof wrapper which you had to carefully unroll to avoid accidental exposure and fit onto the rollers inside the camera. As you took each picture, you had to turn the rollers manually to advance the film.
It was the earliest WYSIWYG before the computer era termed it "What you see is what you get!" - there were no adjustments possible. You just pressed the shutter and hope for the best. Only 12 pictures could be taken with a roll.
Photography during my young days was an expensive hobby. That's probably the reason why so few amateur photos of those days are around now. Most people would balk at the cost of developing and printing photos. You were charged for both developing the negatives and printing the photographs.
A black and white 'postcard' size photo would cost about 40 cents and a colored print would be $2! Multiplied by 12 in each roll, it was a fortune in those days. So each and every picture was always considered carefully before being snapped! Most pictures would actually be printed in 'half' postcard size, approximately 2-1/2" X 3-1/2" which would be around 20 cents each.
Pictures taken with those pinhole cameras, which was what it really was, was quite acceptable. I still have some pictures taken with that camera with me today. Some of which I have posted in another blog about my old housing estate (see the b&w shots taken here). This is a picture taken with that camera.
The Kodak Instamatic was 'hi-tech' - it used a pre-loaded film cartridge instead of roll films. You could now get 20 exposures from each cartridge, and the neatest thing was that it had the latest photographic technology - Flash Cubes! The disposable flash cubes had 4 flashes and you could take pictures indoors now.
In my next blogs, I will tell you how I progressed to developing and printing my own photos, buying my first SLR camera and finally going digital in part III.

Born de Vriendt as the son of a stonecutter, the young Floris initially studied sculpture under his father but later focused entierly on the art of painting. After educational journeys to Liege and Italy, most notably Rome where he got deeply inspired by the paintings of Michelangelo and Tintoretto, he returned to Antwerp and opend up a workshop of the Italian model, with great success. The studio of Floris engaged a large number of artists including Lucas de Heere, Marten van Cleve, Isaac Claesz and Frans Francken. His art often shows a great influense of the Italian mannerism and he belongs to the group of Antwerp artists refered to as the Nederlandish Romanists.
Microsoft is currently engaged in an unprecedented hard-sell campaign to push rapid adoption of Windows 10 by existing users of Win 7 and 8. This includes a series of nagware popups urging you to “Get Windows 10” being stealth installed on Window 7 and 8 devices in the guise of bug fixes and security updates by Windows Update.
More recently, Microsoft has actually been stealth-downloading gigabytes of install files for Windows 10 onto Win7 and Win8 systems without warning or permission. (This can completely fill up the remaining free space on low-end Windows 8.1 tablets with 1 or 2 GB of flash memory, rendering them completely unusable.) In a few instances, MS has actually launched the Win 10 install without warning or permission.
Win 10 is the last discrete version of Windows ever. Going forward, Windows 10 will be continually and endlessly changing with silent FORCED updates done without your knowledge or consent.
Unlike previous versions of Windows, where Window Update would present a list of patches and let you pick and choose which ones to apply (and undo if they caused problems), Win 10 just silently forces changes into your system. This would be great --IF-- MS didn't have such a horrible record of botched updates. In just the FIRST week of Win 10 release, there have been three major screwups that have bricked just-installed Win 10 installations. One driver update for certain video chips locked machines into endless reboots, and one totally killed many machines rendering them unable to boot at all.
This continual unannounced changing of Win 10 means you are dealing with an unknown endlessly moving target. Just because programs and device drivers worked today, there is no assurance they will work tomorrow, next week or next month, due to the endless stealth updates.
This is going to be especially significant with ham radio software because much of it hasn't changed significantly since the XP era of the mid-to late 2000's. Sooner or later some secret update will start breaking these elderly programs, with no recourse to uninstall the offending patch (if you can even identify it).
Win 10 has escalated invasion of privacy to an unprecedented level. Win 10 is far more "cloud-oriented" than previous versions of Windows. As part of this, it's embedded "telemetry" reports practically everything you do, every program you run, every file you open back to the MS mother ship for analysis and marketing purposes. It shares your WiFi passwords with friends on your contact list. It can (and does) pop up ads in the middle of LOCALLY RUNNING programs. It attempts to default file saves of local programs to Microsoft's cloud, rather than to your own hard disk. It tries to thwart downloads of browsers other than Edge;i.e. that can run adblocker and popup-blocker plug-ins. It ignores entries in the Windows HOSTS file aimed at blocking unwanted communications to specific URLs. MS has taken it upon itself to scan your local files to determine which of your BitTorrent downloads and installed programs are "illegal".
Many of these URLs are hard-coded in the communications modules. You can’t stop or "black-hole" them with entries in the HOSTS file, or with firewalls running on the same computer. Blocking them requires entries outside the PC in your router’s block list.
MS is now attempting to stealth-load the same telemetry "spyware" into Win 7 and Win 8 systems under the guise of important "Customer Experience Improvement Program” (a.ka. CEIP) patches by Windows Update. However, at least with Win7 and 8 you can see the list of proposed downloads BEFORE they download, and uncheck them. Further, there are simple third-party batch file tools that can scan and uninstall this unwanted invasive crapware, including the "Get Windows 10" nagware popups campaign.)
Further, MS has started stealth-downloading the ENTIRE Win 10 setup image (i.e. multi-gigabyte DVD image) into Win 7 & 8 systems, whether you asked for it or not, "just in case you decide to upgrade". It's stealing gigabytes of your disk space and blowing through wireless device data quotas.
<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/09/10/windows_10_forced_download/> (This is a British computer and IT news site)
As of late Novmber 2015, Microsoft has been further intensifying their effort to force Windows 10 upgrade "nagware" into Windows 7 & 8 systems. They have been caught repeatedly using Windows updates to cancel "Do not upgrade OS" flags in existing Win 7 and 8 systems (set by users using the tools below). See this 7 December 2015 article from Computer World:
Note also the three other stories about these forced upgrades linked in the right-hand sidebar of this story.
As of January 2016, Microsoft is further ratcheting up their efforts to push Windows 10 onto on Win 7 and Win 8 systems, by reclassifying the Windows 10 install files from "optional" to "important" in Windows Update . The significance of this is that "optional" updates are defaulted to "NO" (i.e. you have to explicitly select them), while "important" updates are defaulted to YES (i.e. you will get them unless you explicitly cancel them).
If you have Windows Update on "automatic", the result is that 3-6 GB of install files WILL BE DOWNLOADED, and the Windows 10 install/upgrade MAY BE launched without warning.
Further, in another example of how Microsoft has completely lost their mind in their desperate frenzy to force Windows 10 uptake, they have (as of early January) embarked on a smear campaign against Windows 7. They have begun a classic FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) strategy of the type IBM used to mount. An MS press release in early January 2016, implies that you will start having difficulty acquiring drivers for new hardware, or be unable to install the latest games if you don't upgrade to Win 10.
The first sign you have been hit with this unwanted crapware is the appearance of a white Windows logo in the system tray in the lower-right corner of the Windows desktop on Windows 7 and 8 systems. An incessant series of popups urging you to update will follow.
If you have already been hit with the GWX nagware and possible installs of Win10-style “telemetry”, you can un-install them with the following .BAT (batch) file.
Open a blank document in Windows Notepad or similar editor. Copy/paste the following lines into it. Save the file as Zap-Win10-Updates.BAT or some such. Note the file extension “.BAT” rather than the default “.TXT” . After the save, locate this file in the Windows Explorer, RIGHT-click it and “Run As Administrator”. After a couple of UAC “Are you sure” prompts, a black “DOS Box” window will open. You will be repeatedly asked to “Hit any key to continue”. Just keep hitting <ENTER> until the black window closes; then reboot.
After the uninstalls complete, look for the subdirectory (i.e. “folder”) called \$Windows.~BT located off the root of the same drive as Windows. You will need to have “Show Hidden Files” enabled in the Explorer to see it. If found, delete it and its contents. (This is the location where the stealth download of the entire Windows 10 installer is being placed, eating up gigabytes of your disk space.) This directory will contain a layout equivalent to a Windows 10 install DVD-ROM and will be somewhere between 3 and 6 GB.
You can “immunize” Win 7 and 8 against these unwanted downloads and prevent the deleted files "coming back from the dead" with the next Windows Update.
Note that this tool has undergone repeated updates and revisions every few weeks as Microsoft has become ever more aggressive and evasive about their coercive forced-upgrade tactics.
Open Windows Notepad and copy & paste the text below into the open window. Then save it with a name ending in .REG such as
These lines are Windows registry entries. Locate the saved file in the Windows File Explorer. Right-click it and choose “Merge” to read it into the Windows Registry. Then reboot the system to make it effective.
Or disable Windows Update entirely, and use the off-line AutoPatcher patching system for Win 7 and 8.1, available from <http://autopatcher.net> . AutoPatcher downloads the entire set of patches and updates for a given version of Windows, stores them locally on your hard disk or removable storage device. You can then update any number of PCs without an Internet connection. When run, Autopatcher presents a list of ALL patches issued for a given 32- or 64-bit version of Windows, indicates which ones are already installed, and lets you opt in or out of any that need to be installed.
Zap_Win10_Additions.bat A Windows batch file to remove the Windows-10-style privacy-invading "telemetry" modules being stealth-loaded into Window 7 and 8.x systems. Right-click this link and "Save As" to a location on your hard drive. Then locate the file, right-click it and choose "Run As Administrator". A black "Command Prompt" window a.k.a. "DOS box" will open. Hit <Enter> at each pause until command window closes.
GWX_Control-Panel Get Windows 10 nagware control panel ("X" = Roman 10) that disables and removes Windows 10 nagware and unwanted stealth-downloaded files. Download this file, then run it. This utility is ready-to-run -- no formal setup or install is required. Be sure to enable the "Monitor mode" in the lower-left corner of it's screen. This activates a resident monitor function similar to an anti-virus program to prevent Windows Update from trying again to install Windows 10 crapware. This is the download page for "GWX Control Panel": <http://blog.ultimateoutsider.com/2015/08/using-gwx-stopper-to-permanently-remove.html> .
Never10 Gibson Research Corp's ready-to-run easy-to-use tool for blocking Windows 10 nagware and forced downloads/installs. Just download it, run it to "immunize" your Win 7 or 8 system against Windows 10 nagware, and then delete the program. No formal install is required. Note that this utility will not remove existing Windows 10 nagware -- it only blocks attempted installs and future downloads. You may still wish to install and run the far more aggressive "GWX Control Panel" above, that can remove existing Get Windows 10 nagware and files.
Note that this tool will download an update for "Windows Update" from Microsoft (Windows 7-KB3065987 or Windows 8.1- KB3065988). This is a newer version of Windows Update that can be instructed to not download the Windows 10 stuff. There may be a lengthy wait while this patch is downloaded and installed. (Even Microsoft's seemingly infinite server capacity is being strained by the grotesque amount of data being pushed out by the Windows 10 upgrade campaign.)
Stop-Windows-10-Nags-and-Forced-Updates.reg A Windows 7/8 registry addition that tell Windows Update that you don't want to upgrade to Windows 10. (This is a ready-to-run version of the registry entries discussed above.) Right-click this link and choose "Save As ..." to some location on your hard disk. Locate the file in Windows Explorer, right-click it, and choose "Merge. Note that recent Windows Updates are actually attempting to reverse this setting. You need to install the resident mode of the GWX Control Panel above to ensure this stays set.

The first manned US vertical flight machine appears to have been developed by Emile Berliner and John Newton Williams. Berliner was an inventor who developed the disk-type phonograph record and designed what may be the first production rotary aircraft engine, the 36hp Adams-Farwell engine. In 1908, Williams constructed a coaxial machine for Berliner using two of these rotary engines. It reportedly lifted both Williams and the machine, a total of 277kg, but was probably steadied from the ground.
In May, 1908, Williams built another stand in Hammondsport, New York, as a member of the famed Aerial Experiment Association (which included Alexander Bell and Glenn Curtiss), using a 40hp Curtiss engine. It made hovers around 1m, again steadied from the ground.

Correlation between Blood Pressure and vascular complications after coronary artery angiography - Journal of Holistic Nursing And Midwifery
Introduction: Post-coronary angiography vascular complications (PCAVC) may cause serious life threats, thus recognition of related factorse is needed to prevente complication
Objective: This study was conducted to determine correlation between hypertension and vascular complications after coronary artery angiograph among hospitalized patients therapeutic- educational center in Rasht
Methods: This descriptive analytical correlational study was performed on 400 patients admitted in angiography wards at Dr Heshmat therapeutic- educational centers by sequential sampling method in 2013. Data were gathered by a 3-part tool including; demographic information questionnaire, blood pressure recording forms and PCAVC occurance (Hematoma, ecchymosis and bleeding) during 24h after angiography until heet removal through interview and observation methods. Data were analyzed by using descriptive and analytic (X2, independent T and ANOVA) statistics tests
Results: Majority of samples (56.2%) had history of Hypertension. Mean of pre-angiographic systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 129.46±21.63 and 76.85± 1.15 and pre-sheat extraction were 132.96±18.02 and 78.85±1.02mmHg. Vascular complications were observed in 24 percents of samples that majority of them were ecchymosis (71.4%). A significant relationship was seen between history of HTN and overall PCAVC (p<0.005), ecchymosis (p<0.006) and hematoma (p<0.046). The statistical tests showed a significant relation between mean of systolic BP before sheet removal with overall PCAVC (p<0/003) and ecchymosis (p<0.004) and diastolic BP with overall PCAVC (p<0.0006), ecchymosis (p<0.0009)
Conclusion: Screen of high occurance of PCAVC among patients after angiography with history of hypertension and systolic and diastolic BP before sheet removal is required to diagnose high risk patients who need special and highy quality of care
If you are positioning a carpet in your Family members Area, Great Space, or any big location, making use of one big area rug might simply be exactly what you might require. If the location rug is thick, you ought to put a felt rug pad under it to give a softer feeling on the hardwood flooring and also shield it from foot impact that happens every time you tip on the rug as well as hardwood flooring damages from the weight of heavy furniture.
The benefit of obtaining a location carpet made from woollen is that it will certainly give you with much longer-lasting convenience compared to a lot of other kinds of location carpets. Do not place a special wool rug in a location of your house that is frequently walked through or that obtains trampled. If you are actually severe about stopping your rug from obtaining damaged, you could also consider getting rug-pads in order to ensure that you keep the bottom of your carpet from obtaining torn.
The location carpet size option has to be done based on the place where you choose to position the area carpet. You will certainly discover a location carpet for $750 at some area and minutes later you will be able to find the same carpet at a reduced cost of around 600$ at some other location.
There are square wool rugs, circular carpets, as well as carpets that are a lot more traditional forms like rectangles. When purchasing a wool location carpet, you usually obtain what you pay for; if the carpet is handmade, you will definitely be shelling out more loan compared to you would certainly for a contemporary woollen carpet that was made in a manufacturing facility. If you want to get a great looking wool location rug as well as save cash, you need to obtain an industrial location carpet.
If you already have furniture that you want to praise, then picking the right rug is an important addition to attract your eye and yet make a refined statement while unifying the elements of a space. Take right into account your style and also what kinds of carpets you admire in others' residences and in stores that sell rugs. Lighter rugs make the room seem cooler and also larger while darker shades warm the room and develop a cozy more intimate area.

As of late I’ve been splitting my time between developing MicroServices and WebApplications in .Net and Developing Chef Cookbooks. I’ve done some of the Chef Development outside of work, as I didn’t want reusable cookbooks to go to waste. I’m super enthused, as my web deployment cookbook actually had someone contribute to it, and has been getting use by folks other than me. WebDeploymentToolkit is currently just a resource provider and documentation on how to use it. However I’m hoping to eventually extend it some to also use regiis encryption. I’m also thinking of helping out the IIS cookbook opscode has with some refactoring just to reduce the warnings that get thrown at me. Back at work however in addition to my development, I’ve been teaching courses in chef to help inspire my coworkers to develop their own cookbooks, as alot of folks don’t have any development in their background. Given the increasing amount of both discussion and use of it, I believe I’m infecting my coworkers with knife skills.
Outside of work I’ve been focused on Data Science. The Podcasts Talking Machines and Partially Derivative have been great, inspiring me to learn as much as I can. As a fun side project I’ve been attempting to make a retail analysis engine to provide some simple reporting. My first task: Sales Forcasting. Now before I give the link, I’ll note anyone with a statistics background will find it laughable, and anyone with a strong algorithmic background may be overwhelmed with nausea. Suffice to say InventoryForcast is a far cry from Jet.com’s pricing engine, but it has been a great way to start recovering my math skills. After many iterations, I’m now looking at F# to write the independent service that performs that analysis and calculations and I’ll just use something like MVC for the front end. Starting off with F# has been nothing short of earth shattering, getting out of my Object Oriented comfort zone is enlightening. I’m falling in love with Suave (featured above) a super light weight functionally written web server. The HTML Data Provider also appears to be the Bee’s Knees, as I’m figuring out how to scrape data sources with it, which means at some point I’ll be able to build new and interesting data sources! Sadly I didn’t get to most my development wishlist from last year, but I’m starting fresh and hoping to stay sharp this year.
So my updates to the project I just started have been sparse so far due to my trying to find time for it while on a honeymoon with my wife. I dare say I am pleased however with that I have gotten done so far, building a model of sale based on the Adventure Works Database. Browsing through the data (although I probably shouldn’t be) I am impressed with the quality and wealth of test data they have crammed in it. It has made me rethink a few things and I am now making a better quality application that would function as more than a proof of concept. I am more or less done with the ability to list and delete sales, I still have to test adding them and then repeat the same process for line items of sales. Once that is complete I’ll have a dynamic warehouse and display for data, so I can start on a controller for the actual business analytics dashboard, which is the purpose of this exercise.
I had planned on spending my Sunday and Monday working on this project (along with unpacking and general recovery), however as we were traveling back toward home my wife fell prey to appendicitis. She pulled through the surgery with flying colors, and only now do I find myself with enough time to stop worrying about her to instead sit on my computer while I watch her sleep. The trip has otherwise been magnificent, though exhausting to try and see everything. Since this happened shortly after crossing the Canadian Border we are up in Buffalo and will sadly be making the trip home tomorrow, which hopefully won’t give her too much discomfort.
So this time I’ll blame my personal life for taking up all my free time, as only now on my honeymoon do I seem to find time to update my Blog. But that aside a lot changed since my last post, I’ve started writing chef cookbooks for work to provide a service oriented architecture for our applications. We have extended to automation system with more deployment types and I’ve been teaching my coworkers both it’s function and how to extend it. My coworkers are now all proficient enough to on board an application, and we are extending our number of deployments weekly. I personally have about 20 applications in the pipeline at the moment (.net and java) all of which will be deployed by using the system and Chef. I’m also hunting around to find a modern SSO mechanism like OAuth or SAML as most of our applications leverage custom solutions, which I would like to curb by offering intro courses to our developers.
In my personal life I’ve been fiddling with machine learning off and on, learning because it has been of great personal interest to me. I’ve since been inspired to create a business analytics dashboard oriented toward the retail space. I’ve started scaffolding a bit, thinking that I’d use webapi, signalr and r.net to run the numbers, however I may shirk R.net for the time being given my immediate task doesn’t require it. I’ve been given a methodology a business has been using for predicting their needed inventory stock, and they are hoping to extend it into a more real time application that doesn’t require manual updates.
I’ve torn the application apart 3 times now due to how I keep changing my thoughts on the exact execution, but I think things will come together soon as I settle on an ideal architecture. I gathered an Adventure Works sample database from Microsoft (http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/55330) which should make for a good starting base of the sort of data I’ll deal with. To make it near real time, I’m thinking I’ll make the data analysis event driven, and store reporting calculations in the database. By doing so I shave of compounded calculation times and can later leverage a similar architecture when running larger information or more complex queries. A minimum viable product is the goal of this exercise however, so I am cutting a few corners on the first run, and will extend it iterative releases.
I’ll update more on the project, most likely this week once I’m done setting up my mobile development environment. (I’m traveling abroad at the moment, so I’m using my laptop which has traditionally been an implement for web browsing.)
So I’ve wrapped up most of my Learning Chef Book and I have to say it was very good at getting me started. It took about two dedicated weekends to get through most everything in detail (including lab set up, etc.) which I think is pretty good. To be fair I have used and played with chef before in a Unix setting, but beyond writing recipes and simple tasks I’ve not done much. I’ve started translating the information over for windows administration, and with the supplement of Chef’s own documentation I’ve been doing pretty well. I’ve been fiddling with the IIS Cookbook to try and configure and set up a windows box, and instead of making my own box I’ve been using opentable/win-2012r2-standard-amd64-nocm from Vagrant’s website. The Box has been treating me well, though I’ve run into some issues with the IIS Cookbook, which appears to stem from the base windows cookbook.
[2015-08-30T10:42:43-07:00] WARN: Using an LWRP provider by its name (WindowsFeatureDism) directly is no longer supported in Chef 12 and will be removed. Use Chef::ProviderResolver.new(node, resource, action) instead.
The fact that the base windows cookbook uses DISM for installing windows features caught me off guard, and it appears to not support out of order installations or dependency resolution. The fact that DISM names and PowerShell names vary also caught me off guard since I’m used to leveraging PowerShell for feature installation. Oddly, that isn’t one of the supported providers that the cookbook can leverage, so I’ve forked the cookbook to try and add the PowerShell provider. So if you take a look at the Repo you’ll see my first cookbook is windows! I’ve actually got several local, but I’m looking forward to trying to extend one by opscode as I think that will give me a way better understanding of making complex cookbooks. With the realization of the number of cookbooks I’ll likely be writing, I made an organization for my Cookbooks: https://github.com/wildbillcat-cookbooks which is where you can find my windows fork.
Tomorrow I’ll hopefully get started implementing chef at work, with my first project this week setting up an IIS Web Farm so we can use a shared hosting environment for our applications. I also plan on experimenting with Microsoft’s web deploy to see if we can leverage chef as a part of our deployment workflow. Chef has put so much hope on the horizon I’m pretty excited about the possibilities it unlocks for our application management. Combined with the deployment pipelines in TFS we should be hitting a completely automated cloudy horizon some time this year. I look forward to seeing the contrast!
Well, my AOCMDB project is going to fall by the wayside for a while. Work has has me overwhelmed the past few months with internal changes and a lot of moving targets. I’ve implemented a new orchestration system using MS build and PowerShell for deployment automation which is very extensible, allowing for the addition of more deployment types with minimal effort. Being that it is mostly in PowerShell we can move it to an alternative build system down the road as I see Jenkins on our horizon.
It has been live for a few weeks now, on boarding applications to it has been a little bumpy but I look forward to running reports later this year to see how many more deployments we perform, along with their average deployment time. I’m still extending the number and types of deployments it can do, and am looking into integrating it with Chef, which we are also currently implementing . By this time next year I don’t think our set up will be recognizable from what it used to be, as I’ll hopefully have driven all of our cloud initiatives into production, and our application developers will be focused on newer application architectures.
Presently for work, my primary focus has been our application deployment automation and Oracle Database Automation. However I’m now focusing all of my free time on Chef, and to a lesser extent CoreOS. I’m hoping to set up a CoreOS cluster and start using docker in production as well, with our first production service being Artifactory. I’m looking at setting it up with Fleet, but I think Kubernetes will be the end state.
With these going, I’m feeling like I’m falling out of touch with the current web stack, so I decided to start developing a small web application of managing and sharing e-books. I found that Oreilly has a really nice sharing license on their eBooks (http://shop.oreilly.com/category/ebooks.do) which encourages letting my coworkers sneek peeks at my collection. Unfortunately I couldn’t find anything to moderate a private ebook collection that you could host yourself and offer community lending. This project will essentally be a bucket list of technologies I want to get up to speed on, and will hopefully serve as good instructional material in the future when the tech goes live. There’s alot of tech stacks I want to play with, so for my own reference I’m listing them here:
Essentially I’m thinking of organizing it like a gallery of eBooks, users can add their own the allow other users to “rent” them. Using Angular 2 I can make it an SPA (Or at least portions), and using epub.js I can offer a web viewer. With SignalR I can monitor connections live for maintaining connection to e-books to optimize rental leases on epub files, maintaining a timer on how long an inactive viewing lease can be. (Leaning toward 30 minutes) That said I could allow that to be set at a per book level, with just a generic default to allow users to customize. This would also enable users to take back their books by force.
I’ve been craving learning some machine learning stuff as well, so I’m thinking of trying out Apache Mahout. (http://mahout.apache.org/) Essentially it allows for an easier leveraging a lot of machine learning techniques, including leveraging Hadoop and Map Reduce. Considering the amount of data analysis we perform at work, I think in the future we could easily leverage this tech to more efficiently scale up our data crunching, as least once we have our cloud infrastructure automated.
It’s good to have my head above water again and working on my external interests. I’m excited to start the new project, although splitting my time between that, Chef and CoreOS/Docker will leave me wanting for time. But I’m excited for all of it, so hopefully I’ll make great strides!
My session on MVC 5 & Angular went pretty well. It ended up being more of a show and tell of some of my code, and then a quick demonstration of how easy it is to implement a very simple application with angular. Essentially I just tied the content of an input box to a Div, but the fact that it takes all of 3 lines of code was seemed to impress. The actual room that I do it in is quite nice, but the screen is terrible. It’s old and is a 4:3 ratio that feels like 800×600 resolution, which had me collapsing toolbars left and right. Based on the impressions I got from the meeting, I’ve decided to split it into two courses. The first one on MVC5 and EF6 to show how to get started developing web applications, since there are a large number of people that don’t have web development backgrounds. The Second one will be using Angular with SignalR in an MVC application which was the big interest from the crowd. I am hoping to make both courses oriented as a crash course to show how quickly you can get up and running using the technology to show the appeal of why one might want to use it. There is a lot of sessions I want to do for the benefit of developers, I’m thinking of doing one of event driven programming next to show how to leverage delegates to create a subscriber model. Functional Programming is also on my to do list, so I’m thinking of fiddling with both F# and Node.js to see which I think would be easier to pitch in one of these sessions.
Outside of my crusade to get our developers to make more modern applications, I’ve been working on integrating our Custom TFS workflows with Microsoft Release Management. I’ve been leveraging the Rest API and have us set up to solely be a VNext Deployment setup. To get started I made use of the release template and PowerShell script made available by Microsoft (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2014/10/10/trigger-release-from-build-with-release-management-for-visual-studio-2013-update-3.aspx) but ran into an interesting issue. The XAML by default will trigger a release regardless of whether or not the compile step succeedes, which I hadn’t thought to check before using it on a test environment. Granted since it was a test environment it’s was hardly a serious issue, but it did cause me to modify the script to detect whether or not the compile had failed before allowing it to continue. I stashed my Script here (https://github.com/wildbillcat/PowershellAutomation/blob/master/ReleaseManagment/InitiateReleaseFromBuild.ps1) for my own reference, along with anyone else should they be implementing vNext templates as well.
We have a few contractors from Incycle Technology working for us who complimented me on having our setup completely vNext, which made me feel great. In that same vein I’m thinking of scrapping my idea of setting up azure pack, and instead setting up server 2016 running Azure Stack since launching new services seems to take so long. I want to keep the configuration managment automated in some way, so I’m thinking of finally getting around to brushing up on Chef this weekend. That way I can quickly spin up and put down the new environment, so when the next version of Server actually hits RTM I can quickly spin it up and have the infosec guys start tearing it apart so I can go live as fast as possible. I also want to get up to speed on chef, as we may start leveraging that for Release Managment as an alternative to PowerShell since the RM software supports it and I’ve got my fingers crossed that our configuration management will be done with it. It’s kind of funny being a Microsoft fan lately, as more and more it seems like Microsoft is attempting to pitch itself as the new Sun Microsystems. The more Oracle closes down Java, the more Microsoft trys to position .Net as the obvious alternative. Since 5 is open sourced, I’m all for it, if something goes awry you can always defect to Node, Ruby, or Python, but all of those come with a steeper curb for a Java Dev.
A Coursera course has caught my eye on financial analysis, so I thought I’d give it a try to see if I might perhaps improve my overall knowledge of the field I am serving. (https://www.coursera.org/course/financialanalysis) It’s been a while since I’ve done something on Coursera and I’ve noticed they are now really pushing for the certificates to sell them. I’m tempted, if only because it appears to come with a capstone project to attempt to apply the knowledge which seems to be interesting. But at the same time I think saving my money for something like my Security+ certification (Likely the next certification I’ll go out for) seems more alluring, along with F# Deep Dives, published by Manning. Granted this just comes from a my frugality, if I had more cash to burn I’d likely just buy in no questions asked, as the cost is nominal. I’m the learning vein I also started a contest at work to try and promote sharing of knowledge around PowerShell since all of our technology teams use it. I am offering small 3D printed toys as prizes, with the hope that it instigates people to collaborate and share if only a little bit. I’m trying to promote using Pester, the BDD testing framework, good code commenting, and designing modular/reusable code through functions and parameters.
This week at work has been pretty crazy at work, I’ve been scrapping together our Release Management Environment to integrate it with our TFS environment. My coworker and I have come to an agreement on how we think it should be implemented, which means we might actually start getting deployments up and running inside the next month! I’ve also been doing a fair amount of programming to automate our SQL Deployments. I’ve completed the component that verifies the contents of the package to ensure nothing in there should be flagged for review, and I’m now onto the portion that does the heavy lifting.
Aside from that I’ve decided to start giving a monthly segment at work on new technologies to help improve our developer’s skill sets. I’m starting with MVC5 and Angular.js web applications with the hope that it will inspire our developers to get rid of the client footprint. Our developers have a lot of applications that use grids to view and edit information, so I’m thinking of using the MVC Grid, and then an example using NG Grid. I’m likely going to start working it up this weekend, leveraging entity framework. I’m considering trying to connect to an oracle DB, and perhaps trying to give samples with SignalR and D3.js if I can find the time. In the mean time I’ll probably whip up an azure environment to start testing with a new Git Hub Repo.
Now MS Build has also been going on which I’ve been watching. The event has been pretty cool, the highlight in my opinion being the Hololens. I can see myself living in an near empty apartment with just a bed and a couch, then building the rest of my environment virtually. Given I can just stretch a video across my wall, there’s no need for a TV. Attach photos to the walls, plants and organic videos throughout, I can have a view even in the basement. Docker and .Net VNEXT looks great for both development features and deployment, although explaining the benefits of of docker for our business use may be a battle. But paired with Azure pack, I have high hopes for our environment in the future. I look forward to catching up on MSDN and build this weekend, since there’s so much going on I can hardly process it all.
Now just to take a step back to note that where a frothing fan boy, there were a few notable thing that were also worrying. The machine learning (where technically speaking very cool) is also that sort of terrifying where statistical evaluation of habit results in what feels like a violation of privacy. Granted we all aren’t that unique, so perhaps that’s just the angst of having to admit that which inspires my discomfort. The second thing was the carrier billing across all platforms, which I’m sure will lead to all sorts of issues as kids can run up a bill without a credit card.
So it’s been a while since I’ve updated my blog, having gotten caught up with a lot of things at work and in my personal life. But having now righted the ship, I’m back on track giving bland reviews of what I’m doing with my time. In this vien I also rethought what I’m doing with this blog, and trying to actively document what my technical activities as tutorials is way to burdensome to be realistic, along with potentially condescending to anyone who reads through this looking for information, given you probably have some idea of what your doing.
So while I reboot this blog, I’ve also decided to redo one of computing environments! (So hence the title, surprise surprise.) I’ve started using Visual Studio 2015 CTP, which has been looking brilliantly, and have set up a new project (Application Oriented Configuration Management Database) to play around in it. As can been seen by my code history, I was also trying out ASP.NET 5 (MVC 6) with Entity Framework 7. Overall it looks great and similar in function, but I spend so much time on small nuances that it was overall proving unproductive considering I’m hoping to have this project be live in a production environment this year. The straw that broke the Camel’s back was my fighting with getting code migrations to work, so I scrapped it for now and moved to a classic MVC 5 with Entity Framework 6.
Presently Visual Studio 2015 itself has been great. I love the new NuGet Explorer, I will definitely be getting the developers at my workplace onto as soon as possible. Easily browsing versions, updates, etc is fantastic. This is especially useful in our enterprise environment as we run an internal NuGet feed and have many version dependent applications. Most of our developers are already irked as they are moved to NuGet in general, and making them handle things using the NuGet command line in order to get required DLL versions has been a strong adoption sticking point.
My next favorite feature has been the suggestion light bulb, which pops up everywhere. This was especially handy moving my code from MVC6/EF7 to MVC5/EF6 as it continued suggestion where I needed to change references, etc. It seems to throw more errors about references which has been somewhat perplexing, as I’ll have something appropriately referenced with NuGet, etc but it will still pop up until I rebuild a second time.
I’m about to start the install of Windows 10, so I’ll be signing off here. But before I do one thing I wanted to also note was the excellent NewHaven.IO meetup I went to on pair programming last Thursday. (http://www.meetup.com/newhavenio/events/220445501/) It was excellently run and really inspiring, even though the entire stack was ruby instead of windows. But seeing how effectively it worked for them was great, and I hope we could get similar infinitives started at AIG. My thinking as with the advent of ASP.NET 5 I can launch educational campaign at work for both new technologies and practices to get us using technologies that play nicer with DevOps deployments.
So it’s time to get started using the Lab. I assume you are using the same layout as my second post on lab creation Moving Target. My development machine is actually a Windows 7 Virtual Machine with RSAT, MMF 4.0, and Visual Studio Ultimate. Being a virtual machine isn’t actually important, I personally use Windows 8.1, but to more closely match my present work environment I wanted to make sure I was running Windows 7 so my experience would more easily translate into my professional life. One other configuration I’ll note that I didn’t realize: install your copy of visual studio onto the build controller. This gives the build controller the correct software with which to compile whatever you make, which will save you troubleshooting why it doesn’t build in the beginning.
I’ve been working on getting my web application up and running the past few days called TFSWorkItemTracker. It’s pretty cool so far, I’ve implemented SignalR with AngularJS on an MVC5 application for near real time updates on a TFS server. I’ll later be using this application for an automated IIS deployment, so that I can push this application from development to production. I’ll note that since I have more experience as a Git user, I am using git as my version control in these exercises.
Lets get started! I would tell you to head to your empty TFS server and make a new Team Project to keep our code in. But in TFS 2013 update 4 they don’t have a new button for project collections, even if you hit the gear in the top right corner to bring up the TFS administration page. Instead, you have to use Visual Studio, so let’s do just that!
Open the Team Explorer and hit the plug to manage your TFS connections: Click Servers to manage the TFS Server List: Click Add and enter the URL of your TFS server. The add server dialog will have all the default settings for TFS prefilled. If you customized the path or port number, be sure to correct it accordingly. Hit OK and Close the dialogs. Now that the connection to TFS is set up, go to File->New->Team Project… and enter a name for your Team Project and hit next. If you are following along exactly, the use TSFWorkItemTracker. I’m a Scrum fan, so I stuck with that. But you can use whatever process template works for you (or in the future we may make one.) Then select Git as your Version Control System (again to match what I am doing) and hit Finish to skip the confirmation page.
Then Visual Studio will work on fabricating your project, usually taking a few moments in my experience. If you have Sharepoint integration this could take longer. Now hit the plug to get back to the connections page: Click clone on local git repositories and enter the path to a git repo you want to work on. (I selected my own). Then click clone. Once it is done cloning, double click the project under local repositories: Click changes, then select open command line: In the command line add the TFS server to the git remotes and push the repo up onto the server.
Finally hit clone this repository and your ready to start building and deploying it. Now doing all the screenshots for all this was pretty tedious, so I think in future installments I’m going to rethink the format. Stay tuned.
So my neat little phases instead turned into a 2 Phase Project for Lab Construction, with Phase 1 containing 7 Virtual Machines, configured as follows:
No Roles (Eventually this will have the IIS role installed, however I am looking to see if using DSC and the RM Server, we can automate the configuration of the VM)
All the VMs are practically ready to go, with just Updates now running! This weekend I can start making some build definitions and configure the release management Server. I’ll document the various means of build automation, etc in the coming weeks as I come up to each one. I’m not going to bother describing step by step how to set up the lab since it’s all straight forward, but I will note that my Team Foundation Server 2013 instance has both Reporting and SharePoint disabled since they aren’t needed for continuous integration.
The Phase two I likely won’t be this weekend since this will give me a lot to work with. However I presently imagine I’ll also be looking at setting up a Chef server to use it for configuring Linux VMs with Release Management, a NuGet Server (with deployments to it automated with Release Management). There will also likely be a lot of other deployment scenarios that I’ll think of as I get further entrenched at work and start rolling up my sleeves.

Penile Enhancement requires a variety of surgery techniques to extend and broaden the penis. Penile size and penile enlargement procedure: A review. One of our prominent US individuals called him the ‘god of male organ enhancement’ after the operation. Germany is the world’s leader in male organ enlargements, with five situations as many people in the country going through the procedure than anywhere else in the world. With such an advancement, natural enlargement is certainly now ridiculously easy cheap for every solitary man on globe who wants to boost his male organ size Titan Gel www.visionapurena.com/titangelgold.
2 inches (5 cm) compared to one inch at the status of erection and when you continue on the penis enlargement exercises, you will notice a real change in the penis size after 6 months. A study reported in the Record of Sexual Medicine penis enlargement found that the average size of individuals’ flaccid penises elevated by even more than 1.5 centimeters after three a few months of utilizing a penile extender.
Vacuum pumps, or penis pumps, are sometimes utilized to deal with erectile dysfunction. However, the total results are very poor due to the irregular necrosis and reabsorption of the fat.17 This procedure has not been reported for micropenis, and it seems likely that the results penis enlargement would be just as bad. Males who experience that their male organ is usually little for their body size, or who have got been diagnosed with having a micropenis or Peyronie’s disease may end up being capable to advantage from this process.
My male organ size started at 6 in . and now I am around 8. 25 inches with slightly more girth. They state obviously that doctors can only promote the penis even more outside the body with specifically visible results in obese individuals and types with different deformities of penile epidermis where the male organ is certainly layered. For a patient having a girth enhancement surgery, having a simultaneous circumcision can improve the aesthetic appearance of girth increase.
Our experience over the last 15 years also obviously displays that the huge bulk of individuals gain an increased feeling of self-worth through penis enhancement. Mainly because significantly as I have got read, there are still no supplements penis enlargement which have been scientifically proven to increase the size of a man’s male organ. Dermal fillers possess increasingly become a well-known non-surgical choice to boost the girth of the penis https://www.practo.com/consult/pennis-size-my-age-is-23-my-pennis-size-is-14-cm-wen-erected-is-their-any-chance-of-increasing-the-size-can-u-suggest/q.
Have you been so lucky to give birth to twins? If so, you need a double baby stroller in order to take an appropriate care of your babies, don’t you think? If that’s the case, you can be sure that not only in online stores, but also in local shops you can easily find plenty of interesting products that will suit your needs.
Apart from the obvious fact that a double baby stroller is significantly bigger and weight more than a single one, there are plenty of interesting features that should be mentioned here. In fact, a double stroller is a very convenient idea, especially for parents of twins, but not only – children of fairly the same age are also likely to be carried around in a double stroller. What are the most interesting and vital features of such a device?
Moreover, most of double strollers have plenty of additional features that are very important for parents. If you’re going to buy such a product, you can expect for instance:
As you can see, there are many interesting things you should consider when purchasing a double baby stroller. Don’t forget that you’re looking for a product that will not only meet your requirements, but also ensure safety of your kids, therefore you should definitely make sure that the decision you make is sound.
Of course, a double stroller is not the only solution. If you want, you can always purchase two strollers and take your child for a walk one at a time or together with your partner. However, a double stroller seems to be a much better idea, especially if you want to be more flexible. It’s very important to mention that it’s good to invest when you want to have a comfortable life..

There is a fundamental lie at the heart of the techno-populist-utopian vision that dominates so much of 21st century Western culture.
The lie is the notion that the world would be a better place without gatekeepers. If only the most powerful information-dissemination technologies ever devised were left open to all — unregulated, uncontrolled, ungoverned by authorities who make decisions about what's acceptable and what isn't — the world would be a much more free and thriving place, the thinking goes. But for this to be true, human beings (individually but perhaps especially collectively) would need to be far more capable of exercising wise judgment than they manifestly are.
That can be difficult for individualistic, egalitarian citizens of liberal democracies to accept. We have long been taught to revere the marketplace of ideas. Let a million ideas bloom, and through competition with each other, the best will thrive and spread while the worst die out under scrutiny.
But this is not what happens in our shared digital lives. Just consider the case of Alex Jones and InfoWars.
Jones' paranoid, rage-fueled conspiracy-mongering has a large and devoted audience. His brand of maliciously false civic poison thrived when left unchecked by gatekeepers. It took Apple, Google, Facebook, Spotify, and Co. stepping in and finally banning InfoWars to stop the spread of this toxin.
This is not an example of censorship. Governments censor. Businesses make decisions about how to conduct business. The Washington Post or The New Yorker aren't engaging in censorship when they make editorial decisions about what and whom to publish. They are acting as gatekeepers controlling which authors and ideas get to appear under their name and with their imprimatur. Their (physical or digital) pages aren't public property.
Now, many people like to think of social media platforms as sort of like public property — giant billboards in a worldwide common room to which everyone has open access to post anything they want. They believe the whole point of social media is leaving behind the era of gatekeepers in favor of a digital democracy of ideas that welcomes everyone equally.
But there are actually clearly gatekeepers on social media and the mainstream internet, and long have been. If you doubt it, try posting hardcore porn on YouTube. Or uploading a podcast championing child abuse to Apple or Spotify. Or announcing an intent to engage in mass murder on Facebook. There are clear (if fairly minimal) limits and community standards on all of these platforms.
What we're seeing now is an acknowledgement from these digital giants that there need to be more of them.
This is a good thing — even if we doubt the capacity of these companies to make such judgments with perfect wisdom and fairness. Acknowledging the need for limits and standards pushes back against one of the premier delusions of our moment: that the world will be improved if the internet is left uncontrolled by any authority whatsoever.
The achievement of most good things — including moral decency, thoughtfulness, civility, knowledge, and wisdom — depend on the existence of gatekeepers imposing and upholding exacting standards. The sooner we come to recognize this reality and act on it, the better.
The reason why the marketplace of ideas often fails to function as it's supposed to is that it's based on a false (or at least overly simplified) notion of human nature and society, presuming that people are roughly equal in their cognitive and emotional capacities, and that the surrounding culture will automatically inculcate norms and habits that facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and the capacity to judge wisely.
But what if both assumptions are false? What if some people are capable of the careful, methodical weighing of evidence but others are not? What if some find it possible to live with the doubt and exigency that accompanies a life of thoughtfulness, while others gravitate out of fear and the craving for certainty to the easy answers and facile simplifications offered by charlatans and demagogues who traffic in absurdly implausible conspiracy theories?
In such a circumstance, the marketplace of ideas will begin to break down — and more fully the more free and open the market becomes, as technology provides a megaphone and a seemingly infinite audience to every would-be huckster on the planet.
President Trump's political career was launched by a racist conspiracy theory, his campaign fueled in part by support from InfoWars, his victory partly a function of the dissemination of disinformation by foreign powers out to subvert American liberal democracy. This is what happens when the dream of a marketplace of ideas has been supplanted by the nightmarish reality of a world in epistemological collapse. In such a world — our world — the loudest, most viscerally satisfying "take" often gets far more traction than the smartest one, precisely because we've lost the capacity to reach any kind of consensus about what even counts as "smart."
So yes, we could use a few more online gatekeepers — even if they do a merely mediocre job, and even if their judgments, at least at first, seem to lack consistency and legitimacy.
Knocking down authorities is always easier than setting them up. But that doesn't mean we don't need them at all.

Our imperfections are what make us perfect. The essence of one's soul, is passion. The essence of One's life is soul. Essentially: live life to the fullest, or something like that.
Since I've let this blog lapse into non-writing status again, there are two components to today's post. (Very long post ahead)! The first is a bit longer, but both of equal importance. Let's start with Kira Kitty.
As everyone knows Mr. K and I have a Siberian Forest cat named Rufio. We had originally got him, not only for companionship, but to show him and start our own cattery; breeding these amazing cats. However, after searching and searching for a suitable wife, or wives" for him we couldn't find any or the plans of this or that cat fell threw and eventually we opted to have him neutered. We've discussed still showing him, but obviously starting our own cattery is no longer an option.
In those plans, we always thought that Rufio would eventually have other feline company. He's quite the social guy and he seemed lonely at night when we had all gone to bed. We tried letting him sleep with us, but since he's still young, only 1.5 years, he is active at night. He would clean himself on the bed, bounce around the room, sit on top of Hermione's crate and try to bat her, climb the dresser, attack the curtains Etc. Basically, we weren't getting any sleep and Sir was banned from the bedroom during sleeping hours. Mr. K and I both felt bad, knowing that he just liked having company. Rufio started letting us know about his disgruntled state by destroying things. He chewed through cell phone adapter cords, Mr. K's fancy headphone cords and many other things. We thought that perhaps it was just naughty kitty behaviour, but when he chewed through the strap of one of my bras not once but twice, we decided it was time to find him a friend. The problem is that Mr. K is allergic to cats. That is why we decided on the Siberian breed in the first place.
In our researching cat breeds the first time around, we read a lot about darker cats (sometimes) producing less of the protein that most people are allergic to. We knew getting another Siberian was out of the question this time around. They are really expensive and really difficult to get a hold of. So, I looked at the local humane society to see if they had any black cats. Statistically speaking, black, or darker, animals are more difficult to adopt out and so I wasn't surprised when I found a few black cats. There was one cat in particular that caught my attention. She was described as "active" and "spicy."
We waited about a week, talking about the pros and cons. We finally decided that we would go meet her and see how allergic Mr. K was to her.
On July 31 we went to our local humane society and asked to see the kitten. There were so many beautiful and sweet cats available, it was just heart breaking. I just had to keep telling myself that we were going to try to save one and some day in the future, I'd be able to help in bigger ways. But, for now, this would have to do.
The worker went into the room and put the two cats already out back into their cage and opened Miss Kitty's door. She sprung happily out and immediately rubbed up against us. Then she was off, enthusiastically scratching the scratching post. It was like she was saying, "look. I know where I'm supposed to scratch. I'll be good. I promise."
The worker left, warning us to make sure that when we left, we snuck out without a black kitten in hot pursuit. Apparently she was quite the escape artist. She would bust out when unsuspecting people were leaving or entering the room and go off to visit the rabbits up for adoption.
We petted her while she scratched and we were both impressed at how she wasn't afraid of us. She purred, further winning us over. She had been found on a walk way in the middle of May and had been in the shelter ever since.
It had said on her bio that she needed to be spayed, but when we went back out to the front desk and told them we wanted her, they told us that she had been spayed three days prior to our arrival. This made us even more convinced.
As we stood petting her while she scratched away at the appropriate scratching object, Mr. K asked me if I wanted her. Of course I did, but I left it up to him.
He told me it was hard to tell because the room was full of cats, but he said that if he petted her and then put his hands near his face he felt fine.
We would have to take her home and see. I vowed to vaccuum every second day if that meant she could stay.
We think she's between 6 and 8 months, but it's hard to tell because she is so tiny. She is technically called a black smoke because her coat is black, but has a silver under coat. Her eyes are gold and she is so sweet. She talks a lot and is quite active; just what we wanted.
Rufio wasn't entirely sure about our decision. He hissed and growled at her the first day, but it hasn't even been a week and they are already kitty battling; friendly kitty battling, that is. They even have started sleeping ear each other, Rufio on the top step and Kira on the one below him.
We're convinced that she is mixed with some kind of purebred cat because her features aren't that of your every day domestic long hair. Her tail is hugely furry and she uses it like a fan to show off. She's a flirt. More impressively, she's not even remotely afraid of the dogs. Otis tried to battle with her like he does with Rufio, but she powder puffed him on the head, flicked her flirty tail and pranced off.
As for her escape artistry, she hasn't tried it yet. (Knock on wood). We're hoping she doesn't want to go outside now because she has so much more room here and more company.
We did have to teach her that biting isn't nice. She would get so excited that someone was petting her that she'd put her teeth on your hand. After saying "ouch" a couple of times and refraining from petting her, she's stopped biting.
So, our furry family has grown again and I vaccuum for over an hour every second day. But, Mr. K's allergies aren't really bothering him. And, that means she can stay.
As for Her Royal Highness, Princess Hermione Sophia: she's not feeling well. (This is the second part of my post. Did you remember? The first part was quite long).
We had a birthday party for me on Saturday which consisted of brunch with some great people, a romp at the beach with sed wonderful people and then a barbecue at my parents' house with more great people. My parents were at camp, so I brought all of the dogs with us. They had been alone on and off all day and so I thought they would want to come along. Plus, they're my family too. Some time between barbecued hamburgers and cake, something bit Hermione. We don't know what it was, but she yelped and jumped around. We thought nothing of it, but the next day she was not herself. She didn't even want her breakfast. She did drink water though which made me feel better. She was alert, heart rate normal, but she just laid on the chair. At dinner I managed to convinced her to eat some yogurt and cinnamon. I thought her tummy was upset and that was why she wasn't eating.
The next morning she scarfed her breakfast down and drank. She was still just lying on her chair. She would go out if I took her, but she wanted to go right back home. Her tail wagged, but her usual spunk just wasn't there. A friend could see where she had been bitten and said it didn't look infected. She at her supper and drank water all day. Her bathroom breaks were normal.
Today is day three and she's still unhappy. She's in her chair resting again. I checked her heart rate and it's normal. Her nose is wet and cold and she's responsive. It's almost breakfast time here for the dogs, so we'll see what she thinks of eating this morning. As long as she keeps eating, drinking and going to the bathroom I won't worry...well, worry too much. I'll have someone look at the bite again today just to make sure it hasn't become infected. I'm hoping with a little rest and some TLC that she'll be back to normal soon. As much as her high energy can be a bit much sometimes, you never want your dog to change and you worry when they just aren't themselves.
Welcome Kira! And I hope Hermione is feeling better soon, I know how worrisome it can be when our furry friends aren't acting like themselves.
You have stumbled upon the blog where nothing ever stays the same. Our household currently consists of 1 Leader Dog (my husband's), a Cavalier King Charles puppy named Hermione, 2 bunnies (Lola and Hamish) and 2 humans. So, grab a cup of coffee, or your drink of choice, and enjoy the crazy antics of my life. :)
Only two days after the Hail Caesar game with Matt I was back over at Kev's for another HC game. The feel is quite different as the figure size is 1/72 and two very nice armies they are and Kev and Andy have converted HC to conform to hex movement which works quite well overall.
Being as nothing is scared the UgoIgo system has been replaced with a card activation system where each brigade has two activation cards plus a Joker that allows you to choose one brigade to move again. So one turn through the deck can allow you to try to activate one brigade three times and the rest two. This can lead to some tense moments as the run of the cards can add a fair bit of drama as when one division gets activated three times out of say five cards or all your cards come out early and then you have to hold on till the deck gets a shuffle. Last night they played out well creating many a worrying moment though the last two run through's Kev's cards came out in a bunch at the start much to his discomfort.
I forgot the at start pis and after failing to activate a couple of times my Carthaginian cavalry (Numidian light horse and Gaul medium cavalry) finally got going. I was facing superior cavalry so was not planning on leaving the hill with my mediums but threw my lights into javelin range to start peppering my opposing cavalry.
Glenn our commander and owner of our troops plan was to move as far forward and as quickly as possible our light troops and start to pepper the opposing skirmishing and open order troops. Meanwhile our main troops were to remain at the halt.
I had the first success and this was to have a huge impact on my flank as Kev's Gaul cavalry was hit with two rounds of missile fire sending them shaken and retreated disordered. They went back through two other cavalry units disordering both of them. This was to slow Kev down and the Gaul's never got back in the game making the contest that bit more favourable.
View down the table, it's still early with both sides still moving towards each other. Kev was mostly moving one sometimes two moves forward with his infantry which actually played into our plan of keeping our infantry from the pitched battle till as late in the game as possible.
Revenge for Kev, I should have evaded from the charge but not wanting to go off the table I stood. I rolled poor and Kev rolled well (one of the few good rolls for Kev who really did suffer from bad dice all game). The end result was one of my light units broken.
Our skirmishers make contact and start to win the skirmish battle. Aided by my ability to roll 6 on most save throws.
Glenn broke one skirmish element and started to pick on the light infantry covering the pike facing our right hand division.
I kept moving my light cavalry back into javelin range, Kev would charge them and remove them from the front but I kept bringing them straight back and whilst Kev was rallying off some of the pips from his Kontos armed heavies I was always able to keep some hits on them. Whilst my cavalry remained on the hill they would be difficult to shift but Kev was not able to do enough damage on my lights and Gaul's to get a better chance of winning the melee.
My biggest set back was one light infantry unit becoming shaken and disordered but overall our light infantry and skirmishes were getting the best of the early battle and driving the Seleucid skirmish line away from the troops allowing us to start working on the main battle line,
Glenn had a couple of great results and Kev had no luck that saw his pike blocks becoming disordered which set them in place for awhile and of course the casualties were starting to creep up. However our decision to remain near our starting locations meant that Kev would be able to get his house in order though by this point he only had his bow skirmishers left to mask his pike and they were unable to hold back our missile troops.
Kev's view was somewhat different to ours. The cavalry choke point does look tougher for him with a long trip behind the woods to get at our rear. Success would have meant I would be forced to move two to three units to block a route into my rear which may have weakened me enough for a drive on my infantry division. Failure would have really stretched his defence as I would have more space to exploit the victory.
In the centre evidence of the skirmish battle with most of his missile troops pushed back and disordered. The scythed chariot waiting for a chance to be unmasked and charge hard into my Gaul infantry but the battle lines were remaining tight.
Not many casualties but the disorder was stopping forward movement which in turn slowed down his advance in the centre. This of course gives us yet more time to keep up the missile fire.
I finally lose a second light cavalry unit which in turn allows Kev to start hammering my left hand medium cavalry unit though I was able to rally some off whilst keeping the Kontos armed cavalry under a similar number of casualties so that Kev was not confident of winning the combat.
Finally the pike close on my 2nd division but Kev's own skirmishers left in forward positions were now in his way. More time, more missile fire and just past my division the fire from Glenn finally separated a medium infantry unit from it's supports.
Just to the right of the round commander base is the rear support of Glenn's first charge, the target has not a single support whilst Glenn got rear and one flank support but his other flank being disordered are unable to help. Not that he needed it as he smashed the unit again aided by our run of good dice whilst Kev remained staunch despite terrible dice, not managing to do more than dint the attacking unit slightly.
The Iberian Celt's remain fast on the hill but once they started to move they would surge over the empty space to confront the now thinning battle line.
Energised by his previous success Glenn threw in a heavy punch in the centre with both flanks and rear support against a unit that had taken just two pips of damage. This time he would have help, a unit of Celt's and two elephants. The bad news is that all three of these supports only give two dice each whilst Glenn not only had more dice in the attack but also was one pip better on his to hits and saves. To add insult to injury he threw his general in as well (my suggestion). The loss was bad, real bad with a difference of 6 casualties the only way the loser could save themselves from breaking was boxcars! The result of course WAS double six and their reward was to be pushed back disordered with his supports. Happy for us it was the expected result that of Kev being pushed back as failed to get even one hit!
Before Kev could do anything to try and rescue the situation, Glenn gets another activation and not even double six could save him as the unit was shattered and then all three supports failed their tests to leave a big hole and broken division. Worse still his follow up was to turn to his flank and smash into the nearest pike phalanx flank.
Whilst he was not able to get my light infantry in to support his charge he still had rear and one flank support. This was a repeat of what happened to me a couple of weeks before so I knew exactly what was to follow. The only consolation for Kev was that it was not supported by any other unit and sure enough it was broken leaving a second division close to being broken and facing attacks on both flanks.
Positions at the end of the game down the line. It looks like their is still two lines facing off against each other but just past the pikes in the centre is a gap in the Seleucid line filled by our troops ready to turn towards the flanks and drive along the lines as well as burst into the rear.
Hats off to Kev has he did take a pounding that was made possible by lousy missile shots on his part that when they did get through were past far more often than deserved and then the mother of bad rolls in close combat but took it on the chin and battled on.
Not that is was all down to Kev's dice, that just made it a sure thing. Glenn had a good opening plan and despite a slight wobble early when he wanted to move forward stuck to it. All that said it was Glenn's taking advantage of that isolated units position with a quick and nasty attack that then allowed the follow on attack and the sudden collapse.
A very nice report with beautiful pictures, elephants and chariot are most impressive, as well as the cavalry charges...
The hexes board pieces are from Kallistra but the flocking of them was done by Kev and Andy. Shows how good they can look

Indicates that this moniker is a relative moniker, such as an item moniker. This moniker must be composed with the moniker of its container before a relative path can be determined.
A relative moniker is analogous to a relative path (such as "..\backup"). For example, suppose you have one moniker that represents the path "c:\projects\secret\art\pict1.bmp" and another moniker that represents the path "c:\projects\secret\docs\chap1.txt." Calling IMoniker::RelativePathTo on the first moniker, passing the second one as the pmkOther parameter, would create a relative moniker representing the path "..\docs\chap1.txt."
Moniker clients typically do not need to call IMoniker::RelativePathTo. This method is primarily called by the default handler for linked objects. Linked objects contain both an absolute and a relative moniker to identify the link source (this enables link tracking if the user moves a directory tree containing both the container and source files). The default handler calls this method to create a relative moniker from the container document to the link source (that is, it calls IMoniker::RelativePathTo on the moniker identifying the container document, passing the moniker identifying the link source as the pmkOther parameter).
The first step in determining a relative path is determining the common prefix of this moniker and pmkOther. The next step is to break this moniker and pmkOther into two parts each, say (P, myTail) and (P, otherTail) respectively, where P is the common prefix. The correct relative path is then the inverse of myTail composed with otherTail:
Note that for certain types of monikers, you cannot use your IMoniker::Inverse method to construct the inverse of myTail. For example, a file moniker returns an anti-moniker as an inverse, while its IMoniker::RelativePathTo method must use one or more file monikers that each represent the path ".." to construct the inverse of myTail.

I have a XO-1, running kernel 2.6.31_xo. I wish to enable/disable the root access (currently, the root access is enabled).
The normal process of changing the root password using "passwd" doesn't seem to work. If it is tried, the 'olpc' user is able to switch to root, without being asked for the password. The approach works in the "standard" fc14 kernel, though.
Do this carefully, obviously, as if you loose root access, you'll be out of luck until you perform a USB clean install (and this only if you have already received the developer key).

Argentina can resume business with country export credit agencies, following Paris Club deal — MercoPress
Navy withheld British minisub offer to find ARA San Juan, Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Aguad admits
“The financing means funds for infrastructure, development, technology and for the future of all Argentines”
Argentine president Cristina Fernandez praised on Thursday the agreement reached with Paris Club creditors and said that the government will now turn to international credit markets to finance “infrastructure, development, and technology.”
“It is a very important day for Argentina, with the Paris Club agreement over the debt and the invitation to the BRICS summit in Brazil,” the President tweeted today.
“The financing that we will obtain will not be spent –as it has been in past decades- on the great financial casino,” she stated, “Funds for infrastructure, development, technology and for the future of all Argentines.”
The President also tweeted about Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavorv’s formal invitation to Argentina to attend BRICS summit to be held in Brazil in July and specified that the bloc represents 25% of the global GDP and 43% of the world’s population.
“Let me tell you. The BRICS are: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Yesterday, our country was invited to its summit in July,” she wrote. “Our country, not this President, not for tea and scones as some very, very, very small headlines seem to suggest.”
The fact is that granting some breathing room to Argentina, the Paris Club agreement calls for a first installment of at least 1.15 billion dollars due by May 2015, followed by another payment within a year.
The group said the deal cleared the way for export credit agencies of its members to resume doing business with Argentina, which should ease making foreign investment in the country.
Buenos Aires has been eager to secure a deal that does not put too much strain on its balance of payments. Argentine central bank reserves stood at 28.6 billion as of Monday evening.
Argentina and Paris Club members came close to striking a deal in 2008 but the government pulled out at the last moment, concerned about its falling foreign exchange reserves in the midst of the global financial crisis.
Argentina wrung a major concession from the Paris Club by avoiding any International Monetary Fund involvement in the deal, which the creditor group usually requires.
The country's history with the informal group of mostly Western nations goes back to the Paris Club's origins in 1956, when Argentina agreed to meet its public creditors in Paris.
What happened to the isolationist movement? We don't pay our debts and you can't make us. We don't need anything from any foreign country.
Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said the EU’s agricultural representative had called him by telephone and that they are due to meet to discuss the issue.
He also confirmed he had been in contact with the heads of the two meat producers involved in the scandal, JBS (beef and pork) and BRF (poultry).
The EU and Mercosur bloc are set to press on with negotiations on a massive trade deal and ”this situation really complicates negotiations”.
European Union has insisted Brazilian representatives attend an emergency meeting to explain themselves regarding a scandal involving rotten meat and the country’s two largest exporters, JBS and BRF. Brazil has already announced that the 22 plants (out of over 4.000) allegedly involved in the scam have been closed.
Brazilian Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi told national media that the EU’s agricultural representative had called him by telephone and that they are due to meet to discuss the issue. He also confirmed he had been in contact with the heads of the two meat producers involved in the scandal, JBS (beef and pork) and BRF (poultry).
The EU and Mercosur bloc are set to press on with negotiations, currently in Buenos Aires, on a massive trade deal and Brazil is naturally concerned that this scandal could jeopardize those talks. A foreign ministry representative admitted that “it really complicates negotiations”.
”This problem affects and will affect everyone. I do not know what the consequences will be but we are going to have problems and we will have to work hard in order to minimize their impact. We have a robust, rigid system that is validated by our international buyers but it fails when people are corrupted and that is regrettable,” Blairo Maggi explained.
Brazil, one of the world’s largest food producers, was rocked by a police operation on last Friday where it was revealed that large meat producers had bribed health inspectors to certify tainted food as safe for human consumption.
“The Commission will ensure that any of the establishments implicated in the fraud are suspended from exporting to the EU,” a spokesman for the European Commission told a regular press briefing.
The executive added that the meat scandal would have no impact on negotiations currently under way between the EU and Mercosur, in which the two sides hope to reach agreements on free trade.
Brazil is the globe’s largest exporter of beef and chicken and fourth in terms of pork sales. Exports of these products made up 7.6% of its trade in 2016 and topped US$11.6 billion, with the EU its main trading partner.
“What the federal police’s investigation shows is that a crime has been committed against the Brazilian people, which merits being punished to the fullest extent possible,” said a communication from the minister, who cut short a ten-day-long sick leave to deal with the situation.
Maggi insisted that “a lot of action has already been implemented in order to correct distortions and stamp and corruption”, adding that “new measures will now be taken”. The minister concluded that a “zero tolerance” approach would be taken.
Former Tory Party leader William Hague has issued a blunt warning to Cabinet Brexiteers not to push their demands for a clean break with the European Union too far. Ahead of crunch Cabinet talks at Chequers on Friday, Lord Hague said Parliament could force a “watered-down” Brexit on the Government if ministers fail to agree a compromise plan on Britain’s future customs relationship with the EU.
Lord Hague has become the latest senior Conservative to intervene within the party about how the UK should manage its withdrawal from the European Union. Writing in the Daly Telegraph, the former foreign secretary warned that disunity over Brexit could hand power to Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party.
Lord Hague has compared Brexit to taking control of a gun, saying it is possible to find a solution without using it to “shoot your foot off”. The former Conservative leader said he believes there is sufficient common ground among the different political parties to negotiate with the EU.
Philip Hammond has been backed by former Tory leader Lord Hague amid ongoing Cabinet tensions about the approach to Brexit. The ex-foreign secretary said the Chancellor deserves credit for pushing for a transitional deal which preserves close ties to Brussels, giving time for a new trading relationship to be established and avoiding turning Brexit into a disaster.
Brexit will “undoubtedly” harm the UK’s ability to work with other EU countries on foreign issues and its influence in the world, warns former Conservative foreign affairs minister William Hague, including protection of the Falkland Islands, and ensuring solidarity among 28 countries.
Prime Minister Theresa May should call an early general election, former Tory leader Lord Hague has urged. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Hague said bringing forward the next election could help the UK secure a better deal in Brexit negotiations.
Former British Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Monday that he is stepping down as a member of Parliament, just months after leaving 10 Downing Street. Cameron, a member of the Conservative Party, stepped down as prime minister in July after the United Kingdom voted in a June referendum to leave the European Union, saying the country needed new leadership.
Lord Hague warns Brexit could put at risk Falklands' sovereignty and cautions about UK disintegration
Former foreign secretary William Hague said that if Britain votes to leave the European Union, the Falkland Islands sovereignty could be put at risk, while Gibraltar would left in a very difficult position. The statement was published this week by The Telegraph in an article under the heading: Brexit would put the Falkland Islands' sovereignty at risk
Brexit campaigners have hit out at former foreign secretary William Hague after he claimed the Falkland Islands could fall to Argentina if the UK votes to quit the EU. In comments rubbished as scaremongering by Leave campaigners, Mr. Hague warned of an uncertain future for Falkland Islanders.
By William Hague - Among the most inspiring experiences of my time in politics was meeting people who, in spite of great pressure to the contrary, chose to be British.

Why, hello there, Dear Reader. Fancy meeting you here. I know I've been away a while, so let me do some 'splainin...
1. My dad is dying of cancer. Big deal, you think, everybody's dying of something. Well, fuck you, this is MY dad I'm talking about, not some random homeless person. He's in Stage 4 of renal cell carcinoma, and after a decade of being in remission, the cancer came back hard core last fall and is pretty much kicking my dad's ass. My mom is out on FMLA leave, and we're down to counting the weeks, if not days, Daddy will still be with us. Needless to say, I haven't been very motivated to do anything, much less paint my nails, which is a bitch because I really, really want to make this blog successful. I've been spending the days in between my graduate classes at my parents' house, and I've brought nail polish with me, but when I get up there, I have to do so much caretaking that I just don't have time to paint my nails.
2. I have a shit ton of research to do this semester. I am determined to finish my TESOL master's program in May so I can finally get a job. I've been unemployed for more than three years now due to budget cuts (who needs a history teacher who can't coach?), and I'm about to go crazy with boredom and guilt that I'm not contributing financially and relying totally on my husband.
3. I seriously need to clean the apartment. We are living in the smallest place I've ever lived in, and I brought decades of accumulated crap into my marriage, crap that is threatening to take over our 950 square feet of living space -- and this is after some SERIOUS reduction in the amount of junk I own. I've gotten rid of 99% of my paper scrapbooking and crafty junk, as well as lots of old holiday decorations. I even donated more than half the books I used to own, but I've still got way too much shit. Part of me wants to throw it all away, but then another part is like, That's just stupid because the stuff you've got left is education-related junk you can use if you ever get another teaching job. Rajiv (my husband) says trash it and promises to buy new stuff if/when I need it, but it's hard to just get rid of hundreds of dollars worth of ancillary teaching materials, as well as materials I created during my seven years in the classroom.
So, those are the top three reasons my poor little blog is being neglected. I do have some new nail polish stuff to share with you (awesome eBay haul, Spoiled glitter swatches, nail strips that actually work), but they'll have to wait a few more days.
:( you take all the time you need to care for your dad, nail polish blog can wait..there are more important things for now...
Sorry to hear about your Dad Tonya, I hope he stays a comfortable as possible in his time left with you and your family. 2012 has also been challenging for me with 2 deaths in the family so far, I figure it can only get better and wish the same for you also xoxoxoxox
I don't know who created this list, but it's been going around the web since fall 2011. Thanks for the great ideas!

Attorney, Author and Researcher William Ramsey is a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in History. Mr. Ramsey also has a J.D. and is a member of the State Bar of California. He has written Prophet of Evil: Aleister Crowley, 9/11 and the New World Order, Abomination: Devil Worship and Deception in the West Memphis Three Murders and Children of the Beast: Aleister Crowleys Shadow Over Humanity. William Ramsey has also made two documentaries—Occult Hollywood, vol.1 and Prophet of Evil: Aleister Crowley, 9/11 and the New World Order.
William is here today to talk about his new documentary: “The Smiley Face Killers: Who is abducting, torturing and murdering college-aged men in the US and UK?”
Daniel and William dive deep into the mystery behind the Smiley face killers. We learn that this unique form of serial killer targets gay men in BDSM settings, night clubs, bars and dating apps. The killer tortures, possibly or sometimes raping the victim. Daniel asks if there is a Satanic link to these murders which William answers that there is most likely.
They then move on to other topics such as 9-11 symbolism, those who predicted it would happen and what numbers you see surrounding these events. The topic of Alex Jones is introduced.
Daniel comes back from break ready to rage. He explains why the show was on such a long hiatus and proceeds to give his unique insights on current affairs. Daniel reads some great listener emails and gives some excellent advice. He then explains why exactly he stopped being a Republican and supporting Trump.
-Creator of ‘Legend of Sonnen’s War’ photoshopped graphic novel series, (greatest MMA fan art eva ;)
Masato asks Daniel about his past as well as his thoughts on the entire Illuminati conspiracy and End of Days. We learn things about Daniel that many have been wondering for a long time. We learn that Daniel actually grew up in a “Revelations Christian Cult” that he later broke away from. Masato asks Daniel about the Mark of the Beast and where this is all headed which Daniel is more than happy to answer in this exciting two hour interview with the creator and host of End of Days Radio.
Daniel comes back from break full of rage and covers everything happening around the world such as the events in Gaza, Sweden and in the very streets of America.
Karen Christine Patrick and Bret Colin Sheppard are here on End of Days Radio to talk about a slew of topics, mainly the upcoming Mars Anomaly Conference September 7th-9th held in the Historic Murray Hotel, Silver City, New Mexico.
Karen is an ET contactee and Psychic who was recruited for a special psychic program for children. Bret is an ET contactee and researcher into Mars and moon anomalies. Both however are experts in many paranormal topics which they discuss in this episode with Daniel.
Daniel asks them about their respective pasts, Aliens, Demons, Telepathy, Telekinesis, NASA lying, The Illuminati, Ingo Swan, The Annunaki and much more. We come to find that indeed just about everything NASA puts out is completely fake but that does not necessarily make the earth flat either.
Daniel comes back from break, discusses the social media ban of Alex Jones, fighting in the streets of Portland, reads a very heartfelt email from a listener, gives a movie review and then goes on to explain why Trump is not actually fighting the Deep state or Illuminati.
Alexandrous is a simple countryboy, with an unquenchable thirst, and hunger for wisdom, and knowledge. His curiosity is as boundless as imagination incarnate. As an INFJ, He deeply cares about others, and wishes to use his gifts to help the world in any and all ways He can, while maintaining his anonymity, as fame, and fortune will only impede this effort.
Daniel begins by asking Alexandrous about his military background which turns into a quite fascinating discussion about the military. Alexandrous talks about how he spoke out against something happening to a friend and things became very heated for him. He explains how the military can seem worse than it is due to bad leadership at the top. Daniel asks him what he thinks of women being in the Marines or special forces which Alexandrous provides and interesting answer for.
They then begin talking about the cabal, the enviroment, Jesus Christ, Moses, Chimerism and much much more! This is an exciting two hour discussion between Daniel and a very unique individual who is committed to bringing about a new renaissance for human kind!
Gregory Lessing Garrett joins End of Days Radio for an exciting third interview. Greg is the author of the Scientism Delusion which is one of the hottest new truth books around due to its cutting edge perspective on the Luciferian elite and their manipulation of the world. The book covers how many things considered scientific are actually anything but, what they are, are occult doctrines being pushed on society.
In the first interview Greg laid out the basics of the deception, in the second we looked into the future at the coming New World Order anti-christ and how the Alien Deception will be a catalyst. In this third interview Daniel and Greg actually talk about Christ himself quite a bit. Daniel explains how he was fooled into believing that Jesus was not an actual historical figure which Greg responds to by explaining that things were similar for him. Greg explains how he bought into the New Age psychedelic deception as he experimented with things like DMT and shrooms only to wind up feeling empty eventually. There is actually a moral to this story as it mirrors the garden of Eden and the apple that was offered to man. It seems that we are always chasing secrets and never finding them before our lives run out.
Daniel asks Greg if he ever saw anything Supernatural while on psychedelics. Greg explains a very unique and troubling vision he had of an entire ocean of rotting skeletons begging for his help. Daniel wonders if this all is meant to be as both him and Greg have been getting a lot of very positive feedback since the first two interviews happened. Daniel then asks Greg if they really do plan to kill us and if he would ever write a book about Christ himself.
Daniel comes back and talks about protesting, Jesus being a historical figure, Whoopi Goldberg, blood moons and reads a very touching message from a listener.

Brainlabs to help Vodafone to take digital media-buying in-house Brainlabs has won a brief to help Vodafone to take its digital media-buying in-house globally. The London-based performance agency is expected to act as a consultant to Vodafone on an on-going basis. Campaign revealed last month how Vodafone was taking two-thirds of its digital media-buying in-house , instead of using its existing media agency, Wavemaker. The telecom giant is recruiting its own biddable media teams in all its major markets, including the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and India, to handle search, social and programmatic. However, industry experts said at the time that they thought Vodafone was likely to seek external advice given the scale of the task. Vodafone spends about £200m a year, or about one third of its estimated £600m media budget, on digital advertising. The brand is thought to be taking direct responsibility for in the region of £140m of that digital media investment, which has been handled by Wavemaker, a subsidiary of WPP, until now. Vodafone confirmed the involvement of Brainlabs and Adform, an ad tech company which provides ad-serving technology for digital media-buying, but declined to comment. A Brainlabs spokesman said: "Vodafone is currently in-housing its digital media and Brainlabs can confirm we are providing consultancy services on various aspects of this process." Daniel Gilbert, the chief executive of Brainlabs, founded the digital agency in 2012 after he previously worked at Google. According to Brainlabs’ website, it offers advice on technology, strategy, automation and training to in-house teams as well as more typical agency services such as search, social and programmatic buying. Wavemaker continues to handle the rest of Vodafone’s media-buying and is helping with the "transition" of biddable media to the in-house team.

Well, it has taken me a few days but I must blog about our Saturday. Let me begin by saying that Kenny is back in school and taking 2 classes, so between work and school, Jess and I don't see him a great deal. Saturday he had to spend the day, first working around the house on things he felt he had neglected and then locked in his office studying!!!! So Jess and I just spent the day together. We played around the house most of the morning, cleaning and doing laundry in between then after lunch we headed up to the last home softball game. We have been to many of these last home games before but this one has a very special meaning...Samantha played her last softball game at GCS. I have blogged about Samantha before so I won't go into a long speech, but she is very special and has been very special to Jessica-so we wanted to be there. I can't believe that she is getting ready to graduate (I know it won't be for 8 more months-but you all know how time flies!) and go to college. She had a super game and they won both of the games that puts them into the state playoffs!!!! Go Lady Generals...you are way ahead of the Braves, this year!!! The pictures are of the Sr. girls and their parents. Thanks Samantha for sharing the day with us and for all you do for us!
trying to pull it at home for several days and it just did not want to come out! So at the game on Saturday, Jessica's Aunt KA-KA pulled her tooth. No tears, very little blood and it was out!!!! Is it little wonder why Karen and Jessica have bonded so well...Ka-Ka is always there when Jess needs her! Thanks, again Karen!
One more thing...while we were at the game we were sitting in the shade with a small group that included Audrey, Avie and Amelia-part of the time! So as Audrey and Avie were relaxing in the shade-Avie sat up by her self. Well, Audrey propped her but Avie "held her own". We got a picture of that, too. GOOD JOB, AVIE! And good luck in October with your surgery-We love you!!!!
Well, I think that about takes care of Saturday. It was a beautiful day and we enjoyed getting to see ALL the exciting things that happened! We did miss Louise and Leigh being here-BECAUSE THEY DID SAY THEY WERE COMING!!!!!! But we will get over that in a few days! Hope you all had a good week-end. Maybe your football team is doing like Kenny's Sooners, of course we can't all be #1 like OU but don't you think the Vols could at least get an SEC win?????! But I have to say that Saturday was topped off by a great victory from OLE MISS!!!!
I always heard the older you get, the faster time goes by...I must be getting old! Ten years ago I met, fell in love and married Kenny. It is hard for me to believe that it has been 10 years. We have been through alot but most of our life together has been wonderful. Kenny is a great father-I knew that before Jessica by just watching him with his boys. He works hard so that we have everything that we need and more and so that I don't have to work full-time outside the house! Kenny is a great husband and friend, too. We enjoy spending time together and I can't imagine my life without him now!!!
Jessica loved just playing in the water. She splashed and rolled and "dunked" herself and tried to "dunk" anyone that got close to her, usually me!
Here is one of the dolphins that came by to visit. No pictures of Jessica with the dolphins, because if I had turned her loose she would still be swimming with the dolphins-probably somewhere in China!!:)
On Sept. 11, we had a benefit dinner in downtown Atlanta for RTV. Following the dinner, Kenny's sister and brother-in-law went up the the restaurant to visit for a few minutes. Long story - short--I decided that Jessica and I would go to meet them at Hilton Head for the next week. We already knew that Kenny couldn't go and Jess couldn't stay with him because of his school and work schedule. So Sunday afternoon, we had gotten up early Sun and gone to Tallahassee for church, Kenny's mom, Jessica and I headed to Hilton Head. It took us just over 4 hours to get there and we had a great day for traveling...and I have to add that Jessica was beautiful!!! She usually is a good traveler but you know how they can make liers out of you!!!
We got to the house and began to relax!! It was so nice. A friend of Chris' let him use the house for the last 3 summers for a week! It has 3 bedrooms and 3 baths, kitchen, living room, sun porch and a boardwalk right down to the beach! Jessica had a BLAST! She took to the water, just like her pool!!! We did not even leave the house until Tuesday afternoon! Went out and did some shopping and out for dinner. It was so nice just to be able to completely relax! Thanks to my sister, Karen, for getting a sub for the sub, we were able to stay over until Friday-we had originally planned on coming home on Wed.
On Thursday evening Toni got a call from her 19 year old daughter. Her dad, Toni's X, had been taken to hospice and they were not sure he was going to make it. He had been sick and we had all been "sitting on pins and needles" wondering how long he COULD last! Toni and Chris got up Friday morning and left for Atlanta as we left for Valdosta. Tom did make it until this morning at around 5. Please keep Abbe in your prayers, as this has been a very difficult time for her.
We returned home on Friday and Kenny and I had a rehearsal dinner for a wedding he was performing on Sat. Saturday morning I got up and went to a "Ladies' Day" at Forrest Park and got home just in time to get ready for the wedding! It was pretty but I was glad when it was all over! I sure don't really enjoy busy week-ends-I like to just lay around and catch up on laundry and cleaning!

For a while the world has been hearing ominous reports about China extending its military power over the South China Sea and threatening Taiwan. By comparison we hear little about life inside China. But this week Freedom House, an independent think tank in Washington, has published The Battle for China’s Spirit, an extensive and convincing report containing dire news about religious freedom, or the lack of it, under the current regime.
Freedom House’s investigators have concluded that controls over religion in China have been increasing since 2012, seeping into new areas of daily life and triggering growing resistance from believers. At least 100 million people — nearly one-third of estimated believers in China — belong to four religious groups facing high levels of persecution: Protestant Christians, Tibetan Buddhists, Uighur Muslims and Falun Gong.
In one paragraph Freedom House sprinkles a few facts about recent developments: “Tibetan monks are forced to learn reinterpretations of Buddhist doctrine during a ‘patriotic re-education’ session. Dozens of Christians are barred from celebrating Christmas together. A Uighur Muslim farmer is sentenced to nine years in prison for praying in a field. And a 45-year-old father in northeastern China dies in custody days after being detained for practising Falun Gong.”
The Freedom House report says that Falun Gong is still heavily persecuted. Why should it be? It’s a spiritual movement that depends on meditation and constant moral self-searching. When it surfaced in the early 1990s, Chinese officialdom seemed to like it. By the late 1990s, however, the Communist Party saw it as a threat.
When it reached 70 million practitioners it began looking like a force independent of the state. Beijing, like any tyranny, cannot tolerate a competitor. It started a cruel, heartless campaign of propaganda, re-education, imprisonment and torture to eradicate Falun Gong. Hundreds of thousands (maybe a million) practitioners were sent to labour camps where many died (2,000, it is said) and many remain.
The constitution of China provides freedom of religion, with one crucial stipulation: Those taking advantage of this freedom must do so in the course of “normal religious activity.” The government, of course, defines “normal,” which means that congregations worship within state-sanctioned religious organizations in duly registered places of worship.
In the accepted opinion of Beijing, religion is potentially destabilizing, especially in a nation with half a dozen popular religions and many lesser forms of belief. The freedom in the constitution turns out to be the government’s freedom to supervise religion so that it makes as little trouble as possible.
Preaching to potential converts is allowed only in private, or in registered houses of worship. There are many “house churches,” where religious services take place in defiance of occasional harassment.
The Beijing bureau of religious affairs may favour one organization over another for the sake of national unity, even if both share the same beliefs and the same name.
Hui Muslims, for example, are much better treated than Uyghurs, who are also Muslims. The Hui can build mosques and pass on their beliefs to their children through their own schools; after secondary school, the young can study under an imam.
The Uyghurs are not given any such privileges. They are watched constantly by the authorities, and sometimes harassed. Most of them live in China’s western Xinjiang province, where they are 8-million of the province’s 19-million people. Xinjiang is bordered by eight countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Many Uyghurs hope to separate from China, if necessary through violence.
The Hui, on the other hand, see China as their home and rarely cause trouble. They fit within the state-run Islamic Association of China, which oversees the practice of Islam and regulates the content of sermons and scripture. Hui Muslims employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan, unlike Uyghurs in the same jobs. Hui women can wear veils, a practice discouraged for Uyghur women.
The spectre of mandatory atheism has hung over China since 1949, when the revolution brought to power the Communist Party and its rule that party members must not practice any religion. The Cultural Revolution, from 1966 till 1976, was also a bitter period of suppression for believers. Tradition-hating mobs destroyed thousands of monasteries, churches and mosques. But Deng Xiaoping’s time in power, from 1978 until his retirement in 1989, brought relative tolerance. While opening China to the world economy, Deng relaxed tensions between the state and the various religions.
Under Deng, Christianity experienced a resurgence. By 2011, about 60 million Chinese were said to be practising as Protestants or Catholics. The Catholics are divided between the state-run Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA) and the Vatican-approved version, with more of the latter than the former. The Patriotic Association’s chairman says its members should “fervently love the socialist motherland.”
Freedom House dates the current wave of oppression from the beginning of Xi Jinping’s first five-year term in November, 2012. (He is expected to be given a second term this autumn.) Xi is sometimes compared to Deng Xiaoping. Like Deng, he knows how to control the party but he’s so far failed to rejuvenate the nation, as he promised to do.
He’s intensified censorship, increasing the paranoia of everyone who disagrees with him or his circle of supporters. And he’s reduced religious freedom, reminding the population every day that there is only one centre of power in China.

In Los Angeles, a city where people come to escape, shield secrets, and bury their pasts, we follow this mysterious outbreak as it threatens to disrupt what little stability high school guidance counselor Madison Clark and English teacher Travis Manawa have managed to assemble. The pressure of blending two families while dealing with resentful, escapist, and strung out children takes a back seat when society begins to break down. A forced evolution, and survival of the fittest takes hold, as our dysfunctional family finds they must either reinvent themselves or embrace their darker histories.

We normally think of nature as thriving most where the flora is thickest. But even in the barren, unbreakable worlds of ice and snow, creatures of all kinds survive.
Because of staggeringly low temperatures, tree growth is significantly hindered in polar biomes. The subsoil of tundra is choked by cold, left permanently frozen. The life adapted for this environment is as tough as it gets with incredible biological tools to suit them to the unforgiving environment. The polar bear’s incredible nose allows it to locate the breathing holes of seals. Reindeer have developed thick hooves to battle predatory grey wolves. In the antarctic, penguins have adapted their vestigial wings into flippers, soaring through the water as an eagle would through the air.
It might be a while north (or south) before you can see these creatures, but don’t let the absence of polar bears or penguins in Wisconsin leave you frosty. We’ll thaw our imaginations and let the games begin! Learn about the frosty animals of the world in a whole new way. It will be “tundra” of fun!
Take me out to the bat game. Take me out to the cave. Buy me some bat homes and places to hang- upside down; I’ll be sporting some fangs. Come knock this topic right out of the park! You won’t care if you ever get back. Go bats!
Inhale the wonders of winter. Smell the mysteries of the cold and frozen land. Winter will come alive as we explore nature and breathe in the fresh surprises. I “nose” you’ll get a lungful of exciting discoveries! Be sure to come back spring, summer, and fall; we’ll compare nature through the seasons and our noses.

It’s been a bit of a slow week around the homestead, at least outside. Inside I have been drying some herbs, both oregano and mint. It might be better to air dry these both outside, but I prefer to use the dehydrator on low (around 95 degrees) because it is consistent. When things are dried outside I have to keep a closer eye on them to ensure pests aren’t getting into the items I am drying, and I have to watch for the rain. I don’t have either of those worries inside.
The oregano I am drying is a nice, strong, True Greek Oregano, whereas the mint is Chocolate Mint (my favorite), Orange Mint, and Spearmint. There is something special, I think, about herbs that have been dried at home. I don’t know whether it is simply knowing where they come from, or if there is a quality difference (I am sure of that, btw), but I sure do like it.
The plants I started last week are all doing well though. I am so hopeful that the sweet potatoes take off and grow well. My biggest concern is the deer. Once they find these plants, they will certainly eat the leaves off of them. They always do. I probably need to get a covering for them as soon as I can to try and keep that risk down a little. I may put the tomato cages over them temporarily until I can get something more appropriate.
I am a little surprised that the brassicas I planted early in the spring haven’t all bolted yet. They are in a part of the yard that gets afternoon shade, so it may be that this is enough to keep them from bolting, but it is also enough to keep them from growing like I want to see them grow. Even so, I don’t mind the plants taking their time as long as they don’t bolt. 🙂
Since I originally wrote this, last week, I have successfully finished drying the mint and the oregano. Today I plan to put Feverfew on the dehydrator.
Perhaps the item of most interest this week is that some of the winter sown plants have just been happily living in their milk jugs since winter. My oldest son has been wanting to plant some things, so I showed him where to move them yesterday. That means I now have Skullcap, German Chamomile, and two types of Echinacea in my raised flower bed. Woot! Here, let me share a picture or two:
As I have said in a previous post, I am not planting my garden in full this year. I decided to only plant those things which were already ordered (sweet potatoes and herbs) and some things I had already planted before deciding this (corn, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and garlic). So even though I am not doing a lot this year compared to previous years, I am still planting quite a bit. This weekend I needed to plant some sweet potato slips that arrived a couple of weeks ago, as well as Goldenseal plants.
I must have ordered more sweet potatoes than I remember ordering. I planted 45 slips, 15 each of Beauregard, O’Henry, and Purple Passion. Those are orange, white, and purple sweet potatoes, respectively. Oh, you didn’t know there were different colored sweet potatoes? Yep, and while they taste similar, they do not taste exactly the same. I find the purple sweet potatoes to be more dry and a little less sweet, while the white sweet potatoes are more mild, and actually make a pretty good white potato substitute. Here is a picture of one of the slips I planted:
The garlic is coming along nicely, and it won’t be too long until it is ready to harvest. It is not all that is doing well though – the mint is growing like wildfire this year. Check out these pictures:
Work and a special photography project I have been working on have kept me busy enough lately that there hasn’t been too much activity from me around the homestead outside of the chickens (more on that tomorrow), but some things of note have happened.
Cicadas! Wow, these things came out in force this past week! I don’t ever recall seeing so many that they were on car tires, grass blades, small plants, and anything else they could latch onto. Wow, this is a bumper crop this year. 😀
Sweet Potatoes – despite not putting much of a garden out this year, I am putting out sweet potato slips. They arrive this past week, and I neglected to get them out over the weekend. I’ll try to do that Tuesday of this week. This year I have purple, white, and orange. Hopefully some will grow this time.
Volunteers – Again, despite not putting out a garden this year, the leftover seeds in the compost had a different idea. We have at least three volunteer tomatoes growing that we will let continue to grow.
Grass – We have a buch of grass peeking its head through our new woodchip covering on our garden. Time to move the chicken pen to let them take care of it.
Finally, I ran across a good article about Ten Things We Can Learn From Old Homesteads. I really liked this list. Is there anything you would add?
It is October 20 and we still haven’t had our first frost. In fact, there is not one in sight, though that could change tomorrow. The average first frost of the year is normally October 17 here, so it isn’t as if we are breaking new ground with a late frost, but it still feels as if we should have already had one.
Due to the weather outlook still looking like it will stay above freezing with no frost in sight for the next week, I have chosen to leave my super-hot peppers in the ground another week. I am still getting about 3-5 ripe Carolina Reapers a week, and there are probably a dozen or more that could still ripen, so I plan to leave them in the ground as long as I can. I am also going to pot my two Pineapple Sage plants as well, though I don’t have the room in the house to let them continue to bloom, so I am leaving them in the ground as long as possible too.
The work this weekend consisted of pulling up most of the tomato plants, which have really given out already, though they were still full of green tomatoes. Even if they had ripened in time, they sure don’t taste like a summer tomato. I did leave a few cherry tomato plants, as those are still palatable. Once I was done with that, I planted three new types of garlic: Purple Glazer, Duganski, and Mount Hood. Let me share a few pictures:
I have traditionally planted my garlic in my raised Square Foot Garden beds – wait, that is not true. I have planted as much in the ground each year as I have the raised beds, but all of this new garlic has been planted in the ground. I am hopeful that I have picked a location where the garlic will get plenty of sun in the spring and early summer. Here’s a pic of the planting:
Though some say the garlic needs to be a couple of inches deep, I have always just put mine right below the surface and then ensured there was adequate ground cover to protect it from cold weather. I suppose I might regret this if we have a bitter cold winter, but it hasn’t failed me yet.
The one last harvest I look forward to this year is the sweet potatoes. This is a new crop for me, last year being the first year I attempted to grow it, to no success. This year I have changed things up a bit, and I am hoping to have a nice crop of them to harvest after the first frost.
I think that has covered the happenings of the week, but don’t miss out on tomorrow’s post on the chickens – you will be surprised!
One of my favorite things to do, usually, is walk through the garden in the morning. I love the cool of the morning, the dew on the ground, and the quiet. It is a real source of enjoyment for me. However, I do NOT like walking through the garden at 7:00 AM when the humidity is high and the temperature is already warm. Unfortunately, that happens sometimes, and Saturday was no exception. I knew I had some work to do in the garden, and I was so hoping for a cool morning, but alas, that was not to be.
The tomatoes seem to be on their last leg now. The plants are looking quite haggard, and the tomatoes themselves are not even as appealing. In fact, the chickens were able to dine on several of them today.
The corn is getting most of my attention this year, and today I harvested several ears I hope pop well, as I would love to get their coloration worked prominently into the popcorn seed. Let me show you four of them:
I am confident this one has some glass-gem corn mixed in with it, and I like it. I love the greens – they are a rare treat in my seed stock.
More flame-licked colors. This one looks a lot like some seed stock I saved last year, which I am sure is what has pollinated all of these. I sure hope this pops well.
Look at that last picture a little closer. See the red kernel just to the right of the middle? See the spots? I wonder what they are. If you look at the one below it, the purple one, it has the same spots. Even so, these kernels are things of beauty!
Believe it or not, we have a winter squash plant that is growing like gangbusters! I doubt anything will come from it, as it has yet to set fruit, but it was a late starter, and it happens to be the only winter squash I have that survived the squash bugs and squash vine borers. I sure would love to get some seed stock from it.
Sweet potatoes are a new crop for me, and even though I grew some last year, I cannot remember for the life of me when to harvest them. I think it may be after the first frost, but I need to look it up. I am so hopeful that I have a good crop of sweet potatoes. I grew purple and white sweet potatoes, which taste very similar, though the purple ones are generally more dry. Even so, I enjoy them.
Usually at this time of year I am not yet thinking about next year, but it sure is on my mind this year. I think it is because I didn’t do such a good job getting the garden out on time this year, and I am hoping to redeem myself a little next year. 🙂 It won’t be long until I start planning. Until then, I have a few other projects I am working on which I will be sharing here, including a homemade smoker and a homemade dehydrator.

Nongjiale rural tourism: surrounding rural tourism of Changchun and Jilin cities, and suburban and rural fruit farms within the province
The Nepalese Army has urged one and all not to doubt on the completion of the Kathmandu-Tarai/Madhes Fast-track Project, a project of national pride and strategic importance, in the stipulated time.
Chief of the Fast-track Project and Lieutenant General Yogendra Bahadur Khand claimed at a news conference at the Army Headquarters here today that the Army was capable of completing the project within the deadline provided there is constructive cooperation and goodwill from all quarters, no matter how challenging it might be from the technical aspect.
Stating that the works like levelling the hills and mounds and filling up soil in the ditches were being carried out expeditiously in line with the road demarcation, he said the project works have been forwarded on the basis of work plan and schedule.
It was also shared on the occasion that the Nepalese Army was working on the project taking the trust of the government and the people that the Army can complete the works fast and at low cost while maintaining the quality as an opportunity to create history.
A Korean consultant, Soosong Consultants, has been selected for preparing the detailed project report of the Fast-track.
Lieutenant General Khand said that an agreement for the construction of the project would be signed with the company within this month and the DPR would be ready in four months of the signing of the agreement.
The DPR would be prepared at an estimated cost of about Rs 101.5 million. It is believed that the 76-kilometre fast track will link Kathmandu with the Tarai geographically and emotionally.
The total stretch has been divided into 10 sections and works are being done through 28 contractors.
The Nepalese Army has built 1,114 kilometres of roads and 29 bridges in various parts of the country. The Army is currently constructing 526 kilometres of roads including the Fast-track.
Butwal-Province No 5 is ranked fourth in view of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contribution, the central bank said.
According to a report released by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the contribution of the province 5 in the national GDP is 17.5 per cent. It is said that the report was prepared after conducting province-level GDP and per capita income of the fiscal year 2017/18 on the basis of overall human development report-2014.
Releasing the report in Butwal on Sunday, Executive Director of the Nepal Rastra Bank Nar Bahadur Thapa said that province no 5 is in the fourth position as per the annual capita income.
Per capita income of the province is 868 US dollar. However, the report shows that the province is in the forefront in view of access to commercial banks. Out of 109 local levels in the province, 106 local levels have access to commercial banks.
As per the data, province no 5 has contributed 16.9 per cent in the country’s agriculture sector, 10.4 per cent in the industrial output and 11.7 per cent in service sector. The province has 15.5 per cent of the country’s total population.

Located in Dongcheng District of Beijing, Yuhe River was built for water transport of grain to the capital in 1291. It was called Tonghui River during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and then renamed to Yuhe River from Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The river gradually dried up in the decades after 1918 and it was completely buried in 1956. In 2005, the Yuhe River protection project was formally approved as one of the pilot projects of protecting cultural relics in Beijing.
In 2009, the Dongcheng District completed the first phase of the project. It restored a part of the Yuhe River which runs 480 meters from the east of Di’anmen Bridge, along the south side of Maoer Hutong, Dongbuyaqiao Hutong and Di’anmen East Street, and finally to Ping’an Street with a width of 18 meters and depth of one meter.
In 2014, the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal was included in the list of World Cultural Heritages. At that time, the second phase of the project was launched to restore the Yuhe River from Ping’an Street to Beiheyan Street with a total length of 600 meters. Considering the river was too deep and few cultural relics were found, the project staff landfilled the river and built landscape parks on the river instead of recovering its original appearance.
Recently, a “water diversion across the street” project has been approved to allow the water of the river restored by the first phase of the Yuhe River protection project to flow into the river of the second phase of the project so as to connect the south and north parts of the Yuhe River by water.
The project is likely to have some difficulties in construction as it involves the subway Line 6 under Ping’an Street and the cultural relic of Chengqing sluice on the north side, and the project is expected to start in spring and complete in the summer of 2018.
After the project, the south and north parts of Yuhe River will be connected to form a one-kilometer-long landscape water system, which can fully revive the beautiful scenery of “water flowing across streets” in Beijing 700 years ago.

The Student Loan “Debt Bomb”: With Student Loan Debt Out of Control, What Can Bankruptcy (and Congress) Do to Help? | Wartchow Law
The Student Loan “Debt Bomb”: With Student Loan Debt Out of Control, What Can Bankruptcy (and Congress) Do to Help?
A new financial catastrophe is facing Americans, and it’s quickly becoming America’s latest and greatest “debt bomb”. According to the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys in August 2014, there are 7 million Americans in default on over $100 million in student loan debt, and the total student loan debt carried by Americans (defaulted and non-defaulted) is an enormous $1.2 trillion. To put this confounding figure into context, $1.2 trillion dollars is equivalent to 1,200 billion dollars, or over a million million dollars. $1.2 trillion is enough to buy a new Prius for about half of all American households, or to pay Congress’s salaries for over 11,000 years.
To measure the extent of the student loan crisis on Americans, simply compare this $1.2 trillion in federal and private student loan debt to the total $1.3 trillion in toxic subprime mortgages that coincided with America’s most recent recession. The foreclosure crisis of the 2000s has now (and almost dollar-for-dollar) been replaced by this decade’s student loan crisis.
Currently there is nearly nothing that filing bankruptcy will do to cauterize the student loan crisis. But a wave of change is on the horizon.
As recently as ten years ago and prior to the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, most private student loan debt was dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding. However for the past ten years, debtors have found no relief for their student loan debt in bankruptcy: bankruptcy will not even discharge late fees or reversed-amortized interest due on accrued interest, which can have the effect of doubling the amount due on a defaulted student loan. In a penalizing twist of fate, chapter 13 debtors can emerge from a 5-year chapter 13 plan actually owing as much as twice more on their student loans than when they first filed chapter 13.
U.S. Congress is presently considering reform to higher education legislation, including possible relief for private student loan* debt in bankruptcy. The suggested student loan bankruptcy reforms include fast-track discharge for private student loans in cases of death or permanent disability, discharge where the private lender has failed to offer the borrower deferment and forbearance options, discharge of private student loans that carry unreasonably high interest rates, and discharge of both federal and private student loans which are granted from institutions having high drop out and default rates (i.e., many for-profit institutions that target low-income students and where success is measured by profit rather than graduation rates).
To date, Congress has done nothing to meaningfully address bankruptcy reform as the student loan crisis continues to drive generations of Americans into widespread default with no avenue for even a moderate relief in the form of restructure of student loan interest rates, late fees or accrued interest.
*Private student loans are not funded by the federal government, which means these loans are obtained directly from banks, credit unions, schools and other market lenders at usually higher interest rates that compare to credit cards. Unlike federal loans, private student loans cannot be consolidated, often require a co-signer and may require payments due while the student is still in school. Critically unlike federal loans, private student loans may not offer forbearance or deferment in situations of medical or financial hardship.
Received a Form 1099-C on Foreclosed Home? You May Qualify for the Mortgage Forgiveness Exclusion to Cancellation of Debt Income.
If you receive a Form 1099-C reporting ‘debt cancellation’ income after a home foreclosure, you may qualify for the Mortgage Forgiveness exclusion. As if the distress of home foreclosure isn’t enough, homeowners may receive a Form 1099-C from their former mortgage lender reporting the deficiency owed as income to the homeowner. The income reported on the Form 1099-C is what’s referred to as “Cancellation of Debt Income” or “Discharge of Indebtedness Income”, both of which generally must be reported as taxable income on an individual’s Form 1040 federal and state tax returns. When the 1099 relates to foreclosed real estate, the amount of cancelled debt can be significant and can consequently result in a substantial increase in tax liability for that year, loss of tax refunds or even additional tax liabilities owed to the IRS and Minnesota Department of Revenue.
For a more detailed discussion on tax debt and other tax resolution issues, be sure to read Wartchow Law’s Tax Blog.
Typically, cancellation of debt is an income realization event that must be reported on one’s tax returns. The idea is that any amount of principal or interest that a person legally owes but does not have to repay is considered taxable income in the year that such debt is cancelled. As an illustration, if you owe a commercial lender $15,000 between interest and principal due on a loan but that creditor agrees to accept $5,000 and cancel the other $10,000 in satisfaction of the full amount, that creditor is required by federal law to issue an IRS Form 1099-C, which reports the $10,000 cancelled debt as taxable income to you. Depending on the circumstances, the amount reported on Form 1099 must be included as personal income unless a statutory exclusion applies. Most of the IRS’s income exclusions are conditioned upon insolvency of the taxpayer—i.e., total debts exceed total fair market value of all assets—however bankruptcy is not necessarily required to qualify under certain IRS insolvency exclusions. Even in the absence of insolvency, a homeowner may still qualify for the Mortgage Forgiveness exclusion.
The Mortgage Forgiveness exclusion is provided under the Mortgage Debt Relief Act of 2007, which allows most taxpayers to exclude 1099 income resulting from the discharge of debt on their principal residence. The key to qualifying for this exclusion is that the debt must have been incurred to buy, build or substantially improve your principal residence and the debt must have been secured by your principal residence. Most traditional mortgages on homestead properties would meet this criteria. Currently, the Mortgage Debt Relief Act only applies through 2012, after which it may be extended by additional act of Congress.
When an individual files for bankruptcy, Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code automatically excludes any debt that was discharged in the bankruptcy from taxable income. This is why consumer debtors who receive a discharge in a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding rarely receive a 1099 regarding any of the discharged debts (and if you do, you should talk to your tax preparer about your options to dispute the 1099).

1.0, the dictation solution for screen reader users created by and for the community. Building on a modest goal shared by three people in three wildly divergent timezones communicating by email as far back as 2011 all the way through the success of a community fundraiser in
2016 and its resultant two-year development and testing process, and with encouragement from the community, the talented members of the DictationBridge team have been working hard to deliver a dictation solution that will meet the needs of many and open up opportunities for millions more blind people around the world.
DictationBridge is a fully featured add-on for the world’s two most commonly used screen readers. Serving as a gateway between you, the NVDA and/or Jaws screen readers and either Dragon Naturally Speaking or Windows Speech Recognition, DictationBridge will change how you work with computers using voice recognition.
The following is a list of the features that our team thinks are most important, but please remember this is a very partial list of the entire package. The complete list of features can be found by reading through Champion White Keds Original Canvas Black Women gBTqW7nxT6 and we’re certain you will find many of the other features and details compelling too.
We’ve received some user feedback indicating that alternative formats for the DictationBridge documentation are needed. Click here to get the documentation in HTML as a zip file, suitable for use in Voice Dream Reader. Other formats will be added as requested.
The following are key highlights of DictationBridge that the team who created it feel are most important:
DictationBridge works with both NVDA and Jaws, affording the DictationBridge team the privilege of serving 78.5% of the screen reading community with a dictation solution that can be freely learned from, freely distributed, and either used as-is or modified to meet the computing needs of a single end-user or a group of end-users. Prior to DictationBridge, NVDA users had no accessible way to control either Windows Speech Recognition or the Dragon line of products from Nuance and now they have access to both.
Furthermore, Jaws users had no accessible way to control Windows Speech Recognition, and they had only one solution for controlling Dragon. Now they have not only a solution for controling Windows Speech Recognition, but they also have a solution for Dragon which they can freely learn from, freely distribute, and either use as-is or modify to meet their needs.
Gray Solid Sandals Lace Toe Open CCALP014814 Heels VogueZone009 Up Kitten Suede Women Imitated DictationBridge does not change your screen reader setup in any way unrelated to dictation. If you install an NVDA or JAWS update, it will not effect the version of DictationBridge designed for your screen reader and DictationBridge will in turn not change any plug-ins or scripts, including the defaults when you install it. With DictationBridge, there’s no more waiting for your dictation support to catch up with the latest version of your screen reader and there’s no potential for DictationBridge to accidentally insert bugs into the default behavior of your Screen Reader of choice.
DictationBridge is the first ever dictation solution for screen readers to include an extensive collection of verbal commands that users can employ to control their screen reader and do various other tasks with the Dragon line of products from Nuance, as well as with Windows Speech Recognition. The DictationBridge team designed this part of the package to make it very easy to add new commands and to modify those that we provide. It even supports navigating the entire web with only speech!
DictationBridge, NVDA and Windows Speech Recognition are all available at no cost to end-users, their educators, their employers, governments or anyone else.
Care has been taken while developing DictationBridge to ensure that it can be easily translated into languages other than English. This affords DictationBridge the possibility to be translated into any of the 35 languages supported by Windows Speech Recognition, and any of the more than 43 languages supported by NVDA which correspond with those supported by Windows Speech Recognition. Whether you’re dictating in a language other than English, or whether your entire Windows interface is in a language other than English, you’ll be able to use DictationBridge in your preferred language once there is a translation available for it, without maintaining separate software licenses for your screen reader to cover non-English interfaces. We believe all blind people, no matter where they live or what language they speak natively should have access to the software they need and DictationBridge is a part of that overall goal.
Because DictationBridge is free, libre open source software (FLOSS), it is not only available gratis to all who care to use it, DictationBridge affords the community the freedom to add to, modify, learn from, repurpose or do anything else they care to do with the software moving forward. People with programming skills can look at the source code as it currently stands for both the Jaws and NVDA versions, along with the DictationBridge core code, by browsing to this GitHub user profile and selecting the appropriate repository. DictationBridge provides true freedom with a lower case “f.”
Documentation is just as important as the software itself. You will find DictationBridge’s documentation to be among the highest quality available you’ve ever read.
Finally, the DictationBridge team recognizes that it is often necessary for screen reader users to use more than one screen reader throughout a day’s computer use. Consequently, DictationBridge is capable of handing off its functionality between screen readers, provided you have both the NVDA and Jaws versions installed.
You can download DictationBridge for either Jaws or NVDA, or both, by using one of the following links:
Gray Open Imitated Women Lace Sandals CCALP014814 Suede Solid Toe VogueZone009 Heels Kitten Up The Humans Who Made DictationBridge Possible
We ask that readers congratulate the three people who started this project as without them, it would have never happened. Pranav Lal has handled almost all of the day to day management of this project and has been helping carry it on his back since day one. Lucy Greco has been the project spokesperson from the beginning and has fought harder for the DB users than anyone else on the team; simply put, DictationBridge is a profoundly better software package because of Lucy’s determination. Last but not at all least is Amanda Rush, she’s a WordPress consultant who has had to put up with demands about our site from literally every other member of the team for more than a year and a half at this point. These three people are why and to a large extent how we were able to bring DictationBridge to the public.
Chris Hofstader played an invaluable role by championing the DictationBridge project itself, as well as the idea that the blind community should be in a position to control its own technological destiny, of which the DictationBridge project is a part. Matt Campbell has led the engineering team from the beginning and brought his tremendous low level Windows hacking skills to the project. , Mallory Van Achterberg handled most of the day to day management of the crowdfunding effort and without her diligence, we would have never made our goal. Derek Riemer joined the team late in the game, took over the NVDA scripting tasks and the software grew better by leaps and bounds with his contributions both in writing code and providing advice to the rest of the team. Sean Pharaoh joined the team when the JAWS version was floundering and has contributed to the common core code shared by both NVDA and JAWS. Tim Burgess carried the Jaws scripts to the finish line, making it possible for the DictationBridge project’s Jaws version to see the light of day. Erin Lauridsen (now of San Francisco Lighthouse) was our original documentation leader and got the ball rolling and Joseph Lee joined the documentation team and took over its leadership making the DictationBridge documentation as good as any we’ve ever read in the blindness space. Patrick Kelly, Sue Martin, Austin Hicks, Tyler Spivey and Bryan Smart all made contributions that helped bring this software to our community. Finally, we would like to recognize The Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired of San Francisco, or what the rest of us call San Francisco Lighthouse. SFL gave us our largest single contribution funding 25% of our goal, Lucy Greco announced the launch of the project at a Lighthouse Labs meeting in 2016, Erin Lauridsen, now Director of Access Technology at SFL, led our documentation team before leaving us to take on this terrific new job and everyone around SFL has been tremendously supportive of our efforts throughout this long journey.
DictationBridge has been a long time coming, and has been a labor of love on the part of every member of this team. Every one of us believes that the blind community ought to have a say in how its technological needs and wants are met, that every screen reader should be able to choose between solutions even if they make choices we wouldn’t prefer they make, and that neither access to finances nor country of residence nor spoken language should be determining factors in the technological choices blind people make for themselves. DictationBridge joins projects like NVDA and its community of add-ons as one more stepping stone toward the goal of shaping our own technological destinies, and opens the door for Jaws users to join the NVDA community on this journey by way of freely modifiable and freely distributable code for their preferred screen reader.
If you’re interested in coming along for the ride with us, join the DictationBridge discussion list and download DictationBridge for your screen reader of choice from the links above, and share it with your friends, and let’s keep the revolution going.

The following are key highlights of DictationBridge for NVDA that the team who created it feel are most important:
Dictationbridge for NVDA (obviously) works with NVDA, the screen reader commonly used by more than 40%of Windows screen reader users worldwide. Prior to DictationBridge, NVDA users had no accessible way to control either Windows Speech Recognition or the Dragon line of products from Nuance and now they have access to both.
DictationBridge for NVDA and its soon to be public JAWS sibling do not change your screen reader setup in any way unrelated to dictation. If you install an NVDA or JAWS update, it will not effect the version of DictationBridge designed for your screen reader and DictationBridge will in turn not change any plug-ins or scripts, including the defaults when you install it. With DictationBridge, there’s no more waiting for your dictation support to catch up with the latest version of your screen reader and there’s no potential for DictationBridge to accidentally insert bugs into the default behavior of your Screen Reader of choice.
DictationBridge for both NVDA and JAWS provide all of the features a user would expect in a fully featured dictation plug-in or set of scripts and configurations. DictationBridge echoes back the text you’ve dictated, it provides access to the user interface for both Windows Speech Recognition and the entire line of Dragon products and includes a full sweet of other cool features you can read about [in New Sneaker Black Lining Cole Techni up Kenneth Cole New York 37 Year 5 Lace Chinese Kam Women q68SnZ.
DictationBridge for NVDA is the first ever dictation solution for screen readers to include an extensive collection of verbal commands that users can employ to control their screen reader and do various other tasks with the Dragon line of products from Nuance, as well as with Windows Speech Recognition. The DictationBridge team designed this part of the package to make it very easy to add new commands and to modify those that we provide. It even supports navigating the entire web with only speech!
Because DictationBridge is free, libre open source software (FLOSS), it is not only available gratis to all who care to use it, DictationBridge affords the community the freedom to add to, modify, learn from, repurpose or do anything else they care to do with the software moving forward.

Kitten Toe Women Solid Suede Lace Open Gray CCALP014814 Imitated VogueZone009 Heels Up Sandals Some Kudos To Our Team
Matt Campbell has led the engineering team from the beginning and brought his tremendous low level Windows hacking skills to the project. , Mallory Van Achterberg handled most of the day to day management of the crowdfunding effort and without her diligence, we would have never made our goal. Derek Riemer joined the team late in the game, took over the NVDA scripting tasks and the software grew better by leaps and bounds with his contributions both in writing code and providing advice to the rest of the team. Sean Pharaoh joined the team when the JAWS version was floundering and has contributed to the common core code shared by both NVDA and JAWS as well as writing the scripts for the latter. Erin Lauridsen (now of San Francisco Lighthouse) was our original documentation leader and got the ball rolling and Joseph Lee joined the documentation team and took over its leadership making the DictationBridge documentation as good as any we’ve ever read in the blindness space. Patrick Kelly, Sue Martin, Austin Hicks, Tyler Spivey and Bryan Smart all made contributions that helped bring this software to our community. Finally, we would like to recognize The Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired of San Francisco, or what the rest of us call San Francisco Lighthouse. SFL gave us our largest single contribution funding 25% of our goal, Lucy Greco announced the launch of the project at a Lighthouse Labs meeting in 2016, Erin Lauridsen, now Director of Access Technology at SFL, led our documentation team before leaving us to take on this terrific new job and everyone around SFL has been tremendously supportive of our efforts throughout this long journey.
This is the release candidate for DictationBridge for NVDA version 1.0. A number of our team members plan on continuing to work on future versions of DictationBridge, to add even more new features and to ensure its compatibility with the Windows operating system and updates to the dictation utilities from Nuance and Microsoft. The $20,000 we raised to do DB 1.0 has been exhausted so we will be trying to raise money to do DictationBridge 1.1 and 2.0 versions and would certainly appreciate a contribution of any sum.
More than money, though, we need people who are interested in joining the team to help out in any number of ways. The first and most obvious thing you can do is to download the RC1, give it a try and please report any bugs you find so we can turn this from an RC into a full release.
At this time, the DictationBridge spoken commands for Dragon Pro will only work with Dragon versions 15 and higher. The team is exploring whether we can get them working with Dragon 13 and 14 but are uncertain if we will be able to get this done before final release. We recommend users upgrade to the latest version of Dragon Pro for use with DictationBridge in the future.
Over the two years that have passed since DictationBridge was an idea to it becoming actual software, we’ve had a number of personnel changes and a few of the key team members have moved onto new full time jobs so won’t be available to work on the next versions of DictationBridge. Thus, if you’re interested in helping writing/debugging C++ code, Python NVDA plug-in code, helping with documentation, helping with translations, testing the software, writing up new feature ideas, helping out as an informal tech support person on DictationBridge’s mailing list, learning tips and tricks of low level Windows hacking or nearly anything else that contributes to a software development project, please write to us and we’ll find you something to do. With your help, we can widen the dictation gateway that is DictationBridge, your screen reader, and dictation software.
We urge you to join the ever growing family of NVDA activists, help DictationBridge move into the future and help the community of blind people take control of our own technology destinies. By helping DictationBridge or any other NVDA related project, you are helping yourself, you are helping the tens of thousands of other NVDA users and you are helping the community take control of what is now only in the hands of a few primarily sighted gatekeepers. Please, join this movement and enjoy the true freedom it will afford you and the entire community of blind people worldwide. And last but not least, please download and test DictationBridge, and tell your friends.

Our team is still working hard on bringing you access to JAWS and Window-eyes access and will be rolling that out shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to download the beta and try it with your favorite speech recognition package. This beta works with Microsoft speech recognition and Dragon NaturallySpeaking. Please be sure to let us know what you think and stay tuned for our next public beta and final products.
Please see below for your own copy of the beta and our product release notes. Thank you once again for your patience and support in our crowdfunding campaign and development of this free software.
A verbal notification of the microphone status when using Dragon. WSR has this feature built-in therefore no support needs to be created.
When you dictate into any application with either Dragon or WSR running, dictationBridge will speak the text that has been recognized by either engine if the NVDA screen reader is active. There are no additional settings that have to be done. The functionality works out of the box. If you want to disable echo back, then disable the dictationBridge addon.
Position the cursor on the word you want to correct. Once your cursor is positioned, say “spell”. A floating window will come up on the screen. This window is invisible to NVDA and other screen readers. NVDA will read out the choices. You then say “choose” followed by the number of that choice; for example, if you wanted to select the fourth choice, you will say “choose 4”.
It is possible to execute any script in NVDA. This is done by sending the script name to dictationBridge which in turn sends it to NVDA. So, you can say “speak focus” to have NVDA say the contents of the keyboard focus. There are over 70 commands that have been added for Dragon. Commands for WSR have not yet been written. These commands, in the background execute NVDA scripts that have keyboard shortcuts assigned to them. These scripts are present in NVDA 2016.3. These script names should be the same with earlier versions of NVDA. To get this feature to work, you need to add the dictationBridge folder to the system path. Instructions for doing this will be included in the installation section.
It is important to know if the microphone is active or not when using speech-recognition. This avoids the transcribing of unwanted text into your document. DictationBridge will now speak the status of the microphone as it is changed when using Dragon. WSR already indicates this status and there are distinct sounds mapped by default to microphone status changes.
It is possible to control NVDA by speaking voice commands from dragon. The commands should have been imported into your user profile. If this has not happened, please see the section on importing them. These commands map to the majority of NVDA features giving you complete hands free control of this program. You can then use native Dragon commands as well to control other programs such as the Windows desktop, note pad and Microsoft Word.
This version of dictationBridge like the ones before is a NVDA addon. To install it, do the following.
Launch NVDA. Ensure that you are running an installed copy of NVDA. This addon has not been tested in a portable version of NVDA.
Once dictationBridge is installed, you will have an item in the tools menu called “Add Commands.” Activate this menu item and follow the prompts. It is crucial that you have already exported your commands that you want to import. These commands should be exported as XML files for this feature to work. If you have exported them as dat files, use the manual import feature from the Dragon command browser. You can do the same for XML commands.
Hit ctrl+i, set the file type to XML and navigate to where you have saved the dictationBridgeCommands.xml file and highlight it.
In Dragon version 15, you will be asked if you want to validate the commands. Agree to do this to ensure that the XML file is valid.
After this procedure, it is crucial to have the following dynamic link libraries (DLLs) in the system path.
There are a few options you need to configure in Dragon so that it works optimally when using a screen reader. You should make these changes immediately after creating your user profile.
Go to the Tools menu in the dragon bar and then to the Options menu item and activate it. This is a large multi-page dialogue and we need to change a few settings here. In Dragon 15, you will be unable to tab to the names of the property sheets in the dialogue. Use ctrl+tab to move forward to the next property sheet and ctrl+shift+tab to move backward to the previous property sheet.
On the Corrections tab, enable the options “Correct commands bring up Spelling Window” and “Spell commands bring up Spelling Window”
The Dragon vocabulary editor is not usable as the list of words is not read by NVDA. We are waiting for the NVDA team to fix certain items before we can support this feature.
The training dialogue in Dragon is not fully supported. We are working on supporting this dialogue and hope to bring out this feature soon.
The word “New paragraph” may be heard in various situations. Please report when this occurs as we are actively tracking this issue.
Certain features such as the invoking of the WSR corrections dialogue may not work on versions of Windows that are set to a language other than English. This is because we have had to use English specific names to interact with portions of Dragon. We are working on enabling translations and hope to allow translators for your language to fix this problem soon.
You should submit all bugs using the dictationBridge issue tracker. There are 3 components into which dictationBridge is split:
In order to file a bug report, you will first need to ensure that you have a Github account. When you navigate to one of the issue trackers above, Github will ask you to either sign in or create an account. If you have not done so already, create a Github account. Once this is done, you can sign in and file your bug report on the appropriate tracker.
There is no accurate way to determine this without testing and seeing the code but here are a few general rules.
3. If you are a developer and fancy cracking open a debugger, join the party and file bugs in the core.
Send a message with the word “subscribe” without the quotes in the subject line to the subscription address.

This piece intends to describe the current state of DictationBridge, what we’ve accomplished thus far and what we still need to do.
As per the schedule we published when we launched the DB crowdfunding project, we did the work to get the combination of Spanish Heeled Sandal The Red Katy Women Tabitha Perry 7Y1I1q with Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) running first. We are happy to report that this task is feature complete and are happy to share the software with anyone who requests a copy. There may be some bugs in the software which we will fix if and when they are reported to us but, as of this writing, NVDA with WSR is considered complete.

In addition to scripting the Dragon user interface, the DB team is currently in process of creating scripts for Dragon Pro to permit users to issue screen reader commands by voice when using DictationBridge. We are working on a unified vocabulary so the same commands will do the same things with all three of the screen readers we’re supporting and progress on this task has been relatively swift. The DB team released the first set of Dragon Pro scripts to the beta team this past week and we’re eagerly awaiting feedback.
As the NVDA scripting effort is nearing completion, we will soon be starting the scripting to support the other screen readers. We elected to do NVDA first in order that we had a functioning prototype on which to model the experience users will enjoy with DB with the other screen access utilities. Once the NVDA version of DB is completed, we expect the scripts for Window-Eyes, ZTF and JAWS to come along rapidly.
We do have one feature on which we’ve not started working yet. This will either play a sound or provide some speech feedback when the user issues a Dragon or WSR command like “scratch that.” The current beta provides no feedback when a user issues such a command and the software will be nicer to use when this feature is completed and included in DictationBridge.
Prior to writing this update, we took a look at the last few articles published on this site. Unfortunately, we discovered that at least one of the older articles uses the term “ZoomText” to describe one of our target access technologies. In fact, we are not supporting ZoomText itself but, rather, we will be supporting Skechers Gauze Sport Gentle Microsburst Women Navy OZarO, a package that combines Window-Eyes and the popular ZoomText magnification package. We are sorry for any confusion this may have caused the readers.
The DictationBridge team is working very hard to get this important piece of software delivered to the public. We are always looking for more help testing the software so, if you would like to be added to our beta team, please send us an email at this address.
Last week, the DictationBridge Indie Go-Go campaign reached its entire $20,000 goal with about 8 hours left in a 60 day fundraising effort.
The DictationBridge team had 12 “official” members but the true story of our success is about the 130 separate contributors and the dozens upon dozens of individuals who helped tell the DictationBridge story on Twitter, Facebook, on blogs and on podcasts. Our entire team is incredibly grateful to all of those who helped us make history with this campaign.
The single largest contribution to the DictationBridge campaign came to us from The Lighthouse For The Blind and Visually Impaired of San Francisco. As far as we can tell, this is the first time that a well established blindness oriented organization has participated in an effort like this one. Our entire team thanks the San Francisco Lighthouse, Brian Bashin, Josh Miele, Jennison Asuncion, Scott Blanks, and others at the Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired for they’re hugely helpful contributions to this campaign.
The DictationBridge publicity effort started at the Lighthouse in San Francisco when Josh invited Lucy Greco, a founding member of the DictationBridge team, to do a presentation about it at their Lighthouse Labs meeting a few weeks before the campaign went live. Throughout our 60 days of fundraising, we enjoyed receiving advice and encouragement from our friends at the SF Lighthouse and, in a big but unofficial manner, we have felt that the San Francisco Lighthouse has been part of the team since the beginning.
A crowdfunding project is largely an exercise in storytelling and getting the message to as many people as possible. If you look at the @DictationBridge Twitter timeline, you will undoubtedly see the names of a lot of individuals who took it upon themselves to help us promote our Indie Go-Go campaign.
We can’t list everyone by name but we are grateful to everyone who helped with as little as a single tweet or sent out DictationBridge related information frequently during the fundraising period. We’re grateful to all contributors, whether they donated five bucks or five thousand and we’re all feeling warmed by the outpouring of affection this campaign has received from the community.
We would, however, like to specifically thank Sandra Pilz and Paul Warner for giving us valuable feedback on our messaging and social media tactics. Sandra and Paul took it upon themselves to help coach us in this area and both were critical to our success. We’d also like to thank Jessie Lorenz, executive director of Independent Living Resource Center San Francisco, for her timely input on marketing and storytelling.
We express our deep appreciation to all of those who invited DictationBridge members to appear on their podcasts, to present at their events and to mention the project on their blogs. Without all of this public exposure, we’d have never made the goal and, as a result, those blind people who need dictation support but choose to (or must) use a screen reader other than JAWS or simply cannot afford the expensive current solutions would not be getting a free program that they desperately need.
DictationBridge, before it even had a name, began when Pranav Lal, Lucy Greco and Amanda Rush started working together to discuss making a free plug-in for NVDA to support dictation features. For Lucy and Pranav, dictation is not an option but, rather, an essential aspect of their computing experience.
Due to having multiple disabilities, many blind people (including some on the DictationBridge team) cannot type with any sense of efficiency or without experiencing a great deal of pain. The primary goal of the DB effort from day one has been to provide an affordable solution to as many of these people as possible. Thus, the war veteran who returns home with neither the use of hands nor eyes will have a computer they can use affordably, a blind person with bad repetitive strain injuries (RSI) now has a free solution and those blind people without a secondary disability have dictation at no extra cost to themselves.
In July, Chris Hofstader joined the team to take over the executive role on the effort. Together, Pranav, Chris, Lucy and Amanda would build out the amazing team of twelve that’s bringing DB to the world.
In August and September of 2015, Pranav and Chris tried to negotiate a licensing deal with a group in Germany to use their code as the core of DictationBridge. The German group wished to maintain proprietary source code which was a deal breaker for DB, as we were committed from the start to the values of an open source project. Chris then called Mike Calvo and they negotiated an agreement that permitted Serotek to license the dictation code from its SystemAccess screen reader in a manner compatible with our philosophy that a blind or otherwise disabled person should never be forced to pay a penny more than anyone else to use the same technology. The agreement with Serotek made history as it’s the first time a vendor of proprietary closed source assistive technology software has agreed to open up its source in exchange for a very modest licensing fee.
The next bit of history we made happened when the Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired of San Francisco made an official endorsement of and large monetary contribution to the DictationBridge campaign. Quoting Brian Bashin, CEO of the SF Lighthouse, “The Lighthouse believes it has a moral obligation to support the access needs of blind and visually-impaired people wherever they live.” During the discussions between the DB team and our friends at SF Lighthouse, one of the major goals we set was to ensure that a blind person in an emerging nation could buy a cheap laptop at a flea market and have full access to dictation features built into Windows, a goal we’ve never heard expressed by a large organization in the blindness space before. By collaborating with SF Lighthouse, the DictationBridge team built what we hope to be a long standing bridge between those of us in the free software community and at least one well established advocacy organization.
The nature of the DictationBridge team is also a first of its kind in the blindness business. The team is made up of people from two businesses (3 Mouse Technology and Serotek), a number of independent contributors and a coalition of activists in the blindness and technology world. The team has a number of members for whom dictation is a requirement and not a feature and we’ve some of the strongest engineering and management talent available in the world of accessibility. Assembling an ad hoc team like this one on which everyone works toward a common goal is unprecedented in this field.
While the DictationBridge fundraising campaign is over, the team is working very hard to write, test, document and publish the software. Those on the private beta team will be seeing the first bits this week and the process of fixing bugs will begin. The DictationBridge project web site will be including a “Donate” button so those who had wanted to help the project financially but couldn’t do so before the campaign ended will have an opportunity to contribute to a fund that will help maintain and improve DB into the future.
Finally, as we wrote above, all of us on the DictationBridge team are sincerely and deeply grateful to the hundreds of people who helped us make this dream into a reality. This community is terrific and we all bow to you in thanks.
There’s been quite a bit of discussion in the world of assistive technology about DictationBridge. As we wind up our fundraising efforts for the project we’d like to take a moment for some clarification. The team and the DictationBridge product has ignited a spark in the assistive technology arena. The team and the product have also taken some criticism.
A few people have taken the view that DictationBridge is about negating other products because the project has mentioned some downsides in other products. DictationBridge is not about bashing Freedom Scientific or any other assistive technology. There are commercial decisions screen reader manufacturers have made which have shaped the adaptive technology ecosystem. And, as end users, we have to live with the consequences of these decisions.
DictationBridge is focusing on what it brings to the table and about creating an inclusive environment. Our initial thought was to focus on NVDA. However, DictationBridge welcomes everyone. We are including Window-eyes, Zoomtext, and jaws users. DictationBridge is bringing speech-recognition support to these environments at no cost for end-users. This is something new in these ecosystems.
For that matter, DictationBridge is future proof. If another screen reader comes along, DictationBridge is architected such that it can be connected to that screen reader via standard Windows data sharing mechanisms such as COM.
DictationBridge is broadening the user base for speech-recognition. The first way it is doing this is by eliminating the price barrier. Instead of having to spend over $1500 on a solution, assuming you buy it from scratch, you spend $0 and have a working solution using Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) and NVDA.
The second barrier DictationBridge eliminates is one of screen reader preference. You may be a Window Eyes user, A JAWS user, an NV Access user, , or a ZoomText user. You may want to try speech-recognition with your chosen assistive technology. DictationBridge will give you the ability to do just that. You may decide to continue using the solution or decide to switch. Either way, there are no fees involved, no need to worry about renewing software maintenance agreements and no need to write funding applications to your state agency.
James is a blind entrepreneur but injures his hand and is unable to type. He knows he has to continue working. He has heard of speech-recognition and decides to try it. He has a little bit of vision so he uses ZoomText for magnification and speech. In the current scenario, he does not have a solution. DictationBridge is going to be a generic solution which will talk to ZoomText and WSR or Dragon. Once James recovers, he may continue to use speech-recognition for productivity or he can resume a keyboard only way of working.
Take another example of Ram who has cerebral palsy, CP, and is blind. He lives in a developing country. He goes to a job fair and lands his first job at a hotel doing administrative work. Ram knows he has to type quickly but because of his CP he’s having trouble.
Today, he will have to request his employer buy additional software and spend over 100000 rupees to get him up and running and working productively. However, with DictationBridge, all he has to do is ask the IT team to install NVDA and DictationBridge.
Ram is a good worker and rises quickly to become general manager. He now has to use the hotel ERP system which has an add-on that works with Jaws. DictationBridge enabled Ram to begin his career. As a member of the management team he was able to smoothly transition to using DictationBridge with JAWS and Dragon.
I’m Patrick Kelly, currently living in Shawnee, Kansas. I’m a huge technology nerd, and seem to be the go to guy for family tech support because of this. I am totally blind, and have cerebral palsy. I had a stroke when born as well, since I was born at 26 weeks. This has forced me to type one-handed. I can type 35 WPM last time I tested myself, but I tend to slow down a lot the longer I type.
I don’t currently use any adaptive keyboards or other assistive hardware to access the computer. I shied away from these types of devices since they have to be configured each time I want to use a different system.
I did however, use Dragon Naturally Speaking with Jaws for Windows 14 and J-Say 11.2, but when I upgraded to Windows 10, I was forced to go back to typing since I didn’t have the money to pay for upgrades to all 3 pieces of software to keep dictation working. I have found that Dragon meets my needs much better than Windows Speech Recognition.
Our state agency for the blind has no money, so asking for an upgrade to that software and Jaws and J-Say because of Windows 10 I knew wasn’t going to happen. When I saw Chris’s predictions blog that hinted at DictationBridge, I almost screamed with excitement.
With the project funding so far, I’ll be able to finally use Dragon with NVDA, which is my primary screen reader. I hope you’ll help by donating to the White Reebok Us black White Reebok White Reebok Us Reebok black Us black Us White black PqR5H4E4v though, so that people in a similar situation to my own will be able to dictate, and also be able to use the screen reader they prefer as well.
The Lighthouse for the Blind and visually impaired of San Francisco has announced its endorsement of and large monetary donation to the DictationBridge project, an ad hoc group of individuals assembled to develop a piece of software that blind and otherwise disabled people can use to better employ dictation software like Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) and the Dragon products from Nuance Communications.
“The overwhelming majority of blind people worldwide cannot afford expensive and unstable solutions when they need to use dictation and a screen reader,” says Brian Bashin, CEO of the San Francisco based Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired. He continues, “The Lighthouse believes it has a moral obligation to support the access needs of blind and visually-impaired people wherever they live. We applaud the creativity of the DictationBridge team to address this need and are happy to be part of their success.”
DictationBridge is raising $20,000 to develop software that permits blind people who want to use speech recognition technologies the ability to do so effectively, efficiently and in an incredibly cost effective manner. DictationBridge, if used with the NVDA screen reader and the built-in Windows Speech Recognition, will provide a solution that comes at no cost to the end users who will enjoy it in the future. In brief, DictationBridge sits between the speech recognition technologies from either Microsoft or Nuance and communicates with the user’s screen reader to permit seamless use of both technologies.

Most computer users, especially when generating a lot of text, do so using a keyboard. For some people, including many blind people, using a keyboard, due to an additional disability can be tremendously painful and, in some cases, entirely impossible. DictationBridge will provide blind users of the three most popular Windows screen readers (Spanish Heeled Sandal The Red Katy Women Tabitha Perry 7Y1I1q, Window-Eyes and JAWS) with the ability to perform nearly every task they care to accomplish using voice commands and dictation. Thus, the veteran who came home from the battlefield blind and without hands will be able to use his computer effectively; the blind software engineer suffering from repetitive stress injuries (RSI) will be able to continue doing her job without experiencing terrible pain; the blind person with cerebral palsy will be able to use his computer to communicate with his online friends around the world. DictationBridge, as it uses a free software model, will be free and available at no cost to end users forever so a blind person can get themselves a $100 laptop in a flea market in an emerging nation and with NVDA and DictationBridge be able to use speech recognition at a cost they can easily afford.
A few months before the DictationBridge team launched its crowdfunding campaign, Lucy Greco, DB project spokesperson, met with Josh Nealy. He invited her to present on the project at Lighthouse Labs, a tech think-tank operated by the Lighthouse for the Blind since 2011. The Lighthouse Labs audience was receptive and helped the team get the project launched. Thus, the Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually-Impaired of San Francisco has been involved helping the DB team recruit its membership and in promoting the effort beginning before the campaign even started. In fact, two important members of the DictationBridge team, Lucy herself and Erin Lauridsen, have been long time members of Lighthouse Labs and are frequent attendees at the events it puts on.
The Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually-Impaired in San Francisco is the epicenter of the accessibility community in the Bay Area. “We on the DictationBridge team are proud to have the Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually-Impaired on our team,” says Lucy Greco. “We hope this is a first in what will become a series of projects like this moving into the future.
The word “lighthouse” is used in the names of a large number of organizations serving people with vision impairment. While this is not obvious to the casual observer, no two of the organizations using “lighthouse” in their name are actually related in any way. Thus, this endorsement comes from The Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually-Impaired of San Francisco and may not reflect the opinions of other organizations serving the blind with “lighthouse” in their names.

The DictationBridge team has received a number of questions from individuals who want to know what we will do if we do not make the entire $20,000 goal.
It should be noted that each level is cumulative so everything that goes into a lower level of funding will also be in those that require a higher level of financing to accomplish.
The DictationBridge team met and added up the costs to determine our minimum level to be able to produce a useful piece of software and we found that for $7500, we could develop the following:
Support for Spanish Heeled Sandal The Red Katy Women Tabitha Perry 7Y1I1q with Windows Speech Recognition (WSR).
At this level, the single most challenging task is replacing the proprietary API hooking library used in the DB demo with the free and open source one used by NVDA itself.
Add support for the Lace Ella Brown Leather Sorel Womens Sandals Sahara up 220 ERwwUqxg speech recognition from Nuance Communications to the main DB DLL.
Write Dragon Professional scripts to provide a way for DictationBridge users to issue spoken commands to operate their screen reader. We intend to include as many different NVDA commands as possible at this level.
At this level, the technical challenges aren’t too great as Dragon Pro scripts are fairly straight forward to write and provide a number of ways it can be used to communicate with the main DB DLL. These tasks, however, are time consuming and present a difficult set of test cases to determine if a bug is in the DB DLL, the Dragon Pro scripts, the NVDA Dragon scripts or NVDA itself. As there will be a large number of NVDA commands supported, this also creates a time consuming task for those writing the documentation.
Write scripts for Window-Eyes (WE) and Skechers Gauze Sport Gentle Microsburst Women Navy OZarO (ZTF). It’s our understanding that this will be a single set of scripts as the scripting facilities in Window-Eyes and ZTF are identical.
Write the Dragon Professional scripts to allow for users to control WE and ZTF software with speech.
The biggest challenges at this level are adding a second and third access technology to the package, writing the scripts for WE and ZTF, expanding the documentation and vastly expanding the test cases to ensure that DB is working properly with both NVDA and the two access technologies from AI Squared.
JAWS, according to the best data we have available today, remains the most popular screen reader in the world. But, as one can read in Matt Campbell’s description of the problem entitled, Inside DictationBridge, “the JAWS scripting facility is considerably less powerful than the more modern analogues available for NVDA and WE/ZTF. The biggest issue is that JAWS can query applications for information through any number of different techniques but it cannot be called by an external application so it’s impossible to notify JAWS that something has happened on the screen in an application that does not have focus.”
Both WSR and the Dragon products pop their UI onto the screen in a non-standard manner and leave the application in which the user had been working with focus. The only way to add a “global” script to JAWS requires altering the default scripts shipped with JAWS itself. The DictationBridge team, while it hopes to serve as many users as possible, has elected to not change the JAWS default behavior as doing so means that any changes made by Freedom Scientific or a third party (Doug Lee’s popular Skype scripts for instance) will require this part of the DB code to also be changed. Altering the default behavior of JAWS will also cause technical support issues that, based on any number of different factors, will be very hard to impossible to solve as using this technique will insert a large number of additional variables to the team’s test cases.
Thus, if we reach the $17,500 point, in addition to everything described in the sections above, we will:
Expand the documentation to include how to use JAWS with DB and describe the limitations it has compared to the other screen readers we’re also supporting.
Solid Heels VogueZone009 Lace Sandals Open Imitated Kitten Suede Toe Up CCALP014814 Women Gray If we reach our entire $20,000 goal, along with everything described above, we will:
CCALP014814 Up Solid Suede VogueZone009 Open Heels Toe Kitten Women Sandals Gray Lace Imitated Ensure the documentation is professionally written and that people have tested it for clarity.
Possibly include features suggested from users “in the wild” that we on the DB team hadn’t thought up on our own.
Put a few dollars in the bank to pay developers to maintain DB if/when something like a new version of Windows, WSR or Dragon might cause failures.
While the DictationBridge team is highly confident that we’ll reach the $7500 milestone, as of this writing, we had approximately $5200 in donations with roughly 40 days remaining in the campaign, so, although we think it’s highly unlikely that we will not reach the minimum, it is still a possibility. Thus, if we do not hit this milestone, we will:
Repay the debts we’ve incurred to get the dictation campaign launched. This amounts to approximately $2000 that we spent mostly to hire and train the technical support staff and to acquire some copies of Dragon, a copy of the 90 day test version of JAWS and a few other odds and ends. If we do not reach the minimum, nobody on the team will be compensated for their time and no additional expenses will be considered.
Donate the rest of the money (minus of course the Indie Go-Go fees) to the NVAccess Foundation to be used as Mick Curren and Jamie Teh, the amazing engineers behind NVDA, see fit. Nearly every member of the DictationBridge and 3 Mouse technology teams are NVDA users and we all trust that Mick and Jamie will use these dollars judiciously. NVDA is the only Windows screen reader to have shown marketshare growth in each of the past six years and is a tremendously valuable tool for blind people in nearly every corner of the globe. Obviously, our goal is to raise the entire $20,000 and deliver the gold plated version of DictationBridge as we believe it will add a powerful set of additional features to the different screen readers we intend to support but, if this proves impossible, we’re proud to help NVAccess in any other way we can.
The DictationBridge team is committed to making as good a piece of software as the budget will allow. Fiscal realities, like being able to pay the developers, testers and those writing documentation have led us to create this collection of milestones so as the donating public can understand what each step will cost and what each milestone will allow us to build. Nearly everyone working on DictationBridge is a screen reader user so we all have a stake in its outcomes and we believe strongly that access technology for blind people should be designed and developed by members of our community and that blind technology professionals should be paid for efforts that benefit the entire community. This is a “for us, by us” project and we hope you choose to donate to the DictationBridge crowdfunding campaign before our June 20 deadline.
For me DictationBridge is a very personal project. I have been using computers since the early 80s, and that entire time I’ve had to use the keyboard to not only type, but control what the output from the computer was. I am totally blind and rely on speech output from my computer to read what is on the screen. This means I am unable to use a mouse to point and click at objects or do things such as highlight and edit text. I use a type of software called a screen reader.
After about 15 years of using computers typing on various keyboards, my hands started to feel the stress. After long days of arrowing up and down through pages and doing all kinds of hand gymnastics on the keyboard, my hands were sore and swollen. In the early 2000’s I desperately tried to use various dictation products to no avail. I bought several copies of IBM ViaVoice and Dragon NaturallySpeaking, hoping that the next version would play better with my screen reader than the past one had.
Eventually about 10 years ago a product did come out that allowed me to use Dragon NaturallySpeaking with JAWS for Windows, a very expensive screen reader. All of a sudden my world opened up; I was able to control my computer with my voice and type my documents. I am a technology specialist and have worked with people with a variety of disabilities throughout my entire career. I’ve always had to stay on the leading edge of what is happening in technology to keep ahead of my clients. As cloud-based applications became the norm, the product I was using for dictation was no longer able to work for me. I found that Spanish Heeled Sandal The Red Katy Women Tabitha Perry 7Y1I1q, an open source screen reader, worked more effectively with the applications I had to use. Unfortunately I was no longer able to dictate using this product. As I had to get my work done and stay on the leading edge of technology, I gave up the ability to dictate.
A few months ago a few of us started talking about how we could add the ability to dictate to NVDA, and DictationBridge was born. As we really wanted this product to work with NVDA, a free screenreader, we thought it was critical that the product itself be free to everyone. So we turned to crowdfunding. I want to ask you to help us assure that all blind users have the ability to dictate and control their computers by voice. In today’s schools, offices, homes, and retirement communities, computers are becoming the norm. Why shouldn’t blind and visually impaired people have the same ability to use these computers in whatever way they want?
Let me describe a little what difference DictationBridge will bring. Currently if you use a screen reader with either Microsoft speech recognition or Dragon NaturallySpeaking, the screen reader is unable to tell you what text the product is typing. This means that a blind person will need to manually go back and review all the text that was created and review it for errors and then fix it. This is problematic in so many different ways. First of all you may be dictating because you need to reduce the amount of typing you’re doing due to hand pain like myself. Also, both Microsoft speech recognition and Dragon NaturallySpeaking learn from the corrections you make to the recognized text. If you are going back later and manually fixing any recognition problems, the speech recognition will not learn and may actually get worse at recognizing what you’re saying.
One of the other critical features we will be adding to DictationBridge is the ability to know if the microphone is on or off. A sighted person can see the lovely little icon of the microphone in different positions and different colors indicating if speech recognition is live or not. The screen reader user has to exit the document they are currently in, go down and find where the icon is with a succession of keystrokes, breaking their train of thought in the document. Then once they’ve confirmed that the microphone is live or not they will have to find their place in the document again. DictationBridge will give them an easy way to determine if the microphone is listening or not. This way, when someone is creating a document and the phone rings, they can answer it and be sure that their phone conversation doesn’t get transcribed into their document. These features are only the beginning of what we want DictationBridge to do. With your funding support we can allow a screen reader user to interact with the dictated text and also give them the ability to give some of their traditional keyboard commands to control their screen reader by voice. When DictationBridge is released, it’ll be free to anyone. By using NVDA, Microsoft speech recognition, and DictationBridge, the only cost to the blind user will be the price of their computer. This means that many more blind people will be able to turn to dictation than ever before. Thank you for your contributions to the DictationBridge project.

If you are interested in working in a clinical laboratory setting, then phlebotomist training may be an occupation to discover. If you are knowledgeable at making people really feel comfy, this might be a good profession fit for you.
Have you ever had a blood test? The majority of us have at a long time in our lives had blood drawn to check for indications of disease. The medical experts that gather our blood are called phlebotomists. Their main duty is making people really feel comfy while they draw out blood for diagnostic testing.
To end up being a skilled phlebotomist, make sure to try to find a training program that is recognized; this endorsement implies that particular requirements have been stuck to in creating as well as providing the training content. Recognized additionally as venipuncture, this specialized provides several training options ranging from a few months to a year, 2 years or perhaps four years.
Some area universities or independent schools supply 1 year training programs. Neighborhood colleges offer two-year associate degrees and college establishments supply bachelor's levels.
It would be to your benefit to check your state's guidelines when intending just how much money and time you wish to devote to phlebotomist training. In numerous areas, this specialized position needs accreditation.
The first step toward certification is to finish a program approved by the National Accrediting Company for Scientific Lab Sciences. Certification can be stemmed from organizations such as the National Phlebotomy Association, the American Society for Clinical Pathology and also the American Phlebotomy Organization.
The National Phlebotomy Organization (NPA) establishes national specifications for phlebotomist training. To be qualified for the accreditation examination the NPA requires prospective phlebotomists to have actually finished a minimum of 160 hrs of classroom plus 200 hours of professional training. NPA is the controling physical body that supervises ethics and also professionalism and trust of phlebotomists.
The American Phlebotomy Organization likewise certifies those who have actually finished 140 hours of classroom, hands-on and also scientific direction. The American Society for Clinical Pathology approves any type of training authorized by the National Accrediting Agency for Professional Research laboratory Sciences (NAACLS).
Just like several clinical specialties, phlebotomy is expected to prosper; the Bureau of Labor Data expects growth up until 2018. Medical facility cycles are by far the key task location, yet medical establishments, labs, private practices, blood banks, and also research study facilities additionally employ phlebotomists. Wages range from $23,000 to $60,000 baseding on geographical room, education and learning, encounter and position.
If you appreciate working in a research laboratory cycle and assisting people, after that phlebotomist training may be the solution to an appealing occupation. Be part of the medical care team and also conserve lives.

There is something absolutely magical about visiting another country, especially a country like England. At least, I think so. But why? On my descent into Gatwick, I thought about that question, and this is the best I could come up with:
England is a country that wears its history on its face. To someone like myself, who has lived in various parts of the United States where colonial history is not explicitly present (i.e., there aren’t a whole bunch of forts and “old towns” on the West Coast).[1] But what does it mean for a nation to wear its history on its face? Traveling to England is like traveling through hundreds of years of history compressed into one space. It is impossible to look at England without being able to see the ancient, the old, the modern, and the contemporary all comingled in the same space. Perhaps this does not fascinate the British, but it certainly grabs my attention every time I visit (just as it captures me now as I sit in the airport).[2]
Perhaps that is, in part, why Damien Walter claimed that England is bewitched by the magical/mystical (having only glanced at the post, this is really random speculation). England really is magical, mystical, bewildering, wondrous, and all manner of other delicious descriptors one might use. But it’s because of the history, I think, that so many tourists are drawn here. That history is a kind of magic of its own, filled with myths, legends, exciting stories, architecture, characters, and literature. It’s a place where you always feel like there’s something grand to learn about the very place you’re standing on. Something happened here, perhaps something insignificant within the endless stream of historical time, but something exciting nonetheless.
Maybe that’s why I keep coming back – this is my fourth trip to England (though my first foray into the southern half of the island). I’m jetlagged. I’m tired. I’m unclean. But I’m amazed by the wonder around me. Is this just the journey of the tourist? Or is there something truly magical about England or equally ancient places that inspire such emotions?
A question for you all: what countries or places have you visited that seemed to wear its history on its face? Let me know in the comments so I can make a list of places to see with my girlfriend…
This is what a picture taken from a plane looks like. What is it, you might ask? Well, it's the clouds being murdered by the sunlight on the horizon. Pretty? I think so, even if my photography skills say otherwise...
[1] When I say old, I mean by degrees of hundreds of years. Much of California was settled fairly late in American history. But there is also something to be said about living in these places that demystifies the historical experience. I love the Old West – the mines, frontier towns, the Gold Rush sites, etc. – but I have lived in that space for so long that it doesn’t hold the allure it once did.
[2] I wrote this post while I was sitting in Gatwick International Airport while waiting for my train.

And In The Beginning ,The Complete Early Man 1968-1969 (Revelation +Two Ounces Of Plastic With A Hole In
The swim is in the Cass River, which is overlooked by all of the incredible shops of Frankenmuth. This section of the river is used for the final leg of the swim challenge event in the river each year.
The bike course is on rural country roads - lightly travelled, some spots you will be lucky to see a vehicle. It is pretty much as flat as it gets out there.
The run is also flat as a pancake, but will take you by all the sights and sounds of beautiful Frankenmuth. It is a loop run course with a dedicated closed course most of the way.
To keep the event safe for athletes, as well as the thousands of spectators and visitors to Frankenmuth, official course cut off is 11:30 pm. This will not be a loose cut off, this will be the official course cut off STRICTLY ENFORCED. Any athletes still on the course at 11:30 pm will be picked up and brought to the Transition Area. Half Bavaria Athletes will sign a release form for that cut off.
Again this is one of Michigan's top tourist destinations bringing thousands of people to the area on a daily basis. Your safety is our top priority so making sure we have all the athletes off the roads by that time is very important.
The Transition area is located behind the River Place Shops in the large grass lot to the right of the famous covered bridge. We will rack everyone according to his/her age group, so you will know who is in your wave based on who is racking around you.
No friends or family members allowed in the transition area for any reason. The race director and race officials will close the transition area 30-45 minutes before race start to ensure all athletes are at the starting area for mandatory course meeting and announcements. Once the transition area is closed, you will NOT be permitted back in before the race starts. Family/Friends will not be permitted in for any reason at any time throughout the event.
When the last cyclist is off the course and has headed out for the run. This time is variable and we will make announcements at the event when the transition area is ready to re-open.
Any athletes removing gear from transition areas before the announcer or race director has officially opened the transition area will be DISQUALIFIED from the race! This pertains to all athletes of all distances. All athletes deserve a clear transition.
In the event of inclement weather, it is recommended you have warm, dry clothing outside the transition area to put on following your finish due to other athletes still being on the bike course.
When you have completed the race, please do NOT enter the transition area wearing your timing chip. PLEASE remove your chip before re-entering the transition area and exiting again. This will cause a timing error.
You must rack according to your race number, based on the sequence numbers placed at the end of each row. Please remember racks will hold 7 bikes racked with the seat tip on support bar. Please be courteous to fellow athletes to ensure there is space for 7 bikes on a rack. If there is not enough room for your bike on your designated rack, please see a 3D Team member and we will help. Please do not move another athletes bike or gear.
Run In/Out and Bike In/Out chutes are clearly marked on the large structures at either end. It is your responsibility to go the right direction while racing in the transition area.
You must be on time and get into your wave start area. The start will NOT be delayed. You will make your way onto the Belle River Queen boat, out to the plank and start off the plank crossing a timing matt at the edge of the plank. The river will be divided in half. Your will turnaround at your designated buoy where there will be a break in the swim line. Simply turn there, head back passing the Belle River Queen heading towards the waterfall, exiting to a step out of the river..
Olympic Distance athletes start at 7:30am. A time trial start off the Belle River Queen boat plank. You will be seeded according to your 1500m ACTUAL swim times. Don't know? seed in back.
Sprint Bavaria: 7:50 a.m. A time trial start off the Belle River Queen boat plank. You will be seeded according to your 500m ACTUAL swim times. Don't know your time, seed at the back.
Super Bavaria: 8:05 a.m. A time trial start off the Belle River Queen boat plank. You will be seeded according to your 200m ACTUAL swim times. Don't know your time, seed at the back.
Exiting the transition area you will take the back entry/exit drive to the Bavarian Inn onto Weiss street South. Left at the four way onto Jefferson that becomes Curtis then Ormes down to a RIGHT on Lewis. Left on Townline to a Left on Bray to a Right on Ormes. This will take you to a Left on Buell. A great section of the course here taking you along a beautiful tree lined section along the river on Loren. This will bring you back to Bray, making a RIGHT on Ormes and back to the venue. This is a one, two or four lap course and it is your responsibility to keep track of your laps.
Aid Station: as you make your loop through the fenced roundabout you will enter after the driveway and have the aid station immediately. Gatorade Endurance bottles, water bottles, bananas, pickles, and fig newtons.
Exiting the Transition Area, you follow an exit chute which opens to a coned cross-country course for about 2 tenths of a mile. That will bring you out onto Weiss street south bound across Jefferson, down Weiss Street, past Bronners Christmas Shops, crossing into Grandpa Tiny's farm across the bridge to a RIGHT on Townline, Right on main street back onto Bronners Christmas Lane. Continuing North down Main street via a coned lane to the sidewalk at the River Place shops. Then crossing the pedestrian bridge down, to a RIGHT on Covered Bridge Lane to a LEFT down the grass hill to the river. About 2 tenths cross country style back on the path along the river, around back through beautiful Heritage park. The path will take you around the park and back out onto Weiss st. From that point you have about 800m to the finish line as we bring you into the same driveway you exited along the bike lap chute and into the finish line or out for lap 2. This will truly be an unforgettable run with all the sights and sounds along the route.
To keep the event safe for athletes as well as the thousands of spectators and visitors to Frankenmuth OFFICIAL RUN COURSE CUT OFF OF 11:30 pm. This will NOT be a loose cut off, this will be the OFFICIAL course cut off. Any athletes still on the course will be picked up and brought to the Transition Area.
You will start with your specific swim wave. Check the information cube at the event for wave start information.
You will complete the Swim and Bike disciplines of the event. Following your Bike discipline, you will dismount your bike, cross the Bike In timing mats and place your bike back at your spot on the rack in the Transition Area. You will then proceed across the Run Out timing mats and you are done! Your finish time will be when you cross the timing mats at that point.
If the event offers a finisher’s memento, please proceed to the finish area to receive the item. Tell the support crew at the finish line you were in the aquabike race and they will hand you the finishers memento.
You will keep your timing chip & strap on until all the bikes are off the course. Once we announce the transition is open, you may turn your chip & strap in at the designated collection point and retrieve your gear at that point.
The race tip here is, first of all, Come Early!!! this event has a lot of components to it like any event in a tourist destination in the summer. Don't wait till race morning to figure things out! Come during the summer to train to get the lay of the land. Plan to come a day or two early to get a feel for where everything is at. This will make for a stress free event for you to race your best.
Next get to the swim early, if you need to warm up you will need to get in the water and out and in line in time. So that is looking like 6:45 a.m. to not be rushed. If no warm up is required, get down in line in plenty of time to get seeded. Once you start swimming take advantage of the swim lane. where do you get a lane lined swim course? You need to get into a smooth comfortable groove quickly with a swim like this. The water will be flat, so use that lane to your advantage, picking one swimmer off at a time.
Exiting the swim it is a good 300m to the transition area so use that time to get your self stretched and ready for the bike. If you do not run well barefooted take shoes to the swim with you. . Also knowing where you are at all times in your age group will be key during the bike. You will know when you get out there where you stand as the transition area is set up according to age group as well.
The wind can be a factor on this course as there are few spots for wind breaks, so it is important to know where the wind is coming from. There are few trees and a flat course means the wind can affect your race. Know where the wind is coming from before the swim, so you know where to drop the hammer on the course. It is flat as a pancake so no worries about any climbs at all.
Finally the run: you will be extra motivated due to all there is to see and hear, so again pay attention when you get to your section in the Transition Area how many bikes are there. This will immediately let you know how many athletes you can go after. Enjoy all the sights and sounds, use that as motivation and start going after your competition one at a time. We will see you at the finish line with a smile and the party awaits.

Luxury cars, given their price tags, are built for optimum performance and service reliability. However, no matter how expensive a car is, even if it comes with unlimited warranty, it will eventually fail its driver in some way or another. The most frustrating would be when it refuses to cooperate and just get stalled in the middle of the road. Embarrassing, right what would you not give just to have a gigantic hand pick your car up and bring it to the nearest shop then save you from the hassle and stress of a car breakdown.
Good thing that there are auto bodyshops that has car recovery services especially for expensive car types such as race cars, sport cars and also super cars. This market is already growing and it would not be as difficult to find recovery help today as with a few years back since more and more shops have already specialized in recovering Porches, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Maseratis and Aston Martins.
However, finding this kind of service is not enough. There are a lot of considerations to avoid dealing with inefficient service. Thus, it is very important to know how to spot a service provider that is the best when it comes to convenience, satisfaction and reliability.
Remember you own an expensive car and it is not just any other car. Thus, it should also have a special kind of treatment: aside from the recover-repair package, among the things that you need to check is if the shop has a certification to do repairs to luxury cars so as to not lose their authenticity or depreciate their value.
Go for a shop that has already been tested by a friend or somebody you know. Testimonials from strangers can be reliable but feedback from people you know especially those whose judgment you trust can be more than helpful in giving you an idea how reliable that shop’s service would be.
Choose a shop that offers convenience. A car breakdown is already a very stressful incidence. Do not make things worse by getting a shop that fails to offer optimum customer satisfaction.
It should also be able to respond immediately. Thus, it should easily be contacted anytime when you need its services. A good indication is that it has a very accessible hotline that you can call. Most importantly, always have the contact number of the car recovery shop of your choice as you do not know when lady luck would frown on you. And if you still do not have a particular car recovery shop in mind, it would be best if you already start scouting now. You can start with the car shop that you frequently go to as it might already have a car recovery package that you can avail when the need arises.
Thus, when you’re heading to your office one morning or you get stuck in the middle of nowhere for your car won’t start, or you would like to service your car but do not have the time to bring it on the shop, immediately contact the most reliable recovery shop that you have identified using the points given above. In this way, you will be assured of getting reliable car recovery and other bodyshop / maintenance services, and that your car is also in good hands.
At times, life gives you a blow and you find it difficult to choose between fleeing and fighting. One of the most difficult as well as embarrassing situations for any vehicle owner is the sudden breakdown of his vehicle, without any previous warning. Just a few days back, I saw an aged couple push their car down the highway, on account of unexpected automotive breakdown. With this incident in mind, I decided to write about some of the most common reasons behind vehicle setbacks. With proper precautionary steps, you make sure that your car is fit and efficient right through the year.
One of the most common reasons behind automotive setback is battery related issues. Here are a few important reasons car battery failure:
Leaving the radio, air conditioner, headlights and interior lights on even when you’re not running the vehicle.
Over-inflated and under-inflated tyres are the second-most important reason behind sudden car setback. Here are a few important things that you must consider to help prevent a sudden crash.
Check your tyre pressure at regular time intervals; always consult the owner’s manual and find out the exact pressure level. Depending upon your car load and driving speed, adjust the tyre pressure.
Keep an extra jack and tyre in your car. However, make sure that the tyre is in good and roadworthy condition. That way, you can use this spare equipment during times of emergency.
A sudden auto breakdown or road calamity is an inconvenient and dangerous situation. Whether your vehicle is old or new, engine failure or other automotive setbacks can bring your life to a halt. From hitting the recent movie halls to consulting a doctor during emergency, you need automobiles for a number of reasons. Without them, your life becomes difficult and challenging. However, it’s very important to keep calm and take the necessary steps. Here are just a few of them.
Now, call your nearest auto repair center and ask whether they deliver mobile car restoration services.
If your vehicle has suddenly decided to stop working, or you have been involved in a car accident, then you will most likely have to hire the help of a recovery service to come and collect your car for you. Tow trucks can be used to tow all types of cars, trailers, machinery, motorcycles and caravans. This article takes a look at some of the most popular types of recovery services that are available, along with information on how you can find a roadside recovery specialist in your area.
One of the most popular services is that of roadside car recovery. Specialists will be able to recover all types of cars, including vintage cars, sports cars and even racing cars. They will also be able to recover motorbikes. Large tow trucks will often come pre fitted with a tilt tray and an underlift, which will allow it to safely pick up trailers and even small boats or caravans that have been attached onto the back of the car. Some tow trucks will be able to tow two cars at the same time if it is required.
Many types of machinery will be able to be towed using the tow truck. This can include bobcats, tractors, forklifts and scissor lifts. The tow truck will be able to come directly to your place of work to recover the machinery.
Recovery services will be able to deal with car lockouts. A lockout is where you either accidentally lock your keys inside of your car, or you lose your only set of car keys. Sometimes the recovery team will be able to make a new key for your car at the roadside. In some instances, such as when a new immobilizer system is required, the vehicle will need to be towed to a garage where it can be fixed at a later date.
Everyone gets a flat battery every once in a while, and the most common reason for this is by accidentally leaving your lights on. A recovery team will be able to quickly come to your rescue and jumpstart your car for you. If for whatever reason the car won’t start, or it needs additional work, then they will be able to safely tow it to the garage for you.
A specialist recovery team will also be able to access hard to reach areas to come and collect your car. This can include on rough terrain, such as off road, in the bush or even on a beach.
You can find a recovery service in your area by searching for them online. All major companies will have a website which list the services that they offer, along with their contact details. Even if you do not require their services right now, it is worth storing a telephone number in your phone in the event that you need to get hold of them in an emergency.
There are few things in this world more frustrating than standing on the hard shoulder of the motorway, waiting for a recovery vehicle to come and tow you away from the scene of a breakdown. One of them is struggling with a breakdown when you don’t have adequate insurance cover.
Insurance is often one of the first expenditures to be cut during periods of fiscal uncertainty. With the European economy on a back footing and the recession in severe danger of deepening, it can be tempting to cut costs that do not provide an immediate return. For every ten pounds you reduce your weekly grocery shopping, you will experience a ten pound drop in your standard of living – but for every ten pounds you reduce your insurance there will be no obvious effect. It will be business as usual until something goes wrong.
Nevertheless as anyone who has ever been caught in a costly situation without the relevant insurance will tell you, it is better to pay for peace of mind on a monthly basis than it is to end up in a situation where you might struggle to cover your costs.
In the above example, that same ten pounds a week in insurance costs might prevent you from having to shell out hundreds of pounds for emergency breakdown recovery. In a worst case scenario in which you do not have the money to pay for this service lying around, you will struggle to retrieve your vehicle and this can cause you to incur both the costs of vehicle replacement and loss of earnings whilst you make alternative arrangements.
Thankfully for those of us who cannot afford to pay for the most comprehensive cover, there are a few different tiers of breakdown insurance available and the cheapest is often reasonably priced. Whilst these insurance plans will offer no-frills services, they will be greatly preferable to having no cover whatsoever in the event of a breakdown. It is worth bearing in mind that the cheapest plans will probably leave you exposed to loss of earnings and may result in additional costs – often these plans will allow the recovery team to deposit your vehicle at a nearby garage of their choice. These garages will rarely offer you the best value for money or the best possible service because it is not in their best interest to spend the necessary money to do so. After all, you are unlikely to return to the same motorway garage any time soon so they will not benefit from your positive experience of their work.
Choosing the right breakdown insurance plan for you can be difficult, and as with any insurance contract you should be careful to read all the relevant small print before you sign on the dotted line. Remember that insurance should not be seen as a cost but as an investment in your security and peace of mind: the last thing you want is to be stranded by the roadside for an indefinite length of time.

Created in the summer of 2008, Chicago Phonography is a loose collective of artists interested in promoting creative activity in listening by producing and broadcasting unprocessed field recordings as an ensemble, in the context of live improvisation. Motivated by the maxim "nature performs and we provide the secretarial services" (R. Murray Schafer The Tuning of the World)-along with John Cage's theories of chance operation, the cut up method of Brion Gysin, and fellow field recorders The Seattle Phongraphers Union-Chicago Phonography seeks not to enliven or enhance reality, but rather to solicit a closer examination of Chicago's aural environment from the listener.
By choice, very little effort is given by member's of the collective towards assembling a unified or authoritative definition of the term field recording and in fact, if a discussion were to take place about what it is that makes a recording a field recording, a certain amount of dissention might occur among the ranks. Chicago Phonography seeks only to edify an aural anthropology, and through performance articulate the North American urban ambience, i.e. the increasing congestion of the modern metropolis, the alarming lack of human control over modern technology, and the pressing need to restore organic balance to everyday living. You can find out more about Chicago Phonography by visiting www.chicagophonography.com.
Chicago Phonography will perform on October 3 at Elastic Sound & Vision Gallery. During their performance, Chicago Phonography will cross-pollinate auditory snapshots with visiting phonographers from outside of Chicago (including Steve Barsotti from The Seattle Phonographers Union), as well as with phonographers abroad, who will be streaming via the internet using real-time environmental audio from locations as far away as the Netherlands.

"The huddling ork boy was covered in mud from top to toe, his head being pressed down into the mud by a gleeful Sturmboss peering over the hill "Yer see that boy? Dats dem deep space skanner array! Dats de thing that will burn at the end of this day!". "Narrgh, blllrp, brragh", the boy tried to talk out of the mud, but failed. "Wazzat?", Grogork lifted the boys head a bit but kept it well below the ridge. "Ptui, Narr, boss, kan't say I do", the boy spitted out a mudpie lodged in his mouth. The boy peered over the ridge "Boss, is it dat great wheeled rokkit launcher?". "Narr, dats just an encumberance.". The boy shaded his eyes, "Dat great tank with the kracklin' kannon?". "A minor speed bump.", Grogork smiled. "The green low tank wiv' lots of guns stickin' out?". "Ah, didn't see that, tis' too small.". The boy counted on his fingers, but gave up, "It's hidden in those innumerable hordes of pink skin bags?". "Nah, dat's the late night barbecue.". The boy's sweat was rank in the air as he shakily pointed at the last thing in sight, "It's dat great Flying Monstrosity?". "Nah, Dat's just inconvenient.". The boy was confused, the only thing left in sight was a big pizza plate several 10ths of meters across mounted on a small building, but who cared about that?"
Manticore deploys in the far right corner, surrounded by a platoon of goons. Command squad deploys in cover on the hill to the left of them. Leman Russ Executioner in the middle, beside the command squad. The Chimera got one squad in the holds and deploys to the left of the Russ, one platoon of goons line up behind it. The Flying Monstrosity (hereby known as the great spaghetti monster, with the three twin-linked ketchup blasters and a platoon of meat balls inside) deploys on the far left flank. The penal legion got impounded and arrives late (reserves). The cavalry is always late (reserves).
Kannons deploy in cover on the right flank, a squad of shoota boys to the left of them, buggies to the right of them. Trukks deploy in the middle. The last unit of shoota boys deploy to the left of the buggies. Koptas outflank for the first time ever.
The Flying Monstrosity trains its twin-linked ketchup blasters on the innocent Nob trukk. The goon squad behind the chimera moves a bit towards the russ. The Russ moves towards the right flank and the kannon emplacement. The command squad tells the goon squad around the Manticore to dig in, and they do. All hell breaks lose as the Imperial Guard shows what artillery is. The Flying Monstrosity opens up with the ketchup-blasters and easily takes out the Nob Trukk, Orks with Ketchup on flies in all directions. The Manticore follows up with a terrifying bombardment which wipes the nob squad to a man, Leonorko unconscious and the boy squad several man short. The Leman Russ Executioner plasma blasts the kannons to slug. The Imperial Guard Cheer.
Grogork snarls, wipes the ketchup from his face, and fwacks the driver on the head and tell him to press the pedal on the metal. A lone ork trukk defies the deafening bombardment and launches itself in a straight line towards the Imperial Guard. Buggies zip up the right flank towards the manticore and immobilize it with a dud rokkit locking itself in its tracks. Boys on both sides runs toward the howling guns of aporkalypse.
Leman Russ consolidates back. The penal legion arrives behind the chimera, slightly drunk. The command squad The Flying Monstrosity splays Grogorks trukk with the Ketchup of DOOM, but the trukks momentum propels it straight into the waiting maws of the goon and penal legion squads. Orks fly out and are met by a withering hail from goons, penals, and the chimera. Grogork, the nob and two boys stands when the smoke clears. The Manticore lets loose at the right flank shoota boys squad and kills 4 boys.
The surviving trukk mob jogs toward the Leman, leaving the penals and the goons to Grogork. Buggies consolidate to get a better fire range on the Manticore. Left flank boy squad moves towards the chimera. Right flank boys squad rounds the impassable hill and gets the command squad in their aim. Surviving gretchin from the kannon battery decides to capture an objective and moves toward the right flank objective. Buggies fire at the Manticore and hits the presumed dud lodged in its tracks. The ensuing explosion kills off several of the defending platoon who promptly flee. The right flank shoota boys open up at the command squad, kills three and sends the rest running off the table. The surviving trukk boys climbs the executioner and rips out its fuel tank, one boy die in the explosion. Grogork makes the goons and the penal legion do the burny dance, the penal legion flees. He proceeds to rip up legionaries with his klaw, but they stand firm. The left flank shoota boys WAAAAAGH and just about reaches the chimera, they rip it to pieces and it explodes, killing two ork boys. Only 5 imperial guard escapes from the insides of the wrecked chimera.
The cavalry arrives, just in time! The Flying Monstrosity showers the remaining trukk boys with Ketchup and they lie down, pretending to be dead. The cavalry charges the left flank shoota boys and runs them over. The Chimera squad charges Grogork, but Grogork stands firm with 6-7 imperial guardsmen and their commander trying to drag him down.
The koptas zoom in, right behind the Flying Monstrosity and blows it out of the sky. The meatballs rolling from its hold being promptly charged. Right flank shoota boys turn around and leaves the objective to the gretchin. Instead, they wreck havoc on the cavalry and sends the horses to the great plain in the sky (literally). Grogork is taken down by a mass of bodies.
The surviving nob gets an objective. The gretchin gets an objective. The shoota boys advance towards two objective and shoots out one of the four remaining guard squads. Buggies make one lone guardman dive into cover. The meatballs down the last kopta and consolidate toward the objective-holding nob.
Commander advance toward an objective. The Meatballs meltas the nob survivor to smithereens, but don't reach the objective.
Grogork turned the barbecue, round and round, over the burning remains of the deep space scanner array. The band was in a disarray, the assault had been a tough fight, many wounded, some even dead. The defending guards had finally fallen, a band of boys earning their ears. All over the planet, deep space scanner arrays was assaulted by smaller ork warbands. Many fell, others were disabled. The stage was set.
Legislative efforts to enhance chemical facility security may be revisited by the 109th Congress. Under legislation likely to be proposed in the coming months, drinking water and wastewater systems subject to the Clean Air Act's risk management program (Section 112r) would have to submit vulnerability assessments and site security plans to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for review.
Drinking water systems are pressing to be explicitly exempted from the requirements because they have already submitted comprehensive vulnerability assessments to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Bioterrorism Act of 2002.
The history behind the currently debated legislation dates back to October 2001 when Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ) introduced the Chemical Security Act. The Corzine bill mandated the assessments and gave regulatory control to EPA. Later, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R-Okla.) introduced a competing measure that transferred regulatory power to DHS and allowed drinking water utilities and others already regulated to petition for an exemption. However, the Inhofe bill did not provide the option of an exemption for wastewater systems because they are not regulated by the Bioterrorism Act.

Can anyone please help in identifying this crab? Is it safe in a reef tank and will it cause any harm on fishes and snails? I can't find anything in the internet that looks the same as this one, we have two in the aquarium at the moment.
How large is it and how are the tips of the claws shaped? If they are sharp, it is likely a predator, of they are "spoon" tipped, it likely a herbivore. A picture from the front might help.
They eat seaweed flakes, dead fish (a small pj cardinal died because it was not eating), and carnivore pellets.
About the size, this one with black spots on its legs is about 2 inches, the smaller crab that got yellow spots on legs is 1 1/2 inches. They tend to swim around the aquarium too, I'm worried that they might be trying to catch the fishes.
They are nice looking crabs, but I dont really know what they are. Their legs show they are swimming crabs and all crabs will scavenge a dead fish. But I dont know it it will hunt a crab or not.
If its not one of those, its likely something from a very similar species. You can see them better to make comparisons.
From the what people wrote about moon crabs in other forums, they seem to be reef safe. But a crab big and hungry enough will kill a fish, if it can subdue it. Even emerald crabs can sometimes kill small fish. But I think, as long as they are well fed and not kept with fish very small, they are safe.
Although in nature they seem to be sea grass specie. So if you have a display fuge with sandy bottom, they will be very good and interesting additions.
Yesterday my mom and I headed out to Fossil Creek Reservior where a Long-tailed Duck has been reported by a local birder friend of ours. Once we got there the reservior was suprisingly open, even though it hadn't gotten above 17 degrees all day. In the end we did not find the arctic traveler but got multiple good birds. Such included 2 Red-breasted Mergansers and a Western Grebe, a new bird, with a scruffy black eye, a giraffe's long neck, and a piercing ruby red eye that when it looked at you you felt like you would turn to stone.
As the morning roled a long we headed out to Timnath Reservoir to see a Barrow's Goleneye and any prairie bird that might be new for my year list. As we drove the road out to the reservoir on the south side a flock of at least 100+ Larks flew in (trying to aviod a Harrier coming down the road) and landed 30 feet out in a harvested corn field. Why not scope them we both agreed, so I hopped out of the car now at 11 degrees and started to scope the larks as snow crystals landed on my rosy-red cheecks. Lark..1,5,9.."9 more larks mom"... Is that a longspur... Yeah hay mommmmmmmm, the bird flew off with all the other larks, thanks harrier. In the flock of 100 or more larks was one (still winter plumage) Laplands Longspur. Most of the reservior was frozen and what little water it had was barren with a few Readheads and COMMON Goldeneye.
That night as I was checking over my year list I realized something, Laplands Longspur was number 100, cool! Today my mom and I might try for #101 and #102 at a local house where a Varied Thrush and also a White-crowned sparrow have been visiting. Hope we get this one.
I am very excited for Spring break, this march. I hope California turns out to be the holy grail we have heard it can be.
This is going to sound really cheesy, but, I feel it is quite fateful, that I can't miss the opportunity. My fiancé (Kimble) and I are getting married on the the 18th of October, this, was decided way before I had even heard of the 100 day project. So after deliberating on what creative project I would do, I decided that Kimble would be my subject and I would draw a piece of him every day. This will be my wedding present to my husband. Kim

Anna Pollock, Founder of Conscious.Travel, has 45 years’ experience in tourism as an independent consultant, strategist, international speaker, and change agent having worked with the Canadian Tourism Commission, PATA, European Travel Commission, European Cities, and Tourism New Zealand. Recipient of The Visionary of the Year Award from the Canadian tourism industry, Anna also serves as Visiting Fellow at Oxford Brookes University (UK) and as an advisor to the Tourism Education Futures Initiative (TEFI).
Anna has undertaken seminal work in many aspects of tourism and is currently addressing ways of mitigating the negative impacts associated with “overtourism.” During the 1990s Anna established herself as a thought leader on the strategic implications of the Internet; created the first internet-based tourism strategy for Scotland and co-developed one of the first multi-purpose destination management systems.
Her strength is her ability to see the whole “big picture” and help others make sense of their rapidly and dramatically changing world. She even predicted the emergence of a company like Airbnb back in 2004 and was invited to speak at the annual Airbnb Summit in Paris in 2015.
Anna now focuses on models of destination development that generate higher yields with less impact based on a belief that for tourism to thrive it must be re-invented in order to provide much higher levels of satisfaction to the customer, more net benefit to the host community and sustained yields to shareholders.

We join you in an unwavering commitment to delivering high-quality services and innovative resources to help public sector employees Engage, Build, and RealizeRetirement®.
A 457 deferred compensation plan allows you to save and invest money for retirement with tax benefits.
Contributions are made to an account in your name for the exclusive benefit of you and your beneficiaries. The value of the account is based on the contributions made and the investment performance over time.
A 457 plan is designed to supplement your retirement income. While a pension and/or Social Security may go a long way, they are unlikely to be enough. Saving to your 457 plan can help you maintain your desired standard of living.
Pre-tax contributions you make reduce your taxable income for the year. These contributions and all associated earnings are then not subject to tax until you withdraw them. You also may be able to make after-tax Roth contributions which allow for potentially tax-free earnings.
You can enroll online in your 457 plan. Depending on your plan rules, you may also be able to change your contribution amounts online. The following paper form is also available; contact your employer or your ICMA-RC representative to confirm you can use this:
457 Plan Contribution Form - to initiate contributions at time of enrollment, resume contributions if you previously enrolled, or to increase or decrease current contributions.
A typical plan includes a wide range of options, from more conservative stable value funds to more aggressive bond and stock funds. You may choose to build a diversified portfolio of various funds, select a simple yet diversified target-date or target-risk fund, or rely on specific investment advice through Guided Pathways.
You can make withdrawals from your account when you leave employment. You have the ability to take payments as needed or request scheduled automatic payments. You maintain control over your investments and continue to benefit from tax deferral even after you leave your employer.
During employment, subject to your employer and IRS rules, you may also be able to make withdrawals after age 70½ or due to an unforeseeable emergency. A loan option may also be available.
Withdrawals are generally taxable but, unlike other retirement accounts, the 10% penalty tax does not apply to distributions prior to age 59½ (the penalty tax may apply to distributions of assets that were transferred to the 457 plan from other types of retirement accounts). For detailed tax information, view Special Tax Notice Regarding Plan Payments.
Have a plan for taking withdrawals from your account - both to manage the tax bill and to provide for your future needs. For guidance, view Turning Your 457 Plan Savings into Income and our Retirement Education Center website, or contact your ICMA-RC representative.
Or, complete and submit the forms in the 457 Plan Benefit Withdrawal Packet. To obtain a copy, contact Investor Services.
You designate a beneficiary, or beneficiaries, to receive any remaining assets upon your death. Designating beneficiaries can help ensure your assets are paid per your wishes, avoid the potential costs and delays of probate, and allow non-spouse beneficiaries to receive additional tax benefits.
You can call it my pet peeve or even my obsession, but whenever I read about the claimed “decoupling” of CO2 emissions and economic growth, I get annoyed. Webster’s Dictionary defines decoupling as “eliminating the interrelationship” between two processes. But the interrelationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth has certainly not been eliminated.
Decoupling is the wrong word and metaphor to describe what has been happening. When a caboose is decoupled from a train, it stops moving altogether. A better metaphor, although less linguistically appealing, would be a “slipping clutch.” The engine continues to transmit power, and as a result the driveshaft continues to rotate, but with less velocity than when the clutch was new.
True enough, the carbon intensities of many economies in the world, particularly those of the industrialized nations, have — for many years — been falling, as those economies have become less energy intensive (less energy use per unit of economic activity — Gross Domestic Product or GDP), and therefore less carbon intensive. For each dollar of economic activity, CO2 emissions are less than they used to be. For each unit of economic growth, there is less growth in CO2emissions than previously.
Furthermore, in some cases, as economies grow, CO2 emissions can actually fall. First, picture an economy which is growing exclusively in its services sector. In this case, economic growth might be accompanied by no change in CO2 emissions. Now picture an economy which is growing in its services sector, while shrinking in its manufacturing sector (sound familiar?). In this case, economic growth might be accompanied by reduced CO2 emissions. Now add to this picture the presence of some public policies, such as those that cause the closure of coal-fired electric generation plants, as well as greater dispatch of electricity from natural gas-fired plants. The result: economic growth continues, with falling CO2 emissions. But there has been no decoupling.
The problem and the confusion arises from a very common mistake in the popular press and, for that matter, in many casual conversations: failure to use the rightcounterfactual for analysis. The fact that GDP is rising while emissions are falling does not mean that GDP is not affecting emissions. The appropriate counterfactual for comparison is how much would emissions have fallen had there been no growth in GDP. Presumably, emissions would have fallen even more. The excess of emissions in the factual case, compared with the counterfactual case, is the magnitude of emissions growth due to (actually, “associated with”) economic growth. There has been no elimination of the relationship between the two, although the nature and the magnitude of that relationship has changed.
So, why have CO2 emissions been declining in some countries? Or, more broadly and more to the point, what factors have affected CO2 emissions? Four stand out (although there are others).
First, energy comes at a cost in all economies, and so economic incentives exist to economize on energy use through technological change. The energy-intensity of the U.S. economy has gradually fallen — almost monotonically — since early in the twentieth century.
Second, putting aside energy-intensity and focusing on carbon intensity, some technological change has worked against the use of carbon-intensive sources of energy. The most dramatic example, specific to the United States, has been the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which has caused a significant increase in supply and dramatic fall in the market price of natural gas, which has thereby led to a massive shift of investment and electricity dispatch from coal to natural gas.
Third, in the richer countries of the world, including this one, the process of economic growth has led to changing sectoral composition: heavy industry to light manufacturing to services. The deindustrialization of California is a graphic example. Does the fact that California’s economy has grown while emissions have fallen mean that decoupling has occurred? Of course not. And, in the California case, there has also been a fourth factor ...
Fourth, public policies have in some jurisdictions of the world (Europe, the United States, and most of the other OECD countries) discouraged carbon intensity. In the USA, this has happened both through climate policies and other, non-climate policies. Some non-climate policies, such as EPA’s Mercury Rule, discourage investment, encourage retirement, and discourage dispatch of coal-fired electricity, while other non-climate policies, such as CAFE standards for motor vehicles, bring about greater fuel efficiency of the fleet of cars and trucks over time. Climate-specific policies have also mattered, such as in California, where the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB-32) has brought down emissions through a portfolio of policies, including an economy-wide CO2 cap-and-trade system.
So, yes, the carbon intensity of many economies continues to fall — for a variety of reasons, including but by no means limited to public policies. And, in some cases, the combination of energy price changes, technological change, changes in sectoral composition, and climate and other public policies has meant that emissions have fallen in years when economic growth has continued. But don’t be fooled. Economic growth does affect CO2 emissions. There has been no decoupling; just some (desirable) slipping of the clutch.
Of course, this is not an anti-environment message. On the contrary, a belief in decoupling per se could lead to a misguided laissez-faire attitude about the path of CO2 emissions. Being honest and accurate about the links between (desirable) economic growth and (desirable) CO2 emissions reductions puts our focus and emphasis where it ought to be: finding better ways to have both.

Sunfire is a Co-Dominate gene thats intensifies the saturation of color in Retics, both by brightening base colors like oranges, and also by darkening and cleaning up the black patterning while changing the pattern slightly. Breeding a Sunfire to anything will make a half clutch of Sunfires, and breeding two Sunfires together create the more intense SuperSun. This color mutation has proven to be the key to improving on many pattern and even other color mutations, adding color and contrast to anything it is combined with. Even the normal siblings from Sunfire breedings get a little extra dose of color.

Cooper, who joins Willy Wonka as an Arizona scratch-off celebrity, is quite happy to have his likeness rubbed with coins by eager jackpot seekers.
“I used to say you know you’ve made it," Cooper told AZCentral, “... if you were an answer on Jeopardy. That means you’re general; that means everybody knows who you are. Or if your head was on a Pez dispenser, because a Pez dispenser puts you right up there with Captain Hook and Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse … and now [I'm] on a Lotto ticket.”
Gregg Edgar, executive director of the Arizona Lottery, said, “Alice obviously is an Arizona icon, and he has done so much good in the community in terms of his philanthropy. So, it fit with our overall mission, which is giving back to the state of Arizona."
Cooper credits his acceptance as a mainstream icon to changes he’s made in his life since his wild ‘70s heyday.
"It has a lot to do with [the fact that] I quit drinking,” he noted. “It has a lot to do with becoming Christian. It has a lot to do with my wife and I being married 42 years. There was a lot of security in my life after a certain point – whereas during those days, in the early days, it was just rip and tear. I had no idea if I was going to be alive the next day."
The Alice Cooper Scratchers ticket pays out a total of six $50,000 prizes, with “second-chance” prizes ranging from Cooper memorabilia to VIP tickets and pre-show party access to the his annual Christmas Pudding concert.
Cooper is set to release A Paranormal Evening at the Olympia Paris, a double live album, on Aug. 31.

What’s the point of Atheism? That’s the title of a panel discussion I’ll be taking part in at this weekend’s “Battle of Ideas” at the Barbican, organised by the Institute of Ideas. The blurb on the event’s webpage asks “how relevant is [atheism] in a society where fewer and fewer people are being raised with a belief in gods which they can reject? Is it precisely the lack of an experience of this personal emancipation, or journey towards humanism and reason, that leads atheists instead to direct their hostility at religious believers and institutions?”
I’m sure the writer of these questions was trying to be provocative but I hope that he or she does not really believe that “coming out” as an atheist is no longer a big deal for anyone, that the journey to atheism is an easy one for all of us. I think there’s a misconception held by many people that atheists are some kind of homogenous mass of cosy liberals with nothing better to do than casually adopt the latest identity fad so that they can go around feeling superior. But not all atheists are the same and, even in 21st century UK, being openly atheist is simply not an option for far too many of our fellow citizens.
Within a one mile radius of where I live in South-East London, there are numerous shops that have been converted into churches serving the local African and South American communities. There’s even an old pub that’s been converted into a mosque. Religion still plays a massive role in the lives of many of my neighbours and I see children all around me being raised to believe in the god of their parents. Like me, most of these people are immigrants, or the children of immigrants. Unlike me, religion remains central to their cultural life and therefore to their sense of identity. For the atheists among them, and I assure you they are there, it is not necessarily easy to be open about their lack of faith – they risk being ostracised from family and friends, and indeed the wider community. For many, this may be too high a price to pay. Instead, these people live compromised lives, ones in which they cannot be true to themselves and have to lie to those around them.
I’ve heard heartbreaking stories from many such people – both face to face at meetings of “ex-Muslims” arranged via the internet and in numerous emails I’ve received since I first started writing and talking about my atheism in public. But don’t just take my word for it – in 2011, Suzanne Brink and Nicholas Gibson of the University of Cambridge carried out a study, “Losing Faith without Losing Face”, which found that “There are cases in which people have ceased to believe in their religion yet continue to pretend to believe in that religion. The reasons behind this decision are generally social in nature. It may be that they are afraid of getting hurt when stating their disbelief openly, or it may be that they do not see enough merit in disclosing their newly found disbelief to justify hurting the people whom they love… around one-third of all narratives included statements to the effect that the authors considered it a necessity to keep their deconversion a secret.”
It seems to me that how we see the world is central to our sense of self; I cannot help but feel that people who are unable to be honest about these matters are, in a very real sense, oppressed by their circumstances and forced to lead unfulfilled lives. So while much of the public discourse around atheism may indeed be pointless – the world probably doesn’t really need any more books putting the case against the existence of god – there is every point in continuing the discussion around atheism if doing so allows more people to break free from the pressures that keep them leading lives of quiet misery as secret non-believers. What’s the point of atheism? Well, for me, it’s simple: it’s about standing up for the truth, about being honest with oneself, and the world at large, about how we think the world actually is.
It’s more than that for me. It’s about ridding the world of the daily harm done in the name of non-evidential gods.
I so wanted to like your book, Alom, but I desperately turned page after page looking for an argument and found it not vacuous. Having, like you, thrown away the Qur’an I’m now looking for substance — I think I’ve finally found it in Nietzche (thank you, Bertrand Russell!) I wish I could recommend your book to friends who have yet to question Islam, but it sadly has enough holes to make a fishing net.
The “non-evidential” phrase that a previous respondent used is key. You’ve talked about the wonderful emotion of love – well expressed in one of your video clips. But if I’d never experienced falling in love, or being in love, I’d have no experience, no evidence, to believe in what you’re saying. But I wouldn’t rubbish this “love” thing, or denounce those that believe in it. I’d accept that there’s something that makes a difference to those people who do believe it, who have experienced it; it’s just that I haven’t.
So it is with faith in God. I’m a christian and a physicist. God is someone I’ve experienced and who makes a profound difference to my life, completely like being in love. I can talk about what it feels like, what it means to me, but I can’t give you that experience in the same way – I can’t get you to experience the love I feel for another person. Sorry.
As a physicist, my faith simply makes the universe and everything in it make a lot more sense. It’s a bit trite to say “physics describes how, God makes sense of why” but there we go.
“Religion” – humans systems constructed around faith – are certainly responsible for a lot of problems (but let’s face it, so are most human systems; capitalism doesn’t seem to be working too well either, does it?) The mistake is to conflate religion with faith, or even God.
As a scientist I hope you’re always open to new experiences (which we often call “experiments”), new understanding, And hopefully those who have never experienced love will do so too.

Genotropin Cartridge 12mg medical term is Somatropin and is manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. The synthesis process involves bacteria, Escherichia Coli K12 which contains the plasma pBR322 and carries the gene for a prohormone consisting 191 amino acids. These acids form the human growth hormone and are preceded by a peptide that contains 23 signals. This signal peptide is isolated by a specific peptidase signal found in the plasma membrane. The human growth hormone is then harvested carefully through the bacterium’s outer wall. A purification process follows that guarantees purity of the final product. This final product is genetically engineered to identify with amino acids found in the human pituitary growth hormone.

Southern Railway S15 4-6-0 828 is watched by an appreciative group of locals as well as the inevitable railway photographers as it leaves Andover station on 15 May 1994. It was working a Waterloo to Salisbury charter, outward via Andover and returning via Southampton. There is still plenty of trackwork at Andover, although judging from the colour of the rails on the right a lot of it sees very little use. The lines on the left are still in use, serving the Army depot at Ludgershall.

They were both late teens or early twenties. She was on top riding him. She had quite large ears. They both seemed to be amateurs and had no rhythm at all. The entire thing seemed love-less and awkward, like she was an escort being paid and he was her first ever client. She had...

*This is sort of a love song to San Francisco. It was inspired by a stay at the California' Dreamin hostel in the Mission District.*
He sleeps on the top bunk for 12 hours every day. He can sleep with his eyes wide open to keep the thieves away. I think he works at some factory all through the night and then climbs back to top bunk before it is light outside again. They call him the dead man and I am the punk rock fan. It cost a fortune to rent a closet so I just stay here instead. This place is pretty cheap if you rent it by the week - and there is even a TV and and some real good company most of the time. This is California Dreamin' starring at the dusty ceiling. In the mission district you can't help but pray. Oklahoma is so far away and this state is supposed to break away but I think I'm here to stay. I think I'm here to stay. I do downtown sometimes where everything looks up and the people drink their coffee out of paper cups. I wonder what they'll leave behind after they die - lots of paper cups and long straight narrow lines. Who are these silly girls? When will they go? I'm sure they gave real nice jobs and boyfriends back home. It's fun to try on someone's pain for just a little time. Then you can stretch it out and look at it and hang it up to dry out again. Eveything is pastel here it looks like candy land - accept the dives are more dreadful and palaces more grand. And the spirits of the great are rumbling the ground. All those unfinished souls who just sucked up life too hard.
What influences the likelihood that a word will be used metaphorically? We tested whether the likelihood of metaphorical use is related to the relationality of a word’s meaning. Relational words name relations between entities. We predicted that relational words, such as verbs (e.g., speak) and relational nouns (e.g., marriage) would be more likely to be used metaphorically than words that name entities (e.g., item). In two experiments, we collected expert ratings of metaphoricity for uses of verbs, relational nouns, and entity nouns collected from a corpus search. As predicted, uses of relational words were rated as more metaphorical than uses of entity words. We discuss how these findings could inform NLP models of metaphor.

In this live-action adaptation of the beloved children's tale by Dr. Seuss, the reclusive green Grinch (Jim Carrey) decides to ruin Christmas for the cheery citizens of Whoville. Reluctantly joined by his hapless dog, Max, the Grinch comes down from his mountaintop home and sneaks into town to swipe everything holiday-related from the Whos. However, the bitter grump finds a hitch in his plans when he encounters the endearing Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen).
With Carrey hitting a career peak, this Grinch doesn't steal Christmas; it restores the season by helping energize us enough to make it through the whole thing.
That is awesome as it can be very rewarding. However, there is so much information that you may not have a clue where or how to start. To get off on the right foot, simply start out by following these simple tips.
TIP! Avoid capturing an overcast sky in your photos. When photographing outdoors, remember that overcast skies can make your photos look muted.
Snap pictures with a sense of urgency. If you take a long time to snap the shot, you might miss it. It will change the look of the photograph. The faster you snap pictures, the better chance you have of getting a good one!
TIP! A dSLR is crucial if you are intent on taking good pictures. A DSLR camera is the best one to use for taking shots as you can look at them as soon as you snap the photo.
While days that are filled with sunshine may be beautiful to behold, they are not so wonderful when it comes to taking photos. Bright sunlight casts awkward shadows and over exposes areas of the image. It can also cause your subjects to close or squint their eyes which looks unnatural. When taking pictures outdoors, early morning light or late evening sunshine will result in the highest quality photographs.
TIP! The position that you use when holding your camera can make a big difference on the quality of your pictures. To keep your grip steady, hold your upper arms and elbows close to your sides and brace your hands at the camera’s bottom and sides.
Hold your camera tight, keep your arms close to your sides and put your hands on both sides and the bottom of your camera. The idea here is to reduce the shaking caused by normal movements. The end result should be clearer photos. Having your hands and arms placed like this also reduces the chances that you will get bumped or drop the camera.
TIP! Be careful when packing cameras and other photography equipment prior to a trip. Pack however many lenses you anticipate using, and don’t neglect to throw in cleaning accessories and backup batteries.
This tip will help you improve your photos! You need to experiment with shutter speeds. Your camera has S, A, M and P settings. The P is an initial for the program mode. This setting has your camera determine your shutter and aperture speeds automatically. If you are less than professional, this is often the best setting.
TIP! While traveling you should take as many pictures as possible. While the pictures might not seem particularly important to you at the time, they will stir up wonderful memories of your trip when you look through them later.
Experiment with your camera’s various features, along with angles and colors. Even if the subject of your photograph has been shot a million times before, you can change many different factors to make your shot stand out. A skilled photographer with an artistic eye can turn a mundane subject into an exceptional picture. Play around to gain experience and build a style of your own.
TIP! Take photos of your travel souvenirs when you’re on a trip. You could take a picture of the store where you bought something or simply photograph the object with an original background.
If you want to be ready when the perfect shot presents itself, make sure you keep your batteries charged. Because digital cameras drain their batteries pretty fast, it’s important that you start the day with a full charge. You should also carry spare batteries so that you can avoid missing a photograph opportunity.
TIP! Detail some notes on your camera settings when you are taking photos. Sifting through hundreds of photographs, you may have a difficult time remembering the emotions and thoughts that you were experiencing when you snapped each picture.
The majority of digital cameras now come with a feature that automatically uses the flash whenever the area you are photographing is too dim. These are convenient for quick photos, but if you are hoping for something a little more professional, consider investing in an external flash unit for a broader range of lighting. Check to make sure your camera has a “hot shoe” on top that will accommodate an external flash, then go to a professional camera store to ensure that you are getting one that automatically syncs with your camera.
TIP! As you journy to new and different places, look for tips on what interesting things there are to photograph. Looking at postcards can give you some great ideas.
One way to exercise your creative muscles is to put limits on how you take pictures. For instance, set a daily goal and just shoot what represents a single concept, like “sweet.” Then go and take 100 different photos in the same room or with the same point of view. By doing this, you train yourself to create unique photos under the circumstances you have created.
TIP! Many people love to wear white when they are having their picture taken, but it’s not recommended. Many people have their cameras on auto settings, and the camera reads the white clothing as brighter light, which throws off the exposure and degrades the photograph.
A common misconception is that white makes a great color for clothes that will be worn in photographs. Many cameras will auto-focus so that it can get a “reading” of every nuance and shade in the photograph’s range. White clothes may appear washed out in such photos, or faces may appear too dark.
Make sure to read the camera’s manual. Manuals are often thick and bulky. People tend to place them at the back of drawers or they get thrown away. However, the manual is an important source of information and should be taken advantage of. You will avoid simple errors and improve your skill.
TIP! Practice a lot whenever you are working with new backdrops or subjects. The more practice shots you take, the more comfortable you will get with the environment.
When composing a shot, think about framing. This doesn’t mean framing a finished photo, but using the environment to frame the subject. When you are taking a picture, you should look for a natural frame for your subject. This is a great way to practice composition.
TIP! Create a silhouette. Many methods for creating a silhouette exist, including the most popular method of using a sunset.
You can use creative methods to produce a silhouette image. One of the most common ways to generate a silhouette is by using the sunset. However, other methods do exist. Any background that is substantially brighter than your subject will create a silhouette. Try putting your subject near a window with light pouring in from behind or even just put an external flash to the rear of the subject. Be sure, however, that the resulting outline gives a flattering depiction of the subject.
TIP! You need to remember where the sharpest focus will be in the frame. Sharpness is usually found at the middle of images.
TIP! Sometimes, the available lighting can just not provide you with a good situation for a landscape photo. You may come across particular situations where another area with consistent lighting is not available.
Different filters are used as an extension of a camera’s lenses. Filters alter the light entering the camera, and can create various special effects. The most frequently used camera filter is a UV filter. By using a UV filter your camera lens will be protected from the harmful rays of direct sunlight. It is also intended to protect the lens from being damaged if the camera is dropped.
TIP! You need to include an object that is interesting for the foreground of the photos, which adds more appeal. Something as simple as a leaf or rock can add a whole new element to your photo.
One thing that can make photographs unusable is red eye. To avoid red eye, do not use your flash. If you must, do not have your subject look directly at the camera lens. Many cameras also include a red eye reduction feature.
TIP! When you are taking landscape photos, mount your camera on a tripod. Keeping your camera steady will always ensure the steadiest shot, whether you’re taking a quick motion picture or a long-lapse photo of a waterfall.
TIP! Take time for posing your subject! Candid photos, like from family events, never turn out as good as posed pictures. This enables you to improve the look and feel of each shot.
Use your shutter speeds creatively. It’s commonly accepted to use super-high speeds in order to freeze moments in time, but slower shutter speeds have their advantages too. Have a look at fast subjects such as cyclists, birds and cars. The background will show the speed of the cyclist, while they themselves will appear crisp and clear.
TIP! When you are going to be taking a close-up shot, be careful if you are using the digital zoom features instead of optical zoom. Cameras will let you zoom in as close to an object as you want, but once you pass the limits of the camera’s optical zoom and switch to digital zoom, the image will become pixelated.
When using a camera that requires film, it is important to carefully consider the brand of film you are using. Nearly every photo artist has an opinion on which brand of film works best. There is not much difference between film brands, just make sure to get the right film format for your camera. Experiment and figure out which one you like best.
TIP! Fiddle around with different shutter speeds to learn their effects. As you try to capture subjects in motion, opt for a faster shutter speed.
At this point, you should be well informed about how to become a better photographer. Re-read these tips anytime you need a brush-up. If you are patient enough, your pictures will eventually look like art.
