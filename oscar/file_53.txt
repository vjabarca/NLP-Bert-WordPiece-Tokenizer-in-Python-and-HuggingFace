For too many organizations, peak traffic times come with higher latency that leaves a negative impression with the end user. No one wants to wait for anything these days. So in a world where overprovisioning is always the norm but not the best solution, what’s an IT team to do? It’s time for these groups to start recognizing the value in more granular performance monitoring and optimization right at the infrastructure’s root. Performance monitoring achieves the following goals that make it a better solution than blind overprovisioning:
Real-time performance monitoring, rather than simply throwing more money at a problem, gets to the root cause for higher-than-expected latency periods and points out areas for improvement. There may well be areas of congestion, but simply making an ecosystem bigger is a costly patch that may not solve the actual problem. Leveraging modern performance monitoring tools that cull data from a number of places and produce actionable analytics will give workers a better understanding of their entire landscape, and where there are actual fixes to be made in the core of the infrastructure.
That mandate calling for cost optimization is easier to reach when using performance monitoring because IT staff have access to more information about the functionality of the platforms on which they rely. Overprovisioning to increase capacity during busier periods requires financial investment that simply isn’t necessary. Any time money is wasted, someone is going to have to answer for that. Directing funds to performance monitoring is more efficient than just increasing bandwidth.
There will likely come a time for expanding an IT ecosystem. A bigger infrastructure is necessary during times of major traffic growth, and that’s usually a good thing for most companies. However, premature overprovisioning in the name of a quick fix to a problem will make an infrastructure inefficient when growth is necessary. Save that step for when it’s really the right move, and solidify your IT foundation in the meantime.
Aside from the unnecessary costs sunk into larger-than-necessary systems, a massive infrastructure is more to manage for a department that is already failing to operate as efficiently as possible. Infrastructure performance management (IPM) points to the root of unexpected latency increases and helps businesses find the original causes of their problems so they can fix them efficiently.
Before you invest more resources, find out how better performance monitoring through VirtualWisdom4 can make your infrastructure more efficient.

I prefer reading to movies. Old, classic novels and guilty pleasures like Janet Evanovich books...although Stephanie really needs to pick Ranger already.

In a trip to the Steel City, the Falcons’ starters throttled the Pittsburgh Steelers’ starters (well, the ones not including the team’s three best players, Big Ben, Antonio Brown, Le’Veon Bell, who are all very good), and the Steelers’ reserves throttled the Falcons’ reserves. All in all, it was just some dumb preseason game in a city known for putting French fries on sandwiches (which tastes good, for what it’s worth). Continue reading →

We will focus more on incumbent player performances closer to training camp, but for now, we’ll spend a lot of time with our new Falcons, and a few familiar faces.

The more I use Angular JS, the more I like it. I’ve been playing around with Facebook’s React recently, and I went back to Angular, primarily because I found React a little more restrictive with respect to two way bindings. I’ve built a modal dialog control in Angular which I figure you guys might find useful. The modal dialog itself is an Angular directive, and I’m using LESS for some of the slightly more complicated CSS rules. I’m going to assume you’re relatively proficient with both, but if you’re not, I highly recommend you check them out before plunging into this tutorial.
If you’re the sort of reader who just wants to see the whole thing in action, feel free to take a look at the demo page I’ve put together that shows off the whole thing. Viewing the source on that page should give you a pretty good overview of what’s going on.
We’re using a couple of different CSS classes to perform the animations for sliding the modal in and out, and also for fading the overlay in and out. Here’s the LESS CSS:
I’ve left out the vendor-specific prefixes for the sake of brevity. Most of the CSS here is used for positioning and some basic styling. I’ve tried to keep the CSS as brief as possible so as to highlight the more important rules. I also feel as though this snippet really emphasizes the importance of using a CSS framework like LESS; it allows us to add variables and specify rules in a much more concise manner.
The animations for the overlay are specified in the `show` and `hide` classes, while the sliding for the modal itself is laid out in the `show` class. There are two rules for the overlay so as to facilitate the fading in as well as the fading out while setting the visibility. If we didn’t do it this way, we’d only get one or the other, or have an overlay that’s visible but transparent, preventing our users from interacting with the rest of the page.
The only other fancy code here is the `transform:translate3d(0, ~”calc(-100% – 75px)”, 0);` line. This is using CSS3’s `calc` function, which allows us to calculate size metrics on the fly. Very handy. Here, I’m saying that I want the modal to shift upward by it’s full height, plus 75 pixels, which just so happens to be the buffer that separates it from the upper border of the document when it’s shown.
The controller for the page defines a `visible` scope variable which is used to set the various CSS classes on the modal’s HTML. We’re hooking into the `keyup` document event so that we can listen for an escape keypress and, when we get one, broadcast an event that each modal will listen to and then hide the modal. And that’s it!
The animations that this modal uses are one of the four that work well on mobile (opacity, transform:rotate, transform:scale and transform:translate), so it looks smooth on mobile devices, too. As I mentioned above, there’s a demo that you can check out which shows the modal in all its glory.

3 (b) (1) Subject to the exclusions set forth in this Code section, a civil action under this article may also be brought by a private person upon written approval by the Attorney General. A civil action shall be brought in the name of the State of Georgia or local government, as applicable. The civil action may be dismissed only if the Attorney General gives written consent to the dismissal stating the reasons for consenting to such dismissal and the court enters an order approving the dismissal. (2) A copy of the complaint and written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses shall be served on the Attorney General by certified mail or statutory overnight delivery. The complaint shall be filed in camera and under seal, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders. The state or, if delegated the authority by the Attorney General, local government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action within 60 days after the Attorney General receives both the complaint and the material evidence and information.

(2) If the Attorney General has consented to a dismissal or elected not to proceed with a civil action, a local government may dismiss the civil action, notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the civil action, if the person has been notified by the local government of the filing of the motion and the court has provided the person with an opportunity for a hearing on the motion. (3) The state or local government may settle the civil action with the defendant, notwithstanding the objections of the person initiating the civil action, if the court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable under all the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, such hearing may be held in camera. (4) Upon a showing by the state or local government that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the civil action would interfere with or unduly delay the state or local government's litigation of the case, or would be repetitious, irrelevant, or for purposes of harassment, the court may, in its discretion, impose limitations on the person's participation, such as: (A) Limiting the number of witnesses the person may call;
4 (B) Limiting the length of the testimony of such witnesses; (C) Limiting the person's cross-examination of witnesses; or (D) Otherwise limiting the participation of the person in the litigation. (d) Upon a showing by the defendant that unrestricted participation during the course of the litigation by the person initiating the civil action would be for purposes of harassment or would cause the defendant undue burden or unnecessary expense, the court may limit the participation of the person in the litigation.

If the state or local government so requests, it shall be served with copies of all pleadings filed in the civil action and shall be supplied, without cost, with copies of all deposition transcripts. When a person proceeds with the civil action, the court may nevertheless permit the state or local government to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause. (f) Whether or not the state or local government proceeds with the civil action, upon a showing by the state or local government that certain actions of discovery by the person initiating the civil action would interfere with the state or local government's investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts, the court may stay such discovery for a period of not more than 60 days. Such a showing shall be conducted in camera. The court may extend the 60 day period upon a further showing in camera that the state or local government has pursued the criminal or civil investigation or proceedings with reasonable diligence, and any proposed discovery in the civil action will interfere with the ongoing criminal or civil investigation or proceedings. (g) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this Code section, the state or local government may elect to pursue its claim through any alternate remedy available to the state or local government, including any administrative proceeding to determine a civil money penalty. If any such alternate remedy is pursued in another proceeding, the person initiating the civil action shall have the same rights in such proceeding as such person would have had if the civil action had continued under this Code section. Any finding of fact or conclusion of law made in such other proceeding that becomes final shall be conclusive on all parties to a civil action under this Code section. For purposes of this subsection, a finding or conclusion shall be deemed final if it has been finally determined on appeal to the appropriate court, if all time for filing such an appeal with respect to the finding or conclusion has expired, or if the finding or conclusion is not subject to judicial review. (h) (1) If the state or local government proceeds with a civil action brought by a private person under subsection (b) of this Code section, such person shall, subject to the second sentence of this paragraph, receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the civil action or settlement of the claim, depending upon the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the civil action. Where the civil action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information, other than information provided by the person bringing the civil action, relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing; in a legislative, administrative, or State Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation; or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds, taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing such civil action in advancing the case to litigation. Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of this paragraph shall be made from the proceeds. Any such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. (2) If the state or local government does not proceed with a civil action under this Code section, the person bringing the civil action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. Such amount shall be not less than 25 percent and not more than 30 percent of the proceeds of the civil action or settlement and shall be paid out of such proceeds. Such person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs. All such expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant. (3) Whether or not the state or local government proceeds with the civil action, if the court finds that the civil action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of this article upon which the civil action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the civil action which the person would otherwise receive under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the civil action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of this article, such
5 person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the civil action. Such dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the State of Georgia to continue the civil action, represented by the Attorney General or local government attorney to whom the Attorney General has delegated authority. (4) If the state or local government does not proceed with the civil action and the person bringing the civil action conducts the civil action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorney's fees and expenses against the person bringing the civil action if the defendant prevails in the civil action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the civil action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment. (i) For purposes of this subsection, the term "public employee," "public official," and "public employment" shall include federal, state, and local employees and officials. No civil action shall be brought under this article by a person who is or was a public employee or public official if the allegations of such action are substantially based upon: (1) Allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct which such person had a duty or obligation to report or investigate within the scope of his or her public employment or office; or (2) Information or records to which such person had access as a result of his or her public employment or office. (j) (1) No court shall have jurisdiction over a civil action brought under subsection (b) of this Code section against a member of the General Assembly or a member of the judiciary if the civil action is based on evidence or information known to the state when the civil action was brought. (2) In no event may a person bring a civil action under subsection (b) of this Code section which is based upon allegations or transactions which are the subject of a civil or administrative proceeding to which the State of Georgia is already party. (3) The court shall dismiss a civil action or claim under this Code section, unless opposed by the state or local government, if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed: (A) In a state criminal, civil, or administrative hearing in which the state or local government or its agent is a party; (B) In a state or local government legislative or other state or local government report, hearing, audit, or investigation that is made on the public record or disseminated broadly to the general public, provided that such information shall not be deemed publicly disclosed in a report or investigation because it was disclosed or provided pursuant to Article 4 of Chapter 18 of Title 50, the federal Freedom of Information Act, or under any other federal, state, or local law, rule, or program enabling the public to request, receive, or view documents or information in the possession of public officials or public agencies; or (C) From the news media, provided that such allegations or transactions are not publicly disclosed in the news media merely because information of allegations or transactions have been posted on the Internet or on a computer network, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or local government, or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "original source" means a person who: (i) Prior to a public disclosure under this paragraph, has voluntarily disclosed to the state or a local government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based; or (ii) Has knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions and who has voluntarily provided the information to the state or a local government before filing a civil action under this Code section. (k) The state or local government shall not be liable for expenses which a private person incurs in bringing a civil action under this article. (l) (1) Any employee, contractor, or agent shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make that employee, contractor, or agent whole if that employee, contractor, or agent is discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against in the terms and conditions of employment because of lawful acts done by the employee, contractor, agent, or associated others in furtherance of a civil action under this Code section or other efforts to stop one or more violations of this article. (2) Relief under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include reinstatement with the same seniority status that the employee, contractor, or agent would have had but for the discrimination, two times the amount of back pay, interest on
6 the back pay, and compensation for any special damages sustained as a result of the discrimination, including litigation costs and reasonable attorney's fees. An action under this subsection may be brought in the appropriate superior court of this state for the relief provided in this subsection.

(f) A verified return by the individual serving any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (b) of this Code section or any petition filed under subsection (k) of this Code section setting forth the manner of such service shall be proof of such service. In the case of service by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery, such return shall be accompanied by the return post office receipt or other receipt of delivery of such demand.
10 (g) (1) The production of documentary material in response to a civil investigative demand served under this Code section shall be made under a sworn certificate, in such form as the demand designates, by: (A) In the case of a natural person, the person to whom the demand is directed; or (B) In the case of a person other than a natural person, a person having knowledge of the facts and circumstances relating to such production and authorized to act on behalf of such person.

(2) Any person upon whom any civil investigative demand for the production of documentary material has been served under this Code section shall make such documentary material available for inspection and copying to the false claims law investigator identified in such demand at the principal place of business of such person, or at such other place as the false claims law investigator and the person thereafter may agree and prescribe in writing, or as the court may direct under paragraph (1) of subsection (k) of this Code section. Such documentary material shall be made so available on the return date specified in such demand, or on such later date as the false claims law investigator may prescribe in writing. Such person may, upon written agreement between the person and the false claims law investigator, substitute copies for originals of all or any part of such documentary material. (h) Each interrogatory in a civil investigative demand served under this Code section shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath and shall be submitted under a sworn certificate, in such form as the demand designates, by: (1) In the case of a natural person, the person to whom the demand is directed; or (2) In the case of a person other than a natural person, the person or persons responsible for answering each interrogatory. If any interrogatory is objected to, the reasons for the objection shall be stated in the certificate instead of an answer. The certificate shall state that all information required by the demand and in the possession, custody, control, or knowledge of the person to whom the demand is directed has been submitted. To the extent that any information is not furnished, the information shall be identified and reasons set forth with particularity regarding the reasons why the information was not furnished. (i) (1) The examination of any person pursuant to a civil investigative demand for oral testimony served under this Code section shall be taken before an officer authorized to administer oaths and affirmations by the laws of this state, or of the United States, or of the place where the examination is held. The officer before whom the testimony is to be taken shall put the witness on oath or affirmation and shall, personally or by someone acting under the direction of the officer and in the officer's presence, record the testimony of the witness. The testimony shall be taken stenographically and shall be transcribed. When the testimony is fully transcribed, the officer before whom the testimony is taken shall promptly transmit a copy of the transcript of the testimony to the custodian. This subsection shall not preclude the taking of testimony by any means authorized by and in a manner consistent with Chapter 11 of Title 9, the "Georgia Civil Practice Act."

Any changes in form or substance which the witness desires to make shall be entered and identified upon the transcript by the officer or the false claims law investigator, with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for making such changes. The transcript shall then be
11 signed by the witness, unless the witness in writing waives the signing, is ill, cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed by the witness within 30 days after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to examine it, the officer or the false claims law investigator shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver, illness, absence, or the refusal to sign of the witness, together with the reasons, if any, given therefor.

(6) Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the false claims law investigator shall furnish a copy of the transcript to the witness only, except that the Attorney General or his or her designee may, for good cause, limit such witness to inspection of the official transcript of the witness's testimony. (7) (A) Any person compelled to appear for oral testimony under a civil investigative demand issued under subsection (b) of this Code section may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel. Counsel may advise such person, in confidence, with respect to any question asked of such person. Such person or counsel may object on the record to any question, in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record the reason for the objection. An objection may be made, received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that such person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on the grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including the privilege against self-incrimination. Such person may not otherwise object to or refuse to answer any question, and shall not, directly or through counsel, otherwise interrupt the oral examination. If such person refuses to answer any question, a petition may be filed in the superior court under paragraph (1) of subsection (k) of this Code section for an order compelling such person to answer such question. (B) If such person refuses to answer any question on the grounds of the privilege against self-incrimination, the testimony of such person may be compelled in accordance with the provisions of Title 24. (8) Any person appearing for oral testimony under a civil investigative demand issued under subsection (b) of this Code section shall be entitled to the same fees and allowances which are paid to witnesses in the superior courts and state courts of Georgia. (j) (1) The Attorney General shall designate a false claims law investigator to serve as custodian of documentary material, answers to interrogatories, and transcripts of oral testimony received under this Code section and shall designate such additional false claims law investigators as the Attorney General determines from time to time to be necessary to serve as deputies to the custodian. (2) (A) A false claims law investigator who receives any documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony under this Code section shall transmit them to the custodian. The custodian shall take physical possession of such documentary material, answers, or transcripts and shall be responsible for the use made of them and for the return of documentary material under paragraph (4) of this subsection. (B) The custodian may cause the preparation of such copies of such documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony as may be required for official use by any false claims law investigator or other officer or employee of the Attorney General or any other agency of the state or local government participating in an investigation of the matters in question. Such documentary material, answers, and transcripts may be used by any such authorized false claims law investigator or other officer or employee in connection with the taking of oral testimony under this Code section. (C) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony, or copies thereof, while in the possession of the custodian, shall be available for examination by any individual other than a false claims law investigator or other officer or employee of the Attorney General or any other agency of the federal government or of a state or local government participating in an investigation of the matters in question authorized under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. The prohibition in the preceding sentence on the availability of documentary material, answers, or transcripts shall not apply if consent is given by the person who produced such documentary material, answers, or transcripts, or, in the case of any product of discovery produced pursuant to an express demand for such documentary material, consent is given by the person from whom the discovery was obtained. Nothing in this subparagraph is intended to prevent disclosure to the General Assembly, including any committee or subcommittee of the General Assembly, or to any other agency of the state or local government or the United States for use by such agency in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities.
12 (D) While in the possession of the custodian and under such reasonable terms and conditions as the Attorney General shall prescribe: (i) Documentary material and answers to interrogatories shall be available for examination by the person who produced such documentary material or answers, or by a representative of that person authorized by that person to examine such documentary material and answers; and (ii) Transcripts of oral testimony shall be available for examination by the person who produced such testimony, or by a representative of that person authorized by that person to examine such transcripts. (3) Whenever the Attorney General, an attorney for a local government, or an attorney for any agency of a local government participating in an investigation of the matter in question has been designated to appear before any court, grand jury, or state or local government or federal agency in any case or proceeding, the custodian of any documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony received under this Code section may deliver to such attorney such documentary material, answers, or transcripts for official use in connection with any such case or proceeding as such attorney determines to be required. Upon the completion of any such case or proceeding, such attorney shall return to the custodian any such documentary material, answers, or transcripts so delivered which have not passed into the control of such court, grand jury, or agency through introduction into the record of such case or proceeding. (4) If any documentary material has been produced by any person in the course of any false claims law investigation pursuant to a civil investigative demand under this Code section, and: (A) Any case or proceeding before the court or grand jury arising out of such investigation, or any proceeding before any state or local government or federal agency involving such documentary material, has been completed; or (B) No case or proceeding in which such documentary material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time after completion of the examination and analysis of all documentary material and other information assembled in the course of such investigation, the custodian shall, upon written request of the person who produced such documentary material, return to such person any such documentary material, other than copies furnished to the false claims law investigator under paragraph (2) of subsection (g) of this Code section or made for the state under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of this subsection, which has not passed into the control of any court, grand jury, or agency through introduction into the record of such case or proceeding. (5) In the event of the death, disability, or separation from service of the custodian of any documentary material, answers to interrogatories, or transcripts of oral testimony produced pursuant to a civil investigative demand under this Code section, or in the event of the official relief of such custodian from responsibility for the custody and control of such documentary material, answers, or transcripts, the Attorney General or his or her designee shall promptly: (A) Designate another false claims law investigator to serve as custodian of such documentary material, answers, or transcripts; and (B) Transmit in writing to the person who produced such documentary material, answers, or testimony notice of the identity and address of the successor so designated. Any person who is designated to be a successor under this paragraph shall have, with regard to such documentary material, answers, or transcripts, the same duties and responsibilities as were imposed by this Code section upon that person's predecessor in office, except that the successor shall not be held responsible for any default or dereliction which occurred before that designation. (k) (1) Whenever any person fails to comply with any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (b) of this Code section, or whenever satisfactory copying or reproduction of any documentary material requested in such demand cannot be done and such person refuses to surrender such documentary material, the Attorney General or local government may file in any county or district in which such person resides, is found, or transacts business and serve upon such person a petition for an order of such court for the enforcement of the civil investigative demand. (2) (A) Any person who has received a civil investigative demand issued under subsection (b) of this Code section may file in the appropriate court and serve upon the false claims law investigator identified in such demand a petition for an order of the court to modify or set aside such demand. In the case of a petition addressed to an express demand for any product of discovery, a petition to modify or set aside such demand may be brought only in the superior court for any
13 county in which the proceeding in which such discovery was obtained is or was last pending. Any petition under this subparagraph shall be filed: (i) Within 20 days after the date of service of the civil investigative demand, or at any time before the return date specified in the demand, whichever date is earlier; or (ii) Within such longer period as may be prescribed in writing by any false claims law investigator identified in the demand. (B) The petition shall specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in seeking relief under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and may be based upon any failure of the demand to comply with the provisions of this Code section or upon any constitutional or other legal right or privilege of such person. During the pendency of the petition in the court, the court may stay, as it deems proper, the running of the time allowed for compliance with the demand, in whole or in part, except that the person filing the petition shall comply with any portions of the demand not sought to be modified or set aside. (A) In the case of any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (b) of this Code section which is an express demand for any product of discovery, the person from whom such discovery was obtained may file in the superior court for the county in which the proceeding in which such discovery was obtained is or was last pending and serve upon any false claims law investigator identified in the demand and upon the recipient of the demand a petition for an order of such court to modify or set aside those portions of the demand requiring production of any such product of discovery. Any petition under this subparagraph shall be filed: (i) Within 20 days after the date of service of the civil investigative demand, or at any time before the return date specified in the demand, whichever date is earlier; or (ii) Within such longer period as may be prescribed in writing by any false claims law investigator identified in the demand. (B) The petition shall specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in seeking relief under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and may be based upon any failure of the portions of the demand from which relief is sought to comply with the provisions of this Code section or upon any constitutional or other legal right or privilege of the petitioner. During the pendency of the petition, the court may stay, as it deems proper, compliance with the demand and the running of the time allowed for compliance with the demand. (4) At any time during which any custodian is in custody or control of any documentary material or answers to interrogatories produced by, or transcripts of oral testimony given by, any person in compliance with any civil investigative demand issued under subsection (b) of this Code section, such person and, in the case of an express demand for any product of discovery, the person from whom such discovery was obtained, may file in the superior court for any county within which the office of such custodian is situated and serve upon such custodian a petition for an order of such court to require the performance by the custodian of any duty imposed upon the custodian by this Code section. (5) Whenever any petition is filed under this subsection in any superior court for any county, such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter so presented and to enter such order or orders as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Code section. Any final order so entered shall be subject to appeal. Any disobedience of any final order entered under this Code section by any court shall be punished as a contempt of the court. (6) Chapter 11 of Title 9, the "Georgia Civil Practice Act," shall apply to any petition filed in this state under this subsection, to the extent that such rules are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Code section.

6 PATHWAYS: A Jacobs Foundation International Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program Comparative Analysis of Productive Youth Development The mission of this Collaborative Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program is to stimulate innovative, interdisciplinary, and comparative research of productive youth development. Participating institutions include the Institute of Education in London, the Universities of Michigan, Stockholm, Helsinki, Jena, and Tübingen. The major objective of the program is to promote the next generation of researchers and facilitate a better understanding and discourse with different stake holders about how to equip young people for mastering the challenges of growing up in a changing social context. PATHWAYS will investigate the antecedents, processes, and long-term outcomes of youth transitions, as well as the factors and processes promoting human competences, especially among young people deemed to be at-risk. Training and mentoring will be provided to enhance understanding of diverse approaches to the study of productive youth development and to engage in constructive debates with colleagues from different disciplines. It will help to foster international and interdisciplinary research and exchange of ideas, in order to gain up-to-date skills for addressing research and policy questions that require combined approaches and a synergy of ideas. A 'Virtual Institute Approach' has been adopted, not limiting activities to one physical location, but pooling the expertise of several partner institutions that are connected by shared research interests, projects and existing collaborations. The administrative core is based at the Institute of Education but many of PATHWAYS' activities occur at the participating sites. There will be regular joint workshops and conferences, bringing together scholars from around the globe, facilitating international networking and exchange.

1 About the Model What is it: The Cost of Commute Calculator provides a multimodal comparison of the expanded costs of transportation impacts in the Metro Vancouver Region. These include both personal costs, and costs to society. Trips: This analysis pertains to utilitarian trips only (i.e. non recreational trips). Time Period: This analysis pertains to travel taking place during the Peak Period on weekdays. ǂ The Peak Period is defined by TransLink as a morning peak (between 6AM and 9AM), and an afternoon peak (between 3PM and 6PM). Currency: All costs are expressed in 2015 Canadian Dollars ($ CAD 2015) Units Unit Cost per Passenger-Kilometer ($/p-km) Description Represents the average cost of moving one passenger one kilometer in the Metro Vancouver Region. Cost Structure Cost Component (Personal) (Societal) Description Components of the total costs of an activity that are borne by the user in normal market transactions. These may include the cost of a vehicle, price of fuel, transit fares, or travel time. Components of the total costs of an activity that are not redeemed by the user/consumer of an activity or service. These are offloaded onto society and are ultimately redeemed through collective payment/taxation. These may include pollution or infrastructure costs. Modal Characteristics Mode Passenger Vehicle Transit Bus Description Passenger Vehicle in these calculations represents a conflation of various personal (i.e. non commercial or service) automobile models. These include sedans, passenger trucks, vans, SUV s and Jeeps. These do not include electric/hybrid vehicles, compact cars, or motorcycles. Average peak period speeds were determined to be 29 km/hr including all time spent idling. Average peak period vehicle occupancies in the Metro Region were determined to be 1.2. Transit buses refer to all bus models operated by Translink in the Metro Vancouver Region. These include diesel powered buses,
2 Cycling electric trolley buses, hybrid buses, and compressed natural gas buses, each of various size and capacity. The physical and operating characteristics of different bus models affect both internal and external cost components. Average peak period speeds were determined to be 12 km/hr. Average peak period bus occupancies vary by route and were determined on the basis of the 2013 Translink Bus System Performance Review. + These calculations assume all bicycles to be newly purchased road/hybrid models. Average operating speeds were determined to be 12.5 km/hr. Walking Refers to pedestrian travel at an average operating speed of 3.5 km/hr. Cost Components and Classifications Component Description Classification Emissions The cost of airborne pollutants emitted from motorized modes. These calculations consider the economic and health effects of CO, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, SOx, VOC s, and Ozone (O3). Climate The cost of climate change effects resulting from Change CO 2 emissions from motorized modes. Infrastructure The cost of building and maintaining roadway infrastructure dedicated to motorized modes. Components include: Street cleaning, boulevard grade & trimming, catch basins/drainage, minor repairs, major road maintenance, bridges programs, street lighting, traffic signals, road markings, road signs, surface repairs, and capital costs. Noise Pollution The cost of noise emissions resulting from motorized travel. These costs include amenity costs (ie. the localized depression of rents or property values associated with proximity to highe grade noise), productivity costs, and health costs. Congestion The costs of roadway congestion imparted on other road users. These include travel time, operating costs, fuel costs, reliability costs, pollution and climate change, accidents, noise and decreased productivity added in excess of already present costs. Accidents () The cost of accidents specific to modes (i.e. the monetization of the risk of causing personal injury or death). Costs include minor injuries, major injuries,

The cost of operating the TransLink bus system as detailed in the Bus System Performance Review. TransLink has determined average cost per service hour as $98 and $61 for conventional buses and Minibuses respectively. The monetary benefit of operating/utilizing a particular mode. These may be derived from taxes, tolls, fares, or other charges. Operating charges depend on mode. The savings to the healthcare system resulting from partaking in active transportation. The savings derived from increased workplace productivity (ex. fewer sick days) resulting from partaking in active transportation. The cost of travel time while utilizing a particular mode. Travel time costs are adjusted for bus operating conditions pulled from the Bus System Performance Review. s The benefit to the individual derived from prolonged life and averted deaths resulting from active transportation. The internal cost of owning and/or operating and utilizing a particular mode. Operating costs depend on mode. º The personal risk of injury or death resulting from utilizing a particular mode. Costs include minor injuries, major injuries, and fatalities attributed to medical expenses, pain & suffering and loss of life. Special Notes ǂ Certain transit routes are not operational during the Peak Period or on weekdays. These are: 242, C19 (weekend only) and the N6, N8, N9, N10, N16, N17, N19, N20, N22, N24, N35 (nighttime only).
4 + Average peak period bus occupancies vary by route and were determined on the basis of the 2013 TransLink Bus System Performance Review. Peak Period values were determined as a weighted average of peak occupancy rates during the morning and afternoon peaks (6-9AM & 3-6PM). As data was unavailable, the following routes use an assumed peak period occupancy of seven (7): 609, C10, C11, C12, C19, C3, C4. This peak period occupancy was determined using the average of the remaining C routes. For those routes operating outside the regular model time frame (see above): N routes used average occupancies during weekday nights, and weekend routes used peak period occupancies on weekends. s The cost of travel takes into account operating conditions, commonly expressed using Level of Service (LOS). LOS rates for transit bus users were based upon average peak capacity as determined using the TransLink Bus System Performance Review. These produced scores from A to F. Passenger vehicle levels of service were set at LOS D during the peak period. Operating charges depend on mode: Passenger Vehicles Bicycles Transit Buses PST on Vehicle Finance PST on License and Registration PST on Chain PST on Brake Pad Transit bus charges are the portion of total transit revenues derived from transit bus farebox PST on Maintenance and Repair PST on Drivetrain payments. PST on Tire Costs PST on Rim Dedicated Motor Fuel Tax (to TransLink) PST on Inner Tube Dedicated Motor Fuel Tax (to PST on General Tune-ups CTFA) Provincial Motor Fuel Tax PST on Depreciation (general revenue) Carbon Tax PST on Bike Boots, Bike Jacket Federal Air Conditioner Tax PST on Panniers BC Tire Tax PST on Helmet, Lights º Operating costs depend on mode: Passenger Vehicles Bicycles Transit Buses Vehicle Finance Chain Transit bus costs are License and Registration Brake Pad equivalent to user farebox Maintenance and Repair Drivetrain payments. Although other
5 Tire Costs Fuel Insurance Depreciation Rim Inner Tube General Tune-ups Depreciation Bike Boots, Bike Jacket Panniers Helmet, Lights structures are available (e.g. monthly passes, seniors rates), for the purposes of this analysis, average user payments were set equal to a single adult fare of $2.75. Transit bus users also incur wait time costs, which were determined on the basis of average headways for each route. Accidents: Assumptions While the international standard for recording injuries has six categories, ICBC uses only three (minor injuries, major injuries, and fatalities). Data for fatalities was taken from the VPD because it is more detailed, with information on who was at fault etc., and this is the data used by the province. Fatality data only covers the City of Vancouver. Our assumption is that the rate is similar throughout Metro Vancouver. This is likely conservative, as fatality rates are likely higher in more automobile-oriented parts of the region. Accident costs are different for different bus routes, although there is a constant accident cost per bus kilometer travelled (BKT). We assume the more kilometers a bus travels, the more likely it is to be in an accident. Climate Change: Buses with a zero per cent climate change impact are the electric trolley buses, operating mostly in downtown Vancouver. Infrastructure: Data from Europe was used for this estimate as the factors measured in Canada and the United States do not go back far enough. Operating Costs:
6 The cost of cycling equipment was calculated from a survey of bike shops. All possible pieces of equipment were included to simulate the most conservative (ie. expensive) case of a brand new cyclist who buys all new equipment off the shelf. Insurance and maintenance costs for personal vehicles are based on the aggregate average mileage in Metro Vancouver. This is a similar methodology as that used by Canadian Automobile Association. Travel Time: Travel time costs are calculated on the basis of the value of travel time (VTT). The VTT is an index which calibrated the value of travel time. These calculations are a derivation based off the average regional wage, standardized by the BC Provincial Government. The VTT may vary according to mode or operating condition to reflect circumstances such as level of service/bus capacity (ie. user comfort). For example, buses such as the 99 B-Line that generally carry considerably more people than other buses and are therefore more uncomfortable, are prescribed a higher VTT. Wait Time: Wait time is based on the average headway of buses divided by two. With long headways, the wait time was capped at eight minutes, with the assumption that on infrequent routes people would check the schedule and attempt to arrive just before the bus. Wait times were also assumed to follow a normal distribution. This model does not include pass-ups, but does have that possibility. If data for the percentage of pass-ups were included, then headways could simply be doubled for that fraction of buses. Charges: The standard fare was assumed to be a single-zone $2.75, which is a high estimate because many people buy monthly passes or concession tickets. Extended Life Benefits: Calculations are based off the World Health Organization s HEAT tool. Health Care Savings: Calculations are based on a provincial government study of healthcare and morbidity costs associated with physical inactivity. Productivity Gains:
7 Productivity Gains are from the same study as above, but differentiated by the entity paying the cost changes, as there is a softer cost that comes with inactivity, like sick days, paid indirectly by businesses. Not Included: Costs and benefits that were unavailable for this analysis, but significant enough to warrant future investigation include: specific infrastructure costs for buses (i.e. bus shelters, signs, benches etc.), infrastructure costs for cycling and walking, parking costs, roadway land value costs, transportation diversity costs, land use impacts, water pollution and hydrologic impacts/costs and waste disposal costs and/or life cycle costs. A capital cost that is relatively small but could be significant is the overhead electrical cables to run the trolley buses. Data was not available.

41 QUESTION 3 Ms. Anderson also turns in a prescription for some syringes. She tells you she does not need the syringes since she is now using a pump and asks you to discard the prescription. What should you tell her? A. You are right. You will not use syringes anymore since the pump will be supplying all of your insulin needs. I will discard the prescription. B. You will still need syringes to give yourself meal time insulin injections in addition to your pump. I will fill these. C. You will still need syringes to give yourself basal insulin injections in addition to your pump. I will fill these. D. You might want to have some syringes on hand incase your pump malfunctions and you need an alternate way to inject your insulin. I will fill these just incase you need them.

LECTURE 4 Interdomain Internet Routing The goal of this lecture is to explain how routing between different administrative domains works in the Internet. We discuss how Internet Service Providers (ISPs) exchange routing information (and packets) between each other, and how the way in which they buy service from and sell service to each other and their customers influences the technical research agenda of Internet routing in the real-world. We discuss the salient features of the Border Gateway Protocol, Version 4 (BGP4), the current interdomain routing protocol in the Internet. 4.1 Autonomous Systems An abstract, highly idealized view of the Internet is shown in Figure 4-1, where end-hosts hook up to routers, which hook up with other routers to form a nice connected graph of essentially peer routers that cooperate nicely using routing protocols that exchange shortest-path or similar information and provide global connectivity. The same view posits that the graph induced by the routers and their links has a large amount of redundancy and the Internet s routing algorithms are designed to rapidly detect faults and problems in the routing substrate and route around them. Some would even posit that the same routing protocols today perform load-sensitive routing to dynamically shed load away from congested paths on to less-loaded paths. Unfortunately, while simple, this abstraction is actually quite misleading. The real story of the Internet routing infrastructure is that the Internet service is provided by a large number of commercial enterprises, generally in competition with each other. Cooperation, required for global connectivity, is generally at odds with the need to be a profitable commercial enterprise, which often occurs at the expense of one s competitors the same people with whom one needs to cooperate. How this is achieved in practice (although there s lots of room for improvement), and how we might improve things, is an interesting and revealing study of how good technical research can be shaped and challenged by commercial realities. A second pass at developing a good picture of the Internet routing substrate is shown in Figure 4-2, which depicts a group of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) somehow cooper- 1

This picture is closer to the truth, but the main thing it s missing is that not all ISPs are created equal. Some are bigger and more connected than others, and still others have global reachability in their routing tables. There are names given to these small, large, and really huge ISPs: Tier-3 ISPs are ones that have a small number of usually localized (in geography) end-customers; Tier-2 ISPs generally have regional scope (e.g., state-wide, region-wide, or non-us countrywide), while Tier-1 ISPs, of which there are a handful, have global scope in the sense that their routing tables actually have routes to all currently reachable Internet prefixes (i.e., they have no default routes). This organization is shown in Figure 4-3. The current wide-area routing protocol, which exchanges reachability information about routeable IP-address prefixes between routers at the boundary between ISPs, is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol, Version 4) [13, 14]. More precisely, the wide-area routing architecture is divided into autonomous systems (ASes) that exchange reachability information. An AS is owned and administered by a single commercial entity, and implements some set of policies in deciding how to route its packets to the rest of the Internet, and how to export its routes (its own, those of its customers, and other routes it may have learned from other ASes) to other ASes. Each AS is identified by a unique 16-bit number. A different routing protocol operates within each AS. These routing protocols are called Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs), and include protocols like Routing Information Protocol (RIP) [8]. Open Shortest Paths First (OSPF) [11], Intermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS) [12], and E-IGRP. In contrast, interdomain protocols like BGP are also called EGPs (Exterior Gateway Protocols). Operationally, a key difference between EGPs like BGP and IGPs is that the former is concerned with providing reachability information and facilitating routing policy implementation in a scalable manner, whereas the latter are typically concerned with optimizing a path metric. Scalability is typically not a major concern in the design of IGPs (and all known IGPs don t scale as well as BGP does). The rest of this lecture is in two parts: first, we will look at inter-as relationships (transit and peering); then, we will study some salient features of BGP. We don t have time to

This picture suggests that all ISPs are equal, which isn t actually true. survey IGPs in this lecture, but you should be familiar with the more well-known ones like RIP and OSPF (or at least with distance-vector and link-state protocols). To learn more about IGPs if you re not familiar with them, read a standard networking textbook (e.g., Peterson & Davie, Kurose & Ross, Tanenbaum) or a book on routing protocols (e.g., Huitema). 4.2 Inter-AS Relationships: Transit and Peering The Internet is composed of many different types of ASes, from universities to corporations to regional Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to nationwide ISPs. Smaller ASes (e.g., universities, corporations, etc.) typically purchase Internet connectivity from ISPs. Smaller regional ISPs, in turn, purchase connectivity from larger ISPs with backbone networks. Consider the picture shown in Figure 4-4. It shows an ISP, with AS number X, directly connected to a provider (from whom it buys Internet service) and a few customers (to whom it sells Internet service). In addition, the figure shows two other ISPs to whom it is directly connected, with whom X exchanges routing information via BGP. The different types of ASes lead to different types of business relationships between them, which in turn translate to different policies for exchanging and selecting routes. There are two prevalent forms of AS-AS interconnection. The first form is provider-customer transit (aka transit ), wherein one ISP (the provider P in Figure 4-4) provides access to all (or most) destinations in its routing tables. Transit almost always is meaningful in an inter-as relationship where financial settlement is involved; the provider charges its customers for Internet access, in return for forwarding packets on behalf of customers to destinations (and in the opposite direction in many cases). Another example of a transit relationship in Figure 4-4 is between X and its customers (the C i s). The second prevalent form is called peering. Here, two ASes (typically ISPs) provide

INTERDOMAIN INTERNET ROUTING End-hosts (ISP customers) Tier-3 ISP ( Local ) Customer Provider Tier-2 ISP ( Regional or country-wide) Customer Provider Tier-1 ISP ( Default-free ; Has global reachability info) Tier-2 ISP (Another) Tier-1 ISP Tier-2 ISP Figure 4-3: A more accurate picture of the wide-area Internet routing infrastructure, with various types of ISPs defined by their respective reach. Tier-1 ISPs have default-free routing tables (i.e., they don t have any default routes), and typically have global reachability information. There are a handful of these today (about five or so). mutual access to a subset of each others routing tables. The subset of interest here is their own transit customers (and the ISPs own internal addresses). Like transit, peering is a business deal, but it may not involve financial settlement. While paid peering is common in some parts of the world, in many cases they are reciprocal agreements. As long as the traffic ratio between the concerned ASs is not highly asymmetric (e.g., 4:1 is a commonly believed and quoted ratio), there s usually no financial settlement. Peering deals are almost always under non-disclosure and are confidential Peering v. Transit A key point to note about peering relationships is that they are often between business competitors. The common reason for peering is the observation by each party that a nontrivial fraction of the packets emanating from each one is destined for the other s direct transit customers. Of course, the best thing for each of the ISPs to try to do would be to wean away the other s customers, but that may be hard to do. The next best thing, which would be in their mutual interest, would be to avoid paying transit costs to their respective providers, but instead set up a transit-free link between each other to forward packets for their direct customers. In addition, this approach has the advantage that this more direct path would lead to better end-to-end performance (in terms of latency, packet loss rate, and throughput) for their customers. It s also worth noticing that a Tier-1 ISP usually will find it essential to be involved in peering relationships with other ISPs (especially other Tier-1 ISPs) to obtain global routing information in a default-free manner. Balancing these potential benefits are some forces against peering. Transit relationships generate revenue; peering relationships usually don t. Peering relationships typically need

Above all, these relationships are often between competitors vying for the same customer base. In the discussion so far, we have implicitly used an important property of current interdomain routing: A route advertisement from B to A for a destination prefix is an agreement by B that it will forward packets sent via A destined for any destination in the prefix. This (implicit) agreement implies that one way to think about Internet economics is to view ISPs as charging customers for entries in their routing tables. Of course, the data rate of the interconnection is also crucial, and is the major determinant of an ISP s pricing policy Exporting Routes: Route Filtering Each AS (ISP) needs to make decisions on which routes to export to its neighboring ISPs using BGP. The reason why export policies are important is that no ISP wants to act as transit for packets that it isn t somehow making money on. Because packets flow in the opposite direction to the (best) route advertisement for any destination, an AS should advertise routes to neighbors with care. Transit customer routes. To an ISP, its customer routes are likely the most important, because the view it provides to its customers is the sense that all potential senders in the Internet can reach them. It is in the ISP s best interest to advertise routes to its transit customers to as many other connected ASes as possible. The more traffic that an ISP carries on behalf of a customer, the fatter the pipe that the customer would need, implying higher revenue for the ISP. Hence, if a destination were advertised from multiple neighbors, an ISP should prefer the advertisement made from a customer over all other choices (in particular, over peers and transit providers).
6 6 LECTURE 4. INTERDOMAIN INTERNET ROUTING Transit provider routes. Does an ISP want to provide transit to the routes exported by its provider to it? Most likely not, because the ISP isn t making any money on providing such transit facilities. An example of this situation is shown in Figure 4-4, where C P is a customer of P, and P has exported a route to C P to X. It isn t in X s interest to advertise this route to everyone, e.g., to other ISPs with whom X has a peering relationship. An important exception to this, of course, is X s transit customers who are paying X for service the service X provides its customers C i s is that they can reach any location on the Internet via X, so it makes sense for X to export as many routes to X as possible. Peer routes. It usually makes sense for an ISP to export only selected routes from its routing tables to other peering ISPs. It obviously makes sense to export routes to all of ones transit customers. It also makes sense to export routes to addresses within an ISP. However, it does not make sense to export an ISP s transit provider routes to other peering ISPs, because that may cause a peering ISP to use the advertising ISP to reach a destination advertised by a transit provider. Doing so would expend ISP resources but not lead to revenue. The same situation applies to routes learned from other peering relationships. Consider ISP Z in Figure 4-4, with its own transit customers. It doesn t make sense for X to advertise routes to Z s customers to another peering ISP (Y), because X doesn t make any money on Y using X to get packets to Z s customers! These arguments show that most ISPs end up providing selective transit: typically, full transit capabilities for their own transit customers in both directions, some transit (between mutual customers) in a peering relationship, and transit only for one s transit customers (and ISP-internal addresses) to one s providers. The discussion so far may make it sound like BGP is the only way in which to exchange reachability information between an ISP and its customers or between two ASes. That is not true a large fraction of end-customers (typically customers who don t provide large amounts of further transit and/or aren t ISPs) do not run BGP sessions with their providers. The reason is that BGP is complicated to configure, administer, and manage, and isn t particularly useful if the set of addresses in the customer is relatively invariant. These customers interact with their providers via static routes. These routes are usually manually configured. Of course, information about customer address blocks will in general be exchanged by a provider using BGP to other ASes (ISPs) to achieve global reachability to the customer premises Importing Routes The previous section described the issues considered by an AS (specifically, routers in an AS involved in BGP sessions with routers in other ASes) while deciding which routes to export. In a similar manner, when a router hears many possible routes to a destination network, it needs to decide which route to install in its forwarding tables. This is a fairly involved process in BGP and requires a consideration of several attributes of the advertised routes. At this stage, we consider only one of the many things that a router needs to consider, but it s the most important consideration. It has to do with who advertised the route. Typically, when a router (e.g., X in Figure 4-4) hears advertisements to its transit customers from other ASes (e.g., because the customer is multi-homed), it needs to ensure that packets to the customer do not traverse additional ASes unnecessarily. This
7 SECTION 4.3. BGP 7 usually means that customer routes are prioritized over routes to the same network advertised by providers or peers. Second, peer routes are likely more preferable to provider routes, since the purpose of peering was to exchange reachability information about mutual transit customers. These two observations imply that typically routes are imported in the following priority order: customer > peer > provider This rule (and many others like it) can be implemented in BGP using a special attribute that s locally maintained by routers in an AS, called the LOCAL PREF attribute. The first rule in route selection with BGP is to pick a route based on this attribute. It is only if this attribute is not set for a route, are other attributes of a route even considered. Note, however, that in practice most routes in most ASes are not selected using the LOCAL PREF attribute; other attributes like the length of the AS path tend to be quite common. We discuss these other route attributes and the details of the BGP route selection process, also called the decision process, in the next section. 4.3 BGP We now turn to how reachability information is exchanged using BGP, and how routing policies like the ones explained in the previous section can be expressed and enforced. We start with a discussion of the main design goals in BGP and summarize the protocol. Most of the complexity in wide-area routing is not in the protocol, but in how BGP routers are configured to implement policy, and in how routes learned from other ASes are disseminated within an AS. The rest of the section discusses these issues Design Goals The design of BGP, and its current version (4), was motivated by three important needs: 1. Scalability. The division of the Internet into ASes under independent administration was done while the backbone of the then Internet was under the administration of the NSFNet. An important requirement for BGP was to ensure that the Internet routing infrastructure remained scalable as the number of connected networks increased. 2. Policy. The ability for each AS to implement and enforce various forms of routing policy was an important design goal. One of the consequences of this was the development of the BGP attribute structure for route announcements, and allowing route filtering. 3. Cooperation under competitive circumstances. BGP was designed in large part to handle the transition from the NSFNet to a situation where the backbone Internet infrastructure would no longer be run by a single administrative entity. This structure implies that the routing protocol should allow ASes to make purely local decisions on how to route packets, from among any set of choices. In the old NSFNET, the backbone routers exchanged routing information over a tree topology, using a routing protocol called EGP. (While the modern use of the term EGP
8 8 LECTURE 4. INTERDOMAIN INTERNET ROUTING is as a family of exterior gateway protocols, its use in the context of NSFNET refers to the specific one used in that network.) Because the backbone routing information was exchanged over a tree, the routing protocol was relatively simple. The evolution of the Internet from a singly administered backbone to its current commercial structure made the NSFNET EGP obsolete and required a more sophisticated protocol The Protocol As protocols go, the operation of BGP is quite straightforward. The basic operation of BGP the protocol state machine, the format of routing messages, and the propagation of routing updates are all defined in the protocol standard [13]. BGP runs over TCP, on a well-known port (179). To start participating in a BGP session with another router, a router sends an OPEN message after establishing a TCP connection to it on the BGP port. After the OPEN is completed, both routers exchange their tables of all active routes (of course, applying all applicable route filtering rules). This process may take several minutes to complete, especially on sessions that have a large number of active routes. After this initialization, there are two main types of messages on the BGP session. First, BGP routers send route UPDATE messages sent on the session. These updates only send any routing entries that have changed since the last update (or transmission of all active routes). There are two kinds of updates: announcements, which are changes to existing routes or new routes, and withdrawals, which are messages that inform the receiver that the named routes no longer exist. A withdrawal usually happens when some previously announced route can no longer be used (e.g., because of a failure or a change in policy). Because BGP uses TCP, which provides reliable and in-order delivery, routes do not need to be periodically announced, unless they change. But, in the absence of periodic routing updates, how does a router know whether the neighbor at the other end of a session is still functioning properly? One possible solution might be for BGP to run over a transport protocol that implements its own is the peer alive message protocol. Such messages are also called keepalive messages. TCP, however, does not implement a transport-layer keepalive, so BGP uses its own. Each BGP session has a configurable keepalive timer, and the router guarantees that it will attempt to send at least one BGP message during that time. If there are no UPDATE messages, then the router sends the second type of message on the session: KEEPALIVE messages. The absence of a certain number BGP KEEPALIVE messages on a session causes the router to terminate that session. The number of missing messages depends on a configurable times called the hold timer; the specification recommends that the hold timer be at least as long as the keepalive timer duration negotiated on the session. More details about the BGP state machine may be found in [2, 13]. Unlike many IGP s, BGP does not simply optimize any metrics like shortest-paths or delays. Because its goals are to provide reachability information and enable routing policies, its announcements do not simply announce some metric like hop-count. Rather, they have the following format: IP pre f ix : Attributes where for each announced IP prefix, one or more attributes are also announced. There are a substantial number of standardized attributes in BGP, and we ll look at some of them in

Recall that one BGP attribute has already been introduced, the LOCAL PREF attribute. This attribute isn t disseminated with route announcements, but is an important attribute used locally while selecting a route for a destination. When a route is advertised from a neighboring AS, the receiving BGP router consults its configuration and may set a LOCAL PREF for this route Disseminating Routes within an AS: ebgp and ibgp There are two types of BGP sessions: ebgp sessions are between BGP-speaking routers in different ASes, while ibgp sessions are between BGP routers in the same AS. They serve different purposes, but use exactly the same protocol. ebgp is the standard mode in which BGP is used; after all BGP was designed to exchange network routing information between different ASes in the Internet. ebgp sessions are shown in Figure 4-5, where the BGP routers implement route filtering rules and exchange a subset of their routes with routers in other ASes. In general, each AS will have more than one router that participates in ebgp sessions with neighboring ASes. During this process, each router will obtain information about some subset of all the prefixes that the entire AS knows about. Each such ebgp router must disseminate routes to the external prefix to all the other routers in the AS. This dissemination must be done with care to meet two important goals: 1. Loop-free forwarding. After the dissemination of ebgp learned routes, the resulting routes (and the subsequent forwarding paths of packets sent along those routes) picked by all routers should be free of deflections and forwarding loops [4, 7]. 2. Complete visibility. One of the goals of BGP is to allow each AS to be treated as a single monolithic entity. This means that the several ebgp-speaking routes in the AS must exchange external route information so that they have a complete view of all external routes. For instance, consider Figure 4-5, and prefix D. Router R 2 needs to know how

Only ebgp-learned routes are re-advertised over ibgp sessions. to forward packets destined for D, but R 2 hasn t heard a direct announcement on any of its ebgp sessions for D. 1 By complete visibility, we mean the following: for every external destination, each router picks the same route that it would have picked had it seen the best routes from each ebgp router in the AS. The dissemination of externally learned routes to routers inside an AS is done over internal BGP (ibgp) sessions running in each AS. An important question concerns the topology over which ibgp sessions should be run. One possibility is to use an arbitrary connected graph and flood updates of external routes to all BGP routers in an AS. Of cours, an approach based on flooding would require additional techniques to avoid routing loops. The original BGP specification solved this problem by simply setting up a full mesh of ibgp sessions (see Figure 4-6, where every ebgp router maintains an ibgp session with every other BGP router in the AS. Flooding updates is now straightforward; an ebgp router simply sends UPDATE messages to its ibgp neighbors. An ibgp router does not have to send any UPDATE messages because it does not have any ebgp sessions with a router in another AS. It is important to note that ibgp is not an IGP like RIP or OSPF, and it cannot be used to set up routing state that allows packets to be forwarded correctly between internal nodes in an AS. Rather, ibgp sessions, running over TCP, provide a way by which routers inside an AS can use BGP to exchange information about external routes. In fact, ibgp sessions and messages are themselves routed between the BGP routers in the AS via whatever IGP is being used in the AS! One might wonder why ibgp is needed, and why one can t simply use whatever IGP is being used in the AS to also send BGP updates. There are several reasons why introducing ebgp routes into an IGP is inconvenient. The first reason is that most IGPs don t scale as well as BGP does, and often rely on periodic routing announcements rather than incremental updates (i.e., their state machines are different). Second, IGPs usually don t implement the rich set of attributes present in BGP. To preserve all the information about routes gleaned from ebgp sessions, it is best to run BGP sessions inside an AS as well. The requirement that the ibgp routers be connected via a complete mesh limits scalability: a network with e ebgp routers and i other interior routers requires e(e 1)/2 + ei ibgp 1 It turns out that each router inside doesn t know about all the external routes to a destination. Rather, we will strive for each router being able to discover the best routes of the egress routers in the AS for a destination.
11 SECTION 4.3. BGP 11 (a) Routes learned from non-clients are readvertised to clients only. (b) Routes learned from clients are re-advertised over all ibgp sessions. Figure 4-7: Larger ASes commonly use route reflectors, which advertise some ibgp-learned routes, as described above. Directed edges between routers represent ibgp sessions from route reflectors to clients (e.g., router R2 is a route reflector with two clients). As in Figure 4-6, all routers re-advertise ebgp-learned routes over all ibgp sessions. sessions in a full-mesh configuration. While this quadratic scaling is not a problem for a small AS with onlly a handful of routers, large backbone networks typically have more several hundred routers, requiring tens of thousands of ibgp sessions. This quadratic scaling does not work well in those cases. As a result, two methods to handle this have arisen, both based on manual configuration into some kind of hierarchy. The first method is to use route reflectors [1], while the second sets up confederations of BGP routers [15]. We briefly summarize the main ideas in route reflection in this lecture, and refer the interested reader to RFC 3065 [15] for a discussion of BGP confederations. A route reflector is a BGP router that can be configured to have client BGP routers. A route reflector selects a single best route to each destination prefix and announces that route to all of its clients. An AS with a route reflector configuration follows the following rules in its route updates: 1. If a route reflector learns a route via ebgp or via ibgp from one of its clients, the it re-advertises that route over all of its sessions to its clients. 2. If a route reflector learns a route via ibgp from a router that is not one of its clients, then it re-advertises the route to its client routers, but not over any other ibgp sessions. Having only one route reflector in an AS causes a different scaling problem, because it may have to support a large number of client sessions. More importantly, if there are multiple egress links from the AS to a destination prefix, a single route-reflector configuration may not use them all well, because all the clients would inherit the single choice made by the route reflector. To solve this problem, many networks deploy multiple route reflectors, organizing them hierarchically. Figure 4-7 shows an example route reflector hierarchy and how routes propagate from various ibgp sessions. BGP route updates propagate differently depending on whether the update is propagating over an ebgp session or an ibgp session. An ebgp session is typically a point-to-point
12 12 LECTURE 4. INTERDOMAIN INTERNET ROUTING session: that is, the IP addresses of the routers on either end of the session are directly connected with one another and are typically on the same local area network. There are some exceptions to this practice (i.e., multi-hop ebgp [5]), but directly connected ebgp sessions is normal operating procedure. In the case where an ebgp session is point-to-point, the next-hop attribute for the BGP route is guaranteed to be reachable, as is the other end of the point-to-point connection. A router will advertise a route over an ebgp session regardless of whether that route was originally learned via ebgp or ibgp. On the other hand, an ibgp session may exist between two routers that are not directly connected, and it may be the case that the next-hop IP address for a route learned via ibgp is more than one IP-level hop away. In fact, as the next-hop IP address of the route is typically one of the border routers for the AS, this next hop may not even correspond to the router on the other end of the ibgp session, but may be several ibgp hops away. In ibgp, the routers thus rely on the AS s internal routing protocol (i.e., its IGP) to both (1) establish connectivity between the two endpoints of the BGP session and (2) establish the route to the next-hop IP address named in the route attribute. Configuring an ibgp topology to correctly achieve loop-free forwarding and complete visibility is non-trivial. Incorrect ibgp topology configuration can create many types of incorrect behavior, including persistent forwarding loops and oscillations [7]. Route reflection causes problems with correctness because not all route reflector topologies satisfy visibility (see [6] and references therein) BGP Policy Expression: Filters and Rankings BGP allows policy expression by allowing network operators to configure routers to manipulate route attributes when disseminating routes. Network operators can configure routers to perform the following policy-driven tasks: 1. Control how a router ranks candidate routes and select paths to destinations. 2. Control the next hop IP address for the advertised route to balance load. 3. Tag a route to control how the ranking and filtering functions on other routers treat the route. We re now in a position to understand what the anatomy of a BGP route looks like and how route announcements (and withdrawals) allow a router to compute a forwarding table from all the routing information. This forwarding table typically has one chosen path in the form of the egress interface (port) on the router, corresponding to the next neighboring IP address, to send a packet destined for a prefix. Recall that each router implements the longest prefix match on each packet s destination IP address Exchanging Reachability: NEXT HOP Attribute A BGP route announcement has a set of attributes associated with each announced prefix. One of them is the NEXT HOP attribute, which gives the IP address of the router to send the packet to. As the announcement propagates across an AS boundary, the NEXT HOP field is changed; typically, it gets changed to the IP address of the border router of the AS the announcement came from.
13 SECTION 4.3. BGP 13 Route Attribute Next Hop AS path Local Preference Multiple-Exit Discriminator (MED) Description IP Address of the next-hop router along the path to the destination. On ebgp sessions, the next hop is set to the IP address of the border router. On ibgp sessions, the next hop is not modified. Sequence of AS identifiers that the route advertisement has traversed. This attribute is the first criteria used to select routes. It is not attached on routes learned via ebgp sessions, but typically assigned by the import policy of these sessions; preserved on ibgp sessions. Used for comparing two or more routes from the same neighboring AS. That neighboring AS can set the MED values to indicate which router it prefers to receive traffic for that destination. By default, not comparable among routes from different ASes. Table 4-1: Important BGP route attributes. The above behavior is for ebgp speakers. For ibgp speakers, the first router that introduces the route into ibgp sets the NEXT HOP attribute to its so-called loopback address (the address that all other routers within the AS can use to reach the first router). All the other ibgp routers within the AS preserve this setting, and use the ASes IGP to route any packets destined for the route (in the reverse direction of the announcement) toward the NEXT HOP IP address. In general, packets destined for a prefix flow in the opposite direction to the route announcements for the prefix. Length of AS Paths: ASPATH Attribute Another attribute that changes as a route annoucement traverses different ASes is the AS- PATH attribute, which is a vector that lists all the ASes (in reverse order) that this route announcement has been through. Upon crossing an AS boundary, the first router prepends the unique identifier of its own AS and propagates the announcement on (subject to its route filtering rules). This use of a path vector a list of ASes per route is the reason BGP is classified as a path vector protocol. A path vector serves two purposes. The first is loop avoidance. Upon crossing an AS boundary, the router checks to see if its own AS identifier is already in the vector. If it is, then it discards the route announcement, since importing this route would simply cause a routing loop when packets are forwarded. The second purpose of the path vector is to help pick a suitable path from among multiple choices. If no LOCAL PREF is present for a route, then the ASPATH length is used to decide on the route. Shorter ASPATH lengths are preferred to longer ones. However, it is important to remember that BGP isn t a strict shortest-aspath protocol (classical path

INTERDOMAIN INTERNET ROUTING D SF C P NEXT HOP: SF MED = 100 NEXT HOP: BOS MED = 500 Figure 4-8: MED s are useful in many situations, e.g., if C is a transit customer of P, to ensure that crosscountry packets to C traverse P s (rather than C s wide-area network). However, if C and P are in a peering relationship, MED may (and often will) be ignored. In this example, the MED for D S F is set to 100 at the SF exchange point, and 500 in Boston, so P can do the right thing if it wants to. vector protocols would pick shortest vectors), since it pays attention to routing policies. The LOCAL PREF attribute is always given priority over ASPATH. Many routes in practice, though, end up being picked according to shortest-aspath. Choosing Between Multiple Exit Points: MED Attribute There are many situations when two ASes are linked at multiple locations, and one of them may prefer a particular transit point over another. This situation can t be distinguished using LOCAL PREF (which decides which AS announcement to import) or shortest ASPATH (since they would be equal). A BGP attribute called MED, for multi-exit discriminator is used for this. It s best to understand MED using an example. Consider Figure 4-8 which shows a provider-customer relationship where both the provider P and customer C have national footprints. Cross-country bandwidth is a much more expensive resource than local bandwidth, and the customer would like the provider to incur the cost of cross-country transit for the customer s packets. Suppose we want to route packets from the east coast (Boston) destined for D SF to traverse P s network and not C s. We want to prevent P from transiting the packet to C in Boston, which would force C to use its own resources and defeat the purpose of having P as its Internet provider. A MED attribute allows an AS, in this case C, to tell another (P) how to choose between multiple NEXT HOP s for a prefix D SF. Each router will pick the smallest MED from among multiple choices coming from the same neighbor AS. No semantics are associated with how MED values are picked, but they must obviously be picked and announced consistently amongst the ebgp routers in an AS. In our example, a MED of 100 for the SF
15 SECTION 4.3. BGP 15 NEXT HOP for prefix D SF and a MED of 500 for the BOS NEXT HOP for the same prefix accomplishes the desired goal. An important point to realize about MED s is that they are usually ignored in AS-AS relationships that don t have some form of financial settlement (or explicit arrangement, in the absence of money). In particular, most peering arrangements ignore MED. This leads to a substantial amount of asymmetric routes in the wide-area Internet, as we ll see in the next lecture. For instance, if P and C were in a peering relationship in Figure 4-8, cross-country packets going from C to P would traverse P s wide-area network, while cross-country packets from P to C would traverse C s wide-area network. Both P and C would be in a hurry to get rid of the packet from their own network, a form of routing sometimes called hot-potato routing. In contrast, a financial arrangement would provide an incentive to honor MED s and allow cold-potato routing to be enforced. The case of large content hosts peering with tier-1 ISPs is an excellent real-world example of cold-potato routing. For instance, an ISP might peer with a content-hosting provider to obtain direct access to the latter s customers (popular content-hosting sites), but does not want the hosting provider to free-load on its backbone. This can be achieved by insisting that its MEDs be honored. 2 Putting It All Together So far, we have seen the most important BGP attributes: LOCAL PREF, ASPATH, and MED. We are now in a position to discuss the set of rules that BGP routers in an AS use to select a route from among multiple choices. These rules are shown in Table 4-2, in priority order. These rules are actually slightly vendor-specific; for instance, the Router ID tie-break is not the default on Cisco routers, which select the oldest route in the hope that this route would be the most stable. Priority Rule Remarks 1 LOCAL PREF Highest LOCAL PREF ( 4.2.3). E.g., Prefer transit customer routes over peer and provider routes. 2 ASPATH Shortest ASPATH length ( 4.3.5) Not shortest number of Internet hops or delay. 3 MED Lowest MED preferred ( 4.3.5). May be ignored, esp. if no financial incentive involved. 4 ebgp > ibgp Did AS learn route via ebgp (preferred) or ibgp? 5 IGP path Lowest IGP path cost to next hop (egress router). If all else equal so far, pick shortest internal path. 6 Router ID Smallest router ID (IP address). A random (but unchanging) choice; some implementations use a different tie-break such as the oldest route. Table 4-2: How a BGP-speaking router selects routes. There used to be another step between steps 2 and 3 in this table, but it s not included in this table because it is now obsolete. 2 I thank Nick Feamster for educating me about this operational use of MEDs.

INTERDOMAIN INTERNET ROUTING /12 AND /16 AS 1 ASPATH {3 1} AS 701 P /12 P /16 ASPATH { } Announce /16 ASPATH {3} Backup Announce /16 ASPATH {3 3 3} Customer, C, AS= /16 Figure 4-9: Customer C is multi-homed with providers P 1 and P 2 and uses provider-based addressing from P 1. C announces routes to itself on both P 1 and P 2, but to ensure that P 2 is only a backup, it uses a hack that pads the ASPATH attribute. However, notice that P 1 must announce (to its providers and peers) explicit routes on both its regular address block and on the customer block, for otherwise the path through P 2 would match based on longest prefix in the upstream ASes! 4.4 Failover and Scalability BGP allows multiple links (and ebgp sessions) between two ASes, and this may used to provide some degree of fault tolerance and load balance. Overall, however, BGP wasn t designed for rapid fault detection and recovery, so these mechanisms are generally not particularly useful over short time scales. Furthermore, upon the detection of a fault, a router sends a withdrawal message to its neighbors. To avoid massive route oscillations, the further propagation of such route announcements is damped. Damping causes some delay (configurable using a timer) before problems can be detected and recovery initiated, and is a useful mechanism for scalability. With BGP, faults may take minutes to detect and it may take several minutes for routes to converge to a consistent state afterwards Multi-homing: Promise and Problems Multi-homing typically refers to a technique by which a customer can exchange routes and packets over multiple distinct provider ASes. An example is shown in Figure 4-9, which shows the topology and address blocks of the concerned parties. This example uses provider-based addressing for the customer, which allows the routing state in the Internet backbones to scale better because transit providers can aggregate address blocks across several customers into one or a small number of route announcements to their respective providers. Today, multi-homing doesn t actually work while still preserving the scalability of
17 SECTION 4.4. FAILOVER AND SCALABILITY 17 Researchers Finding Time-frame Paxson Serious routing pathology rate of 3.3% 1995 Labovitz et al. 10% of routes available less than 95% of the time 1997 Labovitz et al. Less than 35% of routes available 99.99% of the time 1997 Labovitz et al. 40% of path outages take 30+ minutes to repair 2000 Chandra et al. 5% of faults last more than 2 hours, 45 minutes 2001 Andersen et al. Between 0.23% and 7.7% of overlay path-hours 2001 experienced serious 30-minute problems in 16-node overlay Table 4-3: Internet path failure observations, as reported by several studies. the routing infrastructure. Figure 4-9 shows why. Here the customer (C) address block /16 needs to be advertised not only from provider P 2 to the rest of the Internet, but also from provider P 1. If P 1 didn t do so, then longest prefix matching would cause all packets to the customer to arrive via P 2 s link, which would defeat the purpose of using P 2 only as a backup path. Now, given that this route needs to be advertised on both paths, how does C ensure that both paths aren t used? One hack to achieve this is by padding the exported ASPATH attribute. On the path through P 1, the normal ASPATH is announced, while on the path through P 2, a longer path is advertised by padding it with C s AS number multiple times. A good way to do extensive multi-homing without affecting routing scalability is a good open problem. In addition to the fact that customer routes must be advertised along multiple paths, effective multi-homing today is often not possible unless the customer has a large address block. To limit the size of their routing tables, many ISPs will not accept routing announcements for fewer than 8192 contiguous addresses (a /19 netblock). 3 Small companies, regardless of their fault-tolerance needs, do not often require such a large address block, and cannot effectively multi-home. Notice that provider-based addressing doesn t really work, since this requires handling two distinct sets of addresses on its hosts. It is unclear how on-going connections (e.g., long-running ssh tunnels, which are becoming increasingly common) on one address set can seamlessly switch on a failure in this model Convergence Problems BGP does not always converge quickly after a fault is detected and routes withdrawn. Depending on the ebgp session topology between ASes, this could involve the investigation of many routes before route convergence occurs. The paper by Labovitz et al. from ACM SIGCOMM 2000 explains this in detail, and shows that under some conditions this could take a super-exponential number of steps. In practice, it s been observed that wide-area routes are often (relative to what s needed for mission-critical applications) unavailable. Although extensive data is lacking, the observations summarized in Table 4-3 are worth noting. 4 3 This used to be the case, although it seems as if they have relaxed this to /24 in many cases now. 4 These are, unfortunately, a few years old. I need to update the table to include newer results; e.g., from Nick Feamster s dissertation.
18 18 REFERENCES Correctness Problems In the next lecture, we will study routing correctness and anomalies in depth. We discuss three key correctness properties: route validity, path visibility, and route safety, and show how current interdomain routing violates all three properties some of the time. We also discuss steps that could be taken to achieve correct routing in practice. 4.5 Summary This lecture looked at issues in wide-area unicast Internet routing, focusing on real-world issues. We first looked at inter-as relationships and dealt with transit and peering issues. We then discussed many salient features and quirks of BGP, the prevalent wide-area routing protocol today. BGP is actually a rather simple protocol, but its operation in practice is extremely complex. Its complexity stems from configuration flexibility, which allows for a rich set of attributes to be exchanged in route announcements. There are a number of open and interesting research problems in the area of wide-area routing, relating to policy, failover, scalability, configuration, and correctness. Despite much activity and impressive progress over the past few years, interdomain routing remains hard to understand and model. The next lecture will discuss routing correctness and routing anomalies.

1 NECC Northern Essex Community College NECC College Math Tutoring Center Results Spring 2011 The College Math Tutoring Center at Northern Essex Community College opened its doors to students in the Spring 2009 semester. In Spring 2011, 1,064 grades were distributed to 1,049 students enrolled in college level math courses 1 during the term, 208 of which sought math tutoring services through the Center. As displayed in Table 1 below, the 208 students who participated in math tutoring in Spring 2011 averaged 8 total contacts with the Center and 842 contact minutes (slightly over 14 contact hours). Spring 2011 saw a decrease in the number of students enrolled in college math courses who sought tutoring services from previous terms, but averages for the number of contacts, minutes and hours increased dramatically between the terms.

9 Correlations A correlation exists when two variables are linked closely enough that knowing the values for one variable lets us predict with some accuracy the values of a second variable. Correlation does not prove causation, only that there is a relationship. While a correlation coefficient with an absolute value of 1 ( 1 or +1) indicates a perfect association, an absolute value of.2 or higher is typically worth noting. For students who sought tutoring, there was a weak to moderate relationship found between the total minutes spent in tutoring and A C (G =.263) and A D (G = 3.11) completion rates. Controlling for gender, results showed that tutoring had a stronger impact on males than females in Spring Females who participated in tutoring had a weak to moderate relationship (G =.268) with A C completion rates whereas males had a stronger relationship (G=.333). There was also a relationship between age and college math grades for A C completion rates. Students who participated in tutoring that were over 25 years of age had a positive relationship (G =.327) with A C completion rates. When controlling for race (excluding students who had an unknown race/ethnicity), minorities (American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Black non Hispanic, and Hispanic, multi racial, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) demonstrated a stronger relationship between tutoring and final college math grades than the majority (White non Hispanic) (G =.273 for A C and G =.341 for A D). Summary College math students who accessed tutoring services were significantly different from those who did not seek tutoring in terms of student status, age, prior math courses, elementary algebra scores, final grades, and end of term GPA. A higher proportion of those who participated in tutoring were female, minority, older, continuing students that had more earned credit hours, had higher A C and A D completion rates, and had higher end of term GPAs. An association between math tutoring and successful course completion was revealed through correlation analysis; the relationship between these two variables increased for female students, minority students, and students over age 25. Tests for significance also determined a remarkable difference in the distribution of math placement results between those who sought tutoring and those who did not. Results showed higher completion rates for several categories of placement groups for those who received tutoring in comparison to their counterparts in the same placement groups. These results are indicative of a relationship between tutoring and the successful completion of college math courses for students who test at college level, one level below and three levels below college level.

Business is pretty is easy to understand, sales less costs equals profit. Business is as simple as this equation; everything in business boils down to this relationship.
If you want to succeed in your new business, work to increase sales relative to costs: £10million of sales with £10 million of costs makes the same profit as someone who has not started yet! This seems obvious to me, but the papers are continually full of companies throwing away millions on trial marketing campaigns, clearly not really knowing what they are doing. The problem is often that there is a separation from the managers who make those decisions and the people whose money is being spent.
In most entrepreneur based businesses, costs literally come out of the owner’s pocket. The owners are more inclined to be careful with their housekeeping. The so-called dot com boom in the 1990s was a break from this successful pattern.
As the internet was getting going, greedy investors were happy to put billions in the hands of twenty-something technical experts. Few of these people had any business experience. The result was a boom fuelled by a gold-rush mentality. Internet companies got a bad name and then they found it hard to raise capital.
Some critics considered that these boom/bust companies were never proper companies in the first place and wrongly gave bad press to the potential of all internet start-ups.
Think of a business as a giant bucket where the taps pour in liquid gold. Your objective is to have the taps on full while making sure that all the leaks are plugged.
I see so many businesses where they have only one of these things working. A well plugged bucket without the taps on will not fill up. Taps on full, with lots of holes in the bucket will equally not fill the bucket up. I have seen so many owners rushing to get more sales to maintain the level in their leaky bucket, when what they should be doing is managing their costs more effectively. The way to start doing this is by questioning each and every one of them.
The purpose of a plan is far more than to raise money. Design it to be a compass that will steer you through every eventuality.
You should be constantly referring to your plan. Your time as an entrepreneur is your company’s greatest asset. Staying until the ship goes down can take forever and deny you the next opportunity. Stay focused on your long-term goal.
This sometimes means abandoning the direction you are going in. Entrepreneurs continually reinvent their companies and ideas. The main asset of the business is you, focus on that. If something has failed, the danger is in kidding yourself.
Don’t spend years drifting to a slow inevitable end, hoping for that big break, instead, take all that you have learned and make a better attempt next time.
Each failure is a step to success. Read the biographies of any famous entrepreneurs and you will realize that the secret of mirroring their success is not to be found in studying how they succeeded but how they reacted to their failures. Think of a failure as consultancy worth £100,000.
Always know the statistics that are relevant to your business. Cash in and out, sources of sales enquiries, etc. To navigate your ship you have to have constant updates of a changing situation in order to make meaningful decisions.
Non-entrepreneurs think that we find an idea and then run with it. In reality you need to look constantly for new opportunities, new improvements. It is an attitude of mind to look constantly. Remember that often a failure can be the creative grounds for the next launch.
Have you ever had a great idea and proudly told your friends of your innovation, then done nothing about it and actually watched somebody else do it and make it succeed? Entrepreneurs are not looking for their friends to admire then-ideas and intellect.
They are looking to change the world and make a pile of cash. If you keep throwing the dice a six must come up eventually. The good news is you are allowed as many throws as you want.

A year ago, DPK Public Relations was called into service to help West Fertilizer communicate in the aftermath of the West, Texas industrial accident. I served as the company’s primary spokesperson and provided crisis PR response and counsel in the days, weeks and months following the accident.
When we do this type of work, it is almost always behind the scenes. The impact on people and reputations isn’t always readily apparent. Sometimes, just articulating caring and compassion in the midst of tragedy can be an end in itself.
For instance, the statement we released on behalf of West Fertilizer owner Donald Adair was published in full or excerpted by media around the world. CNN’s coverage was unusually complementary, including this quote from Martin Savidge:
I also just want to give you some of the statement that was released by the company. We heard from them for the very first time last night. It’s locally owned. I’ve heard statements from companies in aftermath of disaster before, never have I heard one so heartfelt, and it reads in part,
“The selfless sacrifice of the first responders who died trying to protect all of us is something I will never get over. I was devastated to learn that we lost one of our employees in the explosion, he bravely responded to the fire at the facility as a volunteer firefighter. I will never forget his bravery and his sacrifice or that of his colleagues who rushed to trouble. This tragedy will continue to hurt deeply for generations to come.”
That’s Donald Adair, and he is right, it will be felt in this community so much long beyond the — well, after all of us leave here.
Also worth reading is, “Texas town holds no grudge against exploded fertilizer plant owner,” from Reuters.
Crisis public relations relies on authenticity and follow-through. In the case of West Fertilizer, we vowed to do everything we could to help investigators piece together what happened so no other community would ever have to go through this. It was a promise kept and I’m proud of that.
One year later, it is extremely heartening to see the progress being made by the community of West. WFAA TV’s documentary, “Rise Up, West,” does a good job of capturing the impact this event had on the town and how the town responded bravely. Everyone in West can be proud of what they have accomplished and what they’ve preserved.
I have to assume that whoever came up with the theme for the West High School Football Team is a fan of Bruce Springsteen, although I haven’t seen anything that overtly makes the connection to the term, “Rise Up,” and Springsteen’s “My City of Ruins.” The words below apply to West, Texas just as they did to Manhattan after 9/11:

Alright Rab, this should be sorted now. They should make the wording in the menus a lil more unclear. LMAO!!!!
I would LOVE to try to get some Bacon in a Frotress. Don't think the odds are too good though. Plus, that would be too damn expensive. But, what a payout you would get.

I created this FAQ because, after reading literally thousands of posts, I still see the same requests for basic instructions over and over in each Newsgroup and forum. There are many web sites with similar information, but many people either can't find these sites or they don't have web access. Since I have never seen a FAQ like this posted in any of the Newsgroups I read, I took it upon myself to offer this small contribution to novice overclockers everywhere. I don't claim to have all the answers and I can't guarantee that everyone will be able to overclock their Celeron, but after reading this FAQ you should be well on your way to a successful experience.
Overclocking is not recommended by any manufacture (especially Intel) and will void your warranty. I do not advise anyone to follow these instructions unless they are willing to assume all associated risks. I have consolidated in this document information that I've learned while overclocking my own system or that I have read about the experiences of others. Overclocking can damage your system. Working inside your power supply or wiring 110 volt fans can cause serious personal injury if done by the inexperienced or without the proper precautions. If you're unsure or in doubt about any of these procedures, seek professional advice. I am providing this document for informational purposes only.
If any one out there in Net-land has suggestions, comments or contributions for this FAQ, feel free to contact me. Frank Monroe - Email: monroef001@hawaii.rr.com
You've read a few post, maybe visited a few web sites. Everyone is reporting their success and claiming fantastic speeds from a lowly 266 or 300 mHz CPU. You're excited at the prospect of a high performance CPU for, essentially, small change and you want to get in on the action. The speed of a P2-400 or -450 for $90 or $150 sounds too good to be true. But wait, they're talking about S-codes, multiplier locking, Pin B21, CAS-2, and other esoteric terms. Names like Deschutes, Klamath and Mendocino are bandied about while you wonder what these words have to do with computers. Now you're confused. How hard is this going to be? Is it worth it? Do you need to be an Electrical Engineer to overclock a Celeron? In a word, no. With the right hardware and a little luck, it should be a snap.
As you may know, a given chip design is used for CPU's of many different speeds. The P2 and Celeron designs are named after Western US counties: Deschutes, Klamath and Mendocino. More on this later.
In theory, a CPU is tested first at it's maximum speed. The ones that pass the testing process at this speed are marked as such and sold as top-of-the-line CPU's. Those that fail at the fastest speed are tested at successively lower and lower speeds until they run reliably. These slower cores are then marked with the speed at which they passed the testing process and sold as slower processors. At least, that's the theory. No one really knows how Intel decides which cores get marked for a given speed. Several other factors, such as customer demand and production quality, affect how many processors of each speed are produced.
A CPU of any given speed can usually be made to run somewhat faster if one is willing to play around with the motherboard settings. This is the overclocker's bread and butter. Now, through a convenient turn of events, Intel has produced a CPU with an unusually high capacity for overclocking.
Intel has long controlled the high-end CPU market while it's competitors, Cyrix and AMD were gaining market share in the low- and mid-price range because of the popularity of lower priced PC's. Intel finally realized what was happening and wanted to recover the low ground while also keeping the high end market (can you say "total market domination"?). When Intel designed the CPU core for their newest line of processors, the P2, they changed the way the CPU was mounted. All P2's are mounted on a circuit board, called an SECC (Single Edge Contact Cartridge), that plugs into a special, patented CPU slot (Slot 1) similar to a PCI slot. [Intel calls the Celeron packaging a SEPP (Single Edge Processor Package) but it's still compatible with the Slot 1 connector, go figure.] AMD and Cyrix do not have a Slot 1 CPU, so if you want high-end speed, you need to buy an Intel processor. Thus the high-end market is preserved for Intel. Now, Intel needed a cheap Slot 1 CPU to corner the low-cost PC market.
Enter the Celeron line. To reduce production costs, Intel left out the expensive Level 2 cache. Also, to eliminate design costs, the original Celerons (C266 and C300) used the same CPU core as the new 350-450 mHz P2's (code name Deschutes). [Remember, design costs account for a huge percentage of the total cost of a CPU. Once in production, it costs exactly the same to manufacture a core destined for use as a 266 mHz processor as it does to use that same core in a 450 mHz processor.] Many media pundits immediately dubbed the Celeron a backward-stepping piece of crap because of the lack of the L2 cache. Later, perhaps due to the poor reviews from hardware critics, Intel released the Celeron 300A and 333 with 128 Kb of built-in cache. Again, they used basically the same core design with some modifications to incorporate the on-die cache. The C300A and the C333 modified Deschutes core carries the code name Mendocino. Since Celerons use a Slot 1 motherboard, you can't upgrade to one of Cyrix's or AMD's fast new CPU's later, when prices come down. They don't have Slot 1 CPU's and Intel has the patent. Now Intel has again regained a foothold in the below-$1000 PC market and insured that the upgrade dollars also come home to Papa Intel too.
Here's where it gets interesting. The fastest P2 CPU's (350 to 450) require a relatively new type of Slot 1 motherboard with the BX chipset. The BX motherboard runs at a bus speed of 100 mHz. They can also run at 66 mHz bus which allows them to accept slower P2 CPU's (233, 266, 300 and 333) and Celerons. The Celerons are supposed to be used on the earlier EX and LX generation of Slot 1 motherboards which run at 66 mHz only. Since the Celerons have the exact same core as the new architecture P2 CPU's, there's nothing to stop you from setting the bus to 100 mHz and running a Celeron at 400 or 450 mHz.
People started buying BX motherboards and Celerons and overclocking the hell out of them by setting the bus speed to 100 mHz. A chip meant to run at 266 running at 400 mHz and more was unheard of previously. It's all because Intel is trying to capture the low-cost CPU market without the R & D costs of a new chip. It's really a marketing stroke of genius when you think about it. Produce one type of CPU. Take the best ones, add 512 kb of fast, expensive cache and sell it as the top-of-the-line CPU for $700+. Take the rejects, leave off the expensive L2 cache and sell them as cheap Celerons. Except they're too smart for their own britches. The production yield of 450 mHz cores is too good and the "rejects" are too few and far between. Because they want to flood the market with $100 CPU's, they have to mark them as 266 to 333 mHz Celerons and sell them cheap anyway. It doesn't cost them any more since both chips came off the same production line. Because the P2-450 market is relatively small compared to the low- and mid priced market, the demand is greater for Celerons.
Celerons come in four flavors. The C266 and C300 without L2 cache and the C300A and C333 with 128 Kb L2 cache. Each type of Celeron has several slightly different variations, called a "stepping". Stepping 0 (zero) cores are the original production run. When minor imperfections (bugs) are found in the instruction programming (micro-code) of the core or in other parameters of the chip, they are fixed and the next batch of cores will incorporate the changes. This batch will be identified as stepping 1. If another change is required later, the stepping number will be incremented again. As each successive refinement to the chip is made, the next higher stepping number will be assigned. For many reasons, one stepping may be easier to overclock than another, but usually the higher stepping cores make the best, most stable CPU's.
An S-code (Intel actually calls it an S-Spec.) is a 5 character designation beginning with 'S' used to identify the various different types, stepping, voltage and packaging of Celerons and other Intel processors. There are currently 14 (as of 27 Sep 98) different S-codes for the Celeron family of CPU's. OEM packaging is just the SEPP in a plastic container. There is no heatsink/fan attached, so you need to buy your own. The warranty, if any, is usually only for 30 days and from the vendor, not Intel. The retail Celeron (sometimes also called a "boxed" Celeron) comes in a cardboard box with a pretty good heatsink and fan already attached. You also get a Certificate of Authenticity and an Installation Notes booklet in 11 languages, a cute sticker for the front of your computer and, most important, a three year warranty from Intel. The S-code can be found on one end of the retail box or on the back, left side of any Celeron SEPP printed circuit board.
No processors since the early 80486 CPU's have taken the motherboard bus clock and used it internally at the same speed. Remember the 486DX2? It took the 33 mHz bus clock from the motherboard, multiplied it by 2 and ran at an internal speed of 66 mHz. Modern, BX-chipset motherboards now provide a 66 or 100 mHz bus clock to the Slot 1 connector. Today's Celeron and Pentium II processors multiply this to achieve their designated speed. Without multiplier locking, circuitry inside the processor reads the multiplier jumpers on the motherboard via the Slot 1 connector. Depending on the setting of these jumpers (or BIOS setting for the Abit boards) the CPU then multiplies the clock by 3.5, 4, 4.5 or 5. Multiplier locking forces the CPU to use a multiplier that is pre-determined by Intel, ignoring the settings on the motherboard. All Celerons are multiplier locked. The C266 is multiplier locked at 4; the C300 and C300A is locked at 4.5; and the C333 is locked at 5.
Multiplier limiting (only affects P2-350/400 processors made before mid-August '98) uses a signal from the motherboard to detect the bus speed and then places an upper limit on the multiplier based on the bus clock speed. For example, with the bus set to 66 mHz, the processor can be set to a higher multiplier than it can when the bus clock is set to 100 mHz. In effect, this limits the CPU to a maximum internal speed while allowing lower speeds. With a 66 mHz bus, a "multiplier limited" P2 would accept higher multipliers than at 100 mHz. [The BH6 BIOS has a setting under the SoftCPU menu called 100/66#SEL. With the LOW setting you can defeat the clock limitation on certain P2 processors. It will not work on the newer 400's and 450's and it will not unlock the Celerons.] Intel says it uses multiplier locking and multiplier limiting to prevent unscrupulous retailers from re-marking processors to higher speeds.
Bus locking is a myth, at least at the present time. If it was implemented, it would prevent a processor from being used at a higher bus speed than it was designed for. For example, since all Celerons are meant to use a 66 mHz bus clock, bus locking would prevent the CPU from running at any other bus speed. Since bus speed is set on the motherboard, Intel would need to design and incorporate special circuitry in the CPU to detect the bus speed and compare it to the "proper" clock rate. Below is a newsgroup post about bus locking from a member of the Intel support team. As far as I was able to determine, this is a genuine post. [I have edited format but not content.]
First of all, "bus locking?" how feasible is this in a processor when the bus timing and clock generation is sourced on the motherboard? Think about that.
Yes, of course, you could specify something in the design guidelines for the processor. Given the current state of art in board design, I do not think this would happen on the processor side. In fact, what are you currently doing now? Would not a better description be "Overbussing" (i.e. using a bus speed higher than specified).
You can do what you want with your processor like anything else, but as long as there are those who wish to misuse and misrepresent Intel products to others for their own personal gain, we will take whatever means needed to prevent or foil these attempts.
To be honest, the needs of 'overclockers' pale to insignificance when compared to the specter of remarking and fraud. Intel is acutely aware of activity in this regard, and thus, the accommodation of variable multipliers and the like must be sacrificed to preserve the basic integrity of our product.
That said, perhaps you would like to convince the average consumer who was duped into buying an overclocked system of the need for this ability.
It seems to me your discontent is misplaced. It is the unscrupulous people that should demand your attention in this regard, not Intel.
The key, of course, is getting the right stepping of the right type of Celeron. First of all, the "wrong" Celerons are the C300 (without the 'A' designation) and the C333. If you plan to overclock your Celeron, stay away from these two altogether. Because of multiplier locking [see "What is 'multiplier locking' and 'bus locking'?"], the C333 severely limits your options. Reports of successful overclocking are very rare with these CPU's. While it's true that some Celerons have successfully run at speeds up to 500 mHz, these instances are rare [estimated at 5-10%]. If your C333 won't operate at 500 mHz (100 X 5), your only option (since the multiplier is locked), is lowering the bus speed to 83 mHz (415 mHz) or 75 mHz (375 mHz). Seventy-five and 83 mHz require the PCI and AGP devices to operate at higher than normal speeds since motherboards only provide the correct clock step-down dividers for the 66 mHz and 100 mHz clock speeds. [Some motherboards may correctly divide the 133 mHz bus speed, but then SDRAM timing becomes a major problem.] Many devices do not react well to this condition. Obviously, you are more likely to have problems at 83 mHz than at 75 mHz. The C300 and the C300A should theoretically have the same likelihood of reaching 450 mHz [estimated at 60-75%]. However, there is very little information on the success rate of the C300. [The reason may be that improvements were incorporated into the C300A that were not made to the C300. Remember the C300A uses the Mendocino core while the C300 uses the cache-less Deschutes core.] If you're are going to for 450 mHz with a 300 mHz CPU, why get a C300 when the C300A has the L2 cache for a few dollars more.
Between the C266 and the C300A, it becomes a matter of your needs and your wallet. Both Celerons are quite likely to run well on a 100 mHz bus. The success rate for the stepping 1 C266 at 400 mHz (estimated at 85-90% for the SL2QG and the SL2TR) is somewhat higher than for the C300A at 450 mHz (estimated at 60-75%). The C266 is cheaper, roughly 1/2 the price of the C300A, but it doesn't have any L2 cache. Though the lack of the L2 cache may not make as much difference as you might expect, it does affect overall performance some. In most 3D games (except Unreal) the lack of secondary cache makes almost no difference. Most other applications do use the L2, but remember, SDRAM at 100 mHz is pretty damn fast and you do still have the L1 cache. After you factor in the wasted CPU cycles looking in cache for data that's sometimes not there (cache miss), the speed disadvantage is less than you might imagine.
That said, the C300A seems to be the current favorite. Many people have decided that the extra cost and added risk is more than outweighed by the [IMHO, slight] performance gain offered by the 128 Kb of cache. A word of caution, the C300A does seem to be a little trickier to overclock. It occasionally needs more than the default 2.0 volts to be stable and often needs more than a stock CPU heatsink and fan. I've seen many more cries for help from people with an unstable C300A at 450 mHz than first-time success stories. Most people usually achieve their goal but some just never make it, no matter what they do. There are no guarantees with either CPU.
OK. We've narrowed the field somewhat, but there are still the different stepping variations to consider. For the C266 the best stepping is stepping 1 carrying S-codes SL2QG and SL2TR. Since the stepping 2 C266 is so new, there is very little known about the success rate of the SL2Y3. It may very well be as good or better than the stepping 1 CPU's. Before the release of the C300A, the S-code with the most successful reports was by far the SL2QG. The fan and heatsink provided by Intel with the retail boxed SL2QG has proved to provide more than enough cooling and there is very little price difference between it and the OEM SL2TR.
Both the of the C300A CPU's, the OEM SL2WM and the retail boxed SL32A, are stepping 0. Many people have reported that additional cooling helps improve the success rate of reaching 450 mHz. With this in mind, you may want to consider the cheaper OEM version and buy your own quality heatsink and fan setup rather than find out later that you need to remove the Intel-provided heatsink on the retail version. There is one additional point in choosing your C300A that bares mentioning. There seems to be a consensus that certain manufacturing plants have a higher success rate. The Malaysia plant has gotten the most attention as producing the best CPU's, but few vendors even let you request specific S-codes, let alone trying to specify country of origin. [This last thing about the country of fabrication is unscientific at best and most likely just wild speculation.]
There are basically two motherboards of choice for overclocking a Celeron, the Asus P2B and the Abit BH6. The BH6 is by far the most popular with owners of the C300A for a couple of reasons. First, it's the only motherboard that doesn't need a BIOS upgrade to recognize the C300A. Secondly, it allows you to increase the CPU voltage from the BIOS SoftMenu. This feature is particularly attractive since many C300A CPU's need a voltage higher than the default setting of 2.0 volts to be completely stable. Additional features that make the BH6 popular are it's lower cost, BIOS SoftMenu setup for all settings and an additional PCI slot.
In all fairness, the Asus P2B is also a very good board. Though it costs about $40 (US) more, some staunch Asus supporters maintain that the P2B is more stable and has a higher success rate when overclocking. The P2B does not have any built-in provision for changing the CPU voltage if it's necessary to do so, but it does have 3 ISA slots for those legacy ISA cards while the BH6 has only 2 ISA slots. The biggest drawback to the P2B is that you need to flash the BIOS to the newest version (1005) in order for it recognize the C300A. This can be problematic, to say the least, since you need a CPU to flash the BIOS and it won't recognize your CPU until you flash the BIOS. Catch 22.
There are other motherboards that can be used, however, I recommend at least considering one of these two if at all possible.
If you are going to use a 100 mHz bus speed, you should plan on getting PC-100 SDRAM memory. Many people have reported successfully using their old PC-66 memory, however, if you do try it and have problems overclocking, memory would be a likely suspect. You should also plan on starting with a minimum of 64 Mb. It's best to get 64 or 128 Mb DIMM modules since the number of memory sockets is usually only 3, or 4 at the most. Two 32 Mb DIMM modules will limit your ability to upgrade memory in the future.
Not all PC-100 is created equal and you usually get what you pay for. Fortunately, if you only plan to try the 100 or 112 mHz bus speeds, most good quality PC-100 memory will work. You only need the high-priced, premium "CAS-222" memory if you want to try 124 or 133 mHz bus speeds. CAS stands for Column Address Strobe -OR- Column-Address Select. CAS latency refers to the number of processor cycles from when a Read command is registered to when the data from that Read command becomes available. CAS-222 certainly won't hurt if price is no object, but the added cost will only buy you a few tenths of a percentage point of overall performance.
There is an excellent web site, called PC100, that will tell you more than you'll ever want to know about memory. The URL is listed in the learning resources section at the end of this FAQ. Here are some excerpts from that page (used with permission).
The fastest cas 2 parts that operate at cas 2 at either 66 mHz or 100 mHz will have a PC100 label on them that says PC100-222-xxx. Cas 2 parts that operate at cas 2 at 66 mHz and cas 3 at 100 mHz will have a PC100 label on them that says PC100-322-xxx. The 222 or 322 refers to the actual data programed into the spd eeprom chip located on the memory module that informs the motherboard exactly what the SDRAM module is capable of.
There are two aspects of system cooling that need to be considered, case cooling and CPU cooling. The power supply fan alone normally does not provide sufficient air flow to eliminate heat build-up inside your case. Hot air trapped in the case forces all components to operate at higher temperatures and reduces the effectiveness of convection cooling throughout your system. Many overclockers find that heat is their main enemy, especially if you find that you need to raise the CPU voltage. There are several things you can do to ensure that your case stays cool.
First, check the direction of air flow from the power supply fan. The best cooling is obtained by having the power supply fan draw air out of the case. If it draws air into the case, you may want to try reversing it. It's a simple procedure than can make a significant difference in case temperature. [Caution: Capacitors in the power supply can store a charge even after the power has been off for several hours. Make sure that the unit has been unplugged for 24 hours or more.] Remove the supply from the case and remove the cover. Most power supply fans are held in place by four screws. Remove these four screws and flip the fan over. Generally, both sides of the fan will have a set of holes so you should be able to re-attach the fan with the same screws. Reassemble and install the power supply. You should see a drop of several degrees inside the case just from this simple, free procedure. Opening the power supply will probably void the warranty on it so, if you're worried about that sort of thing, you'll be relieved to know that there are other things you can do to lower your case temperature.
Adding a second fan is a good idea even if you aren't overclocking. Many cases provide a location at the lower front that is designed for a second fan. Even if your case doesn't have a ready-made mounting point, you should be able to find a spot to install a second fan. Depending on the type of connector your fan has, you can plug it into the motherboard fan connector or use one of the extra drive power cables for it's 12 volt supply.
Leaving the case cover off is also a possible solution to overheating. Though not ascetically pleasing, it is a free solution that many overclockers employ.
Now that your case is maintaining a near ambient temperature, you need to think about the CPU. If your system crashes or seems to become unstable after a few minutes of operation, you may find that heat build-up is the problem. The fan and heatsink that is attached to retail Celerons is usually adequate to achieve the 400 or 450 mHz speed with the C266 or C300A. If you bought an OEM Celeron or if you're having suspected heat problems with your CPU, you'll need to buy a good heatsink and fan combination and install it on the CPU. Many vendors offer cooling packages with heatsinks and one, two or even three fans. One vendor (STEP-ThermoDynamics) even offers an electronic peltier system ($85 US) and another (Kryo-Tech, mentioned at Tom's hardware site) offers a $500 refrigeration system. While these expensive cooling systems work very well, most people find that a simple heatsink setup with one or two ball-bearing fans will provide all the heat dissipation that your CPU needs. A number of vendor and cooling information web sites are listed in the learning resources section at the end of this FAQ.
Be sure to remove all of the original thermal tape from the CPU if you're replacing an old heatsink. It's important to apply a very thin layer (.003 to .005 inch) of thermal interface material between the heatsink and the CPU. A little goes a long way since you're only trying to eliminate air gaps, not frost a cake. Too much is worse than not enough. Some interface materials are conductive so you'll want to be careful not to get any on the CPU pins or circuit board. There are several different types of thermal compound and some work better than others. Thermal greases are made by dispersing thermally conductive ceramic fillers in silicone or hydrocarbon oils to form a paste. Thermally conductive compounds are an improvement on thermal grease as these compounds are converted to a cured rubber film after application at the thermal interface. Thermally conductive adhesive tapes are double-sided pressure sensitive adhesive films filled with sufficient ceramic powder to balance their thermal and adhesive properties. As you can see from the table below, thermal tape is only slightly better than nothing at all. Radio Shack and most electronic supply stores sell small tubes of the thermal grease or thermal compound for $2-$5 (US).
First, set up your system and get it running at it's normal speed. Set the SoftMenu or the jumpers as directed in your motherboard manual. Install all your peripheral cards and software and test out the system. Run a few benchmarks at the standard speed so you can compare the before and after results. Only when you're satisfied that the system is behaving as it should and that it's stable at the rated speed, should you begin to push the performance envelope of your system.
Now you're ready. Neither the Asus or the Abit motherboards require you to cover pin B21 on the Slot 1 edge connector. It is ignored by the motherboard. Most other motherboards do require you to cover this pin to fool the bus speed setting circuitry into selecting the 100 mHz speed.
On the Abit boards you should reset your system and enter BIOS setup. Change the following options in the CPU SoftMenu:
On the Asus P2B you have to change a jumper on the motherboard. If you are set for the 66 mHz bus speed (as you should be if you followed the advice at the beginning of this section), you should only need to change one jumper. Power down and unplug the power cord. The jumper block that you need to set is located just above the primary IDE connector and it should be labeled "BUS FREQ". Your current setting for 66 mHz should be: FS0 1-2 (pins closest to CPU), FS1 1-2 (pins closest to CPU), FS2 2-3 (pins away from CPU). To set the bus to 100 mHz you need to change FS2 to 1-2 also. Now all three jumpers should be on pins 1-2, the pins closest to the CPU.
That's it. If it works when you power up, you'll be at your new, overclocked frequency. A C266 will be 400 mHz; If you're lucky, a C300 or C300A will be at 450 mHz; and, if you're really, really lucky, the C333 will be at 500 mHz. If your computer completes POST (Power On Self-Test), boots into Windows and seems stable, try running some applications. Run a benchmark or two. Let it stay on for several hours, cycling a game demo or benchmark. If it acts normally, except FASTER, of course, congratulations!
If it doesn't work at first, don't worry (yet), there are several things you can try before you give up and admit that you've got an "unlucky" CPU. Read on.
There are many things that can be done to coax a stubborn CPU into working. I'll try to mention as many as I can here. Above all, don't give up until you have exhausted all of your options. Some of the things you can try are free or low cost, while others may require replacing some expensive components. Whenever possible, try to eliminate the cheaper options first. Then, if you suspect you may need to buy a new DIMM or video card, try to borrow one from a friend first or try your CPU in another, successfully overclocked system. Remember, it might not be the CPU at all, but something else in your system that's giving you problems.
As mentioned in the section on cooling, heat build-up is one of the most common problems. It manifests itself usually after several minutes to an hour after start up, especially when running CPU intensive applications. If you system won't POST (Power On Self-Test), heat is probably not one of your problems.
1. Try leaving the case open with a table fan blowing into the case. If the system stays up longer or seems more stable with the table fan and open case, try some of the cooling methods mentioned above.
2. Check the temperature of the CPU (front and back sides) and your video card by gently placing your finger on the heatsink. Be gentle and only touch the heatsink while your system is running. If it's too hot to leave your finger in place, you definitely have a heat problem.
3. If the heatsink is applied with thermal tape, try removing it (be sure to get all of the tape off) and using some thermal grease and/or a better HS and fan. [If you have a retail Celeron that came with an Intel fan, I'd save this for last since many, many people have used this fan without problems. Lately though, I have seen cases reported where changing the HS/fan did help a retail C300A. It may be that the thermal tape does not provide enough heat transfer to the heatsink. You could try just replacing the thermal tape with good old thermal grease and reinstalling the same Intel HS/fan setup.]
There have been many reports of what is being called "burn-in effect". After running the CPU at an elevated voltage or even at the normal voltage while "exercising" the CPU (cycling CPU intensive applications), the processor somehow becomes more likely to run at the desired speed. The time required varies and it doesn't always work, but it's worth a try. If it doesn't run at 100 mHz bus, try 75 mHz or 83 mHz for a few days. Leave the computer on for several days straight. Give it a workout, then try it again at 100 mHz. [I have found some documentation on this effect in respect to audio components. Some suggest that it may have something to do with dopant stabilization and the dielectric properties fully forming in the tiny, in-circuit semi-conductor junctions, capacitors and other components.]
Sometimes a little extra voltage is all that's required to encourage your recalcitrant CPU to straighten up and fly right. You can adjust the voltage quite easily with the BH6 SoftMenu. It's a little harder with the P2B but you can still do it. With the BH6 you can increase the voltage in small increments. Put your system through it's paces after each step. If it still crashes, bump the voltage a little more. You can fry your CPU by increasing the voltage too much. Use some caution and common sense here. If voltage is your stumbling block, 2.2 volts usually does the trick, though some have required as much as 2.3 or more. The BH6 BIOS will not let you set the voltage higher than 2.3 volts without a special procedure (found on Andy Drake's site). All Slot 1 motherboards read the required CPU voltage through contacts on the SEPP (CPU board). By selectively blocking certain contacts, you can "tell" the P2B (or any motherboard) to raise the CPU voltage. Teflon tape is one of the best materials to use, however, some people have used nail polish (dry 24 hours before inserting the CPU) or other non-conducting varnish. You can even cut the trace, but this technique, while effective, is difficult to reverse (you need to re-solder over the cut). This procedure is fraught with pitfalls and, if done incorrectly, can jolt your CPU with 2.6 volts or more. Since I can't include pictures with this text document, I recommend examining a web site that illustrates and details this procedure, if possible (see the list of web resources at the end of this FAQ). Your choices are quite limited with this method, but if you have a P2B or other motherboard, it may be your only option. Notwithstanding those words of caution, here is the list of pins to cover to get the specified voltages.
Heat production increases when you increase voltage, so don't forget about needing more than ordinary cooling if you need to raise the voltage. One note of encouragement, there have been many reports of users being able to revert back to the normal 2.0 volts after a few days and still maintaining stability (see the section on "burn-in" above).
Try different versions of drivers. Try new video drivers, try old video drivers, try Direct X 5.0 and 6.0. Remove all your cards except the video card. Disconnect the harddrive and boot from a floppy. If you have two DIMMS, try with each one individually. Borrow better, or at least different RAM. Borrow or use an old video card. Overclocking pushes your whole system to the edge. There is no predicting what device may be extra sensitive to slight timing errors, data errors or excess heat. Many of the new video cards, especially the AGP cards run very, very hot. Be sure that video chip overheating is not what is keeping you from your desired speed. [My G200 AGP card has hit 145 F when I forgot to turn on my extra fans. You can mount an old 486 fan on it's heatsink for added insurance.] If you find a card, harddrive or device that's keeping you from running at 100 mHz, you'll need to replace it.
Try getting it to run after disabling the L2 cache in the C300A (L2 should be disabled anyway for the C266 and C300 which have no L2 cache). Set memory delay settings to higher values. Be sure the AGP setting (Abit motherboards only) is at 2/3. Set harddrive mode to PIO 4 or 3. [This is an area I hope to receive comments on from other experienced Celeron users. How about it?]
There are a number of things that could happen to your system through overclocking but, with a little common sense, you can remove most of the risk. Heat is the primary concern. The CPU is the system component that is most likely to suffer from excess heat. Higher clock speeds and/or higher voltage create more heat. Extreme heat can literally fry the CPU. Keeping the voltage as close as possible to the default of 2.0 volts and using a quality heatsink and fan will keep the CPU temperature within reasonable limits.
Long term effects of higher current produced by faster clock speeds can have more subtle effects. A process called electro-migration can slowly erode the microscopic circuits inside the CPU--causing the traces to spread and the semi-conductor junctions to break down--until the CPU eventually fails. This is a very slow process and it takes years. A modern CPU has a design life of 10 to 15 years. While the life of your overclocked CPU may be somewhat shortened, do you really expect to be using your current 300 mHz processor, even overclocked to 450 mHz, in even as little as 5 years? By then we'll all be overclocking 1000 mHz (giga-Hz) CPU's.
Since BX motherboards like the BH6 and P2B are designed for a 100 mHz bus speed, you are not likely to hurt the mainboard with speeds up to 100 mHz. The other components, however, can be negatively affected by bus speeds other than the standard speeds of 66 or 100 mHz. At all other speeds the PCI and AGP clocks are higher than normal (see the table below). Besides the obvious effects of increased heat generation, some peripheral devices are especially sensitive to timing problems when the PCI bus is over clocked. Some hard drives will trash your data if the PCI bus is clocked too high.
At the moment when you can’t sit down without your tummy tumbling over your belt, you actually realize that you have excess kilograms. In that decisive moment you are becoming aware that you need to shred the fat and get perfectly shaped body. But, besides physical appearance, excess belly fat is linked with heart disease, diabetes, liver failure, depression and dementia, as well so our goal is to reduce body fat.
Celebrity trainer, Kit Rich and co-owner of SHIFT by Dana Perri, says: “When you want to burn fat from your midsection it’s important to first look at what you’re eating. Before anything else, decrease the amount of sugar, alcohol and processed, starchy foods in your diet. Then replace these foods with high-protein foods and healthy fats like butter, ghee and coconut oil. Not only will this strategy boost satiety, which aids weight loss, it will also help the body burn fat.”
It is important to add some boost to your health, and incorporating apple cider vinegar into your daily diet is great way to do that. As Lauren Slayton, MS RD founder of Food trainer in NYC explains, those foods that help keep blood sugar stable aid fat loos, which will reduce body fat. When blood sugar, insulin is secreted and the more insulin is secreted which means, your body is going to store more fat.
Prepare mixture of 1 tbsp of ACV in water and top with some cinnamon. Bonnie Micheli and Tracy Roemer, the co-founders of Shred415, suggest you to combine some hot water with 1 tablespoon of ACV, ½ tablespoon of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of honey. According to them, this combo suppresses your appetite and in same time reduces water retention.
According to Slayton, omega 3 fatty acids contained in hemp seeds, chia, walnuts and salmon significantly increase lipolysis which means you will lose fat instead of storing it.
In order to boost the amount of thermo genesis in your diet you need to consume more lean proteins and cruciferous veggies. Juan Carlos Santana is owner of the Institute of Human Performance in Boca Raton, Florida, and he explains: “If most of your diet came from these two food sources, you’d work off a couple hundred calories per day just digesting your food—which is what you’d burn on an hour long walk. Ultimately this can help you decrease body fat.”
The personal trainer, Ajila Cherry and Founder at Functional Innovative Training says that water is one of the most under-appreciated magic fat-burning elixirs. She advice’s you to drink glass of water right after you wake up in the morning. Additionally, you should drink a full glass of water every time you eat, as the more water you drink, the fuller you will feel. In other words, it will be easier to cut back on unnecessary calories. As Ajila explains, water is the essential element of weight and fat loss, which will reduce body fat. But, many other experts and trainers also support this ideology. The celebrity trainer and creator of Methodology X, Dan Roberts says: “Every chemical reaction in your body needs water. Even if you’re just mildly dehydrated, that could affect your fat metabolism and your performance in the gym.”
After big workouts, your body needs good recovery. Namely, you need to replenish blood-sugar levels and to stop your muscles from breaking down. In order to do that, you should provide your body the crabs and starches it needs. After each intense session, your body needs more energy, and it is crucial to adhere to that, particularly because your insulin sensitivity and metabolism are highest.
Although it is important to treat yourself, you still should make sure you are eating right to make up for it. According to Kelvin Gary, the founder of New York City’s Body Space Fitness, only one meal is not going to kill your goals. But you need to be careful, as being consistently inconsistent will – for sure. When you have intention to cheat, you need to get constant with good habits and plan ahead.
It is highly advisable to avoid any diet versions of your favorite sugary drinks. Experts explain that these beverages and no better solution than drinking the regular product. According to recent studies, there is link between consuming diet sodas and the expansion of waist circumferences. In fact, the journal Obesity, published as story in which was discovered that people who drink diet sodas have much higher percentage of belly flab that those individuals who don’t consume this beverage.
You should try to incorporate HIIT workouts, instead of doing cardio every day. Rich says: “High-intensity circuit training with dynamic movements is one of my favorite ways to build muscle and burn fat all over the body”. He adds that there is no possible way to spot-reduce fat, but in order to lose fat overall, it is extremely important to train the entire body. For example, mountain climbers, burpees, push-ups and jumps squats are great exercises. In workout that lasts 40 minutes, you should do 20 minutes of cardio and reserve the other 20 minutes for circuit resistance training. He claims that after such workout, you will notice the difference in your body – for sure.
Cherry explains that any time some client asks for advice about how to lose fat around the midsection, most commonly she suggests them to do more cardio. Many clients are doing mistake when they should increase the number of abdominal exercises. It is important to highlight that cardio is the most efficient strategy and it doesn’t all have to take place in the gym. She advice’s her clients to walk more, get up every hour at work and take the stairs. So we should consider cardio and various activities to reduce body fat.
Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, CDN, CFT, co-author of The Nutrition Twins’ Veggie Cure explains: “Nuts like pistachios aid in fat loss because they’re a good source of protein and fiber”. She adds that this type of nutrients stave off hunger and ward off energy crashes which often leads to binges and cravings. In fact, they are one of the lowest-calorie nuts.

Happy Tuesday my fellow beauty lovers! It finally feels like Fall in New England this morning. It was in the 40s last night, though I expect another unseasonably warm week to come. I’m torn between being ready for Fall, and wanting to squeeze the last bit of Summer fun out of my days! I have a few new products to share with you today. It seems I am not keeping up with new releases as well as I used to, so I’m planning on sharing a sneak peek of some new beauty items that perhaps haven’t gotten a full trial yet. If you’ve tried any of these, leave me your thoughts below as I’d love to hear your experiences!
butter LONDON has a new eyeshadow/blush clutch called Glitz & Glamour. If you love cool purple tones, GRAB it! The purple-taupe shade has been my go-to for an easy wash of eyeshadow. The sparkly burgundy shade makes a great smudgy eyeliner. It also comes with a dusty pink matte blush, and On The Glow highlight pen in Moonstone.
Jane Iredale’s new Fall collection includes six shades of Smooth Affair for Eyes cream to powder shadows. These creamy shades can be used alone or used as a shadow primer. I’ve been testing Petal (sheer pink) and Canvas (sheer champagne), and can tell you the creamy formula doesn’t work alone on my lids. I’m going to have to do more experimenting to see how they work layered under a powder shadow. If you are new to eye makeup, and feel intimidated by a palette with many shades, these may be a good option. They are easy to apply and blend with your fingertip.
Touch in Sol Metallist liquid Foil & Glitter Shadow Duo, that’s quite a mouthful for a small double ended tube of glittery goodness, isn’t it?! THIS is my new eye brightening BFF. It’s no secret I love a good shimmery eyeshadow, and if it’s purple? Even better! I have shade #5, Lottie, which has a sparkly purple taupe cream shadow on one end, and loose red-violet glitter on the other end. If I’m being honest, I have mostly been using the purple cream shadow alone. It’s beautiful! If I do want a more bling-y look, I’ll gently pat a little glitter on the center of my lid. It’s a bit messy like all loose glitter, but sticks nicely to the cream shadow once it’s applied. I didn’t get any irritation on my sensitive eyes either. I want to try the other shades out asap.
BECCA Aqua Luminous Perfecting Concealer – I’m thrilled to be testing this concealer, which I will use over my HG Becca Under Eye Brightening Corrector. This lightweight, water rich concealer contains mica pearls to brighten skin and give a radiant look. With my oily skin, I won’t be using this on blemishes or redness but if you love a good Becca glow it’s going to be perfect. I have tested this on my under eye circles once, and I can tell you I love the light texture and powerful pigment. A light dusting of setting powder is a must for my under eyes to prevent creasing. I like this powder for setting.
Did you hear that Max Factor is back in the US? As a child of the 80s that started her love for makeup at a young age, this has me feeling all kinds of nostalgic! Max Factor was the first makeup brand I ever tried. I’m thrilled to see the brand back in US drugstores. The lipsticks are creamy and pleasant feeling, with an old school lipstick scent. Simply Nude is a pretty pinky nude shade, and Maroon Dust is the perfect Fall deep nude shade. Masterpiece MAX High Volume + Definition mascara has been my go to since I opened it. If you layer your mascaras to get the look of length and volume, give this a try. I haven’t heard if the brand is expanding beyond the current lipsticks, liquid liner, and mascara, but I am hopeful we will see eyeshadows, blush, and foundations from Max Factor eventually!
Clinique is another long time love for me, especially their mascara formulas. They have a new mascara, Lash Power Flutter-to-Full which has a dial tube allowing for a light coat of mascara or full on bold volume. I’m also excited to try out the new smoother High Impact Custom Black Kajal liner. 12 hours of lasting power from my eyeliner is like music to my ears, considering my Fall allergies are in full swing! I’ll have to check back with you on the new Clinique products, as I’ve only swatched them for now.
What new releases are you excited for this Fall? Can you believe it’s already time to start thinking about Holiday Beauty sets?!

Suspended voluntarily: The licensee is not actively engaged in real estate agency work and has chosen to put their licence on hold.
A person commits an offense if the person, acting intentionally or knowingly with respect to the person's conduct, discharges or allows the discharge of a waste or pollutant:
Anytime that you have questions, feel free to contact the City of Kilgore Code Enforcement Office at City Hall or by phone at (903) 988-4129. If you receive a notice of violation and need more time or more information about the violation, contact the City of Kilgore Code Enforcement Office.
The court is located at 929 E Main in Puyallup, in an area known as the Puyallup Executive Park (blue glass buildings). The Clerk's Office and courtrooms are located on the ground floor of the 929 E Main building.
If your ticket is not delinquent or in collections the court can schedule payments on a fine or penalty by visiting the clerk’s office during regular office hours and scheduling a payment agreement. The minimum monthly payment is usually $50 per month. If you opt to pay rather than appear for your hearing, as long as the payment is received prior to the hearing, full payment will cancel the hearing.
Posting the bail or bond (from a licensed bond agent who appears at the Clerk's Office for you) in the amount listed on your warrant is the most immediate way to have the warrant recalled from the system. This will clear any pending suspension action by Department of Licensing (if this is a criminal traffic case). Once the cash bail or bond is posted, it is held in trust until your next court date or until the judge orders it be released. Bail or bond may be posted at the Clerk's front counter (929 E Main, Puyallup) during regular office hours which are Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4:30 p.m.
In most cases if you are unable to post the total bail or obtain a bond and a public defender has been appointed to your case please contact your attorney. If you are not represented by counsel you may report to the clerk’s office and upon verification of your address and authorization of the judge, the clerk will assign you a warrant quash date. It is important to remember with this option the warrant remains in the system until the day you appear before the judge. Be aware of the possibility the warrant could be served upon you in the interim while awaiting your quash date.
The last option is to surrender yourself to the Puyallup Jail located at 311 W Pioneer in downtown Puyallup. You will be seen in custody on the next judicial day.
Yes. In 2013 Puyallup assumed court services for the City of Milton. Court hearings and payments for Milton Court are also processed at the 929 E Main, Puyallup location.
To be eligible for jury service in Puyallup or Milton Courts, you must have an address within Puyallup or Milton (depending on the court which has summoned you), must be 18 years of age or older, be a U.S. citizen, have the ability to understand and speak English, and have no convictions for a felony. If any of these criteria are not met, notify the jury clerk by email or letter of the situation.
To be excused from jury service, you must demonstrate that serving jury duty would be a hardship. Statute requires this be done in writing (email or letter) providing the reason / s you are unable to serve. The jury clerk will notify you whether or not you have been excused. Employment is generally not considered a reason to be excused from jury duty. For more information, review Jury Duty page.
If you've missed a court date for a minor traffic offense (mitigation or contested hearing) and payment has not been received, the failure to appear is reported to Department of Licensing and the case is placed into a collection process. Receipt of full payment or signing a payment agreement immediately following a non-appearance will adjudicate the pending suspension action by Department of Licensing. If you wish to reschedule a missed hearing, a letter should be submitted to the court as only the judge has the authority to authorize a new hearing date.
The primary collection agent for both Puyallup and Milton Courts is Dynamic Collections located at 790 So Market Boulevard, Chehalis, WA 98532. Their phone number is: 1-800-464-3457. There may be some cases prior to 2016 which may be listed with Puget Sound Collections at 1019 Regents Boulevard, Suite 101,Tacoma, WA 98464. Their number is: 1-800-922-8932. The clerk's office can advise you which agency to contact.
If your ticket is in collections and you feel there are compelling reasons that caused a late response or non appearance, you may submit a letter of “show cause” to the judge for consideration pursuant to IRLJ (Infraction Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction) 3.2(b).
Red light camera infractions are processed similar to parking violations. They are not reported to Department of Licensing and do not appear on your driving record. They can however delay renewal of your vehicle tabs if unpaid. The rules in responding to red light violations are the same as a traffic infraction. You must respond within 18 days to the notice either by
Community service involves volunteering time for a non-profit organization as a mandatory condition of your sentence (court ordered), or done in lieu of court fines (portions of your fees and costs may not be eligible for community service). It can be completed for any non-profit, tax-exempt organization of your choice, i.e. food banks, churches, Good Will, United Way, etc. It is important to note most assisted living or nursing home facilities do not qualify as non-profit. Community service is generally accepted in lieu of fines for traffic infractions, however, on criminal violations it must be authorized by the judge. The verification form required as proof of completion of your community service can be found under the court’s Forms section of the webpages, or they are available at the clerk’s front counter.
The application for a public defender is made available to you during your first court appearance (arraignment) or online under the Court Forms area of the Municipal Court's webpages. You must complete the application and be screened to determine if you qualify for an attorney. Applications are accepted at the Clerk’s Office front counter during regular office hours on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Please assist the clerk in this process by bringing the financial information required or noted in the application.
Yes, ma’am.. Birds of a feather, flock together! We must support each other in keeping the positive vibes flowing! Make is a great day Rhonda.
So true – “As a man thinks within, so is he! (Proverbs 23:7) Positive thoughts are so important. We are surrounded by negativity all day long. So long for the positive things in life and people.
So very true Marie! We are the by-products of our surroundings.When that vibe is negative, you’ve got to be very deliberate in not buying into the negativity! I will find the silver lining in every situation!

Bill Gates suddenly dies and finds himself face to face with God. God stood over Bill Gates and said, 'Well Bill, I'm really confused on this one. It's a tough decision; I'm not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in America, yet you also created that ghastly Windows '95 among other indiscretions. I believe I'll do something I've never done before; I'll let you decide where you want to go.'
Bill pushed up his glasses, looked up at God and replied, 'Could you briefly explain the difference between the two?' Looking slightly puzzled, God said, 'Better yet, why don't I let you visit both places briefly, then you can make your decision. Which do you choose to see first, Heaven or Hell?'
Bill played with his pocket protector for a moment, then looked back at God and said, 'I think I'll try Hell first.' So, with a flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke, Bill Gates went to Hell.
When he materialized in Hell, Bill looked around. It was a beautiful and clean place, a bit warm, with sandy beaches and tall mountains, clear skies, pristine water, and beautiful women frolicking about. A smile came across Bill's face as he took in a deep breath of the clean air. 'This is great,' he thought, 'if this is Hell, I can't wait to see heaven.'
Within seconds of his thought, another flash of lightning and a cloud of smoke appeared, and Bill was off to Heaven. Heaven was a place high above the clouds, where angels were drifting about playing their harps and singing in a beautiful chorus. It was a very nice place, Bill thought, but not as enticing as Hell.
Bill looked up, cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled for God and Bill Gates was sent to Hell for eternity.
Time passed, and God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was progressing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill Gates shackled to a wall in a dark cave amid bone thin men and tongues of fire, being burned and tortured by demons.
Bill responded with a crackling voice filled with anguish and disappointment, 'This is awful! It's nothing like the Hell I visited the first time!! I can't believe this is happening! What happened to the other place....with the beaches and the mountains and the beautiful women?

The NAR is panicking. That should tell you what you need to know. As we’ve argued, there’s no silver lining for housing in the plan to freeze foreclosures.
Thousands of first-time and move-up buyers who hoped to make a foreclosed property their new home now face uncertainty, anxiety and possibly remorse as they worry that closing on their desired property could be in jeopardy.
For many, the dream of homeownership could turn into agony if their home purchase is indefinitely delayed by a moratorium on foreclosures declared by some banks, the National Association of Realtors® said today. The moratoriums are needed, banks say, to review all of the foreclosures in their portfolios to make sure they’re in compliance with the law and that titles are clear.
NAR warned that a prolonged review process would have a damaging impact on many communities and hinder the nation’s economic recovery.
“As the leading advocate for homeownership issues, we understand that many lenders need a time-out to review their actions to ensure that homeowners are not improperly foreclosed on and that the lenders are following regulations and state laws. After that, the foreclosure process must resume quickly to return stability to families, the housing market and the economy,” said NAR President Vicki Cox Golder, owner of Vicki L. Cox & Associates, Tucson, Ariz.
Over the past few months NAR has met with officials of top banks to discuss market issues. NAR urged banking leaders to seek resolution quickly through loan modifications and the short-sale process rather than through foreclosure. “We stand ready to help lenders develop better short-sale procedures,” Golder said.
“There are valid foreclosures that should move ahead quickly, and we shouldn’t lump them in with mortgages that are suspect. That would cause deep problems in an already fragile market and throw many families into uncertainty,” Golder said.
Golder said that she is receiving reports from Realtors® that the moratorium is already creating some anxiety among purchasers as transactions are being delayed and that some foreclosure listings are being removed from the market.
Compounding the problem is that the requirements for foreclosure vary by state, and practices to meet these requirements vary by firm. NAR is working with regulators, such as the Federal Housing Finance Agency; and encouraging them to identify and quickly address process problems.
In a letter today to the U.S Treasury Department, the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, NAR stated the hope that banks would complete their foreclosure review expeditiously to assure that the rights of borrowers are protected and remove doubt that buyers will receive clear title to their purchase.
“NAR has long urged the lending industry to take every feasible action to keep families in their homes with a loan modification and, if that is not possible, to give them a ‘graceful exit’ through a short sale. These options are far better than a foreclosure, and nothing has driven this point home more clearly than the questions being raised about foreclosures. Lenders should place additional resources into processing loan modifications and short sales,” NAR wrote.
A year ago, NAR instituted a special short sale training program for its Realtor® members to work more closely with banks in expediting mortgages at risk by resolving them through short sales and loan modifications. More than 51,000 Realtors® have been certified in the program.
The National Association of Realtors®, “The Voice for Real Estate,” is America’s largest trade association, representing 1.1 million members involved in all aspects of the residential and commercial real estate industries.

Customer service is an on going process in any and all business ventures. Whether your a one person team, or an organization with thousands of employees, customer service is a part of your business that is not departmental, and should never be overlooked. Customer service tends to be placed in a department, but the truth is, your companies customer service department is the entire organization, and one of the biggest issues that damages your companies relationship with your customers across all departments is “The Follow Through”. A customer, whether satisfied or not, will not necessarily voice their opinion to the “Customer Service” department, rather, the first person he or she can contact. This could be the front desk staff at a hotel, the store counter clerk, the janitor, the customer service phone line, and the list goes on. In fact the list goes on to include every single person that works within your organization, and many times, the complaint, or even the positive feedback will stop at that person, never making it to the designated customer service team for proper follow through.
This can be and probably is a major issue that is costing your business customers and revenue. When a customer calls in with an issue, and the first person he or she speaks to is the accounting manager for instance, do you know for sure that the message is being relayed properly to the customer service team? This customer complaint could be left on a voice mail message, and never go any further than the delete button if an employee has the “This is not my department” mindset. With customer service, there is no department, and customer satisfaction must be accomplished by every department within your organization.
If your company has not done so already, it is time to put a system in place to educate all departments on the importance of customer service, and the follow through. Whether in the form of positive feedback, or negative feedback, all customer correspondence must be forwarded to the customer service team for follow up and follow through, if it cannot be handled by the department originating the feedback. Even if the issue is properly handled by the original department, there is still a need for additional follow up by the customer service team to verify customer satisfaction, therefore the customer service team should be notified of any and all complaints for further follow through.
Customer service should remain a team effort, that is handled organization wide, with constant communication not only with the customers, but within every department internally. This will ensure customer satisfaction and growth in customer loyalty.

I'm currently moving ahead on the proportional controls for a set of cooling vats. I'll be using Solo SL4824-CR temperature controllers to provide proportional-only control. Given that these tanks will be in close proximity, and in straight rows, I'll be connecting all the controllers with RS-485 and using a Modbus RTU to Modbus TCP gateway to read/write set value and read the process values.
Right now, I will need a Modbus RTU to Modbus TCP gateway to connect to a PLC and provide integration with a Glycol chiller. Does anyone have any suggestions on a solid, cost-effective device? This is my first time building a RS-485 network from scratch.
What model of PLC controller will you be using ? It might matter, because some of them treat Modbus/RTU devices like I/O (I'm thinking about the Modicon M340) but most treat them like messaging peers.
There are a handful of well regarded providers of robust Modbus/TCP to Modbus RTU bridges. The best ones, in my opinion, are:
But don't get a general-purpose "serial server" with RS-485 on one side and Ethernet on the other. You need something that's built to understand both Modbus/TCP and Modbus RTU.
If you were using a PC and not a PLC, you might be able to use a general purpose serial server because the PC would be running a virtual serial port and could simply run a Modbus RTU driver directly. But a PLC is going to expect to use Modbus TCP, not just "encapsulated" Modbus RTU.
I realize that you did ask for a recommendation for a "solid, cost effective" unit and you aren't as concerned about flexibility.
1. The device comes as a Modbus version (as opposed to generic serial server), but Modbus firmware is not installed when you take it out of the box. It's on the CD or available as a download, but the firmware needs to be installed.
2. The module is DIN rail mount but does not have removeable screw terminals. If the device needs to be replaced, the wiring needs to be moved screw terminal by screw terminal.
3. If I recall properly, there's a Windows software installer package the assigns an IP address to the module and manages the Modbus firmware download to the module, and includes a telnet app that is used to configure the serial side of the gateway; very 1970-ish, but it works.
My advice is to make sure whichever one you work with, make sure that it is made for Modbus, so that it packs message frames on both sides properly.
Thanks for the info. I'm about to wrap up for the day. Gotta love laying out terminal blocks by hand
I'm not sure on the PLC yet, as I'm not that far into it. I was thinking about using a Click PLC to read the modbus values for alarming and to interface with the SCADA and HMI, and at first I will likely just connect the PLC to the RS-485 network, as it will only be used to start and stop the glycol chillers at the moment so that we can get him up and running by April.
Eventually I'll be pumping all this data into their process tracking software, hence the reason I want to put each group of tanks on a gateway.
If you use a Click with the Ethernet Port you could use the PLC as your Modbus RTU to Modbus TCP Gateway. They have a 485 port to communicate with the Controllers and a Ethernet Port to go to a HMI or SCADA System.
I've used the Moxa MB3180 several times for this purpose, and it's a rock solid reliable product in my experience.
Maybe I am misunderstanding what the OP is wanting to do but, couldn't sparkie use the 485 port as a Modbus Master connected to the Temp. Controllers? The Serial Port would Write the Setpoint and Deadband to the controller and read other data that is required.
The Ethernet Port would then be a Modbus TCP/IP Server. The HMI/SCADA would send the Setpoint & Deadband to a PLC Modbus Register (which would then be sent out of the Serial Port). The HMI/SCADA could also read all the data from the PLC that is read from the Temp Controllers.
Yes, that would work, but would probably require more time to set up than a generic gateway and would be more application specific. Changes to the addressing used would require changes in the Click too. If you knew you were only going to use those addresses and not modify it after it was all set up, it might not be any more work.
The reason I can't just use a Click as a modbus gateway is because these tanks will be grouped by 10's, and they will be adding tanks in off numbers, such as 3 or 4 at a time as they get them up and running and expand. So I feel the best route would be to keep each RS-485 network separate, and use a modbus gateway at each group of tanks. Then the PLC and SCADA systems can use eithernet. This enables me to significantly reduce the amount of wire that must be pulled to each panel. We can, for instance, use a single 20A circuit for power at each set of tanks and an ethernet wire to the gateway. Everything else is local to the tanks.
However, you are on to something. If I use a small click panel at each set of tanks, I have less distance to run instrument wire, and can use the click as the gateway. I would have to set up the polling times for info, and work a little handshaking magic, but that might be the best way to go.

For those of you coffee drinkers who absolutely love coffee but have challenges digesting the everyday pick me up, try cold brewing your coffee! Instead of using hot water, you use cold, resulting in a concentrate that is super low in acidity, and very tasty! It takes some time and patience, but worth every minute.
1. Pick up your favorite coffee beans, and opt for course grind. Note, there is a debate about fine vs. course. Choose which one makes the most sense for your brewing method. For you tea lovers out there, check out this link to make cold brew tea.
2. Without purchasing a Toddy, (which works wonders) there are many ways of cold brewing with equipment most coffee lovers already have sitting in their kitchen. You can use a french press, a jar, pitcher or anything that can hold water + coffee (since it takes a while to make, opt for a larger vessel, you will get a greater return on your investment). You will also need some sort of strainer, like cheesecloth or coffee filters and a sieve or colander.
3. The usual ratio is 1/3 cup of ground coffee to 1 cup of water. Slowly pour water over your brew, and do not mix.
4. Cover your brew, and let it sit on your counter for up to 24 hours. The longer you leave it, the stronger it gets. Optimal time is anywhere between 12-18 hours.
5. Strain your coffee into another vessel, through a sieve/colander lined with cheesecloth or a coffee filter. The resulting liquid is your delicious coffee concentrate.
6. Keep sealed and refrigerate for up to two weeks. If you make a huge batch and know that you won’t drink it within that time frame, you can freeze it. Tastes best within 1 week, but it can manage to still taste lovely within 2 weeks.
7. Make sure to dilute before drinking. Add ice to a glass, pour in 1/2 part coffee and 1/2 part water, if you like it strong, or 1/3 part coffee and 1/2 part water, if you like it more subtle. Then add milk or sugar, some people even add salt! For a cold winter day, you can heat up your cold brew over the stove or in the effective, albeit less desirable microwave. Dilute it as you would your iced coffee, and enjoy a hot cup of cold brew.

Every five years, a new Farm Bill is passed. What is the farm bill? One of the most significant legislations affecting food, farming, nutrition, and land-use in the United States.
The first Farm Bill was enacted after the Great Depression with the dual goals of supporting American farmers and helping them maintain their land. The last Farm Bill was passed in 2008 and expires on September 30th of this year (that’s in 5 days!).
The Farm Bill programs have a strong influence on what food is available, how it is produced, food security, farmer livelihoods, and environmental consequences, as well as having notable international impacts. Together, these various initiatives significantly impact public health.
More than 60 percent of Farm Bill funding is allocated to food assistance programs. Since 2008, the food stamp program has doubled in cost to a pricy $80 billion a year, helping to feed almost 46 million Americans, or 1 out of every 7th person.

Sixteen years ago, Alice Waters partnered with the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, and their school community to start an edible garden, whose purpose was to create an experiential learning space that delved into various school subjects. Through strong community support, Alice Waters spearheaded the transformation of a concrete playground into an edible schoolyard, and in turn started a local food revolution.Since then, many schools have followed suit, encouraging the growth of school gardens, greenhouses, cooking programs and gardening initiatives all across the country, and world.
Across the pond, in an East London school community, shoots and similar ideas are sprouting. Spearheaded by parent, Cassie Liversidge, the Chisenhale Primary School has grown it’s very own edible playground.
The playground boasts a bounty of fresh fruits, veggies, and even wheat, which they mill in class, and transform into fresh loaves of bread, in collaboration with the “lessons in loaf” curriculum. Some of their local produce is used in their cafeteria, so that the children can eat their very own harvested food at lunchtime.
The children all have a hand in planting, weeding, harvesting and even selling! By smartly partnering with the Royal Horticultural Society Campaign for School Gardening, School Food Matters, and Waitrose, they are bringing the community together all in the name of good food education.
For more information on the Chisenhale Primary School edible playground, check out the Edible Schoolyard’s website here. To hear Cassie speak about the transformation she helped spark, watch her inspiring video here, friend her facebook page, and follow her on twitter.

Two weeks ago, Stanford University published their controversial study in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluding that organic produce has no added nutritional health benefits over their conventionally grown counterparts.
However, one of the few distinguishable advantages of organic fruits and vegetables is that there is a lower risk of pesticide exposure. Despite this, the conventionally grown produce that was reviewed contained pesticide levels within the safety limits set by the EPA.
It was noted in the study that children are especially vulnerable when it comes to pesticide exposure, since they are maturing and their immune systems are more sensitive. Because childhood is a critical period in human development, exposure to pesticides during that time may cause adverse effects.
According to the FDA, foods labeled “organic” must be certified under the National Organic Program. They must also be grown and processed using organic farming methods that promote biodiversity and recycling. Synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, bioengineered genes, antibiotics, hormones, and radiation cannot be used. For more information on organic food labels, click here. To read about the challenges small farmers face should they chose to become certified organic, click here.
In the study it was found that organic produce has a 30 percent lower risk of containing detectable pesticide levels. The Environmental Working Group has compiled a list of the twelve foods containing the highest levels of pesticides, calling them the Dirty Dozen (with apples, celery, and bell peppers at the head of list). The Clean 15 on the other hand are the foods lowest in pesticides, with onions, sweet corn, and pineapple as the top three least contaminated. Here is their methodology.
What this study did not focus on, was the nutritional, environmental and community value of locally grown produce. Eating local produce offers various health benefits for our bodies, and our planet. According to the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, the top five reasons to eat locally are:
At Butter Beans, we have created close relationships with local food purveyors, purchasing as much of our produce as possible from nearby farmers to provide the freshest and most nutritious food to our students. A list of our suppliers can be found here.
Despite the emphatic reactions to this food study, it’s a step in the right direction for the quality and safety of the food we eat daily. This sort of dialogue shows that our communities are taking more interest in different methods of food production, which trickles down to how we feed our families. It is of utmost importance that we nourish ourselves everyday with fresh fruits and vegetables.
First Lady, Michelle Obama sums it up pretty well: “We can make a commitment to promote vegetables and fruits and whole grains on every part of every menu. We can make portion sizes smaller and emphasize quality over quantity. And we can help create a culture — imagine this — where our kids ask for healthy options instead of resisting them.”

James, “Gandhi” was released in 1982, altho' I agree, I don’t recall the Medallion being a 70mm showcase until “Rollerball” and later.
Sam, that other drive-in was the Starlite, billed on the screen tower as “Southwest’s Finest For Colored Americans.”
Adding to my above post, I have recently found out that whole Oak Lawn/Lemmon Ave. area (which I only heard referred to as the Lemmon/Oak Lawn area when I was growing up in Dallas from ‘58 – '79) used to be called the Melrose district – think that was the name of the area’s old telephone exchange, IIRC. The historic and refurbished Melrose Hotel is just down Oak Lawn from the old Esquire/Melrose location.
Oh, one other little point: someone posted that this theater was changed into a multi-screen in the 1960’s – not true. As of summer 1969 it was still in its original single-screen configuration. It was one of several McLendon theaters that hosted the world premiere of “True Grit” with John Wayne being carted around in a McLendon limo to each theater to make his appearance after the film’s showing. The other theaters were (I believe) the Preston Royal, Park Forest, and several McLendon drive-ins. Sometime in the early 1970’s is when the “twinning” or “tripling” took place, just in time for the auditorium in what had been the mezzanine (balcony, sort of) to show the reissue of “Jason and the Argonauts” in a new 35mm print (the Casa Linda had shown “Jason” during its first suburban run in 1963).
I have to say, though, that I get a kick out of all those who have posted comments referring to the Casa Linda’s “original splendor” or other similar verbiage. I practically lived at this theater for 20 years and “splendor” is not a word I would ever use to describe it. Its interior was plain to the point of being spartan and from 1958 – 1979 it certainly showed its wear and tear. This is not a put-down, as no one ever maintained anything in pristine condition back in those days; even the Majestic, Capri, Tower, and Palace downtown were allowed to judiciously show their age. Compared to those venues, the Casa Linda was nothing special – but it sure is a part of some wonderful memories for me.
Talked to my dad this weekend (he went to college in Kingsville back in the early 50’s, when these venues were all current) and he says the screen at 77 & Ailsie is most likely the King (I say it was the Brahma); he and I agree that the El Rancho was north of town on 77; he has no idea of the one on Santa Gertrudis (I say that’s the site of the King).
Just returned from a visit to El Paso and was privileged to see “The Magnificent Seven” as part of the El Paso Film Festival, hosted at the theater. None of our party of five had ever been inside and, to say the least, we were simply knocked out by the theater’s beauty. Projection, unfortunately, is not so hot – pretty dim picture, sorry to say. Have noticed this same phenomenon at the Paramount in Austin. Are the projection bulbs used today just not as bright as they used to be?
@Warren G. Harris: There were many films in Cinemascope and B&W – before Longest Day roadshow was Diary of Anne Frank (1959 – roadshow @ 171 min + intermission).
“This theatre opened with 70MM capability but didn’t show a 70MM feature until 6 years later when Rollerball opened in 1975—ran quite a bit of 70 after that.”
The big deal is, simply, historical accuracy – someone might use this site as a reference source. The originators of this site are well aware of this – it is, no doubt, one reason they started this site.
Also, those of us who use this site regularly are aware of our debt to Mr. Lewis, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Holcomb. It is not possible to put a price on their work.
All of what I posted immediately above goes out the window if this venue operated as the Plaza subsequent to its being the Fine Arts. The original McKinney Ave. Plaza would have been long out-of-business by then
Chuck, it’s my present opinion that someone, way back, got “Plaza” and “Varity/Fine Arts” mixed up, possibly because of the latter’s location in “Snider PLAZA.” There was a well-known and long-advertised theater located on McKinney Ave. across the street from North Dallas High School called the Plaza. It ceased operation, I believe, sometime in the early 1960’s and is now long-demolished. I cannot pinpoint a time span when the Varsity/Fine Arts could have been called Plaza when the McKinney Ave. Plaza wasn’t also in operation. If you’ll check Lost Memory’s photo of the McKinney Plaza on its C/T page, you’ll see that it is, in all probability, a photo of the Fine Arts. Confusing, yes? The fact that the marquee in the photo shows “Light Up The Plaza Theater” may merely indicate an informal reference (i.e. the theater in Snider Plaza), as the McKinney Ave. Plaza closed long before nostalgia-minded groups existed to try to save old theaters. This is my best guess – I would love to read a response by someone more knowledgeable than I.
Joe, I’m with you on the architect – it is much more representative of Pettigrew’s taste/style than Eberson’s.
Thanks for posting the nice pictures. As a correction to my previous post, Midnight Cowboy opened in 1969, not 1968.
INTERESTING INFO, JOE – I SUSPECT YOU MAY HAVE SOMETHING. If so, the Melrose had long ceased to be talked about when I was growing up in Dallas and attending the Esquire semi-regularly (lovely theater). I first heard of the Melrose name when I came across it in the interviews section of Jeanette Crumpler’s book on Dallas' Elm Street theaters, “Street of Dreams.”
Address is wrong for this theater. The White was not on Forest LANE in North Dallas. More like Forest AVENUE in South Dallas, though I’m not sure of the street number.
I read that the Tower auditorium was actually housed in a completely separate, purpose-built building (built 1937) that sat behind the Tower Petroleum Building (built 1931) that housed the theater’s Elm Street boxoffice, entrance, and lobby; and that in 1951 the Corrigan Tower building was constructed to sit over and around the auditorium building (http://www.dallasarchitecture.info/towerpet.htm).
Can anyone comment on the arrangement (lease, easement, part ownership?) that must have been made between Interstate Amusement Corp. and ownership/management of these other two buildings in order to effect this type of situation?

Minimalism/Las Vegas/Light Sculpture: The Continuation and the Rupture of "Architectural Art" and "Artistical Architecture" | Kuresawa Takemi
July 31, 2007 at 9:51 pm · Filed under Appalachia, Herbal Blog Party, Immune system, Lymphatic system, Matthew Wood, Michael Moore, Pokeweed, Skin and hair, Specific indications, Tommie Bass
Now that Iâ€™m living on my home ground again, Iâ€™ve been feeling like writing about some real traditional Appalachian herbs. So for Julyâ€™s berry-themed blog party, I chose a classic of Appalachian herbalism: pokeberry (Phytolacca americana).
A while back on the Herbwifery Forum, a few of us were reminiscing about growing up in West Virginia and North Carolina. From our informal survey, it seems like covering oneself in pokeberry juice and running around like a little demon is an essential part of an Appalachian childhood. And itâ€™s no wonder. Pokeweed is everywhere in Southern Appalachia, and the ripe berries hang in shiny, inky purple-black clusters. Squish them in your hands, and they turn bright pink. What could be more fun?
Of course, we all knew that pokeberries were â€œpoison,â€ so we didnâ€™t eat them. (Unless someone said â€œI dare you,â€ that is. And even then weâ€™d spit them right out again. I never knew anyone to get sick on them.)
The truth is, poke is strong stuff. It can be toxic even in moderate doses. Some herbalists stick to diluted homeopathic preparations of the plant, just to be on the safe side. But I prefer the old-fashioned way: drops of the tincture, spoonfuls of the decoction, sips of the wine, or a berry at a time. (Fresh plant only. Poke doesnâ€™t take well to drying.)
So you might be asking, like my ten-year-old niece always does, â€œWhatâ€™s it for?â€ Well, poke is for all things, um, pokey. Poke gets things moving in the body, especially the lymphatic system, the joints, and the metabolism. In other words, it’s an “alterative.” Used externally, it kills things (scabies, ringworm, etc.).
The most common indications for pokeberries in old-time Appalachian herbalism were â€œrheumatismâ€ and â€œbad blood.â€ These days Iâ€™d call those â€œchronic joint painâ€ and â€œlymphatic sluggishness.â€ The usual prescription was to eat one berry a day for a week (without chewing the seeds), stop for a week, and repeat. Three berries, three times a week was another classic dose.
This tradition of on-and-off dosing is interesting. Perhaps poke inspires a reaction in the bodyâ€”maybe in the immune systemâ€”that is triggered only by withdrawal of the dosage? Poke is often called an “immune stimulant,” but I imagine it’s more complicated than that. I often wonder about pokeâ€™s effects on autoimmune conditions, since many of the conditions associated with the symptoms of â€œrheumatismâ€ turn out to have links to autoimmunity.
Modern herbalists sometimes use pokeberries to help stimulate an underactive thyroid, and old texts often mention goiter and obesity as important indications for the plant. Itâ€™s possible that poke acts directly on the thyroid, or indirectly on the metabolism through its general stimulation of â€œmovementâ€ in the body.
Pokeâ€™s movement-stimulating properties, combined with its affinities for the lymphatic system and â€œglands,â€ have led to its traditional use for many conditions involving hard, swollen masses in the body, including simple swollen lymph nodes, mumps, tonsillitis, adenitis, orchitis, mastitis, goiter, and cancer.
In my experience, poke root is one of the best things out there for inflammations of the breast, including mastitis. Fresh root poultices are traditional (though they can cause skin irritation), but tincture of the fresh root or a plaster of fresh berries will work, too, along with drop doses of the tincture internally. (Poke is contraindicated during pregnancy, but okay for nursing momsâ€”in small doses, of course.)
One of pokeâ€™s many folk names is â€œcancer root,â€ and (like many other lymphatic herbs) it has a reputation as an old-time cancer remedyâ€”especially for breast and skin cancers. Itâ€™s interesting that the old authors are split on its effectiveness. Iâ€™ve noticed that those who recommend poke for cancer support tend to emphasize using the fresh plant, rather than dried. This fits with what Iâ€™ve been taught. Always use fresh poke.
Whiskey tincture of the fresh root and fresh berry wine are the traditional Appalachian ways to preserve the plant for internal use. Traditional preparations of poke for external use often involved extraction in kerosene. This is one tradition I donâ€™t follow. Poke-infused olive oil works just fine, thanks.
My favorite saying about poke comes from Tommie Bass. Talking about the old-time use of poke whiskey as a tonic, he said “It just straightened you out.”
Parts used: fresh root, fresh berries (young shoots and leaves are also a â€œspring tonicâ€ food, boiled in two changes of water).
Homeopathic mental indications: “Loss of personal delicacy, disregard of surrounding objects. Indifferent to life” (Boericke).
PS: I’m going to post this month’s blog party on August 2ndâ€”mainly because that’s the day we get real internet access at our new house, but also because it gives busy-in-the-summer folks an extra day to make a blog party post!
The Greenbrier Valley is not like any other place in the Appalachian Mountains. It’s not close and steep like the Allegheny Plateau farther west. It’s not long and snaky like the Ridge and Valley just to the east. It isn’t high and alpine like the Allegheny Mountains to the north or low and humid like the Great Valley to the south.
In geologic terms, the Greenbrier Valley is a patch of Mississipian limestone and sandstone, honeycombed by caves, eroded by the Greenbrier River, and sitting smack on top of the Allegheny Front.
In geographic terms, it’s rolling farming country (called “levels”) mixed with higher knobs and ridges. Cattle, sheep, logging, and (more and more) tourism. Stately farms and back-hollow hideouts. Southern culture with mountain skepticism.
It’s hard to know where to begin. The West Virginia mountains are the reason I know plants. I am an herbwife because of the place that raised me. The mountain I grew up on is solid coal-free limestone. Many mountains close by are not so fortunate.
I can’t explain mountaintop removal coal mining here. You have to see it. I have been on a mountaintop removal site. It’s absolutely chilling. Even the video I linked to can’t really convey the feeling.
Some of the local groups organizing against mountaintop removal have put together an education / social networking site called ilovemountains.org. It’s an interesting ideaâ€”an opportunity for people to let their friends know what’s going on, and to track their connections to other people concerned about mountaintop removal. Another site with more ideas about concrete actions that people can take is stopmountaintopremoval.org.
Please do check out the sites, learn about mountaintop removal, and take some action. As someone pointed out at an herb gathering recently, Appalachia has been a really important reservoir for herbal knowledge in a country where herbwifery all but died out by the mid-twentieth century. Let’s show some respect for our grandmother herbwives and get our asses in gear to protect their mountains.

This season each assistant coach, coach and manager is required to umpire a minimum of two games this season. The only games we are asking you to umpire is our baseball AA and Softball 10U divisions respectively. There are a total of 45 games and if we each work our two games, we should have a plate and base umpire for each game.
Umpire equipment is located in the Clubhouse at Woodland. I recommend that plate umpires wear a “cup” as foul balls have their own minds. Leg gear, chest protectors and facemask are available and should be worn.
Review the schedule and of available games and select game(s) that you are interested and available to work
If you find a conflict that you need to return a game, please contact me James Smith via email asap.

The Brazilian companies have crossed geographic borders, commercially and also culturally in search of longevity for their products and services. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the strategic factors and the product innovation on the exporting performance in a candy confectionary company. In this regard, it has been analyzed the internationalization strategies used by the company, through quantitative and qualitative methods by application of a survey and interviews which, together, enabled to compare the importance and the performance of various attributes considered decisive to the exporting performance. Among the achieved results, this work showed there is a gap between the degrees of performance versus the degrees of importance of the studied attributes. This means that, by top management perspective, the company is below market expectation. It evidences the necessity for reevaluation the strategic planning, in order to strength other important dimensions explored, aiming to achieve success in the international market. This study confirmed the existence of a strong relationship between innovation product, strategy and exporting performance.

The new documentary Room 237 highlights a few oddball theories about the classic 1980 Stanley Kubrick horror film The Shining. While Room 237 glosses over the details of these theories to give a wider perspective on the type of person that formulates them, The Shining Code goes in deep. Specifically about the notion that The Shining was a hidden confession by Kubrick of producing and directing the Apollo 11 moon landing, making it a hoax.
I’m a big, huge fan of The Shining and it’s detailed and rich content, however, deep-reading of films like this are the exact reason I didn’t do all that well in any criticism class. Jumping to conclusions about the “meaning” of something is messy, especially when that meaning is something you’ve made up and now need to find evidence for. Want to see what I mean? Take the next hour and twenty minutes and watch The Shining Code. It’s hysterical.

In context of poorly performing national economies and sustained employment insecurity since the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, various UK and US studies have suggested that access for younger people to independent living, and to owner-occupied housing in particular, has been in decline.
Testing the wider validity of these findings, this paper uses cross-sectional data to deconstruct how and why pre to post-crisis changes in housing consumption patterns among 18-34 year olds have varied across the EU 15 countries.
Our results indicate a common trend towards diminishing access to home purchase among younger people. However, the extent of decreasing homeownership rates, as well as whether the rental sector or the parental home are used as alternative housing routes
The paper suggests that rather than being the direct outcome of economic recession and labour market contraction at the country level, post-crisis declines in young-age property ownership is primarily associated with housing systems, especially those most affected by shifting mortgage-credit access, and could thus be interpreted as a constituent of the volatile nature of more market-types residential capitalism.

Guest: Jim Weaver, a five-time CEO who brings 25 years of successful leadership experience in helping to grow both public and private companies. Jim has built and grown companies in multiple industries, including software development, systems integration, payment processing, and telecom. Jim is also a longtime YPO member and a new coach at CEO Coaching International.
Episode in a Tweet: A 5-Time CEO joins CEO Coaching and shares the common traits of great CEO leaders.
Quick Background: Jim Weaver didn’t set out to be a 5-time CEO in such a diverse array of businesses. But whenever opportunities presented themselves, Jim took advantage, pivoting his companies and himself towards new experiences, better markets, and BIGGER growth. Now he’s ready to share what he’s learned from five stints in the big chair with CEO Coaching International’s clients.
On today’s show, Jim Weaver discusses his transition from government work to the private sector to going public, and what his experiences at the top of multiple companies have taught him about being a great CEO in any field.
Jim Weaver’s first CEO post was at a company that delivered large systems integration and payment processing in health and human services for both the government and private insurance industries.
“The differences in those businesses were significant,” Jim says. “On the system’s integration side, all of that was one-time revenue. Even with a $50 million-dollar job, when that job was done, there was no residual revenue from that job.”
However, Jim identified the opportunity to create a recurring business model focused on the government payment processing side. So he pivoted the company, made some key acquisitions to help grow in this new space, and never looked back.
“It’s a lot easier to grow your business on last year’s base as opposed to having to replace all of last year’s revenue and then have your growth metrics on top of that,” Jim says.
One way to apply Jim’s wisdom to just about any field: pivot your own business away from big one-time purchases to subscriptions or membership programs that incentivize repeat business and get you paid more quickly.
Jim Weaver: Today, if you’re not thinking about what the technology’s going to look like, or what’s happening to your industry as close as six months out, then you’ve got issues.
“Getting A players into key seats – and quite frankly into every seat – is critical to the success of the business,” Jim says. But you also have to remember that you’re hiring for where you want your company to go, not for where you are right now. Your business is going to change as it grows, and great CEOs know how to identify motivated employees who can grow along with them.
“That’s certainly the environment that we try to create in any of the companies that I’ve been a part of,” Jim says, “where somebody has that opportunity to grow into that next-level position. Certainly, when you raise the bar, it suggests that you’re going to hire only A players or Bs that’ll be coached up to A.”
But take note of this–don’t let the anxiety of feeling you HAVE to fill a position push you into a rush hire that you’ll just end up regretting.
One of the biggest differences Jim sees between how businesses operated when he started and how they operate now is the sheer speed of change. “Today, if you’re not thinking about what the technology’s going to look like, or what’s happening to your industry as close as six months out, then you’ve got issues,” Jim warns.
Once the CEO has identified those essential actions and strategies, it’s critical to make sure your vision cascades down through the entire company. “All hands on deck” meetings, especially annual planning sessions, can be key to driving home your strategies from the top down. Jim also recommends internal newsletters or blog posts that can keep everyone updated on the company’s progress and focused on the BIG goals ahead.
Poor CEOs harness all the wrong stereotypes in all the worst ways. They’re brash to the point of obnoxious. They’ll charge through every meeting like a bull in a china shop just to remind everyone who’s really in charge. They’re so sure their way is the only way that they ignore smart ideas from their leadership team, or worse, only hire Yes Men.
“You have to treat people, at all times, with dignity and respect,” Jim says. “When they’re successful, when they’re performing for you and they’re doing well, and more so, quite frankly, if they’re struggling. Those who are very successful, they’ll be rewarded by that, and assuming you’re paying them a competitive salary, I think that is how you motivate people to go beyond what they’re currently doing today.”
Jim believes another key CEO trait is embracing vulnerability when necessary. During tough times, your employees and key relationships don’t want to see you hiding behind your ego – they want honesty, transparency, and a clear path forward.
“Being vulnerable, as opposed to trying to circumvent the problem, creates a path to resolution,” Jim says.
2. Your business’ future is now. What are you doing today that’s going to get you BIG in three years?
2. Lead, don’t bully. The stereotypical CEO who blows his top and pushes around everyone belongs in cartoons, not a board room.

Big hand to global East Falls tech company STRATIS IoT who debuted in the top 20% of the Inc.5000 fastest-growing private companies in America.
For a 49 year-old mother nervous about going back to school, La’Tonya Redmond-Kraft sure finished her freshman year strong at Strayer University. The East Falls resident was humbled to learn recently of her induction into the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS), an organization that recognizes academic excellence in freshman and sophomore students.
La’Tonya resolved to go back to school after years as a stay at-home mom. “I’d raised the kids to the point where they were independent and I figured it was time to do something for me.”
Besides, her daughters were getting tired of their mom answering their homework questions. “I’ve always been a good student, so I guess it was a habit,” she said with a laugh. “And my daughters didn’t want me looking over their shoulders when they were studying. They finally said, ‘Mom, haven’t you always talked about going back to school?”
She realized too she wouldn’t ever achieve her dream of owning her own business if she didn’t get the necessary education. So she visited the Strayer University campus and enrolled immediately as a business major.
The idea of winning honors never occurred to her – “I was so nervous going back to school after such a long time away that I just focused on the work. Doing my best was the only thing I thought about.”
Even after she learned of the honor (which is invitation only – the Strayer faculty submitted her name), she kept the same level-headed mindset. “I don’t want to celebrate anything until I’ve got my degree, that’s the goal. Then I’ll do it up right.”
She is nevertheless humbled by the honor and is deeply grateful to so many who made it possible. “I’d like to thank God first of all. Then my school for nominating me. My deceased mother set a great example for me and my husband and three daughters gave me so much love and support. I’ve been blessed to have so many people in my life that have inspired me to never give up.”
Founded in 1994, the Society has active chapters at more than 300 college and university campuses across the United States and more than one million lifetime members.
NSCS provides career and graduate school connections, leadership and service opportunities and awards $1 million in scholarships annually to students across the U.S. NSCS members are deeply committed to scholarship, leadership and service and, as a result, impact their campus and local communities each day.

My background consists of database design and programming. I have done job and client tracking systems, inventory and sales management, and accounting. The other side of me is being a Worship Minister for a local church. Here I put music together each week that is based on the message to be read. Of course my hobby, flight simulation which keeps me relaxed.
Are you in need of software that allows you to create a database without using visual basic code and not needing a great deal of knowledge of database rules?
I have been using this platform since 2006. I started with the LE version (which is free), but has limitations such as no network access or being able to add numbers. I later purchased the Pro version because I needed the limitations removed. FileAmigo is the closest platform to Microsoft Access that I have found on the Internet.
I spent over 20 years programming databases using various platforms. When Microsoft came out with MS Access, I was really impressed at how easy it was to make a very nice database. MS Access gave several ways to program the database to include using Macros and Visual Basic Code. The platform needed you to be educated in database development as well as knowing how to use Visual Basic Code.
When I found FileAmigo, I was surprised at what I recognized. Most displays that are automatically generated with FileAmigo are grid type displays which Microsoft Access also generates. You can attach sub-tables to the main table so that other information can be kept that will further describe the main database record. For instance, you can have the main database record consist of company information. To enhance this, you can create a sub-table that will provide information on people who work at the company. You can also keep other information that would have many records such as comments and dates you called the company.
FileAmigo has an automatic help system that will guide you in the database development. This feature can be turned on or off, which is handy as you get proficient and no longer need the help. Creation casino online of a database with this platform is fast. You can either import your information or create the database from scratch. If you import, the fields are created for you automatically. All you might have to do is change a few names and some field criteria. When you design from scratch (that’s what I like to do), then you define the field names and criteria. You can then start entering your information. As time goes, you can modify the main database, or add sub-tables to keep other information about the main database.
You can define reports based on the main database and one sub-table. You are able to define sorting and what information you want to search by. By using the SQL statements, you can search on other sub-tables to get your information. Reports can be exported for use with Microsoft Word or Excel.
FileAmigo is currently upgrading to version 11. I had the opportunity to use the beta version of the program. They have made numerious modifications and put in new features that brings it closer to what Microsoft Access can do. The nicest part is that you still don’t need to use Visual Basic Code to get the job done. Conversion from FileAmigo 7 is flawless, which is very good.
Customer Service has provided me with all my answers and helped me in figureing out some problems that I have run across in getting my information out of the database. They will try to create the problem on their end and e-mail you the results. If they need more information, they will ask you. When installed FileAmigo 11 on my Windows 7, it would not run. They stayed with the problem till it was solved. This took a few days to do. Most other places would just write you off and provide you with some dumb solution.
FileAmigo comes in a LE version with some limitations which is free. The pro version is what you pay for and enables you to share the database with other users and opens up other features that can be used. This is one great program to have.

One of the most stylish ways to arrive in Darwin is by train, sweeping into the tropics from the Australian red centre. The Ghan is the railway that connects Darwin at the top of Australia to Adelaide in the south and it is considered to be one of the world’s top train journeys. The train journey takes two nights and three days end to end, connecting with Alice Springs smack bang in the middle of the country. The unusual sounding name of the train line honours the Afghan camel riders who once serviced the route delivering mail and goods into the townships of the desert. The journey spans 2979 kilometres click, clicking along the rail gauges through some of Australia’s most dramatic landscapes taking in barren desert, the Katherine Gorge, rolling plains and tropical lush forest, then arriving at the Darwin Train Station just 10 kilometres from the CBD.
The Ghan chugs into Darwin twice a week and departs from Adelaide on a Sunday and Wednesday arriving in Darwin on Tuesday and Friday respectively. If you plan to travel from north to south, the train departs from Darwin Train Station on Wednesday and Saturday all throughout the year arriving in Adelaide on Friday and Monday respectively. This is currently the only train connection to Darwin after the line was extended to the city on 2004, but for those looking for a stunning and unique way to travel the country a train journey on The Ghan will most certainly live up to your expectations.
Born in Barmouth, North Wales, he came to Canada with his parents in 1914 and settled in Oakville, Ontario. He worked in an insurance office until he was 19. He left his job to study art and in 1931 took instruction from J.W. Beatty at the summer school of the Ontario College of Art, Tor. (1931). He went to England where he was employed as an illustrator by Stillwell & Darby, Lond. (1935-37) and in his free hours studied at the Goldsmith’s College of Art, London, under James Bateman and John Mansbridge. In England he executed several portraits and exhibited with the London Portrait Society. On his return to Canada he became a regular exhibitor at the OSA annuals and with other groups. Much of his work was sold through the T. Eaton Company’s Fine Art Gallery. In the years that followed he did illustrations for several publishers including the Standard and the Star Weekly and was art director for Bell Features Publishing Co., Tor. (1941-48). He taught at the Doon School of Fine Arts, Doon (Kitchener), Ont. (1952-54) and the Etobicoke Community Art School, Ont. (1954). As a painter he was known for his landscapes, marine subjects, figure studies and portraits. His technique was described by the London Free Press in 1959 as follows, “. . . in every picture there is a heavy underpainting and then an overpaint­ing that gives the impression of glossy varnish and creates a brightness, or feeling of presence of light no matter how dark, drab, or fogbound the colors and atmosphere might be expected to be. The artist varies his palette wisely to present paintings that glow with brilliant color . . . .” Much of Dingle’s painting was done in oils and his output was once said to be from 150 to 200 paintings a year. During the summers he travelled to the east coast where he had painted Cape Breton Island and other areas. During the win­ter, he seldom went beyond a 50-mile radius of Toronto. He also painted in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, the British Isles and Massachusetts. His paintings appeared on calendars of Sellotape Canadian Ltd. and on Christmas cards produced by Austin Marshall. His affiliations included: ALCT (1945); ARCA (1948); RCA (1968); OIP (1958); FIAL (1960); OSA (1961) (Pres. 1967-70). He died in Toronto at the age of sixty-three and was survived by his wife Patricia, three sons, John, Christopher and Brian and two grandchildren, Geremey and Tyler. He is represented in the following collections: NGC, Ott.; Lond. Regional Art & Historical Mus., Ont. and the following banks, CIBC, BNS, RBC; Dom. Foundries & Steel Ltd. and elsewhere.

We will customise your daily tasks around your personal and professional commitments to help you complete your MOOCs successfully.
MOOC stands for Massive Open Online Course. We believe, these are by far one of the best gifts for anyone looking to improve themselves in their field of interest. Now, educators and educational resources from the world’s best institutions are available to everyone who can connect to the internet. Some MOOCs are free while others are paid.
E-learning courses in general have an innate problem. Due to their very nature of being Massive and Open, MOOCs are also easy to get lost in. People are unable to motivate themselves to complete the course.
No, we don’t. Imagine us as your personal assistant, cheerleader and a friend who will lay the road for you, so you can achieve your goals.
You can pursue your MOOC in any of the platforms such as Udacity, Coursera, edX or more. You can choose to do any of the MOOC available to you without restrictions.
We suggest using the MOOC aggregators such as MOOC-List and Class-Central to easily find the right MOOC across multiple sites for your need.
A MOOC manager will be assigned to you. They would contact you when convenient to remind and follow-up with your progress. They will customise our program to cater to your needs and play an active role helping you finish your e-learning course. They will worry about all the scheduling and deadline management so you can simply concentrate on the course and complete it successfully!
Hi, I’m Gokul and I hold couple of masters in Robotics. I have been in the field of Learning & Development in Robotics for about a decade. Also, I have been involved in start-ups all through my career and ROBOTUTE is my pre-PhD work on Intelligence Systems.
The reason I started this project is to find a solution to a problem I have always faced. Since I have always worked in start-ups, my schedule has been a bit erratic and I couldn't keep up with deadlines of MOOCs. I wanted to complete many e-learning courses but realised that the climb was pretty steep to do it without support. This lead to the idea for ROBOTUTE.
Rocca was founded over a decade ago by Angelo Hernandez, the latest-generation stone craftsman to come from a long family line of traditional stone-working specialists.
Rocca was founded over a decade ago by Angelo Hernandez, the latest-generation stone craftsman to come from a long family line of traditional stone-working specialists. From a proud heritage developed in his native Spain, Angelo understood better than most the challenges presented from working with natural materials formed in pre-history like granite, marble and quartz; the ever-present danger of hidden flaws deep within the stone that leaves the product prone to failure after installation, the irregular composition of the stone slab that renders it unsuitable for domestic use, not to mention the sheer logistical difficulty in handling and working with a particularly hard and heavy material such as granite, marble and quartz.
Angelo was appalled at the lack of skills and specialist knowledge that were available within the Scottish natural stone marketplace and noted the poor judgement on raw-material sourcing, countless middle-men resulting in low value-for-money, clumsy production skills and inept installation.
Together with a handful of passionate like-minded specialists and a committed customer-services’ back-up team, Angelo re-established his long-standing working partnerships with the major production quarries in Spain, Italy, India, China and Brazil, and using his vastly experienced judgement and eye for detail, he set about personally selecting only the finest granite, marble and quartz raw materials for import.
Now in 2017, Rocca has grown out of all proportion to its humble origins. In the large work-area factory in Glasgow, Angelo personally directs production and ensures that only when the finished product is perfect and manufactured to his own exacting standards, will he authorise the engraving of the famous Rocca maker’s mark which signifies perfection in stone.
As we approach the mid-way point of the second decade in the 21st Century, Rocca continues to thrive on its enviable and fiercely-protected reputation as the premier provider of exceptional quality granite, marble and quartz products. With a sales’ and distribution network that easily services the whole of Scotland, in particular the major conurbations of Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen and Dumfries in addition of course to their west of Scotland heartland, Rocca delivers exceptional quality and tremendous value for money right across the country.
Many homeowners choose to have natural stone worktops installed when they have ordered a brand new kitchen while others simply decide to have their existing kitchen worktops replaced. Whatever the reason for choosing natural stone worktops, Rocca makes the whole process incredibly easy.
When you are having a brand new kitchen installed - Rocca works in partnership with all major kitchen supply and installation companies across the country. Here’s how we work:-
• We will liaise with your kitchen supplier and in a matter of days, manufacture beautiful, bespoke natural stone worktops for your new kitchen.
• Once your new kitchen has been installed, (minus standard worktops), skilled Rocca craftsmen will follow-up and install your newly-manufactured, bespoke natural stone worktops.
• Within a matter of days of our survey, Rocca will manufacture gorgeous bespoke natural stone replacement worktops.
Nothing could be simpler – and you have the peace of mind of knowing that Rocca will take care of everything and see the job through to the end, ensuring your complete delight and total satisfaction.
At Rocca Worktops, we think differently from our competitors and we act differently too – from start to finish.
Our real strength is about providing an exceptional customer experience, on time and every time, making sure that your experience of buying from Rocca is truly exceptional.
Throughout our website and in person in our showroom, we always endeavour to be as clear and informative as possible.
To help answer any unanswered questions you may have, we have created a short frequently-asked-questions page to perhaps address those issues not covered elsewhere.
Everyone at Rocca subscribes to our founding family values of honesty, integrity and professionalism – to ensure that we never, ever, let a customer down. We also take our responsibility to our staff, our suppliers and to the environment as seriously as we act towards our customers. Everyone at Rocca, from the youngest junior apprentice to the managing director, is treated equally and with respect, and everyone works in safe, fear-free conditions.
In the interests of protecting the environment, raw materials are acquired only from responsible suppliers operating quarries that provide sustainable sources. Production methods use non-chemical, water-based techniques that are non-polluting. Waste is recycled wherever practicable. At Rocca, we recognise that sound, uncompromising values are not just good for our staff, our suppliers and our environment, they are also good for business too!
At Rocca Worktops, we are committed to providing our customers with exceptional value for money in the quality of the natural stone product that we create and subsequently install. In fact, from the excellence of the sourced raw material to the enviable innovative quality of our production methods, we believe, quite simply, that no one can beat Rocca for sheer quality and tremendous value for money. You just won’t find a better deal on marble, granite and quartz anywhere. And our enviable “maker’s mark” guarantees it.
Our work, though, is not finished until our product is installed in your home to your absolute delight and total satisfaction. We take full responsibility not only for the outstanding quality of the manufactured product, but also for the installation; we will always see the job through to a most satisfactory completion. We aim to provide you with an exceptional customer experience at Rocca, and our Customer Services team is committed to delivering it. Every time!

Chuck Thiobodeau's Vintage, an O'Day/Tripp built? Dolphin moored in Little Harbor, New Castle, New Hampshire (updated March 24, 2010)
March 24, 2010. We first heard of this boat on June 19, 2009 when Jim Homet (Tiki) sent in the following report (edited) and photo:
" I sail on Tuesday's out of Little Harbor in New Castle, and I swear I saw a Dolphin on a mooring! The boat's name was Vintage, it has a dark blue hull, white topsides and a black spar. The cockpit coamings looked like they were molded of fiberglass. A quick look at the NH Port Authority mooring list shows it registered to someone named Thibodeau (it also shows it to be 24'). Let me know if this is new to you, and if so, I'll try and find out more info.
This was new to us, at least under the Vintage name. This sighting, and report, moves Jim into that elite group - DFIs (Dolphin Field Investigators)! Stay tuned
New Hampshire harbor moorings listings are public and posted on line. After confirming Vintage's owner's name, vessel name and mooring #, we emailed the Portsmouth Harbormaster's office and asked them to to forward our email to the Thiobodeaus. It took a while but Chuck called in yesterday. He was sitting by his computer and while we talked he went to the Dolphin website and saw his boat - "Neat!".
Chuck told me that the original owner named the boat Vintage, and had the builder install a Volvo diesel which is still in the boat. He will send in some more info about the boat soon but directed us to a website that had pictures of Vintage, some of which are below.
"You have been great to work with and very accommodating of our mind changing …and very happy to recommend you to colleagues if asked."

"Every couple of years the crescent moon turns a deep crimson color. It stays that way for three full days. It's the best time for spells to be cast and for the positive energy to be drawn to yourself"
Amberlyn Darksky is everything but normal. Living with her overprotective dad while not actually knowing her mother, makes her more miserable and sad every day. Lorena, her lovely mother, died while giving birth to her, and Amber is not only living with this cruel fact but also with her gift (or shall I say CURSE!)
She has the ability to "see and feel" other people's memories, their joy, happiness, but also pain and sadness they have ever experienced in their lives. Too much for a 18 year old girl who never got the chance to really live, have friends, go out.
Though her father Carmine strongly forbids her to apply for college, she feels the urge to breakthrough his "shelter" and discover what normal life is.
But can a person that is not "normal" actually experience normal life? Despite her dad's disapproval, she is off to Minnesota and the Cyprus Falls University. But instead of finally having a normal life, enjoying college, making friends, partying like every other, she is about to encounter her Destiny!
Vampires, paranormal creatures, mystery and romance..be aware, this book will have you totally sucked in from it's first page.
What I truly admire the author for, now that I read the book, is her talent to describe events so vividly! Look out for the prologue and the moment Lorena is giving birth to Amber! Honestly, I could almost feel the pain she was going through, could smell the blood and experience the horror Carmine (her husband) is going through after receiving the news.
Occasionally I could feel certain "holes" in the plot, but this didn't influence the pleasure of reading this book! Roxanne surely is a talented writer, building up her own unique style of writing and I will watch out carefully for the next installment!
This looks good and since it is the first of what appears to be a series, maybe those holes in the plot will get plugged. I think i will pick this one up..thanks and great review.
Hey Kim:) Thanks for the comment. I am glad you like the review and that you're gonna give this book a try. Its does have few "holes" but I guess next installment will fix them. Roxanne sure is a great storyteller! I am really looking forward to the next one in the series:)
I am a 32 year old bookworm, a mother and a wife. My work is closely related to books, but I am not a Librarian. Too bad. But hey, that doesn't stop me from reading. Hope you will enjoy it out here. WELCOME TO MY WORLD!

Nexon announced that they are going to migrate European server to North American server. Wherein, North American players don’t have to do anything, while European players have to do hassle stuff in order to transfer their characters in the American server.
After the migration, both European and North American players have now access to each other’s server.
It is all good that North American players get to meet European players; however, what does this mean?
Nexon decided to merge European server to North American server is probably because the population of European server is going down, or worse, the server is dying due to lack of players, resulting into merging into North America.
The merge is not a full merge of characters and all the Europe’s data. It is not the merge you think. It is a merge where both North American and European players will have access to each other’s server but not a North America meets Europe, meaning you won’t meet European players in your current server but you can meet them through creating a new character and joining the European server.
Maplestory mesos would be a phenomenon upon the migration of both these servers. Wherein, there will be a North American player who wanted to transfer to European server for a reason and a European player to transfer North American server.
Some will even buy mesos from both servers, wanting to play in both European and North American servers.
Let’s take it. These things happen because the era of MMORPG is about to end. People don’t want to grind for hours in order to achieve a certain level. Nowadays, people seek competition. Wherein, in a single game, upon performing well, a player can raise his/her own self-esteem. It is not about grinding hard anymore. It is all about self-esteem.

Quantitative Easing Revisited | The recent spate of negative economic news is motivating downward adjustments in the near-term growth outlook for the US economy, both in the private sector and amongst policymakers.
Concerns about the lackluster pace of the domestic recovery and spillovers from disruptions to growth in Japan, the Euro Zone, and the Middle East, coincide with the planned conclusion of the Federal Reserve's second quantitative easing (QE2) program this month. As a result, questions about the efficacy of this unorthodox policy intervention are receiving new attention. Should we extend the Fed's purchases of Treasury securities? And if so, what are the attendant risks of growing the central bank’s balance sheet even further?
Dr Chandan explores the Fed's options and their implications for commercial real estate in his GlobeSt column, Quantitative Easing Revisited.

We aim to bring you interesting and helpful information about osteopathy and complementary medicine within Bristol and beyond.......
The United Nations on Thursday declared that June 21 will be International Day of Yoga, adopting a measure proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi who said yoga lets people "discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature."
The 193-member U.N. General Assembly approved by consensus a resolution establishing a day to commemorate the ancient practice, which Modi called for in September during his inaugural address to the world body.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the International Day of Yoga would bring attention to yoga's holistic benefits.
"Yoga can contribute to resilience against non-communicable diseases. Yoga can bring communities together in an inclusive manner that generates respect," Ban said in a statement.
"Yoga is a sport that can contribute to development and peace. Yoga can even help people in emergency situations to find relief from stress," he said.
If you'd like to bring yoga in to your life, then do consider practising with Mala at The Chandos Clinic on a Saturday morning. Full details on our website.
Many of you may already have met Nikki at The Chandos Clinic, but in case she's slipped your notice, here's an article by her which appeared in our latest newsletter. Nikki offers Thai massage one Saturday a month and she currently has availability on Dec 20th. So if you are interested in a bit of pre-Christmas pampering for yourself, or as a Christmas present for someone else, then please ring the normal reception number to book in. (0117 9745084)
As well as all the other Massage Therapies I offer at Chandos Clinic I am now delighted to be offering Traditional Thai Massage which has been my passion for over 12 years. I also teach these simple techniques for couples be it friend or family at Bristol Folk Hse for the last 6 years. So for those of you, who may not have come across this form of Massage before, below is a bit of information.
Traditional Thai medicine has remained pretty much unchanged in the last 1000 years. Its recent world-wide spread has been quite phenomenal. This ancient system of massage and manipulation has its roots in Yoga, Ayurvedic medicine and Buddhist spiritual practice. This unique and complete system of Yoga therapy combines rhythmic massage, acupressure, gentle twisting, deep stretching and meditation. Performed on a floor mat fully clothed I use thumbs, palms, forearms, elbows, feet knees and even shins to press and stretch your body.
“Thai’s believe that good health and freedom from pain result from the unhindered flow of vital energies (Sen) through the body's tissues.”
‘Pressing’ is the mechanical process used to prepare the muscles for stretching and stimulate energy flow in the Sen, which release blockages or stagnation, which can result in pain. A full session is very thorough with every muscle and joint treated, and when I am satisfied that all soft tissues have been adequately ‘pressed’, stretching begins, gradually progressing into the elegant large scale stretches that Thai massage is renowned for. The manipulations are designed to stretch the muscles a little more than would be possible unaided through Yoga and although the Muscles are the masseur's ultimate target, fibrotic connective tissue and weak circulation are also treated during the massage.
Thai’s have long recognised that most musculo-skeletal pain and lack of mobility of the joints is the result of muscles shortening under the influence of repetitive strain. Tension and spasm in a muscle are the result of a vicious circle of events involving the muscle and its sense organs; those muscles that are antagonistic to it and the brain. The more tense the muscle the shorter it gets, and the brain interprets this as contraction, so inhibiting the function of the antagonistic muscles, which weaken as a result.
The Chandos Clinic is a centre of excellence in osteopathy and complementary medicine situated in the heart of Redland, Bristol. Our friendly and comfortable clinic offers professional and caring treatments from a variety of registered practitioners. We welcome patients of all ages, from birth upwards. With our wealth of experience we can help you understand and overcome many of the physical and emotional problems of everyday life and support your general wellbeing.
Orchids, Fertilization of.—I have been endeavouring during several years to make out the many contrivances by which British Orchids are fertilised through insect agency. I am very anxious to examine a few exotic forms. Several gentlemen have kindly sent me specimens; but I have not seen one of Lindley's grand division of Arethuseæ, which includes the Limodorideæ, Vanillideæ, &c.1 If any one would have the kindness to send me a few flowers and buds of any member of the group, packed in a small tin canister, by post, addressed as below, he would confer a very great favour on me. Would you have the kindness to inform me, if in your power, whether the late Professor Morren2 has published anything (and where) on the fertilisation of Orchids by insect agency? Charles Darwin, Down, Bromley, Kent. [We are unable to answer this question, and must refer it to others. After searching through Morren's multitudes of pamphlets, we find nothing on Orchids except an academical dissertation on Orchis latifolia, and some remarks on the causes of the movements in the lips of Megaclinium.]
An important consideration when avoiding tennis elbow while woodworking, along with bench height, is the grip with which you hold your planes. If you have a death grip on the tote, you are likely to be over-tensing the muscles around your elbow, leading to problems like you have described. This is similar to a leading cause of tennis elbow in recreational tennis players, gripping the racquet too tightly. Also happens in military pilots, I have been told. Using improperly sized gloves can lead to overgripping and, in turn, tennis elbow.
So, after fixing the bench height issue, take a close look at your grip on the tote. You shouldn't need a death grip on it. If you still can't plane without pain, maybe try making a custom tote? Perhaps a little larger so that you can get a good grip without really holding on.

Creation (in the biblical sense) is not a theory alternative to, and in competition with, theories offered by science. It has nothing to do with materials, mechanism and process. It is an ultimate concept and thrusts itself upon us when we look, not backwards in time, but away from our space‑time altogether. An analogy makes this plain, and also the relation between creation and providence.
God is sovereign over his creation. He brought it into being out of nothing, and He holds it in being. Thus He is both transcendent and immanent; another analogy illustrates this. Nature is therefore not divine: it is something over which man is to exercise responsible stewardship.
The word 'create' in our English Old Testaments is nearly always a translation of the Hebrew word bara. This latter is not, however, the only word used in connection with the subject we are discussing. There are in fact two other common ones: asa, usually rendered 'make' or 'do' but with a wide range of other meanings 1; and yasar usually translated 'form' or 'fashion'. But among these three words bara seems to be a term of special significance. It is used only of God (as is its Greek equivalent ktizo in the New Testament). Wherever it is used it seems to convey strikingly a sense of newness, sometimes indeed expressed quite explicitly2. It is probably true to say that bara (and ktizo) have a significance in the Bible very similar to that of 'create' in modern English, so it is worth looking .into our own usage of this latter word a little more closely.
In current English we allow 'create' and its derivatives to be used of human subjects as well as God; we talk for instance of the 'creative arts'. But we still use the word in a special and rather exciting sense 3. We remark that Beethoven 'created' the great Missa Solemnis; alternatively, of course, we may choose to say that he 'composed' or 'wrote' it. The two statements are not equivalent however; their impact is quite different. The latter conjures up the picture of a man at an untidy desk, pen in hand; the former, of a man with a rapt look in his eyes, deeply stirred by profound ideas. Again, is it quite appropriate to comment that another great musician, Haydn, composed a famous piece in the summerhouse at Eisenstadt while in the employ of the Esterhazy family in the autumn of 1765; but it would sound a little odd if 'created' were substituted for 'composed' in this remark. 'Creation' is too powerful an idea to be tied down to a specific time, place and circumstance like this. In a sense Haydn's masterpiece was the work not of a few particular weeks but of a life; it came to birth not in a small summerhouse but in Haydn's world. It is this aspect of things that the word 'create' (as against 'compose') is used to express. 'Composition' is linked with time, place, circumstance and process; 'creation' tends to soar above them all.
The biblical usage follows this pattern. Thus, when the Bible uses 'create' (or 'make' in a parallel sense) it is not concerned with material and mechanism or even with particularities of time and place. The very furthest it goes in amplifying the mode of God's creative activity is to affirm, 'God said, "Let there be." ' Creation was by Divine fiat. By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, it says, their starry host by the breath of His mouth . For He spoke, and [the earth] came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm 5. The famous prologue to John's gospel 6 emphasizes the same with its striking metaphor of the Word for Jesus Christ, the divine Agent of creation. Again, it is characteristic that when the biblical writers wish to say something of the materials out of which or the methods or processes by which things were given their present visible structure they avoid the word 'create' 7. They use instead the more general terms 'make', 'form' or others similar. Thus they tell us that man was 'formed' (not 'created') of dust from the ground, and woman was 'built up' (not 'created') out of part of Adam's side 8. Again, Jeremiah was 'formed' in the womb; Job was 'made' and 'fashioned', and Jacob 'made' and 'formed' there 9. The writer of Psalm 139 in an oft‑quoted passage 10 uses four words in two verses to describe his development onwards from conception ‑ but not one of these is 'created'. Accordingly it would seem fair to say that in the Bible the creative aspect
of God's activity (and there are other aspects) is never linked to a particular process or material; rarely even to a specified moment or locality 11. The act is seen rather as an unanalyzable movement out of the mind of the Creator into the arena of created 'space‑time' (as we have now come to call it)12. In this movement the only intermediary is God's Word. Creation is thus an ultimate concept; it indicates the furthest back it is possible to go in discussing the origin of things. It is in this sense that in John's vision of Jesus Christ, the Lord speaks of Himself as the beginning of the creation of God, the Word which gave effect to God the Father's creative thought and brought the world into being 13. It is in the realisation of this that 'creation' is seen, emphatically, not to be an alternative to scientific theories of origin. It belongs to the ultimate realm, beyond science; it is undiscoverable by any experimental technique whatsoever. The Bible insists on this 14.
However, it is important to recognize that in speaking of the notion of 'creation' as the furthest back we can go we must not think exclusively, or even primarily, in terms of time (i.e. historical time). Why must we not do this? Because Scripture tells us that God's creative word is still being spoken, and will be to the end of the age 15. It was being spoken, for example, in the great public drama of national regathering after the captivity of Babylon.; and it was spoken in the private experiences of King David as he sorrowed for his sin 16. Particularly where there is a notable new beginning, as in these cases, the Bible proclaims God as Creator. Even more significant for us are the references to recurring events in the living world. To each generation the call comes with immediate relevance: Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth17. In every spring as the new leaves burst forth, or the new baby rabbits appear the Bible recognizes the creative activity of God. "A new generation takes the place of the old. Creation continues, for God is perpetually sending forth His Spirit and renewing the face of the earth with fresh life" 18.
Creation in the Bible is therefore an idea which comes into its own when we think not so much backwards in time as upward (or outward) to God. In reflecting on the idea of ultimate origin the tendency to look backward in time has become natural and almost universal only because we and our world have so clearly the character of growing old. If we lacked this character (and we were still interested in the possibility of creation) we would be readier to grasp what has just been stated ‑ that the essential direction to look is not backward in time but away to God. This conclusion would seem to follow from the biblical handling of this topic: to repeat, the idea of creation involves essentially a look in the direction of God, not of prehistory.
To clarify this further, let me use an analogy to illustrate the relationship of creation to another biblical concept, providence. Suppose we regard our world's on‑going history as 'His Story', a story which the divine Author, unseen, is Himself writing. (This is not, in passing, an unbiblical analogy: see Ps.139.16; Heb.10.7; Rev.5). His book is before us, incomplete; the ink is still wet where it lies open. Seeking to understand what is in the process of being written we try reading what has gone before, turning back the pages one by one. The narrative grips us. Indeed we cannot pause until, alas! we find the writing becoming too faded, intermittent or archaic in style for us to decipher. At this point we stop; or rather, our interest, with less to hold it, becomes aroused in a new direction. "Whose book is this?" we ask. "Who wrote this story?" The question of authorship has met and challenged us as we turned back the pages to the beginning; but in fact, this question could have confronted us at any point, even where the ink was still wet ‑ only then we were too preoccupied with the tale itself. From any page we could have reorientated our thoughts, looked up, and exclaimed, "Hey, who wrote this?" Better still, at the very start we could have called out, "Is anybody there, writing this?" For we notice of course that the story hasn't finished.
Though this analogy has imperfections (for example, we are not merely readers of God's story but characters in it), its interpretation should be plain. God, of course, is the Author of the tale, the Creator of the world it portrays and of the characters and encounters which enliven it. All is of his conceiving 19. As we contemplate the story we note that fresh characters constantly appear, and new situations constantly develop. Where do they come from? At this point in our discussion the most obvious answer is, from the Author's fertile mind. This answer denotes creation: it explains in fact what is meant by that term. But the Author is not projecting into his created history a jumble of things and notions isolated, disparate, incommensurable, lacking relation and compatibility. He has thought (and written) into being a coherent story, in which everything is linked intelligibly and meaningfully with everything else. That fact introduces the possibility of a second answer not a consequence of mere logical necessity of the first: the characters and situations come from their antecedents in the story, and can be understood in terms of them. To the reader the dramatis personae and their circumstances do not appear suddenly from nowhere, as stones dropped into a pool might seem to do to a fish. They are engendered within the story itself in a way usually quite comprehensible to him 20. Accordingly, as we trace with admiration the way the Author has skilfully and lovingly made one situation develop from another we find ourselves answering the question "Where did this come from?" in terms not of creation as before, but in terms of what the religious believer, in real life, calls Providence ‑ God's previous and continuing activity in things which influence his circumstances.
Seen in the light of this analogy the biblical concepts of creation and providence appear as two contrasting, but entirely consistent theological accounts of how a given situation arose. The first traces it from the conceiving mind of God into the arena of space‑time; in this it imparts meaning. The second concerns its history within space‑time; here it introduces mechanism. These accounts appear in relationship. They are not alternative to each other, as if we could opt for one or the other according to whim and fancy; they are complementary in the sense that we need both if we are not to miss important truths 21. Remember now your Creator, and Honour your father and mother is how the Bible reminds us of our present duty in both connections. One commandment recalls our creation; the other our procreation, i.e. the way in which God, in His story, has providentially woven our lives into the fabric of what has gone before (i.e. how He has 'formed' or 'fashioned' us, Heb. yasar).
The Bible's doctrine of Creation has often been summarized in the phrase creatio ex nihilo, creation out of nothing. The appositeness of this phrase should be apparent from the foregoing discussion, but some of its further implications need to be made explicit. Firstly, it means that nothing, visible or invisible, shares God's eternity. He alone has immortality22. Without implying that eternity is simply time extended (in both direcions) endlessly, this means that the Creator and His Creation stand on a fundamentally different footing. He is the Holy One 23 (as we saw in an earlier chapter), never to be confused with created things (even the most splendid, like the sun), or with the world process itself (which He controls) 24. The Bible never lets us lose sight of this distinction. The moment we do so, it says, we are in danger of falling under the power of a lie, great and damaging 25. Secondly, God is under no external constraints in His creative work. He hasn't to 'make do', like us, with whatever materials are available. He is absolutely free, bound only to be true to Himself 26. Of course and most importantly, He was under no compulsion to create the universe at all, or to create it just as it is. In other words, He willed it and designed it. This matter will be discussed more fully in Chap.VIII.
Finally, as the Venite (Ps. 95) so magnificently describes, the world belongs to God, and is under His sovereign and omnipotent rule. Having created it, He is never, like the sorcerer's apprentice, faced with situations out of His control 27. He commands, and creation obeys 28 The fact that man can (and does) resist God's will is, paradoxically, not a denial of His omnipotence but an outcome of it. It is He who has given this power to men. He holds them responsible for the use they make of it, but that that is no denial of His omnipotence will be evident when God brings all eventually to judgement 29.
We must now consider a little more closely a facet of the Bible's teaching hitherto noticed only in passing. The Deists 30 had made the mistake, biblically speaking, of regarding the world as a machine created to function on its own according to built‑in laws. God was thought of as a sort of machine‑minder who needed only rarely to 'intervene' to rescue the machine from a malfunction (a seized‑up bearing shall we say), or to supply it with material. He exercised His control from outside. This, however, does scant justice to the richness of the Bible's teaching. This teaching is that God is not only 'over all' (transcendent) but 'in all' (immanent). The relationship to the creation is perhaps something like that of a sponge in the sea. Each is 'in' the other (but not in an equivalent sense). Accordingly the Bible sometimes speaks of the creation being in God (the sponge in the sea); and sometimes of God being in the creation (the sea in the sponge) 31. There are two or three notable passages in the New Testament which stress this continuing dependence of the creation on God. Paul, speaking of Christ as the divine Agent of creation, says, in Him were all things created, . things visible and . invisible, . and He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together, or cohere 32. The great 19th‑century scholar J.B. Lightfoot commenting on this says. "He is the principle of cohesion in the Universe. He impresses upon creation that unity and solidarity which makes it a cosmos instead of a chaos. Thus (to take one instance) the action of gravitation . . is an expression of His mind" 33. No doubt Lightfoot would have agreed that Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are too. The writer to the Hebrews similarly makes of Christ the vast assertion, He reflects the glory of God . . upholding the universe by His word of power 34. In a backward look at the course of world history the elders before the throne of God in the book of Revelation praise Him because, Thou didst create all things; by Thy will they were created and have their being 35. In the New Testament, whenever God's involvement with the dynamics of natural processes is mentioned (in general terms rather than with reference to particular historical instances), the verb is always in the present tense, which corresponds rather to our present continuous than to our present simple (e.g. 'I am doing' rather than 'I do'). Thus God makes His sun to rise, sends rain, feeds the birds and clothes the lilies 36, Jesus tells us. We miss his whole point if we regard all these statements merely as relaying beautiful thoughts. They are intended to disclose hard facts; there is no point in making them if they don't. In the Old Testament it is the same; God's involvement with His creation is not something finished and done with when we reach Genesis 2. He makes springs gush forth; animal life of all kinds looks to Him for food; stormy winds fulfil His command; He gives the fixed order of day and night, and so on 37. He is the God in whose hand our breath is 38. All these usages convey the same impression. God is very much involved in the continuing existence and functioning of His world; and it is again His creative word Peter, tells us, by which he gives effect to His will 39.
The relationship we have been speaking about is, of course, what theologians refer to as God's 'immanence', His presence everywhere and in all things. This must be set alongside His transcendence, for the Bible, as we have seen, insists on both. This certainly poses a problem for thought; how are we to conceive of such a complex double relationship? It is natural in such circumstances to look for an analogy or model which embraces as much as possible of its more important features. A book and its author is a useful one to illuminate the relationship of creation to time. What we want is one to illuminate particularly that of transcendence to immanence, and for this purpose I should like to adapt one suggested by the late Professor D.M. MacKay 40. It runs somewhat as follows. Instead of thinking of creation as manufacture (the manipulation of matter into objects, like the Deist's watch) he suggests that we think of the process by which the busy two‑dimensional world of a television screen, full of colour, life and interest, is held in being. The world on the screen has an existence of its own: yet it is clearly a dependent world. It is established by energy from outside; one throw of the switch and it dissolves into nothingness 41. Moreover, its dependence is a moment‑by‑moment affair, and only the continuing goodwill of the broadcasting authorities keeps the show going. Yet this lively world need not be reflecting the goodwill of its sponsors. It may be filled with scenes of violence and hate totally abhorrent to them. Thus the model illustrates (however imperfectly) not only transcendence and immanence (as characteristics of the sponsoring authority, that is) but also that element of freedom to rebel which we know so well in our real world. However, as Professor MacKay himself warned, "Every illustration brings with it a crop of possible misunderstandings which counterbalance its usefulness" 42; so we must not push it too far.
We may attempt to summarize the biblical teaching of God's immanence, so far as it is relevant to our subject, in this way. Nature is so constituted that it is legitimate to think of physical processes as taking place in accordance with fixed laws, laid down by the Creator and giving to Nature a certain in‑built autonomy. Examples of this emphasis are Job 28.25,26 for atmospheric phenomena: Jer.5.22 for terrestrial, Jer.31.35,36 for celestial; Jer.8.7 for zoological; and indeed the original ordinance of Gen.1.11,12 which established for the biological world the fundamental principle that like reproduces like 43. Yet we would be mistaken if we took this to imply that God's relation to Nature is like that of an aircraft pilot who has handed over his machine to automatic controls. This would be seriously to undervalue the Bible's teaching that it is God's ceaseless faithfulness and 'steadfast love' that alone maintain what we regard as the law‑abidingness of Nature 44. Who would think it appropriate to speak of the faithfulness of a pilot whose plane was flying automatically? The most he could mean would be that the pilot was holding himself ready to assume control in an emergency ‑ a quite inadequate representation of the situation of which the Bible speaks. Interestingly, the Greek word automatos (from which we get 'automatic') occurs twice in the New Testament (Mark 4.28, Acts 12.10,11); on the first occasion it suggests the element of autonomy in Nature 45, on the second the divine control over Nature 44. Evidently there is no conflict between the two ways of looking at things: but the whole tenor of Scripture tells us that the second is the more fundamental 46. The ultimate truth is that whatever happens in Nature (whether through 'miraculous' angelic mediation as in Acts 12.10,11 or in the ordinary course of things as in Mark 4.28), God ultimately is the Giver of its actuality (if such an ugly phrase can be pardoned). When Jesus tells us that our heavenly Father "feeds the birds and clothes the lilies", it is clearly unacceptable to interpret his meaning as if he had added, "Circumstances permitting". Jesus knew as well as we do that birds die in hard winters and flowers suffer malformations. His words are empty of power to reassure if they are qualified by any suggestion that in the end, God may be defeated by the vagaries of nature. Nor can he possibly mean that, in such an eventuality, God like a good father will make it up to us in some other way. The only possible consistent understanding of his words is to take him as meaning, "Don't be anxious; your Father controls everything, in wisdom, love and power". And when he later added (in anything but the spirit of hyperbole), even the hairs of your head are all numbered, he indicated that this matter of the divine solicitude extends to the ultimately small. There would seem to be no excuse, on this testimony, for denying it even to the myriad electrons and photons that throng the universe of microphysics 47.
For man, made in the image of God and charged with dominion under Him, two serious corollaries follow from the Bible's teaching. The first is that what we have come to call 'Nature' is not to be regarded as divine, and worshipped. Men have often in the past worshipped the sun, moon and heavenly bodies, or certain animals and trees. Some still do. The Bible makes clear that this is a futile practice and a God‑forbidden one 48. The truth is (the Bible implies), that as nature was created out of nothing, so in the form we know it nature will one day vanish into nothing, like a television picture when the power is cut off; or better, when the set is switched to a new channel 49.
The second corollary is that man cannot escape his responsibility as the steward of the physical creation. It has become fashionable in some quarters to call the idea of man's lordship "cosmic arrogance", as that able and influential writer Stephen J. Gould does 50. This is foolish. The biblical teaching must be understood as a whole; and when it is, the denial of man's lordship over nature becomes not cosmic humility (as Gould would imply) but cosmic evasion, dereliction of duty. For further, the Bible clearly teaches (what its critics overlook) that man's lordship is to be exercised on the pattern of his Maker's, for he is made in God's image 51, and it leaves us in no doubt about what this pattern is. The Lord is good to all, and His compassion is over all that He has made; Thou openest Thy hand, Thou satisfiest the desire of every living thing; He will gather the lambs in His arms and gently lead those that are with young52. Is then the charge of "cosmic arrogance" against the Bible's doctrine of man's dominion over nature, justified? Certainly not. The lordship of man over the creation is to be expressed in compassionate stewardship, never in greedy exploitation 53. It is true, like so many of Scripture's great principles, the mandate has been sadly misunderstood and perverted by those to whom it was addressed; but this cannot excuse us from recalling and obeying its implied obligations.
The biblical doctrine of Creation is one of the distinctive glories of the Christian faith, and indeed of the faith of Israel from which it sprang. It is what the Scriptures (1 Tim.4.6) call "good doctrine", nourishing to the spirit and full of health and wholesomeness 54. Men and women who receive it have at once an understanding of their humanity. They know what they are, where they are and why they are here. Gone are the spectres of meaninglessness, pointlessness and absurdity 55. They hear the voice of conscience and duty. It may not be sweet and soothing, but it is no longer something trivial, arbitrary, irrelevant or unintelligible, a mere tormenting accident of existence. It sounds a challenge and points a direction. It gives a reason for behaviour and the promise of peace of heart. Or they feel the pull of romantic idealism, the unbearable longing for something 'beyond' 56; and it is no longer a mere will o' the wisp, a cruel deceit, an unaccountable self‑deception of the human mind. If the Bible is true and God is Creator, however far off the object of desire is, it is at least there, as a Reality to be sought. Otherwise the future is undefined, undefinable, and arguably merely the stillness of final oblivion. Bertrand Russell, in his famous essay A Free Man's Worship 57, wrote that "only on the firm foundation of unyielding despair can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built." That was in 1903, reiterated in 1917. This outlook, reinforced by the increasing threat of history's violent human antagonisms now becoming global, still seems to hold in thrall many minds today, with Darwinian fundamentalists trying to make the best they can of it. Against it the biblical doctrine of God the Creator stands as a sure defence ‑ reinforced a thousandfold by its promise that one day all things are to be made new (Rom.8.20‑25; Rev.21,22) when Jesus Christ comes to reign. It is hardly too much to say that the choice facing our post‑modern culture lies exactly here: Biblical promise or neo‑Darwinist despair.
This chapter has discussed not the enfeebled creator‑idea of deism which evidently is all that Prof Dawkins and others who think with him have in mind, but the biblical doctrine which is fundamentallydifferent. Darwinist arguments may damage their deism, but they are powerless against the Bible's theism; it towers above them. If Darwinists wish to engage this they will have to abandon their science‑based arguments, and turn to intuitive ethical ones instead, as indeed Prof Dawkins seems to realize 58. Their God is too small
It is sometimes a simple synonym for 'create' (e.g. in Gen.5.1). As a general rule it is best to refer to the RV for literal accuracy.
Von Rad: "It is correct to say that the verb bara, 'create', contains the idea both of complete effortlessness and creatio ex nihilo, since it is never connected with any statement of the material" (GENESIS, op. cit. p.49).
Something that is, about what (unfortunately) is often called 'secondary creation': this term rather lowers the dignity of the key idea.
The Bible occasionally has passages like Ezek.21.30 or 28.13, but this is quite untypical and hardly affects our overall conclusion.
Isaiah 48.6,7,13.20; Ps.51.10. "Just as chapter 1 understands nature as created by God's word, so the Old Testament knows history also as created by God's word. See Isaiah 9.7; 55.l0ff . ." von Rad, GENESIS, op.cit. (p.52).
This analogy throws light on the problem of self‑will, for as Dorothy Sayers noted in THE MIND OF THE MAKER, fictional characters, once created, do have a sort of free‑will of their own. They can't just be made to do anything the author wishes, or they lose their credibility. See also the later television analogy.
Of course, stories by human authors do have characters dropping in suddenly ‑ but that is because our stories are only narrow slices of the whole. On the other hand, as we shall see below. God is under no necessity to link every physical event in His story to earlier events in a law‑described way; He can introduce what we call 'miracle'.
So we cannot 'explain away' the existence of predators, poisonous snakes, or noxious insects as if they were not His creatures, however much we would like to (see Ps.104.21; Numb.21.6; Exod.23.28; John1.3)
Deism was a system of natural (as opposed to revealed) religion which began in England in the late 17th century. It became highly influential in France and Germany; some of its great names are Toland, Tindal, Rousseau and Lessing.
Rev.4.11 (REB, NIV). The two verbs using 'create' (one active and one passive) are aorists, signifying a past action complete in itself; 'have their being' is the imperfect, literally 'were being'.
Philosophically this view may be very difficult. But it is not uniquely so. Other precisely‑defined views are equally difficult. The matter is further discussed in Chap. XI.
Deut.25.4; Luke 12.42‑48. In Gen.1.28 man is charged to replenish the earth and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea . . the fowl of the air . . and every living thing that moveth upon the earth (RV), 'earth' (Heb. erets) here clearly having its commonest meaning 'land' in antithesis to 'sea' and 'air'; contrast Ps.85.11 where it answers to 'heaven'. Gen.2.5,8,15,20 particularise man's charge; it is to dress the garden prepared and to keep it (RV; care for it NIV). Man then names the animals and birds, thus expressing his rulership. They included cattle (RV, REB; livestock NIV) as well as wild beasts. This mention of apparently domesticated animals before the Fall is instructive: see my chapter 'The Primal Creation' and Anthony A Hoekema, CREATED IN GOD'S IMAGE (Paternoster/Eerdmans, 1986)
It would be difficult to substantiate claims that propaganda about "man's origin by natural selection". "the survival of the fittest", or Darwin's "Preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life" had ever advanced human happiness or welfare; rather, historically it has been quite otherwise. This doesn't of course disprove the ideas; but it does have a bearing on what we teach our young children. If they had criminals among their ancestors would we be eager to inform them? But if we believed that man was "made in the image of God" we should certainly tell them. Their possible evolutionary connections could wait till they were mature enough to decide the implications for themselves.
cf. Steven Weinberg (a Nobel prizewinner). THE FIRST THREE MINUTES (Andre Deutsch, London, 1977) "The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless".
MYSTICISM AND LOGIC (Penguin Books, 1953). Russell more or less confirmed this in his Preface of 1917. where he mentioned his failing conviction about there being an objective difference between good and evil, that is presumably, between right and wrong (cf. Dawkins, UNWEAVING THE RAINBOW chap.9 Penguin Bks 1999)
Dawkins' 'trump card' exemplifies this; see Keith Ward GOD, CHANCE AND NECESSITY pp.190ff (One World Publications, Oxford 1996). In the end he realises that he has to descend from his scientific perch to the common level of all thinking men and women, scientists or not. Science cannot prove his case; his 'fundamentalist' convictions, shared by Atkins, Dennett and others (Monod's "Pure chance, absolutely free but blind, at the very root . ") alas, desert him.

These are passages that Cold Springs Community Church leaders have suggested as essential Scriptures to memorize. We're going to post one a month so you can reflect on each for some time. (The first one - for March 2013 - is short!)
This is the 3 month reading plan suggested by Bro Rajkumar. Finish The Bible in 2 months, meditate on the verses for a month. Remarks and Suggestions a. Before the Bible reading please pray according to Psalm 119;and believe God’s promise in Jeremiah 33:3 b. Remember the Holy Spirit is your teacher. c. Preferably read your 20 chapters at one sitting early morning. Short breaks of a few minutes in between help. If you cannot read at one sitting read ten chapters in the morning and the rest at night d. Whatever the Holy Spirit speaks to you from your reading (maybe just a couple of verses) please meditate on. As you lie down to sleep at night let your mind be occupied by these verses. d. Buy a new notebook and write down everything what the Holy Spirit speaks to you. e. Do not make this exercise a burden but ENJOY it by realizing you are having fellowship with God f. One dos not read the scriptures to just know the scriptures but one reads it to KNOW GOD through the scriptures.
This plan is a year-long plan that covers the Old Testament once and the New Testament four times. Each consists of one reading of history, one of prophecy, one of poetry, one of gospels/early church, and one of epistles.
This reading plan will encourage both an appreciation of Christmas and an anticipation of Jesus' second advent.
What if there was a visible way to discern whether one’s faith was legitimate or nothing more than hollow religion? What if God’s grace had ensured genuine belief in Jesus had an outward and discernible manifistation clearly distinguishable from just knowing, saying and doing the right things? Enter James, Jesus’ intrepid younger brother, whose short letter pierces though the self-deception and lukewarm living all too common among professing Christians. No New Testament book is more influenced by the teachings of Jesus nor more controversial throughout church history, than James’ epistle. So if you have asked the question “how do we know our faith is real”, then this hard-hitting letter from James has the answers you’ve been waiting for.

We do tons of reading for school/college. When its our favorite novel, no matter how big, we're done in a few days... here's my challenge to you... can you finish the Bible this summer?
This reading plan follows the Common Lectionary, weekly (Sunday) scriptures. Each week, there is a specifically identified Old Testament reading, a reading from the Psalms, a New Testament reading, and a reading from one of the four Gospels. This is a part of a globally used 3 year plan. This plan coincides with the Sunday morning scriptures used at Gateway Community Church, as well as many other churches throughout Christendom around the world. Although there is also a DAILY lectionary available, choosing to focus daily on the same 4 scripture selections, from Monday to Saturday, culminating with the Pastor's message on the same selections can be a very valuable tool in your spiritual development. If you have ever thought that coming to church and listening to what the Pastor thinks about a passage of scripture doesn't allow you to think for yourself - I would encourage you to commit to reading and reflecting on the passage yourself, or with your family, and allow God to speak to you through these words all week long. You will often find a new perspective each time you reread a passage. God's word is alive. Let it be alive in you.
Discipleship 101 is a ministry of First Alliance Church in Silver Spring, MD. More than simply being religious, Jesus calls us to be one of his disciples - and as we follow him to make disciples of others. This reading program provides a chronological presentation of the life of Christ and the beginning days of the church. The goal is to keep Jesus at the center of everything that we do and all that we aspire to be.
This is a daily devotional to bring you inspiration, courage, strength and so much more to help you to have a stronger relationship with God. Feel Free to Visit our website @ http://www.tdlchurch.org
Historically, the book of Galatians has challenged Christian commentators due largely to the technical discussions of biblical topics ranging from circumcision, to the Torah, to freedom in Christ. A contextual study of Galatians will help to unravel the letter for both Christians and Jews. To be sure, without a proper background to the book we will forever misread Paul, Apostle to the Gentiles. For this particular study, allow me to start in B'resheet (Genesis) with Avraham and circumcision. If we begin to peel back the mysteries surrounding this simple biblical command we stand a better chance at understanding Sha'ul (Apostle Paul) and his enigmatic instructions.
Some traditions hinder our individual relationship with our Heavenly Father; other traditions enhance it. Every Saturday morning, during Sabbath service, Jewish synagogues the world over, engage in the public reading and studying of the Pentateuch (the first five books of Moshe). Each week, a portion (called a "parashah,” usually one to six chapters long) is read and expounded upon by the rabbi and congregation. This schedule has now become part of tradition. Fifty-four portions in all comprise the entire schedule, beginning with Genesis at Rosh HaShanah (Jewish Head of the Year), and concluding with Deuteronomy, around the same time a year later. We invite and encourage you to join the reading schedule that has so inspired the Jewish Community since before the birth of the Church. At the same time, we challenge you to read the portions on your own, mining God's rich, spiritual garden, gleaning the precious nuggets that lay in store for you there. A Messianic commentary for each portion has been provided to assist you in your journey to become a more mature child of HaShem.
Want to read through the Bible in one year, but don't want to be stuck in just one place at a time? This devotional is a well-rounded plan that will daily feed you in four essential areas: 1) Daily reading in the gospels to keep Jesus at the center of your study; 2) Daily reading the inspiration and instruction of Psalms and Proverbs for encouragement and wisdom; 3) Daily reading in the OT for historical background and great faith stories that make up the root system of the Christian Faith; and 4) Daily reading in the NT for the meat believers need to grow in their understanding of the faith. During the course of one year, you'll read through the gospels four times, the NT twice, Psalms and Proverbs twice (except Psalms 119, which is spread out over several days due to its length), and the OT once.
This is an aggressive reading plan where you will read the entire Bible in 30 days. It will require about 2 hours of reading per day for a decently fast reader.
We are called to pray for God to send workers out into the harvest. This plan is for praying regularly over the preparation and attendees of a planned church outreach. {Created for Crossroads Men's Ministry "Wild Game Feast & Outdoor Expo" March 25, 2017}
As of 2016, this is a reasonable order of NT books in the order in which they were written, based on several sources, including some very recent archaeological and manuscript data and textual analysis. Popular consensus on the order lags decades behind academic research, but there is still insufficient data to determine the order. Only future finds and research can increase the probability of an accurate order by dating the original texts (which are very unlikely to exist now). Note: the order of the books is not the same as reading the order of EVENTS, nor as interesting, but it may reveal a little of how the early church developed prior to any canon or Church division.
This plan supplements our sermon series on the letter of 1 Peter. This letter explores what it means to live faithfully as a follower of Jesus in society. As we learn to live out the ways of Jesus in the kingdom of God, our lives will become different--questionable.
Our ten week worship series, reMIX, is a sprint through the Bible, hitting the highest of highlights and themes in God's story with humanity. Our goal is to provide a big picture view of the Bible so, as you read passages personally, you'll have a clear sense of how it all fits together. This series includes 10 weekly plans you can read at your own pace with fresh themes introduced every Sunday. Week one includes readings from Genesis 1-11. Genesis literally means origins or beginnings. It’s a great title for the first book in the Bible because it speaks to the origins of the universe, the beginning of sin, and the start of God’s redemptive rescue plan through our Hebrew Patriarchs – Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. This week, we’ll explore the beginning of the beginnings – specifically to look at the creation story and the introduction of sin – these stories are the foundation of our Judeo-Christian world view.

If you've been reading along, you know that Joseph brought his family to Egypt with great hospitality that turned to enslavement. We pick up the story with God's call on Moses - to be sent back to Egypt to face the most powerful person on the planet with one message - "Let my people go." Exodus is the story of how God won release for his enslaved people and how God would seek to give them a new identity through the Law and priestly codes. For forty years, these former slaves slept in and ate sand, until a new generation which had no memory of slavery would be ready to reenter the land promised to Abraham. This is our story.

Joshua tells the story of Joshua's leadership after Mose' death and his call to capture and claim the Promised Land. Judges tells numerous stories of the Israelites in conflict with the "locals" and God's call to raise up leaders to lead these conflicts. Ruth is the beautiful story of Ruth and Naomi's deep, unlikely and inseparable relationship. We continue the theme of God calling unlikely and imperfect people to fulfill his ongoing mission to forge Israel into a nation. This is our story.

Week five includes readings from 1-2 Samuel and 1-2 Kings - the rise and fall of Israel as a regional political power. If you've been reading along, you know that Joshua led the Israelites into the promised land and God's people entered into a period of settlement and unrest while guided by Judges - God called leaders and legal counsel. Now as God’s people settle in to the tribal areas assigned to them, they ask Samuel, their prophet/judge for a king – so they can “be like other nations.” We pick up the story this week with God’s relenting to this unwise request and subsequent parade of kings who at first bring Israel to glory, but quickly lead the people into division and eventual conquest and exile. Rise and fall, obedience and rebellion, repentance and restoration – the story of a people who make God their Source and then reject Him sounds like a broken record. And sadly, it is our story as well. God disciplines those He loves. Let’s sing that song as we explore this week’s theme – Nation Building and Busting.
The Feasts of ADONAI are dress rehearsals of Messianic Redemption. Our LORD Yeshua has literally and prophetically fulfilled the first four of the seven feasts mentioned in Leviticus 23; it is my belief that the Torah teaches that he will, likewise, literally and prophetically fulfill the final three at his soon to be second arrival. As the children of Avraham willingly and faithfully lived out HaShem’s yearly cycle of “mo-eydeem,” the Spirit of the Holy One graciously opened their hearts to understand that, as his treasured possession, they were responsible to actively pursue a genuine, personal, loving relationship with their Heavenly Abba. It is this type of personal relationship that HaShem has always desired from the nation of Isra'el, and through the grace poured out to Isra'el, the surrounding Gentile nations might also see the goodness and mercy of ADONAI, and seek to become one of his treasured possessions as well (read Deut. 4:5-8). Today, our covenant responsibilities to our Holy God have not changed any more than the covenants made with his Treasured People have changed. He is our God and we are his people!

Today I am happy to introduce historical fiction and fantasy young adult author, Coreena McBurnie, who will talk to us about her new series Prophecy which retells the story of Antigone. Prophecy is the first book in the series and is now available. See below for more details about Prophecy and Coreena down below.
Hi, Coreena. Thank you for stopping by the blog today for an author interview! Can you tell us about the journey that led you to write your book?
I had always wanted to write about Antigone, but wasn't sure where to start, especially because I envisioned a young adult novel and some of the subject matter is delicate -- like Antigone being the child of incest (her mother is her grandmother and her father is also her brother). I also really love Sophocles' plays involving Antigone -- she has always been one of my favourite characters from Greek myth -- and I wanted to do her justice. About four years ago, I was signed up to do National Novel Writing Month (a challenge to write 50,000 words in November) and didn't know what to write. I finally decided to tackle Antigone. I sat down and decided not to worry about what was in the Greek myth, that was all set and done, and instead decided to write without trying to tiptoe around the sticky issues. Once I did that, Antigone found her voice, one that was surprising even to me.
Why did you decide to retell the Oedipus myth from the point of view of Antigone when Antigone has a story of her own?
I decided to do this because I wanted to start the story at the beginning. Oedipus' and Antigone's stories are most famously told by Sophocles in his Oedipus plays, the last of which is called Antigone. My book, Prophecy, is the first of a planned trilogy mirroring these three plays. I wanted to get to the roots of Antigone's amazing sense of duty that we know her for and thought the place to start would be with the profound impact her family story must have had on her life.
I love Athena, the goddess of wisdom. She is strong, independent, and smart, which has always appealed to me. She even has an owl as her animal symbol. And, her temple is the Parthenon in Athens -- an amazingly fantastic building!
That's a tough one, but I'd probably have to say Theseus and the Minotaur because it is the first myth that I remember learning about way back in elementary school. I wrote a report on it and I was fascinated -- I think my love for Greek myth began there.
I have just started reading The Readers of Broken Wheel Recommend by Katarina Bivald, a Swedish author. So far it is very good, and promises to be a funny, quirky read. It's about a young Swedish woman who has never travelled before and is now visiting her elderly pen pal in a small town in Iowa called Broken Wheel. However, when she arrives, her pen pal friend has died, but the young woman ends up staying for her visit anyway. I am really enjoying Swedish writing in general right now because the sense of humour appeals to me.
Even though Antigone is an ancient Theban princess, her struggles to find herself and do what she thinks is best, despite what everyone else says, is pretty universal and applicable, even today.
I have studied Classical myth and culture for years, I even have degrees in Classical Studies, and I have put my love for Greek myth into this book.
Sixteen year old Princess Antigone, daughter of the infamous ancient Greek King Oedipus, wants to lead a normal life and fulfill her duty to the gods, her city, and her family, but fate has other plans. The Olympian gods bless her, the snakes talk to her, her parents want her to marry a foreign prince, her embroidery looks like burial shrouds for dogs, and she has fallen in love with the wrong boy. When the mysterious and devastating prophecies surrounding her family are revealed, Antigone must choose where her allegiance lies: With the gods who have betrayed her family but who she is obliged to serve? With her plague ridden city? With her family which lay in ruins? Or even with herself?
My name is Coreena McBurnie and, ever since grade 5 when I had to do a report on Theseus and the Minotaur, I have had a soft spot for Greek mythology. When I hit university, I was drawn to the Classical Studies department (earning both a BA & MA), where I explored the archaeology and culture of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds — and also where I managed to read Homer’s Odyssey, one of my absolute favourite books, in the original Greek, something which was thrilling for me (I know, sounds crazy, but the poetry and scope of the original text is amazing). After a lifetime of “what is that?”, “why did you study that?”, and “what can you do with a degree in Classical Studies?” I have decided to write novels based in ancient myth and to bring so many of the stories I love to life for a modern audience, with my own spin, of course.
Prophecy, Book 1 in the Antigone Series, is my first published novel. Currently I am working on Book 2 in the Antigone Series, called Fate. I am also in the middle of another novel about Clytemnestra who is notorious in Greek myth for killing her husband, Agamemnon, when he returned home from the Trojan War. I love exploring the motives of strong women in ancient myth.
I live in BC, Canada with my husband, our three kids, and our cat, in a beautiful part of the country, on two rivers, surrounded by ranches, near ski hills, and only a couple of hours drive to the ocean.
I vaguely remember Antigone's story, it was sad if I recall. I love a good Greek myth retelling and the cover is stunning.
Athena is my favourite Greek goddess too. I love reading Greek myth retellings so I'll have to check Prophecy out.
I absolutely adore Greek mythology so this looks like something I will love! What a wonderful interview too, I love getting to know author's methods and ideas when writing a book, so much fun and always interesting!
Aw, I always love to hear that a book got its start during Nanowrimo and is now getting officially published :) I'm not super familiar with Antigone's story, but the author's take on it sounds interesting!

Eugenia Swift is a young woman of singular sensibilities, a connoisseur of beauty...and naturally inclined to tackle even the most difficult tasks on her own. As the director of the Leabrook Glass Museum, she's been asked to travel to Frog Cove Island— an artistic haven near Seattle— to catalog an important collection of art glass belonging to the late Adams Daventry. But thanks to unsavory rumors surrounding Daventry's death, the museum insists that Eugenia take along Cyrus Chandler Colfax— a rough-hewn private investigator whose taste in glass runs to icy cold bottles filled with beer. When Colfax declares they must pose as a couple, Eugenia protests in terms as loud as his Hawaiian shirts. She's loath to disclose the secret purpose of her trip: investigating the disappearance of her good friend Nellie Grant...the late Adam Daventry's lover. Meanwhile, the green-eyed calm of Colfax's gaze shields his own hidden agenda— locating a priceless Daventry treasure that will help him avenge an old wrong.
While Eugenia has always kept her heart on a shelf, their very lives soon depend on making an utterly convincing couple. Because among the chic galleries of Frog Cove Island lurks a killer, and their only chance for survival is the boldest, most artful collaboration they can dare to imagine.
Suspense, taut plotting, and the fascinating world of art glass combine with an unlikely hero-heroine pairing in Sharp Edges. On the surface, Eugenia and Cyrus are nothing alike: she’s a sophisticated museum director with a passion for art glass, while he’s a a private detective who dresses in loud Hawaiian shirts. She’s impatient and headstrong; he’s self-controlled and doggedly patient, a self-described “tortoise” rather than a “hare.” I was skeptical of their attraction to each other at first, but as I got to know each one better, I realized along with them that they share some fundamental traits: loyalty, a sense of responsibility and of justice, determination, commitment, honor, and strength of character. Those shared characteristics make the pairing work despite their surface differences– and their initially conflicting agendas.
While the focus is strongly on Eugenia and Cyrus and the dual mysteries they are trying to solve, the secondary characters are well-drawn and, in the case of Cyrus’s nephew Rick, engaging as well. Cyrus’s relationship with Rick does a lot to establish and deepen his character, but despite the fact that he doesn’t get a lot of page time, I liked young Rick as well. He’s a kid on the cusp of manhood, trying to find his feet. I’d love to know what he did with his life (hint to Ms. Krentz: he’d be about 36 now, just the right age to be the hero in his own book!)
The plot twists and turns in true JAK style, and overall, it’s well-constructed. I did feel there was a weakness in one character’s actions and her explanation of them, and the villain’s methods aren’t clearly laid out, but those are minor quibbles that didn’t keep me from enjoying the story. And the book holds up quite well despite its age (it was published in 1998.) Sharp Edges is a solid entry in the Krentz canon.
The author of over 40 consecutive New York Times bestsellers, JAYNE ANN KRENTZ writes romantic-suspense, often with a psychic and paranormal twist, in three different worlds: Contemporary (as Jayne Ann Krentz), historical (as Amanda Quick) and futuristic (as Jayne Castle). There are over 30 million copies of her books in print.
She earned a B.A. in History from the University of California at Santa Cruz and went on to obtain a Masters degree in Library Science from San Jose State University in California. Before she began writing full time she worked as a librarian in both academic and corporate libraries.
I read a few JAK books when I first got into romance novels, probably about 10 years ago. I haven’t read many, though, and I’m thinking I should read some more of her books now. I’m glad you liked this. It does sound good and I’m adding it to my TBR.
I have only read one of her books (under her pseudonym Amanda Quick) and really enjoyed it. I need to read her books under this name. This one sounds good even despite the small flaws you mention. I am glad you enjoyed it!
Her books as Krentz (which I think is her real name) are always contemporary, and usually romantic suspense; she uses Amanda Quick for her historical romance/romantic suspense. For a while, there was a paranormal element to most of her books (ESP rather than werewolves etc.), but in the last few years, she seems to have gone back to straightforward romantic suspense, except for her futuristic RS written as Jayne Castle. Her books aren’t deep, but they’re page-turners!

The London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a reference point in determining interest rates for financial instruments in the U.S. and globally. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) established a multidistrict litigation for cases alleging that banks understated their borrowing costs, depressing LIBOR and enabling the banks to pay lower interest rates on financial instruments sold to investors. Over 60 actions were consolidated, including the Gelboim class action, which raised a single claim that banks, acting in concert, had violated federal antitrust law. The district court dismissed all antitrust claims and granted certifications under Rule 54(b), which authorizes parties with multiple-claim complaints to immediately appeal dismissal of discrete claims. The Second Circuit dismissed the Gelboim appeal because the order appealed from did not dispose of all of the claims in the consolidated action. A unanimous Supreme Court reversed. The order dismissing their case in its entirety removed Gelboim from the consolidated proceeding, triggering their right to appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1291, which gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over appeals from “all final decisions of the district courts.” Because cases consolidated for MDL pretrial proceedings ordinarily retain their separate identities, an order disposing of one of the discrete cases in its entirety qualifies under section 1291 as an appealable final decision. The JPML’s authority to transfer civil actions for consolidated pretrial proceedings, 28 U.S.C. 1407, refers to individual “actions,” not to a monolithic multidistrict “action” and indicates Congress’ anticipation that, during pretrial proceedings, final decisions might be rendered in one or more of the consolidated actions. The Gelboim plaintiffs are no longer participants in the consolidated proceedings.
You may have heard both negative and positive things about Acai Burn so we are looking to answer all your questions here today. Acai Burn comes in pill capsules and can be found on different supplement stores online. This product promises to burn fat although the main ingredient, Acai Berry, does not burn fat. When added to diet and exercise, this product promises to boost your weight loss with its supplement blend.

Some studies show a little weight loss in about 12% of those that take the supplement. This product might be helpful in boosting your weight loss and/or getting your diet off to a strong start. Be careful as you will be enrolled in an automated shipment program when you purchase this supplement on certain websites.
Acai is a natural berry that is a superfood but does not burn fat. This superfood provides extra antioxidants for your health and is often eaten raw or mixed in a juice. Comes from a palm tree in the northern section of South Africa.

Taking supplements, drinking cayenne water and juicing. These are all a part of the wonderful world of detoxification 2015. Lets talk about Taking advantage of detoxification. The holidays are over, and your body is feeling really bloated right now. But, before you resort to detoxification, take the following things into consideration:
Your body automatically goes through the detox process on its own. Technically, a detox is what happens when addicts are trying to rid their bodies of addictive substances. The doctors use prescribed drugs to remove bad drugs. People who are healthy really don’t have to go through the detoxification process. Right?
During the 1400’s, Paracelsus was quoted as saying that the dose made the poison. Basically, a drug is only toxic if it is taken in large doses. The body can get rid of the drugs that it does not need. The kidneys, liver, skin and immune system function well together to make this happen.
Don’t go by scale numbers. There’s really not that much research to prove that detoxification is really effective. There may be a few detox diets that work. But the sample sizes for these studies aren’t large enough to provide reliable results. Also, the methodologies aren’t reliable either. Many times the only way that a detox is considered effective is if someone loses weight while trying it. If these detoxification diets really worked, then the creators should provide proof that they work. Basically, most people don’t think that they work. So, remember this if you plan on being a part of the detoxification 2015 craze.
Detox commercials are misleading. They spit out vague words such as cleansing and toxin, but they don’t identify specific toxins. Your body probably is getting rid of these toxins automatically. In all actuality, the toxins probably weren’t bad.
Sure, you probably will lose weight if you use these cleanses. This is because a lot of detox products require you to fast. The body isn’t burning away calories, so it has to burn fat and lean muscle instead. Decrease your calories and you will lose muscle mass. Lose weight when on a 2 or 3 day cleanse, and you will probably gain it all back very soon. This is especially the case if you start eating again.
Sure, you might feel lighter after a cleanse. But this could be because you are suffering from low blood sugar. If you drink a lot of fluids, this will have a laxative impact on your body. You won’t feel as bloated and won’t have as many abdominal pains. But the pains will resume once you start eating again. Get rid of bloating by consuming a prebiotic or by eating foods that have plenty of fiber, such as veggies and oatmeal.
Detoxification 2015 might not be healthy for you. Whether or not these detox products are healthy is very debatable. Many people go on these diets without consulting their physicians first. They end up suffering from things such as the lack of concentration and nausea. If you want to be a part of the detoxification 2015 craze, then speak with your doctor beforehand. However, a good doctor will probably say that it isn’t a good idea.
It has been proven that it’s damaging to the body when you eliminate certain nutrients and electrolytes from your diet. If you have medical conditions such as low blood sugar or heart problems then a detox could be fatal. Since many detox products are laxatives, which is another added risk.
Also, the FDA has warned that manufacturers sometimes like to put additional ingredients in detox products that could be harmful to your health.
It is possible to eat real food and lose weight. This is actually the way that you are supposed to lose weight. Try eating healthy on a regular basis so that you don’t have to resort to cleanses. Drink plenty of water and eat foods rich in fiber. Also make sure that your diet has a lot of protein. In addition to eating healthy, you should exercise. A healthy lifestyle is much better than one that needs commercial cleanses.

After 30 years, researchers have learned a great deal about the fat stored in the body, and the old idea of fat acting simply as a source of energy has been abandoned. Fat’s far reaching effect on an individual’s health is now recognized, and the fact that accumulated fat in specific areas has a more detrimental effect than fat in others has been confirmed. Belly fat, in particular, the fat that forms around the internal organs, has a far reaching, negative influence on a person’s well being.
This inner fat, known as visceral fat, increases the threat of a variety of medical problems, including diabetes (type 2), dementia, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and more. Although it cannot be seen without specialized equipment, body shape can indicate its presence. Someone with a hefty, round belly, considered apple or pear-shaped, probably has too much visceral fat.
A weight loss as small as ten or twenty pounds can reduce the risk of health troubles, but how does a person lose belly fat? Fortunately, deep belly fat is a ready source of energy for the body. Losing pounds and inches through exercise and dieting means a loss of surface and inner belly fats as this energy source is utilized. What’s more, a basic exercise regime will help keep visceral fat from returning.
A healthy diet works. For example, switching from refined grain to whole grain foods while increasing activity decreases harmful abdominal fat. Further research indicates that a diet with polyunsaturated fats like those found in nuts and heart healthy oils, like safflower and peanut oil, are less likely to contribute to belly fat than foods with saturated fats like palm oil.
Living an active life with a heart healthy diet will help an individual avoid the accumulation of belly fat as well as help those willing to turn their lives, and health, in a new and better direction.

Victoza is a drug originally manufactured to combat the disease of diabetes. Studies have shown that taking it in conjunction with exercise and a healthy diet can lead to a 5-10% reduction in body mass. Weight loss studies have been conducted on patients with diabetes as well as those who did not have it and weight loss results were similar. Today, Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Victoza, is working to have it approved as a weight loss drug.
Although Victoza has yet to be officially approved for weight loss, it has become a very popular drug for Novo Nordisk. Its popularity may be because many people are using it for off-label reasons. Sales grew 58 percent in 2012 and another 14 percent in the latter part of 2013. In December, the pharmaceutical company filed two submissions with the FDA in order to prescribe it for weight loss. At this time, it is still only available for prescription to diabetes patients.
Victoza slows digestion and stimulates the production of insulin, which leads to weight loss. The higher the dosage, the larger the weight loss. A study done at the University of Copenhagen showed that subjects taking a dosage of 3.0 mg had an average weight loss of 16 pounds while those who took a doses ranging from 1.2 to 2.4 mg averaged between 10 and 13 pounds.
There are some concerns regarding side effects of taking Victoza including, but not limited to increased risk of pancreaitis as well as tumors of the thyroid. There are many that believe that the overwhelming amount of possible side effects overwhelms the positive benefits.
If history is any indication, regardless of the possible side effects, Victoza will be hugely successful for Novo Nordisk when it eventually becomes approved as a weight loss drug.

Kat Burkhi has said that we must all have soft skin for spring. We spring clean our homes, so why not clean our skin for spring? In fact, let’s go one better and scrub winter off our entire body!
Kat Burkhi began her career as an interior designer; however, she branched out to create soaps and candles with exquisite fragrances. Kat’s natural body creams are in big demand and her pure and natural skin care products contain the best juice for clearing skin.
Women want to glow in the hot summer months. A body scrub clears the dead skin cells but freshly scrubbed skin should be well moisturized. Yes, anyone can create their own body scrub, but you must know the difference between good oil and bad oil. Cold pressed oil is the best juice for clearing skin.
Cold pressed oil is full of nutrition. Your skin needs oil that is rich in fatty acids that will penetrate deep into the skin. DIY sugar scrubs are fine, but lots of homemade skin scrubs melt long before they are applied to your legs and arms.
Kat Burkhi has created a different type of skin scrub. The mask contains cranberry fibers and Hibiscus petals. The scrub is an antioxidant that contains glycolic acid. This amazing scrub contains the best juice for clearing skin, yet it contains no harsh chemicals. Harsh skin products cause untold skin damage, but this gentle scrub can be used twice weekly.
If you are fighting fine lines and wrinkles, it’s time to protect your skin from further damage. Kat has every faith in her unique scrub; she knows that many women will benefit from the lashing of vitamin C contained in the fragrant skin product.

One benefit is the way a cleanse removes waste from your body. This benefit alone can increase your health. Not only can eliminating waste help you feel stronger and more energetic, it will also remove toxins that can lead to illness.
Weight loss is an additional benefit. As some of your excess weight can be attributed to waste, you can lose unwanted pounds through a lime juice cleanse.
Your healthy colon cleanse diet begins with the juice, and allows you to slowly add healthy foods to your diet. Fresh, raw vegetables and fruits, and whole grains will provide the vitamins and minerals you need for good health. They also provide dietary fiber to keep your digestive system working properly.
You can look at a juice cleanse as a moderate form of fasting. Your body can experience the benefits of fasting, while continuing to have some essential nutrition. When you choose a cleanse and follow the instructions, you will have results.
Long-term results come from making healthy choices after completing the diet. You do not have to return to processed foods, junk foods, and other products that are not good for you. Instead, you can maintain your desired weight.
Many individuals have discovered the cleanse to be a safe, effective way to lose weight fast. You can shed pounds, and be healthy. If you are determined to lose pounds, it could be the ideal solution for you.

"One word: 'Awesome!' Heather’s skills & talent as an artist combined with her warm, enthusiastic inclusive approach have afforded my daughter to grow and explore her creative passion. The variety of mediums helped her to try new things and create pieces she is truly proud to show. The technique and theory help to round out her whole learning experience. Thank you Heather!" Shelly Melnyk
"Our daughter has thoroughly enjoyed every class that she’s taken with Heather. So much so, that she invited friends to an art class birthday party. Lots of fun! It’s been a great balance to add a creative activity to her extra-curricular activities." Ruth Rankin
"She loves art. We love framing her work. We love the oil pastels and the watercolors. A beautiful smile after every class to go with a fantastic piece of art!" Pamela Schellling
"My daughter loves coming to art class with Heather. She loves it so much she has asked to join a second class per week. The pieces she has brought home are beautiful. Our favorite painting is on our fireplace mantel so we can see and enjoy it every day. Heather is very talented and works well with the children. We would recommend this class to everyone."

“Our customers asked for an easier way to…” Or, “Our customers asked us to make our vacuums more powerful.” You get the idea.
Whether you work in a technology company or a consumer business, some shy away from saying this, because they don’t want to appear as if they are reactive. They believe they should look proactive enough that their customers never have to ask for a new product feature or service, that the company is way ahead of the curve. That’s not always the best approach.
How else would you know what customers want unless you have a system in place and a culture where there is open dialog? Have all the best inventions come only from companies, or are great products and services partly a result of companies listening to their customers’ needs?
Even more than listening to feedback, you deeply understand the challenges your customers face. When customers ask for something more, it immediately makes sense because you understand their needs.
Dissatisfied customers can leave you for your competitor. The fact that they’ve asked you for an improvement shows they are loyal to you. When you make an improvement to your product or service based on customer feedback, you’re acknowledging that you exist for your customers—not the other way around. Lasting loyalty goes both ways.
Being able to change your service to meet a customer’s need speaks to your capabilities. Customers often hear, “We can’t do that,” or “It’s not our policy…” How gratifying it is for a customer to hear, “Yes, we can do that.”
Companies build their brand reputation when they can demonstrate they have the resources and expertise to deliver what customers want – not just the simple requests, but changes that build brand equity. Of course, most changes don’t happen overnight. The companies that can adapt to what the customers have asked for are the winners.
Customers never want to feel they exist to build your empire. Letting customers know you’ve improved because they asked makes them feel valued.
Years ago, there was a very popular fast food restaurant just a few miles from my home. Although it was close, it was the opposite direction where most people shopped and ate out. I called the chain and unapologetically asked for one closer to where I shopped. Several months later, a restaurant appeared right where I wanted it. As much as I realized their decision was based on far more reasons than my phone call, it felt good believing the company acted because I asked.
There’s no-pressure, no nonsense and no oblgation to use our services... but you’ll probably want to.
Yulia Romanenkova, entrepreneur, banker, founder of the renowned international children’s filmmaking camps (Maksatiha) and inspirational speaker is passionate about using her unique film making programme to develop verbal, social and thoughtful communication in children. This mother of three personally encourages and supports not only her own children but the thousands who pass through her camps to dream up, create and channel their skills, ambitions and thoughts through film. This skill, she believes, teaches that with a bit of hard work and imagination dreams can come true! By making their own films, the children discover their ability to solve tasks in the modern world, learn how to be independent and responsible and focus on the result whilst working in a team. As the inspiration and backbone for the Maksatiha Camp, Yulia believes creativity is not a skill to be taught but rather inspired and developed by its daily practice. In her words “Somewhere along the way, we simply forgot to honour this innate gift and how to access its power”. She feels our role is to encourage learning experiences that increase the ability to recognise and listen to our inner voice.
The main goal of Maksatiha Camp is to help every child discover their own talent and build confidence for their entire life. In a short period, children are encouraged to use their knowledge and enjoy sharing skill sets in a carefully organised setting. Children learn about themselves, other people and the environment, which builds a harmonious sense of community and friendships for life.
In 2008, Yulia opened her first summer camp in Maksatiha, 80 km away from Tver, Russia. In 2013, her family moved to the UK and in 2014 she founded the Maksatics filmmaking holiday camp for Russian speaking children in the UK. Her film-making programme became a highly-effective way of awakening interest in the Russian language. Maksatiha camps have been established in Russia, UK and Italy and accommodate more than 1,000 children per year from over 20 countries.
Yulia is a self-made woman who has more than 25 years of experience in banking and finance. She graduated at the Financial State Academy Russia and worked in the biggest commercial banks in Moscow as a Head of Treasury and head of the FX and MM markets. Then she was invited to work for the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation on matters of State Property and Privatization of the National Internal Debt department. After three years at the Ministry of Finance of RF, she worked as CFO of the metal-steel holding company Mechel. In 2003, she founded financial consulting company Russian Trust Company to offer her experience to private companies wanting to build their business, as well as raise capital to invest in projects in Russia. In 2007, Yulia got her MBA degree from The University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
In 2007, she came back to the banking business and became Chairman of the board of Inbank, Russia and developed online banking for small and medium sized retail companies and individuals. Since 2013 she has been the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Rigensis bank, Latvia.

5 minutes ago Dolly know what it meant to wake up and couldn't even stand up. Which is to be expected. New sensors; new circuits; different response times, different hysteresis, different feedbacks, etc. No way in hell is she ready to go off on her own for normal movements let alone be ready for a combat situation. One or two days in the gym, combat training, orientation and practice regarding the new sensors and new systems that she now has at a minimum would be required to acclimate to the new body. And that is assuming that her "muscles" didn't atrophy while awaiting activation which is probably not true since she "hurt" when she first awoke.
One possible explanation for the pain on waking is that the biological muscles were being electrically stimulated to tighten and relax constantly, keeping her muscles stong, but resulting in her first experience with her muscles being extreme fatigue.
Also, she may be able to do a lot more processing in the same period of time than a human. She would almost have to, it takes humans months to figure out how to walk, and even then we call them toddlers for a reason. Walking is actually one of the toughest nuts to crack in modern robotics.
Depending on how her motor control is designed, it might be just a matter of establishing a bunch of parameters, and adapting response curves accordingly.
Humans need so long to learn motor skills, because out control is based on accumulated experience, rather than on calculations.

Edmodo is an education social networking tool. It provides a means for teachers to easily create an online space where students can connect and communicate. Some examples of some of the things that you can do with Edmodo include:
Set tasks and assignments: Whether it is a quick task or a bigger assignment, Edmodo allows you to easily set dates and provide information and resources. In addition to this, once submitted feedback can be provided in a timely manner. Only limitation is focus on scoring, rather than rubrics.
Provide links and resources: Although URL shorterners and QR codes make it easier to share long webpages, there is nothing better than simply clicking on a link. You can also provide additional materials, such as documents and images to support learning.
A place to respond and reflect: Along with sharing material, Edmodo provides a place for students to post and comment. There are different options associated with this and it can all be locked down by the teacher if needed. Posting can occur within a group or directly with a teacher, but never between students.
Include parents in learning: Parents can be provided with a group code to connect. This does not mean that they will be able to see everything, instead they are connected with their child, having access to assignments, events, alerts, direct messages and anything else you tag them in.
Connect with other teachers globally: An underutilised function, Edmodo provides the ability to connect with teachers in a safe and secure environment. The initial setup asks for information about subject areas, this then aligns teachers with others in their subject areas. There is a stream of information provided that allows people to share and connect. This not only provides the means for finding ideas and resources, but also for collaborating with teachers around the world.
It needs to be noted that Brookside has signed up for School Account. Not only does this help to organise things, but it prevents students from signing up as a teacher and creating their own groups.

Abstract The East Africa Dairy Development program successfully used the volunteer farmer trainer (VFT) approach in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. PIM-supported research on the VFT approach was in part responsible for its uptake by 21 development organizations in Rwanda. Three years after the end of the EADD program in Rwanda, VFTs are still training farmers with support from the government, NGOs, and producer organizations.

For example, one can just switch off the discovery of their profile and only keep chatting to the people one has liked. It shows you both men and women to choose from in its settings.
Apart from these, Tinder also offers general settings like limiting the search distance or age. It allows fxmous to enter your location manually. Tinder Plus is not a free service like Tinder. It dating with a monthly subscription of Rs Also, if you mistakenly swiped someone you like, dating, then you can undo that with Tinder India. TrulyMadly also offers a similar option.
I, however, encountered a little problem while using Tinder, which could have been a technical glitch or maybe the app has been designed that way.
It logged me out on several occasions where there was no net sittes. Next up we have Woo. The app also prompts you siets ask questions from its customised list or you can even type a question of your own before connecting with someone. But the problem with it is that it really pushes you to ask questions. It only shows you a couple of matchmaking options and prompts you to ask at least three questions in order to move further. And then it india you to invite friends on the app, famous is really annoying.
The USP of the app is that it allows you to select india particular interest tag of a person and the search engine stes turn lists all of those site who have that similar interest.
It allows people to record a 7-second voice message optionalwhich displays on their profile. The profile im has a slot to fill in your religion. Woo app too requires you to dxting in with your Facebook account but the issue with india method is that your Facebook dating is exposed also to those people whom you liked, chatted but unmatched later out of certain problems. It does not things you should know about dating a single mom on safety especially for girls as it only sites the initials and not the full name of girls.
The app settings are more or less same for Woo too as one can choose to see people based on distance, age and sex. Well, to site with, let me tell new free dating apps 2014 that OkCupid caters to a much larger mass india famous sexual orientations.
It asked me if I was straight, gay or bisexual in the beginning and of course my gender. OkCupid more or less relies on a search algorithm based on datting. It is, however, likely to make your dating experience better if you fill in your profile summary relating to your interests famius hobbies. You can also mention famous age preferences, area preferences and whether you are interested in new friends or dating.
Apart from ij few mentioned above, it also attempts to famouz into your smoking and drinking habits, religion, body famous, relationship type etc. It is good for people who are looking for serious relationships and want to be sure of the match before liking or messaging a person. It shows you your match percentage with the profiles displayed based on interests and proximity.
OkCupid by far has the dating elaborate search filter. It does not just allow you to browse matches based on location, age, relationship status etc but also on ethnicity, religion, drinks, income, job and manhattan broadcasting half price hook up diet. So this is why it datings so important to fill out your site profile properly, so as to appear in searches with common interests.
With A-list, you can view all your profile visitors and those who liked you; search by many more filters such as body type and attractiveness; browse other people in the incognito mode etc. This happens to be one of the oldest site datting and is famous full of dudes just kidding.

From the Summer 1991 issue of Sega Visions Magazine. For whatever reason there was no Niles adventure that issue, so we ran this promo on the back cover. Not sure if all the anatomy is spot-on in that drawing, but ya gotta love those shoelaces! They're as loopy as Spider-Man's webbing! Oh, and there's my buddy Dave LeBlanc again, last seen in the "Columns" episode...
From the Fall 1991 issue of Sega Visions Magazine. This was a pretty straight-forward Ninja game, as far as I can tell from this adventure, with the possible exception of some robots and a big green floating head being part of the fray. There are lots of fun action poses here, and the layout had some nice twists. Cool Asian-influenced lettering on the logo, too. Maybe a little too much purple... FUN FACT: I'd long been unhappy with the color registration on these comic pages. As I detailed in my Episode 2 "Columns" blog post, I very laboriously and meticulously applied the color to a separate overlay, which I carefully registered to the line art (using those old peel-off registration marks of yore), and yet the registration was always off on the printed art. After seeing the mediocre printing on this episode, I inquired of Creative Director John Sprague to look into what was going on in the pre-press process. He discovered that the pre-press people were shooting the line art on a photostat camera, and scanning the color art on a rotary scanner (state of the art in those days). Well, anyone who's ever used a stat camera knows they are operated by cranks, gears, and pulleys and have more in common with medieval torture devices than digital technology. You bump into it or even breathe on it, and you change the calibration. Trying to duplicate the exact size on a separate device is a fool's errand. Apparently, it was cheaper than a scan, but for the next issue, we finally arranged for both the color overlay and the line art to be scanned. Little did we know that Episode 6 of Niles Nemo In Segaland would be the last!
This issue also featured the house ad announcing the "Draw a Sonic the Hedgehog comic strip and win an appearance in the next Niles Nemo in Segaland adventure" contest. Lots of hand-lettering in that word balloon...
From the April-May 1991 issue of Sega Visions Magazine featuring "Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse™". Bringing this Niles adventure to life was in some ways a wilder ride than that of Disneyland's Mister Toad! When I was told I'd be illustrating a story featuring Niles encountering Mickey Mouse™, I was excited at the prospect of drawing my own version of one of the world's most iconic characters. I assumed that the good folks at Disney would send me some model sheets, and I'd take it from there. Not quite, as it turned out. Early in negotiations we were informed that Mickey could only appear on the game box, and everywhere else where he "appeared" in the comic, he would have to be unseen, speaking off-panel! Disney Corp. retains stringent control over the use of its characters, and no one outside of their auspices could be allowed to draw Mickey, nor could he be shown interacting with characters outside of the Disney oeuvre. So much for that! Ultimately, I came up with the pencil art, and that was submitted for approval. All was okay, except on Page 1, I had depicted Niles wearing mouse ears (like hundreds of millions of theme park visitors have done over the last 60 years). Nope! The ears had to go. I'd originally had Niles discarding his hat in the last panel on Page one. Now he's juggling a jewel from the game. So, here comes the FUN FACT: When I laid out the page, I worked out a way that Mickey could subliminally appear! Only after the final art was done did I share this fact with the Creative Director, John Sprague. I drew a quick tissue overlay outlining the hidden Mickey. John's astounded response: "Dave, you are CRAZY!" Well, it all went to press, and no one ever spotted the little trick I played on the good folks at Disney. See the progression I created to demonstrate the gag below:
Many years later, in 2006, I very nice young chap named Ken Horowitz approached me out of nowhere to interview me about my experience drawing Niles, and over the course of said interview, I revealed my secret. The interview can be found here on Ken's Sega-16 appreciation website. It was conducted via email, and I think it went pretty well, except I said "cookie," where I really meant "Easter egg," which coincidentally is a term coined by Niles co-creator Bill Kunkel, according to at least one Internet source. Mr. Horowitz also conducted an interview with Bill, which can be found here. This Niles Nemo adventure may be the most surreal of them all, with wild layouts, painful puns, and crazy characters such as a witch, a clown, several animated toys, and strange creatures of the forest.

Moving right along...! From the Winter 1990/91 issue of Sega Visions. This third episode of Niles features a cast of barbarians, elves, warrior skeletons, Huns, dragons, a couple of female warriors, and a cameo appearance by me, as I more or less looked at the time, disguised as a one-eyed Norseman (Page 2, Panel 4). Another complex story brimming with characters and as much plot as Bill could cram into two-pages while simultaneously demonstrating the basics of the game. FUN FACT: I originally drew the game controller as the Sega-16 model, it being the current version, but before publication (and luckily before inked art), someone discovered that the game was not available yet for Sega-16, so I changed Niles' "weapon" to the Master System controller.

Modelling exercice in Chavant Nsp plastalina (oil-based clay), following Philippe Faraut's instructions on his dvd.
If you are looking for a single series of face modelling lessons on DVD, this is likely the only one you'll really need. Philippe Faraut is a sculptor I admire for his accurately defined forms which also magically contain so much grace and life. Sharp edges meet smooth planes, without looking fake, although they are often stylized. Real human flesh seems to have been magically turned to clay.
OVERALL REVIEW: Absolutely recommended, a must-have for anyone willing to pay attention and spend the time to learn sculpting. Complete beginners will get it very quickly. Faraut is great at simplifying. He sometimes makes a common mistake on purpose, so that he can show you how to fix it and avoid it in the future. Experimented sculptors will also get their share of new info: Faraut is the real deal and he's been honing his sculpting and teaching skills for a long time. Every DVD brings something new. I love how in-depth they get. Highly recommended. I've been using them whenever new modelling projects come my way, and everytime I do, it's uncanny how much progress I make. I should take a week off and just sculpt while watching the series. Tonight, January 27th, 2012) I ordered the latest DVD, and am eager to get it. Someday I'll also get Faraut's books. They appear to be the kind of visual reference any artist interested in the human head would keep on hand at all times.
I'll cut to the chase for all the busy people: It's a great ressource, and I intend to get the other volumes as well. This DVD is a TREASURE for total beginners, yet will appeal to the intermediate and
This one goes deeper than the first, and builds on what has been learned before. Great for anyone looking to represent the beauty of the Feminine in all her forms.
The title is a bit misleading. It's about more than the male appearances, there's lots of structure and detailing information, including smoothing and adding clothing.
Fantastic approach, this DVD features the same clarity and efficiency shown throughout the series. A fantasy twist after the more academic lessons is very appreciated. The Bonus Feature called Meth-Amorphosis has been shown online before, but this longer version, on the big screen and in better quality, is well worth seeing.
The series is so inspiring that I felt moved to rush the order of a much needed new computer, to coincide with the upcoming stage of character design on the contract that occupies me these days. My old computer is moving to the studio, and we will use it to view the Faraut DVD while we design the puppet heads in clay. Accuracy, here we come! My colleague has never see the series, and I'm sure he'll appreciate it. Both of us had surprising results last Halloween when we carved actual Pumpkins while watching Ray Villafane's DVD tutorials, so with Faraut, there's no telling how far we'll go.
The series is self produced, and the quality rivals that of higher budget productions, such as The Gnomon Workshop's products (a few of which I also have to recommend). It's edited in a way to make it very fluid and easy to follow. In fact, time flies when watching it. I saw volume one twice the first night I got it.

solvent when smoothing, instead of water. Using heat is also an option. Professional oil-based clay is often much denser, therefore requires much more work to smooth out with tools, heat, and solvents, compared to water based, where all you need is a bit of water. I'm planning to give water based another try, in the coming weeks. I purchased a big bottle of very good hand cream, to prevent the dry bleeding hands I used to get with that kind of clay.
Worth mentioning is the high quality of Faraut's website. Very sleek, easy to navigate, very informative, and the online store is convenient.
They don't always keep the website updated, so they might have some items in stock that they don't show online. So just call them and ask.

Last Sunday, the AMAZING Shakira performed an awesome set at 95.8 Capital FM’s Jingle Bell Ball at The O2 in London. This Sunday, she officially releases the second single from her third album ‘She Wolf’. The infectious, ‘Did It Again’ has already reached number 26 on the UK singles chart thanks to her X-Factor performance a few weeks ago. The actual single release includes a turn from Kid Cudi as well as a host of remixes.
In the US, ‘She Wolf’ was released just a few weeks ago, with the deluxe edition featuring remixes and a pair of live tracks recorded (bizarrely) for UK TV show T4!? UK fan will no doubt have to wait for the inevitable cash-in, sorry, re-issue to get their hands on these as well as this… the brilliant, ‘Give It Up To Me’, a track only included on American editions. It’s produced by Timbaland and features a guest spot from Lil’ Wayne! Enjoy…
CocknBullKid (Anita Blay) has been making marvellously fantastic music for a number of years now under the guise thecocknbullkid… check out her delicious 2008 single ‘I’m Not Sorry’, which is still available digitally from iTunes.
Now, thankfully she has the backing of a major label and her debut single is available from this week in the shape of ‘One Eye Closed’, which is a frantic guitar riff led belter, with gorgeous drums and piano moments, ultimately framed and held together by CocknBullKid’s impressive soaring vocals. The video is a big giant romp as well…
The track itself, is the first to be released from her forthcoming album entitled ‘Adulthood’, which is due for release in February 2011. In the meantime, you can download the Jakwob remix of ‘One Eye Closed’ and some other free CocknBullKid tracks and remixes from RCRDLBL by clicking here.
It stars Ian Carmichael and Terry-Thomas vying for the attentions of Janette Scott. Infuriated by the smooth - yet underhanded - tactics Thomas uses, Carmichael enroles on a college course of 'Lifemanship'. Tutored by Alastair Sim and his staff, Carmichael quickly learns 'how to win without actually cheating' and goes head-to-head with his love rival.
I really did enjoy this film! Thomas is superb as the cad, and how can you fail to love anything with Alastair Sim in it? The focus of the film is on the comedic relationship between the male leads, so there's little female vintage fashion to ogle, but it's great to see the streets of London before traffic really overtook them. Watch out for cameos by Hattie Jacques and John Le Mesurier too!
I'm so so so sorry!!! I lost my dog several years ago, now have a cat too, my kids love her (me too) and I understand your feelings... :(
Anyway LO is great, I remember you have others, also beautiful with Vesla, you will always remebmer the good things!

There’s a ton of bands in the death metal world that pay their little homage to Death. Some would say there’s many that worship the band and what they did for the scene. But Gruesome exist in a space where they are actively taking the Death discography and essentially making new ‘versions’ that revere what the band did and work as a second disc. It’s a high bar to shoot for, but currently the band has had no problem in pulling off the first three records.
The recently released Twisted Prayers is Gruesome’s take on Spiritual Healing. An album that saw Death expand beyond the boundaries of their first releases and go into a more melodic/technical and outside the box zone. It’s all done with genuine intent, and because of it, is successful in carrying on the legacy of one of metal’s most beloved. We called up vocalist/guitarist Matt Harvey to talk with us about how the band does some prior research on the Death album in question, his thoughts on the retro movement, and much more.
Matt Harvey: As always, one nice thing about Gruesome is that we have a very clear goal – we are a Death tribute band. We have a blueprint to follow, but with each successive Death album, that template gets more complicated. We wanted to embrace that and rise to the challenge. Spiritual Healing, compared to Leprosy and Scream Bloody Gore, is much more melodic and it has more flashy, technical parts going on. That was really the challenge in terms of the writing. To embody that, and make it a convincing [album] and try to follow the leader as much as possible and do it justice.
Dead Rhetoric: So you have something you are shooting at with each album. Does that necessarily make things easier in some regards, or no?
Harvey: Yeah, it does. I’m a big believer in having a structured approach and I embrace limitations. Without limitations, it’s really easy to become unfocused. Out of all the projects I have been involved with, Gruesome has the most limitations and the most structure. We are trying to make new Death albums for people. But at the same time, just because we know where we are going, doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy to get there. I feel like it’s only going to get more challenging as we continue on as a band, because the material that we are going to be paying homage to gets more and more challenging. It will be interesting.
Dead Rhetoric: I can’t think of a better term, but how much research is there in getting the details for the album, in this case, Spiritual Healing?
Harvey: I think research is a really accurate term, because writing the riffs is one thing but that’s only really part of the whole picture. One thing our producer, Jarrett Pritchard, did was had a long phone conversation with Scott Burns about how Spiritual Healing was done: what kind of mics, pre-amps, equipment, and amplifiers were used. I’m sure a lot of the technical details are well above my paygrade. To me, you can really hear the fruits of that research in the record. Regardless of whether the material and the performance is good, sonically, this album is really as similar to Spiritual Healing as you could possibly get. That’s what we wanted. We wanted it to sound like disc 2 of a Spiritual Healing double set or what have you. So there is a lot of research.
Similarly, for the lyrics I spoke to Terry Butler when we were out with Obituary. I had the chance to corner him and punish him a little bit. It’s not the first time I’ve punished him; he’s a very patient man [laughs] putting up with all of my dumb Death questions. But I was talking about what the band was listening to, what they were talking about amongst themselves as far as the lyrics and where the inspiration comes from. I’m sure it’s pretty obvious on Scream Bloody Gore – “Evil Dead” is about Evil Dead, “Regurgitated Guts” is about Gates to Hell…Leprosy is still pretty specific, but Spiritual Healing branches out into a wider realm. I talked to Terry about what my thoughts might have been about what influenced them. He really helped me and gave me some good direction. So there’s definitely an academic element to what we are doing. It’s fun, and we are passionate about what we are doing. But because we are trying to recreate something, you have to understand what it is in order to reverse engineer it.
Dead Rhetoric: Right, which is something that fans are obviously looking at. There’s a ton of bands out there influenced by Death. But when it comes to Gruesome, a more unique aspect. I think the time that you are putting in with those pieces you just mentioned is what is allowing you to push a bit farther and gain some recognition.
Harvey: Because we are a tribute band, we are fans of Death or we wouldn’t be doing this. But just because we know that we are unoriginal doesn’t mean that we aren’t putting our best work forward. I feel like if we didn’t, not only would that be lame in terms of standards for myself: I don’t want to do something half-assed; I’m not into that. But it would be really shitty, because here we are trying to honor someone’s legacy and in our small way contributing to perfecting it – if we half-ass it, it becomes a cash in, or disrespectful. That’s the last thing we want to do or want to be perceived as. It’s always been coming from a place of respect and admiration for Chuck and all the guys in the band, and what they’ve done. It means we have to take it seriously, we have to take it as professionally as possible, and we have to really dig as deep as we can into everything surrounding the albums. That’s the only way that I feel like the project is credible in my eyes, as a Death band.
Harvey: It’s not like a situation with Metallica and Diamond Head, where 95% of Metallica fans don’t know anything about Diamond Head. They can just interpret it how they want. With us, all of our fans know who Death is. They are all our fans because they are Death fans. They are going to see right through our bullshit if we produce bullshit, and I appreciate that.
Dead Rhetoric: In continuing to cover Death albums with each new Gruesome – any Death record that you are particularly stoked to get to down the line?
Harvey: I’m really excited about moving forward. People that are familiar with the other stuff that I have done with Exhumed…people who listen to Exhumed probably presume that I’m pretty into Scream Bloody Gore, Leprosy, and Spiritual Healing. That doesn’t seem like too much of a stretch. It’s a little bit more of a personal challenge to start writing and performing stuff that’s in the style of Human, Individual Thought Patterns, and Symbolic because it is more technical and more melodic. It’s more progressive, and it’s something that in my other bands/projects I haven’t done a lot of. To me, it’s like a new territory and it’s slightly intimidating, but it’s slightly invigorating. I’m looking forward to proving to myself that I can pull it off.
Dead Rhetoric: You mentioned the lyrics already but to go further, can you talk about the shift towards more socio-political lyrics instead of the gore-based ones for this album.
Harvey: When I was talking to Terry about what influenced them, I had this idea that there was this old Time-Life book series called Mysteries of the Unknown that talks about various occult things, conspiracies, and unexplained phenomena. It was advertised on TV a lot around the time that Spiritual Healing was released, so I was thinking maybe they were into that “in search of” vibe, or whatever. Terry told me I was making it way too complicated – they were just watching the 6 o’clock news. As soon as he said that, I was like, “Ding!”
I just started to look around at various things and found that there’s still a lot of the same kind of problems and terrible things going on that really aren’t so different from when Spiritual Healing came out. There’s a song called “Killing Spree” on Spiritual Healing, which is about mass shootings, which are a bigger problem now than they were then. So we did a song called “Fatal Illusions” about that. We did a song about the death penalty, “Inhumane,” which seemed like unnatural for a death metal band [laughs]. Obviously, in my opinion, religion is an even bigger problem in this country than ever, with the Evangelical Right infesting the political discourse. “Twisted Prayers” was pretty obvious, because they are talking about all these things like compassion and mercy all the while making the world more merciless, less compassionate, and more dangerous.
As soon as he said the 6 o’clock news, I got a ton of lyrics written in a few weeks and the album was good to go. It’s interesting finding things that are still morbid and very dark, but they ring a little more true on a wider scale than the stuff we talked about before. That said, we still do have a song about a horror movie – “Fate” is about The Dead Zone. The song, “Lethal Legacy” is kind of about a parasitic twin…so there’s still some traditional death metal stuff on there, but most of the songs are a bit more topical.
Dead Rhetoric: You mentioned “Fatal Illusions,” which you put out a video and it has a warning at the front of it. What was your aim with the visual aspect of the track?
Harvey: When I originally wrote the lyrics, I was thinking about the guy who went into a pizza parlor in North Carolina because he thought that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex slavery thing out of the pizza parlor. He went in there with a gun, intending to shoot people up, and luckily he ended up not doing that. I was just thinking about someone who is so convinced about whatever bullshit it is they believe, that they are willing to go out and kill for it.
It’s not like there hasn’t been school shootings, but recently it seems like there are more and more – I read a statistic somewhere that more kids have been shot in school than armed forces this year, which is pretty shocking. It tied in really nicely with that. That’s something that Relapse put together for us, and it’s not an anti-gun song – it’s an anti-mass shooting song. I’m not an anti-gun person per say, but I’m definitely an anti-mass shooting person…I think pretty much everyone is. Obviously whatever it is that we have been doing isn’t working. It’s something that people need to think about and talk about, not only in the metal scene but hopefully people in power, etc.
Dead Rhetoric: I totally hear you on that. I teach myself, and I’m floored by it. Even at my middle school level there are kids that are genuinely concerned about it and wondering why nothing is changing.
Harvey: I don’t blame the kids for being concerned about it. I haven’t been in school for a long time, about 25 years since I graduated high school. If I had kids, I wouldn’t want them to go to a school that looks like a prison with metal detectors and armed guards. That just seems like insanity to me. Without getting too crazy or whatever, I just think that we need to treat guns like cars. You have to take a course and pass a safety test, and get them registered. If you sell them there has to be a record of that. If you have mental health issues or a felon or etc, you can’t buy guns.
I don’t get into the whole ‘ban this gun or that gun’ stuff because then you are getting into what constitutes an assault rifle or whatever. That’s counterproductive. I think most firearm owners would be open to the kind of stuff I’m mentioning. It’s not about taking guns away from people that haven’t broken any laws, it’s about getting a handle on what’s out there and making sure that people who shouldn’t have guns don’t get them. It’ll never be a perfect system – it’s not like the people who are shooting up schools are felons. They aren’t knocking over convenient stores. They are emotionally traumatized people who don’t have the coping capability to work out whatever their issues are, and turn to violence. I would just say to buy a fucking guitar and start a band. It’s a lot better.
Dead Rhetoric: Being in a band that’s covering Death albums from long ago, what do you think the appeal is in retro acts?
Harvey: I feel like metal, at this point, if you count the first Black Sabbath album as the first metal album for argument’s sake…it means metal is about 49 years old at this point. It’s a pretty safe bet that over the last 49 years, everything that can or could have been done has been covered. That includes all the cross pollination from rap metal to folk metal to funk metal to classical and metal. There’s metal bands that have accordions I guess. Everything’s pretty much been done at this point. Frankly, I’m amazed that the genre is alive and is as viable as it is. I’m not sure if it speaks to the quality of the music, or lack of imagination of the music producing and buying population, or some combination of both.
I think that at this point, if you are into metal, the weight of the genre’s history is so immense that you are going to be pulled towards the things that defined it for 50 years. You are going to be pulled towards Master of Puppets, Leprosy, Black Metal, Screaming for Vengeance, The Number of the Beast, Savatage, Angel Witch…there’s a million different classic records I could name, and I think because of the Internet, nothing is inaccessible and nothing goes out of print. Not to sound like an old dude, but when I was a kid, if an album was out of print or on a small label with no distribution…I have been buying records since I was 11 pretty constantly. But as an 11 year old, I wasn’t tape trading. If I went to the store and they didn’t have it, I didn’t get it. So now, everything exists. Present and past are in the same space. There’s a natural pull to consume older stuff because it’s there and it informs all of the newer stuff. Because of the culture of metal and the Internet, it’s going to lead a lot of people to the older stuff, or bands that sound like the older stuff.
There’s also the 25 year nostalgia thing. In the ‘70s, Happy Days was a show about the ‘50s. In the ‘80s, The Wonder Years was a hit show about the ‘60s. In the ‘90s, there was That ‘70s Show, they just stopped getting creative with the names. It’s only natural that people are looking back. Maybe 10 years ago, Municipal Waste and Toxic Holocaust were hot, upcoming bands because they sounded like DRI and early Kreator. I think both bands are great, it’s no knock on them, but they were backwards looking bands. I don’t think it’s really anything particularly new. If you look in the ‘90s at records by Sleep or The Melvins, or even some of the Danzig stuff, it’s very backwards looking to the ‘70s. I think that nostalgia is part of human nature.
It’s always easy to think that something before, that you weren’t a part of, was better because your imagination can fill in the gaps. Right now, we are seeing a resurgence in all things ‘90s. I would go to the bar and hear Soft Cell, Duran Duran, and Journey – all that ‘80s stuff. Now I go to the bar and hear mostly ‘90s music – a lot of grunge and stuff. I hate the ‘90s so I don’t know what it is. I just go, “Oh, I remember that song. I hated it then and I still hate it.” But it is a pop culture cycle that things go through.
Harvey: Exhumed has 4 shows coming up in July. We are going to Puerto Rico and Florida. I’m actually doing a couple shows with Exhumed and Gruesome, so if I die, that’s why [laughs]. Then Gruesome has a European tour after that. Exhumed is going to Europe for a couple weeks just to do some festivals and hit some places when we were in the UK, Scandinavia, Spain, and places like that. Exhumed will also have a US tour later this year that will be announced soon, which is fairly exciting. There’s lots of stuff in the works, and I’m always busy with some shit [laughs]. But that’s the way I like it. I like to keep working.
Harvey: There’s nothing being talked about right now, but in this stage of our trajectory…I hate the term career, it sounds pretentious. But we are at the point where we are able to do a full US tour, because we can ask for what we need to do it right, so we aren’t losing money/jobs/spouses/minds or any of that stuff. We are fortunate to have seen the band grow pretty quickly. We have every intention of doing a full US tour, but I just don’t have anything concrete now. I do think that it’s the next step and it’s something we will solidify fairly soon.
Never fear, metalheads – I haven’t abandoned the deep search for buried treasures of metal from the past. Life, family, work, and other obligations can often take me away from these endeavors, but I feel the time is ripe to return to 1994, a year notable in the metal world especially in America, as most record labels were dropping bands like flies and calling this style anything but what it was. Grunge, alternative, and the start of nu-metal would take shape; melodic lead breaks within songs were starting to phase themselves out, and Headbangers Ball on MTV was on its last legs.
Through the good fortune of a Midwest touring jaunt as a tour manager for a New England band, that summer I would take in the Milwaukee Metal fest, seeing Slayer headline a few months prior to their release of Divine Intervention, witness the impressive stage shows of Morbid Angel and Overkill and understand the grim reality of multi-stage, 100 bands + in two day festival action warts and all. So even though the tides were changing, a lot of bands stuck to their guns and released some worthy albums that may have been lost in the flannel and smoke haze. Here are some records that I think deserve a more intense listen and appreciation from that year:
A lot of people look at the Tony Martin-led era as the black sheep of Sabbath discography, but I feel there are many hidden jewels to unearth if you can come across these records. Cross Purposes has a lot of the early classic Dio feel, yet the subtle swing/rock groove from Bobby Rondinelli that made the mystical “Cross of Thorns” and deeply bluesy doom-meets-power crusher “Immaculate Deception” stand up well in their tremendous catalog of songs.
The sixth studio album would be the first for Dio with guitarist Tracy G, and I think his slightly modern approach worked well for the dragon master to bridge the gap between his conventional fantasy/ rainbow themes and gain new appeal through an angry youth culture. “Jesus, Mary and The Holy Ghost,” the gloomy title track, and “Blood from a Stone” are just three premiere tracks from this severely unheralded release.
Dan Swanö and his Swedish progressive death metal troop Edge of Sanity continued to throw curveballs on this fourth studio platter Purgatory Afterglow. Be it the punk-ified “Black Tears,” the doomy meets 70’s epic rock riff groove for “Blood-Colored,” or haunting 7:51 progressive opener “Twilight” that shimmers from clean keyboards against clean vocals, then picks up into this energetic, low death riff that kicks your teeth in – it’s classic EOS 101 here. [Damn right this is a classic – ed.]
Most of your folk metal groups that have gained traction owe a debt of gratitude for the Skyclad discography. The marriage of witty lyrics full of smart personal/political insights and musically moving through electric guitars, bass, drums, and fiddle, Martin Walkyier survived the Sabbat break up just fine, thank you, because songs like “Civil War Dance” and fiddle/ guitar jig worthy “Sins of Emission” were not like anything else coming down the metal pike in the mid 1990’s.
Coming off of the commercial (and musically) disappointing The Ritual, guitarist Alex Skolnick would jump ship for Savatage as drummer Louie Clemente simply couldn’t sustain the rigors of playing thrash. Given a new lease of life in guitarist James Murphy (Death, Obituary), plus a more proficient drummer in John Tempesta, the Bay Area veterans set about dialing in a heavier record for Low, record company be damned. Who can deny the brilliance of “Hail Mary”, the ripping title cut, or attacking riff mastery “Dog Faced Gods” where Chuck Billy first unleashed the lower growls that give Testament a fierce edge.

Looking for a quick snack for the kids? Want to make a dressing with a difference to have with salad or over baked salmon? Look no further – tahini is the answer!
For an instant Middle Eastern vibe, grab some hummus from our chiller section and dip your favourite veggies for a super-quick healthy snack, or enjoy with falafels, Turkish bread, yoghurt and a bit of chilli sauce. Grab some of our tahini, and follow the simple steps below:
Tahini is ground up sesame seeds, nothing more, nothing less! It’s naturally gluten and dairy free, and is famous for lending taste to hummus. The tahini you buy should contain nothing apart from sesame seeds.
Sesame seeds are rich in protein (helping to create a feeling of fullness), dietary fibre, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, B vitamins and manganese. Not bad for a little guy! Unhulled tahini contains more nutrients, as the sesame seeds have the outer shell intact, but it can also have a slightly bitter taste – up to your tastebuds which one you use.
Tahini is a staple in many cuisines - Middle Eastern, African, Mediterranean, Greek and Turkish, for example. Used in dips, dressings and sauces, it also good on a rice cake with sliced tomatoes and ground pepper.

“Fairy Tale Christmas” is, perhaps, one of the most creative productions to ever grace a Southern Utah stage.

It’s even more impressive because Tuacahn’s current production of “Fairy Tale Christmas” is a world premiere. This is the first…
The weather has been a factor across most of the UK this week, floods have destroyed homes and along with strong winds have taken lives. The temperature has dropped in to single figures on a regular basis. This has meant that the consumption of food at my FS has risen above expectations. I have already used 100 fatballs, 12.75kgs of seed and over 5kgs of peanuts. I am concerned that at this rate it will be an expensive project.
However I have stopped hanging single fatballs from branches as the squirrels had most of them away. I have stopped the squirrel having all the peanuts away by buying a better peanut holder and I have bought another seed holder so that I don't have to put so much loose down.
All that said, I am very pleased with the increase in the numbers of birds that are visiting. I have also had a fleeting visit from the most beautiful male Bullfinch and if he starts coming regularly then it will all be worth it.
I have left my hide in situ, I hope its not a mistake because the price of them has risen so drastically over the last 12 months or so that I couldn't afford to buy another just like that.
Anyway, a beautiful afternoon thursday allowed me to spend a good 3 hrs in the hide, that was after I had driven around large parts of the chester surrounds looking for Waxwing. I failed miserably though.
I think that the cormorant would be much better thought of it they were white. No I'm not being racist, I merely mean that they are the bird world equivalent of Darth Vader, you see them sitting there knowing that at some point a fish is going to get it, If they were white they would be looked at in the same way as the Egrets.
So no Waxwing and as yet nothing truly sexy at the FS. come back next week and see if its changed. Oh and I am hoping that Santa is going to bring me a new camera for christmas, I think I'd like the 5D mk 3 or the 6D.
A couple months back I started a simple iOS project that would display flash cards for Luther’s Small Catechism. It seemed like a good opportunity to really focus on learning Swift and do a project that would be edifying for the church. What bothered me was that the app would be iOS only. The Triglotta app is iOS only and I do get requests for an Android version but I don’t have any interest in working in Java for a side project since I get plenty of exposure to it at work. At the same time I’ve been studying Node.js and the frameworks built on top of it like Angular 2 and Ember.js. This got me thinking about building a flash card web service. I could then build a web front end using a JavaScript framework and I could also build an iOS native app as well. I could also expose the API someone else could build an Android native client if they wanted to.
Once again I’m starting off in a new direction. My current thinking is to build the web service using Node.js and Ember.js with a MySQL database. I would use Angular 2 to develop the web front end and eventually build an iOS native client in Swift. I’m going to commit to using BDD to develop the whole thing. I’m going to work on it every day in some way, and I’m going to blog about it in some way every day. Vacations might be an exception, but I’m going make every effort to make some progress and blog about it even then.

There was a time when the terms " group building event" sufficed to strike horror right into the soul of any kind of office worker. Pictures of forced amusement as reluctant workers attempted to sing like Madonna or funnel their inner survival (Bear Grylls) on a Challenging Mudders style assault course or even worse signified the "previous strategies" reasons came quickly, and an unexpected epidemic of troubling family members was just about assured.
Times have actually altered, and employers have actually got wise to 2 things. The first is that in today's firm world, team characteristics are a lot more important compared to ever before and could indicate the difference in between success as well as failing. The various other is that making those teams combine still takes effort, they have to produce team structure events that will excitedly be anticipated which individuals will obtain something from, rather compared to things they will certainly dislike and also avoid like the plague.
Escape Rooms are quickly becoming the present fad for business and also company group building, leaving behind the old made events like 5 apart football, rounders' as well as evasion things like big structure blocks. Perfect for concentrating on great deals of business advancement objectives, Escape Room group building could offer a variety of team structure benefits for services/ organisations of all dimensions and shapes
Currently a well created marketplace, with fixed Escape Rooms showing up throughout the country, the Escape Room group building experience is becoming ever a lot more readily available and appealing to wise organisations that count on group in one kind or another. Call them leave games, escape games, escape rooms, locked room games puzzle spaces, or something else, however the property continues to be the very same, you gathering with a group of your buddies, resolve the hints as well as leave the space within the time restriction.
This is why we have seen a rise in new sort of group structure jobs showing up. Definitely, there are some people who like absolutely nothing much better than to execute or to test themselves mentally or physically. For others, food prep work difficulties, sporting events or simply a night-time out for a few beverages jointly will function far better.
The trick to a effective group building day is to actively obtain the guests engaged with the selection of the occasion, in contrast to compel it on them. An escape room is among one of the most recent trends in group building occasions. It is one that has a expanding appeal amongst organisers, and extra importantly, among individuals.
Any individual who delighted in appreciating TELEVISION shows like The Crystal Maze or Ft Boyard will instantaneously recognise the approach of an escape room. The suggestion was expanded from TV amusement to a item anyone can attempt with the very first escape room opening in Japan 11 years earlier back in 2007. The concept soon broadened all over the world, and also firms like Handmade Mysteries are market leaders that provide London escape rooms together with escape rooms in additional towns and cities across the UK.
Each escape room has its own certain theme. You may find on your own in a advanced globe, or a jungle atmosphere or in a Blade Runner inspired mad production. You as well as your team after that have an hr to analyze your surroundings, make sense of the hints and work out exactly what you have to do to obtain out.
Some of the considerable benefits of an escape room over various other kind of group building activity is that it has huge allure. Age and also physical conditioning are useless, and the even more shy employee will certainly feel similarly as comfy as individuals who are extra exhibitionist as well as gregarious. Fans and also leaders will all benefit from exactly how the team engages and also functions with each other and this is all done within the natural spirit of enjoyable!
Some will certainly be far better physically and after that those who are a whole lot much better at psychological dexterity will reach bend their mental muscular tissues-- there is an possibility for every single individual to reveal off his/her particular capability, and to construct new ones.
Most important of all, however, is that this kind of occasion is one where success depends upon all those abilities being united, to create a whole that is more compared to the sum of its components. Which is, nevertheless, real principle of a cohesive and also efficient team.
It depends how you desire to run it, with smaller groups, one escape room could accommodate approximately 6 staff member. London places can additionally run games together with each other so you could have teams completing versus each other in time tests. Just speak with the pleasant team, provide a get in touch with 0207 8673736 or simply use their very easy reservation forms to publication rooms one by one.
Let them understand what you need and also they will make certain the Gamesmaster creates an environment of healthy competition for your organisation!
The various other significant facet that escape rooms have in their favour is that this is one affair that the unpredictable English weather can not ruin. A firm picnic could usually feel like Russian roulette! An Escape room could be essentially considered at any moment of year-- possibly an escape room could be an resourceful alternative to the common workplace event when the Christmas season happens this year. Now is the suitable time to obtain buy https://www.handmademysteries.com in from workers.

This happens from time to time on my MacBook Pro and Firefox. Interestingly, when this happens I switch to Safari and Safari works fine.
What happens is that when accessing the Gmail, the screen shows "Loading...." and briefly flash the part of the page then goes back to "Loading..." again and this continues ad infinitum.
I don't know the exact cause of this. Apparently there is some issue with a corrupted cookie that may be causing this issue. One thing the corruption could occur is that I am using the Mac Mail via IMAP to download messages at home. Because Mac Mail allows sorting by the sender, I can weed out old news and newsletters quicker. I know, I know I have not completely subscribed to the Gmail paradigm (but it is a free country too!).
Anyhow, I think when I do these deletions on Mac Mail, things may go out of sync and that's when the problem seems to start.
You can try different URLs to access Gmail and this has fixed my situation. In my case if I just use https:// this will usually fix the problem, but then I will need to use https://
If you really need to fix this, you will have to remove Gmail related cookies. I don't know which is what so I usually remove all Google issued cookies. That will also fix it completely.

You have installed the CISCO ASA in your organization, configured the NAT so that all of your own computers are protected behind the NAT and Firewall but now some users want to use a VPN to connect to some network outside. For example, a visiting or partner employee may want to connect back to their corporate office via an IPSEC VPN.
The CISCO support web site has a very comprehensive information on this. The URL to the support article is this.
This article also shows you how to configure this situation using the ASDM User Interface. But I know you don't want to read that so in summary here is what you would do:
Add and/or Activate esp protocol in IP from the outside to the inside interface, Source is outside and destination is inside.
We've implemented this in April 08, it is June now and has been working very well in our environment. We've tried the "regular" CISCO VPN client connecting to the outside as well as CheckPoint ScruRemote VPN clients with it.
You have set up an IIS server on the Internet on Microsoft Windows 2003 R2 server. Everything appears to be going normally. You can FTP to "yourself" from within the same server, so you know FTP is working. Now you find out that people cannot see the directory when they connect to the FTP server. They can log in and connect but connection breaks as soon as the user tries to get a directory listing or try to send a file.
Your IIS Server, by default, does not support Passive FTP, and whoever trying to access your FTP server is opening the FTP server behind their own firewall and Network Address Translation (NAT). That's 99% of the case from Cable Modem and DSL users.

I am hereby putting this in writing, so that I can say in a few years to people "I told you so!" sort of things. I have been saying this for the past 2 years or so and each time I said this to my other geek colleagues, they almost always laugh.
When I was a kid in Japan and when I visited my grandfather's place. There was this telephone without any dial at all. To make a phone call he would pick up the receiver, then there is a crank on the right of the phone which he turns a few times. An operator answers. He will tell the operator, to "Give me Maeda-san." and the operator knows who this is, where this person is, and connects. Even more, if this Maeda-san was not at home, the operator will try again and when he is back at home, connected, the operator will call back my grandfather and connects.
Sounds awfully antiquated, classic or whatever you would say because what you would do today is to go to your computer, start Outlook, type in Maeda, and find the name of the person, then find one of the phone numbers, call the guy, he isn't there, leave a message etc. And we call that high tech modern age stuff.
What, however will happen next is actually we will all go back to what my grandfather had in the first place. Except that it is wireless of course.
Most of us will have cell phones with basically nothing but a green and red button. It will fit almost in any pocket.
You command it with voice only and the computer intelligence behind it will do all of the reset of the work. It is connected with a complex search engine with a voice recognition software both on the phone and also on the remote phone switch too.
- The location service on the phone would know if I am at home or office. If I have ordered a pizza before both from my office or home at different outfits, it will basically know which pizza place I am talking about. It will perhaps ask me "Call Harbor Pizza?" if I am calling from my home in Half Moon Bay, or "Call Brick Oven Pizza?" If I am in the office. Of course, I can be in totally different city in that case the search engine linking would suggest other places near by.
- Of course it is 7 PM and line is all busy but no problem, like a human operator would do, it would try calling on your behalf and then connects you up when the line is open.
- Let's say that I was in the different city and ordered a pizza. I would want to go and pick up the pizza. I would say to the phone. "Gide me to the pizza place." Of course the historical information would know that which pizza place it was, and with the GPS phone and voice navigation, there is no problem phone doing the navigation. The user still has not touched any dial at all!
I think we will all be having a phone that do this. And you know your search engine provider is scanning all your emails and everything you store in remotely hosted applications. It can have a lot of context as to what you are asking about.
Sure enough, bits and pieces of the technology is already out there. I use VoiceCommand on my Pocket PC all the time, and I speak to the robot at United Airlines too. I think that the integration of these stuff will make a phone with dials obsolete in a few years.
On April 2014, I left a successful startup and an embarking on another medical IT venture.

I used this dress cookie cutter from Copper Gifts. It's easy to make modifications to the dress shape with this particular cutter. Before I baked the dough, I trimmed off the rounded sides for Elsa and Mulan. I did the same for Tinker Bell, but I also trimmed a little off the bottom to give her dress the shape that I wanted.
Labels: Ariel, Belle, Character Cookies, Cinderella, Dresses, Elsa, Mulan, Rupunzel, Snow White, Tinker Bell
Princess Peach, of course, does not have a readily available cookie cutter as far as I could tell. I drew and cut out my own template for her and used a paring knife to cut her shape from the dough. I found the cookie cutters for Mario and Luigi here at www.cheapcookiecutters.com. I did not have a cookie cutter for the mushrooms either, but I used a large circle cutter. Once these were cut, I trimmed and shaped the bottom of the circles to make area of the stems/faces.
I outlined the characters with the help of my projector. I filled in the spaces with the appropriate colored royal icing, waited for it to dry, and then added the details with royal icing and my food dye markers.

The pearl sprinkles are Wilton Sugar Pearls. I piped on the colored icing and then placed each individual pearl with my tweezers to get them in the right position.
My projector came in handy when making these cookies. I cut out my own rectangular shapes from the cookie dough because I did not have a rectangular cookie cutter that was quite wide enough for bot. I used a flip flop cookie cutter for the other two.
I flooded the cookies with white royal icing and let them dry completely (overnight). The I outlined the character shapes in black with a PME tip # 1.5 using the projector images as a guide. Next, I flooded the sections with the appropriate colors. I added some remaining details in black. The only details I left until the next morning were the mouths and eyes. I waiting until the characters were completely dry to draw these with a black food dye marker. I used the FooDoodler brand of markers because I appreciate their fine tip for adding these smaller details. For the last step, I added a small spot of white royal icing onto the eyes.
The thin areas that I filled with colored icing became a cratering nightmare. These formed while the icing dried. I've made cookies similar to these (the Dr. Seuss cookies) so I had expected this. I pulled my scribe needle through the narrower sections in an attempt to prevent the craters from forming, but it wasn't 100% effective. I filled in most of the craters with icing after they formed with the same colored icing. It wasn't a perfect solution but it helped improve their appearance.

What happens to us after death is perhaps the greatest mystery of life. One belief is that we reincarnate – that there is life, after life. Despite this widespread belief, renowned spiritual author and scholar Tom Harpur remained skeptical of reincarnation – until now. What has lead Harpur to consider reincarnation as a real possibility? It may be surprising, but the best evidence does not come from the world of religion or spiritual studies, but from the world of science. From cases of children who can recall living past lives to the science of biometrics to the realm of quantum physics and global consciousness, we examine the evidence for reincarnation. Could a young boy with vivid, accurate memories of WWII be the reincarnation of a pilot who was shot down during the war? Is it possible that Anne Frank is alive today, reincarnated as a senior member of the Swedish National Police? Claus von Stauffenberg was executed for his attempt to assassinate Hitler, but did his life end there?

Monday June 4, 2009--Peggy Lynn "Pumpkin" O'Neal, walks out of the Eagleton Federal Courthouse after being arraigned on federal charges for allegedly smuggling heroin into the St. Louis Justice Center downtown. O'Neal and two other corrections officers were arrested after the indictment was unsealed this morning. According to prosecutors on four occasions from January through early March, the guards got heroin and cash from someone outside the jail and brought it to an inmate inside St. Louis Justice Center downtown.
Credit Card Verifier - Credit Card Verifier allows you instantly check all major credit cards number for validity without submitting the card number online. Credit Card Verifier can validate any VISA, MasterCard, Diners Club, Carte Blanche, EnRoute, American Express (AMEX), Discover, or JCB credit card number. Credit Card validator uses LUHN10 (MOD-10) algorithm, so it only validates the integrity of the number combination, not the credit card itself.
Credit Card Verifier only verifies whether or not a credit card checksum is valid; it does not validate the credit card account. In order to verify a credit card account, you will need software that can access credit card networks, and, typically, submit authorization request on the card account. If you need to charge credit cards and validate credit card accounts, please look into a merchant provider such as Authorize.net
We are going to be taking credit cards over the phone in the near future. I was looking to see if there's a way to verify a CC without actually running it.You appear to have a hadle on the issues, I'll likely be back at some point in the future.
The verifier is limited to 16 digit's which is fine for most bank cards: visa, mc, amex and disc. However, there are a slew of gift cards, prepaid cards, private labels and fleet cards that have account numbers longer than 16 digits. It would be nice if the longer lengths could be supported also.
Yea! It's better but I mostly need a software that will process, 1, owner of the card and cvv and expering date.
I am a chartered accountant in india and in a recently attended seminar Luhn's algorithm was discussed and i was searching on google to get behind the Luhn's Algorithm fundamentals and your webpage was listed so to try out this programme for testing I downloaded. My suggestion is that the result window showing "Valid or Invalid visa/master/etc Card" whould be more prominent by using larger fonts so that it looks more attractive to actual users.
what can credit repair do for you | building credit | credit card repair | top 5 credit repair companies
This is a great company to work with. Friendly staff and very helpful. I provided them with my filled out form, and they were able to analyze my credit score. They provided sound advice and I was able to raise my score with a few tweaks. Gave their # to a couple of friends that I have heard had great success as well. Talk to the experts at Quick and Easy! They will help make you look good.
Creditsweeps are done by companies or individuals who want hundreds to thousands of dollars upfront directly deposited in their bank account. (which is 100% illegal and against the credit services organizations act) Once they get you to pay they have you give them a power of attorney. they then use that power of attorney to file a FAKE police report saying your identity was stolen. In a very few cases this will work “permanently”. These are cases where its hard to determine there was a legitimate account. (ie. identity thieves don’t make payments on your accounts for months or years and then stop paying. Real identity theft involves someone getting a credit card, maxing it out and NEVER making a payment. If you have ever made a payment on your credit cards the creditsweep won’t work. What you are likely to see is 1 credit bureau remove all the items and then over a 4-5 month time period all the items come back one by one. (the other bureaus are notified but put off removing items until after the 1st bureau reviews it.
Check what your monthly payment on a debt consolidation loan would be. Are you at least paying that much towards your credit cards now? If the loan payment is more than you pay towards your debts (and it fits into your budget), it might be time to up the ante and just put more money to your credit cards. If the loan payment is less than you pay to your cards, you'll likely wind up paying way more interest over time, since your loan term will probably be long.
Rapid rescoring is a little-known strategy explained by credit guru Liz Pulliam Weston in her book, "Your Credit Score: Your Money and What's at Stake." Unlike credit repair services, which are almost always a scam, rapid rescoring is a legitimate way to improve your credit score in as little as a few hours – if there are verifiable inaccuracies on your credit report. For rapid rescoring to work, you must have proof that negative items on your credit report are incorrect.
Taking out a loan to pay off debt is counter-intuitive, right? Especially when taking on a new loan requires hefty fees, rolled into your total balance, or a long repayment period. The InCharge Debt Consolidation Alternative, or debt management plan, is a program that gives you all of the benefits of debt consolidation without having to take out a new loan. With the debt management program, all of your payments are consolidated into one monthly payment that you pay to InCharge. InCharge then pays each of your creditors. InCharge helps you secure lower interest rates on many of the credit cards you do have (with exceptions), meaning that more of your monthly payment will go to pay off the balance, and less to interest. This will help you pay off your debt faster. The InCharge debt management plan is designed to help you get out of debt in 3-5 years, paying less than you would if you continued on your own, or even with traditional debt consolidation with higher interest rates.
Having bad credit can tempt you to use your child’s credit. You might think you’d never do that but you never know what you’ll do when you’re desperate. Say you have to have electricity turned on, but your credit’s too bad. You could easily rationalize using your child’s credit to have the electricity turned on. Keep your own good credit and you won’t think about exploiting your child’s.
Take out a secured credit card from a credit union. With Most banks you will need 300-500 to start. After you receive your card charge $15-$20 at the most. When you get the bill in, pay it by or before the due. DO NOT PAY LATE!! Do this a few times and your credit should jump about 20-30 points. When your credit goes up to where you want, you can take out the money from your secure credit card. DO NOT CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR CREDIT. (SHRED THE CARD INSTEAD) Hope this helps. God Bless
Personal loans charge simple interest (as opposed to credit cards, which often have variable rates and sometimes have different rates for a credit card balance transfer and purchases on the same card) and they typically have a loan repayment term of three to five years. By consolidating your credit card debt into a personal loan, you’ll have a definite plan for paying off your old card debt.
Lenders will look at your income and current debts, such as credit cards, current mortgage, and student loans, to determine whether you’re able to take out a home equity loan. Lenders want to ensure you can pay back your debt so if you already have a substantial amount, you may not be an ideal candidate. Burkley said borrowers should have around a 40% to 45% debt-to-income ratio to qualify for a home equity loan.
A secured credit card, in particular, is the ideal tool for rebuilding credit. They offer nearly guaranteed approval because you’ll need to place a security deposit that will double as your spending limit. Secured cards are also far less expensive than unsecured credit cards for people with bad credit. And you can’t tell them apart from unsecured cards on a credit report.
Just wanted to say our loan experience with you has been fantastic! The process was by far the easiest and close to the quickest loan process I have ever gone through. We had very good credit before but now it’s "exceptional" according to FICO and I think the changes we made by consolidating debt using LightStream made all the difference. I rarely write things like this but really have been amazed and thrilled with your company. It actually feels unbelievable; not sure how you all did it but somehow you designed an incredible experience and I look forward to borrowing from you again.
If you have medical debt, you may be wondering what options are available to you. Medical debt can be consolidated into a nonprofit debt management program, though you may not receive lower interest rates. Considering that much medical debt is already at a low or zero interest rate, this should not be a deterrent. By consolidating medical debt to a debt management program, you are simplifying your bill pay and committing to timely, consistent payments of your medical debt. This will help you pay off your debt faster and also may have a positive impact on your credit score.
After getting approved for refinancing, the new loan may be reported to the credit bureaus, which could lower your average age of accounts. Your other loans will be paid off, but they could stay on your credit reports for up to 10 more years. Your overall installment-loan debt will stay the same, and as long as you continue to make on-time payments, your score may improve over time.
It may not make sense but that is the way it’s factored into your credit score, which is the end result here. Cutting up the card to avoid using it may help if it’s a temptation. The scores are comprised of debt to income ratio, but also credit worthiness and longevity, among many other things. If you have $100k in open to buy credit, and only $5k in debt, that helps your score. Also, it shows that lenders have extended this amount of credit to you. i.e. Creditworthiness. Additionally, your score factors in length of credit. They want to see how long you’ve kept that credit, expecting a good relationship with the lender and you’ve shown responsibility. Old schoolers used to close the accts and be done with it. This is the new way of the credit score. It is an education in itself.
To qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you must have little disposable income. A means test is applied that compares your income to the median income in your state. If your average monthly income for the six-month period leading up to your bankruptcy filing is less than the median income for the same household size in your state, you automatically qualify.
However, if you must have more plastic, applying for a secured credit card can be a safe way to go about improving your credit score. These are lines of credit that are secured with a deposit made by you, the cardholder. Usually, the deposit also acts as the credit limit on the secured card. While they come with high fees, high interest rates and low limits, these cards report your repayment history to the major credit bureaus each month, so as you make on-time payments, your credit score will improve – to the extent you won’t need the secured card anymore (they aren't the most advantageous out there), or the card issuer will let you convert to a regular card (usually after 12 to 18 months).
It’s been only a year since I opened my first card last September, and I already have a solid FICO score – 720, the last time I checked. That’s not a perfect score by any means, but it lands me safely in the “good” credit range, meaning I probably won’t have trouble getting approved for new credit in the future. I still have work to do if I want to get into the “very good” credit category, which starts at 740, according to MyFICO, but for a credit card newbie I’m not disappointed in my progress so far.
While this might seem like an obvious debt-repayment strategy, Cavalieri – and many personal finance experts – suggest that you set up your payments with your bank or debit card, so that anything you owe is automatically paid every month. "Automation is key. Setting up payments to go automatically will help keep things humming and ensure you do not miss any payments," Cavalieri says. That way, not only will you start filling the debt hole, you'll avoid late fees and you'll improve your credit score, which may allow you to refinance some debt for better interest rates.
I would disagree with this option, as a credit analyst its my job to investigate credit and determine customer eligibility for loans etc... typically creditors do not look for a card thats been used 1 time for $15 then never used again this kind of credit is disregarded and or not taken seriously. When we look to approve a consumer we look at several factors and what that makes a large impact is how they make their payments, the balance currently on all their revolving and installments and the history of payments. if you only charge a tiny amount and pay it off its going to show no history and therefore not be a heavy influence. in fact if you can handle it it is good to sometimes charge the card near max but then pay it off super fast. yes this well temp drop score however. it will show creditor your applying for that you can handle larger amounts and that you pay them down good and fast.

If you’re financially drowning, of course you can declare bankruptcy. The problem is that bankruptcy is a serious derogatory mark on your credit. It won’t prevent you from getting credit in the future, but for a time some credit products will be unavailable to you and others will come at very steep prices. Also, not all debts can be discharged in a bankruptcy.

If you do not make your payment on time, most credit cards will immediately hit you with a steep late fee. Once you are 30 days late, you will likely be reported to the credit bureau. Late payments can have a big, negative impact on your score. Once you are 60 days late, you can end up losing your low balance transfer rate and be charged a high penalty interest rate, which is usually close to 30%. Just automate your payments so you never have to worry about these fees.
Paying your outstanding balance a few days after you receive your paycheck, rather than waiting until your due date, will help minimize the balance that’s reported to the credit bureaus and used to calculate your credit utilization. This can work both with multiple monthly payments or a carefully timed single payment. Automating withdrawals from a bank account is a great way to enforce the plan and eliminate forgetfulness.
Omo says that reducing what you spend at restaurants could have a dramatic effect on your finances. "I had a client, a single person, who spent almost $900 a month on food, and the majority of that was eating out. [By] working with this person, I was able to get them to reduce that number by almost 50 percent and put that difference in paying off debt." Plus, in recent years, restaurant prices have been consistently climbing from month to month, according to the Consumer Price Index.
Here is a simple test. (This is not 100% accurate mathematically, but it is an easy test). Divide your credit card interest rate by 12. (Imagine a credit card with a 12% interest rate. 12%/12 = 1%). In this example, you are paying about 1% interest per month. If the fee on your balance transfer is 3%, you will break even in month 3, and will be saving money thereafter. You can use that simplified math to get a good guide on whether or not you will be saving money.
Just because you have a poor credit history doesn’t mean you can’t get credit. Creditors set their own standards, and not all look at your credit history the same way. Some may look only at recent years to evaluate you for credit, and they may give you credit if your bill-paying history has improved. It may be worthwhile to contact creditors informally to discuss their credit standards.
Credit repair can involve fixing your bad credit in any way, shape or form, but when most people use the term ‘credit repair’, they’re referring to the process of disputing errors on credit reports. You can go through this dispute process for free with each of the credit bureaus on your own. This involves filing a formal dispute with the credit bureau(s) in question either online or via snail mail.
The root cause of your debts hasn’t been settled.Florida consumer protection lawyer Donald E. Petersen said consumers should not file bankruptcy until the root cause of their financial distress is solved. “If a consumer has severe health problems and is incurring medical bills that they are unable to pay, do not file bankruptcy until after the course of treatment is complete,” he said. “Similarly, consumers who are unable to pay their bills because they are unemployed or underemployed should not file bankruptcy until their employment status has stabilized at compensation that they can live on without accumulating additional debts in order to meet ordinary living expenses.”
One of the biggest mistakes that any borrower can ever make is trying to dispute their entire credit report. Typically, traditional credit repair companies will utilize this tactic; however, it has been proven very risky and potentially debilitating to the overall purpose. By disputing your entire report, you may remove some of positive aspects that are boosting your score.
Credit card companies make balance transfer offers because they want to steal business from their competitors. So, it makes sense that the banks will not let you transfer balances between two credit cards offered by the same bank. If you have an airline credit card or a store credit card, just make sure you know which bank issues the card before you apply for a balance transfer.
The secured credit card is a way to build and establish credit to obtain higher credit scores. If you found that you cannot get approved for a traditional credit card, you’re still likely to get approved for a secured credit card because there is less risk for the lender. The card issuer will report to the credit bureaus about your ability to pay the credit card on time and how you manage and use the balance.
Those with poor credit or no credit can obtain a low credit limit secured credit card (by putting up a security deposit). This is reported to the credit bureaus as a regular credit card and allows you to build a positive payment history quickly. Eventually, the credit card company (and others) will offer you a higher traditional credit limit without the security.
While credit building loans can be a key step in establishing a strong credit history, it’s imperative that you make all of your payments in full and on time. When you are committed to building a strong financial future with personal budgeting and spending discipline, successfully paying off a credit builder loan can lead to approval for good rates and terms on mortgages, auto loans and other loans in the future.
A debt consolidation loan streamlines existing debts into one new loan. Most unsecured consumer debt can be consolidated, including credit cards, medical bills, utility bills, payday loans, student loans, taxes and bills sent to a collection agency. Having one monthly payment instead of several can make it easier to get your finances in order and could allow you to save money on interest fees. When shopping around, it’s essential to find a loan with a lower interest rate and better terms than the original debts.
Consolidating credit card debt allows you to develop an effective repayment strategy so you can get out of debt faster. At the same time, you minimize interest charges, which reduces your total cost and can lower your monthly payments. But debt consolidation is not a silver bullet. It won’t work in every situation and if it’s used incorrectly, it can actually make a bad situation worse.
If you need a long time to pay off at a reasonable rate, and have great credit, it’s hard to beat this deal from Unify Financial Credit Union, with an APR of 6.99%-18.00% Variable with no expiration. The rate is variable, but it only varies with the Prime Rate, so it won’t fluctuate much more than say a variable rate mortgage. There is also no balance transfer fee.
If you’re the parent of a teenager, you might wonder if now is the right time to help them open a credit card. It can be hard to decide if they’re ready to take on the responsibility that comes with having a credit card since you need to trust that your teen has the restraint to limit spending and pay on time. Generally, we recommend introducing your teen to credit as soon as you can since credit is such a large part of life as an adult — you need credit to take out loans, apply for a mortgage and even make certain purchases. Plus, it’s important for your teenager to learn how to manage credit responsibly so they can build good credit.
Remember, there are lots of reasons why your credit may be in rough shape. Most are related to your spending habits. So, for instance, if you missed a few payments or your debt levels are too high (think over 30% of your total available credit limits), disputing errors won’t help your case — you’ll have to make some changes to improve your credit scores. And you may have to wait a bit to see an uptick.
Your bill-paying habits can help or hinder your ability to get a good interest rate. It’s not uncommon for lenders to review your track record of paying noncredit accounts, such as rent, utilities and phone bill. Lenders, credit bureaus and credit scoring firms generally believe that the past is the greatest indicator of future behavior, so this data can provide telling insights.
While it’s not a requirement to file, it should be noted that there is a second financial planning course that must be taken before a filer makes their last payment on the Chapter 13 plan. This course prepares the filer for financial success after the bankruptcy is final, which helps reduce the likelihood that they’ll need to rely on bankruptcy again in the future.
Once you resolve issues on your credit report, it’s time to implement a strategy to start improving your credit score. The single best thing that you can do to improve your credit score is to pay current accounts on time and in full every single month. You can picture it as burying negative information under a mountain of positive credit information.
Otherwise, the advice you have given is great and works well for a quick boost but having the ability to remove lines of information from your credit history is even better because once it is gone, it can no longer affect your score. BTW - don't take my word or anyone elses for that matter, educate yourself! You can find either of the sources I mentioned just by Googling either of them if you want and I promise you, the more information you have, the better!
We’ll explain each of the four pillars of credit repair in detail below. Just remember, each step on its own will not be enough to completely fix your credit. Credit repair, after all, is like peeling an onion: You have to peel away a few layers before you get to the good stuff. But we’ll try our best to make sure your credit recovery doesn’t bring you to tears.
Most credit counselors offer services through local offices, online, or on the phone. If possible, find an organization that offers in-person counseling. Many universities, military bases, credit unions, housing authorities, and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extension Service operate nonprofit credit counseling programs. Your financial institution, local consumer protection agency, and friends and family also may be good sources of information and referrals.
What is it? A debt management plan, or DMP, consolidates your credit card payments — not your credit card debt. Instead of making several payments to various creditors, you make one payment to your DMP and your credit counselor will use that payment to pay the debt you owe to various lenders. Your counselor may also try to negotiate lower rates and fees associated with your debt.
Many companies offer very good deals in the first year to win new customers. These are often called “switching incentives.” For example, your mobile phone company could offer 50% off its normal rate for the first 12 months. Or your cable company could offer a big discount on the first year if you buy the bundle package. Credit card companies are no different. These companies want your debt, and are willing to give you a big discount in the first year to get you to transfer.
The credit union is probably taking all your debt into consideration, not just the mortgage. And with a personal loan, new mortgage, credit cards, car loan and student loan, it sounds like you have quite a few bills you’re handling. It’s understandable you want to get your interest rates down, though, and it’s good you’re trying to be proactive about the process. Just because one lender turned you down doesn’t mean they all will. But you do want to be careful about applying for loans with multiple lenders as the inquiries can impact your scores. You might want to try one of the other options mentioned in the article before you give up. If you get turned down by multiple lenders, though, then you may want to at least talk with a credit counselor to see if they have suggestions.
The best way to consolidate debt varies by individual, depending on your financial circumstances and preferences. For some, the best way to consolidate debt may be paying off smaller balances first and then adding those payments to the bigger bills until those are paid off. Others might consider transferring balances to one credit card or getting a consolidation loan. However, consolidating balances to one credit card or using a loan can be risky because, if you need to borrow additional money, it may be tempting to use one of the accounts with a zero balance. Then the debt grows, and you can find yourself in financial trouble quickly.
The key to this strategy is obtaining more credit, but not using more credit. In other words, if your limit goes up $1,000, don’t go out and charge half of it. Think of the boost as a way to save money later when you apply for an auto loan, home loan or another form of long-term debt where a high credit score will likely result in big savings via a lower interest rate.
As newer debt weighs more heavily on your credit report than older debt, your score can drop when you make an effort to pay, whether in part or in full. While the payment will make the debt show as settled in full, it may show on your report as new debt. Regardless of how it shows on your report, ensure that the lender removes the charged-off status on your old debt and shows it as paid in full.
If you are unable to qualify for a balance transfer deal or personal loan that makes financial sense, and you prefer to not touch any of your assets, you may want to set up a chat with a reputable credit counseling firm to see if you are a good candidate for a Debt Management Plan (DMP). A DMP can make it easier for you to pay your credit card bills, but it will likely have a negative impact on your credit score.
Offer a variety of deferment options: Discover offers four different deferment options for borrowers. If you decide to go back to school, you may be eligible for in-school deferment as long as you are enrolled for at least half-time. In addition to in-school deferment, Discover offers deferment to borrowers on active military duty (up to 3 years), in eligible public service careers (up to 3 years) and those in a health professions residency program (up to 5 years).
This part of your credit score will look at how much debt you have. Your credit report uses your statement balance. So, even if you pay your credit card statement in full every month (never pay any interest), it would still show as debt on your credit report, because it uses your statement balance. This part of your score will look at a few elements:
Even if the debt has passed the SOL in your state for suit (variable by state) and even the federal SOL for reporting (roughly 7 years from when the debt discharged) a collector may still pursue you for this money if you owe it. They will just never be able to collect it or report it if you don't allow them to, although they will certainly try and hope you are ignorant enough of the law that they get money from you.
Once you complete a plan to repay your debt, you should also complete a thorough review of your credit report. Creditor should automatically inform the credit bureaus that your account is paid or current. However, mistakes and errors happen frequently, particularly following a period of financial hardship. That means it’s up to you to make sure your credit report is up to date and that old errors aren’t hanging around.
If you already have a good-to-excellent credit score and a low debt-to-income ratio, you may want to consider refinancing your student loans. When you refinance your loans, you take out a new credit-based private student loan and use the money to pay off some or all of your current loans. (The lender will generally send the money directly to your loan servicers.)
You can compare your debt consolidation program options by using a debt consolidation calculator. The calculator will help you determine how much you can save by comparing your current interest rates with the proposed debt consolidation program’s interest rate. It will also help you determine your monthly payment based on your total debt balance, interest rate and repayment term.
Hi , so I started out with a 421 in December 2014 , I had a foreclosure , no credit cards , horrible spending habits , collections etc. My foreclosure fell off my report and I went to 453 . I applied for a credit one unsecured card , high interest and annual fees but all I could get at the time (300 credit limit). Charged gas every month , maybe 50 and paid it right off .In March got a cl increase to 500. My credit went to a 479. Appied for a Capital one card w/ 300 cl. Got it , charged very little every month paid it off , in June got a credit increse to 700. Also got offered a platinum mastercard w/500 cl from Credit One . I also had my husband add me to his Capital One credit card w/ 1000 cl. As of July 15 my score is 556. Not ideal but every week I check with Credit Karma and my score is going up . It takes time but you have to be disciplined . My name added as a user on hubbys card and my new credit card has now shown up yet on my credit so Im hoping for a decent jump when it does . As far as old collections , I paid off a 1700 Fingerhut bill and it had no effect on my credit whatsoever , I really wish I hadnt paid it , it says paid but still shows as derogatory. Tommorow I am going to my bank and getting a 500 secured card . As you can see I started this quest in December 2014 when I decided it was time to take responsibility and do something and its been 8 months and my credit score has jumped about 135 points .
We made the following tips as practical as possible to give you both the structure of a plan and a clue about how to actually stick to it. Knowing what to do and actually doing it are two very different things, after all. We also explored how long the hands of time will have to turn before you can put bad credit behind you, hopefully once and for all.
One of the main benefits of consolidating your credit card debt is getting a reduced interest rate. Reducing your interest rate allows you to lower your monthly payment and pay off your debts sooner. As a result, if you can’t lower your interest rates by consolidating your credit card debt, then it is probably not worth the extra cost and fees you will have to incur to do it.
No one can legally remove accurate and timely negative information from a credit report. You can ask for an investigation —at no charge to you — of information in your file that you dispute as inaccurate or incomplete. Some people hire a company to investigate for them, but anything a credit repair company can do legally, you can do for yourself at little or no cost. By law:
The Capital One® Secured Mastercard® offers qualifying cardholders a lower security deposit compared to other secured cards. You will get an initial $200 credit line after making a security deposit of $49, $99, or $200, determined based on your creditworthiness. Typical secured cards require you to deposit an amount equal to your credit limit, so this card has added perks for people who qualify for the lower deposits.
Credit repair is critical to saving money on insurance, loans, and credit cards, but that's not the only reason to repair your credit. A better credit score opens up new employment opportunities, even promotions and raises with your current employer. If you dream of starting your own business or just want the security of knowing you can borrow money when you want to, you should repair your credit sooner rather than later.
How to use it effectively: The money you withdraw from your 401(k) loan should go directly to paying off your credit card debt. After your debts are paid off, payments most likely will be taken from your paychecks until your loan is repaid. If not, continue to make regular, on-time payments. While you’re repaying your loan remember to keep your job — don’t quit and avoid any actions that may lead to your dismissal so you aren’t subject to penalties.
It’s hard to know the answer because it’s impossible to know your exact situation. A credit score factors in both non-revolving (car loans or mortgages, for example) and revolving (usually credit cards) credit. Diversity of credit has an effect, as do on-time payments and the amount of credit you access versus your credit limit (under 10% is best of all, but under 30% is considered acceptable).

Following the 2007-2008 implosion of the housing market, banks saw mortgage borrowers defaulting at higher rates than ever before. In addition to higher mortgage default rates, the market downturn led to higher default rates across all types of consumer loans. To maintain profitability banks began tightening lending practices. More stringent lending standards made it tough for anyone with poor credit to get a loan at a reasonable rate. Although banks have loosened lending somewhat in the last two years, people with subprime credit will continue to struggle to get loans. In June 2017, banks rejected 81.4% of all credit applications from people with Equifax Risk Scores below 680. By contrast, banks rejected 9.11% of credit applications from those with credit scores above 760.22
With a basic understanding of how the credit industry functions and where your credit score comes from, it’s time to begin exploring how to repair credit score fast. There are many different proven methods that millions of people have used for fast credit repair. Whether you have bad credit score or average credit score, the journey to repairing credit score all begins here: learning different tips and tricks.

Both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy can allow you to keep your house if requirements are satisfied.

Credit reports typically have a space for you to provide your comments at the bottom: explaining why a particular debt hasn't been paid or to point out any factual errors. While this is another area of recourse, with the credit bureaus you're seen as guilty until proven innocent, and the burden's on you to correct things. When you write to the credit bureau, be sure to send copies (not the originals) of any proof that can be used.
If you have missed multiple payments, perhaps its time to set-up payment reminders. In the digital age, you can schedule your cell-phone, laptop, and even email to remind you when a payment is due. On top of this, you can purchase sticky notes and post them around your entire home or office to remind yourself when a specific bill is due. In a lenders eyes, there should not be an excused for a missed payment. Just like the example of lending money to your friend, a lender is expecting to receive their capital back in a timely manner.
The lack of information and knowledge surrounding the credit industry has led people to create false beliefs of what is good credit, what is bad credit, and how to repair credit fast. What’s fascinating and quite unsettling is that people think that it’s hard to repair credit fast. We are here to break barriers and provide the information you need to understand that fast credit repair is doable. To make strides to decrease the number of households in debt and provide valuable information to credit-holders, we are going to explore the basics of credit and how to repair credit fast.
Yes it does! I tried this about 20 yrs. ago! I consolidated my debts into one amount! I also had my interest rates reduced by the loan company. I discovered that any money that was shaved off my debt in any way whether by lower interest rates or by taking settlements were considered charge-offs and demolished your credit rating. It took me over 30 yrs. to regain any credit worthiness at all!
A single month afgter opeing, my scores went up 64/68 points, from the 598 range to 665 range. Keep a low balance or utilization rate of less than 30% (preferrably less than 10%). Studies show the sweet spot is 1-9%. Paying on time 100% of the time and knowing the date your card reports the balance to the credit bureaus is the key. Always pay by the due date and be below 30% (or 10%) on the reporting date. After as little as 6 months, but usually 12, they will convert your card to UNSECURED, likely with a limit increase and give you your original deposit back.
Account Information – Carefully check all accounts listed and make sure they are actually accounts that you have opened. If you find an account in your name that you did not open, contact the credit bureaus, explain the fraud and ask that a fraud alert be put on your account. Then contact the card-issuing company to find out more details about the account. The fact that it is on your report means it is likely that someone used your Social Security number in opening that account. Also be sure that the balance information and payment history for each account is accurate. If any information is inaccurate, you will need proof of the correct information and you will have to start a dispute with the credit bureau to ask for ratifications.
Make no mistake: if you want help with your debt, you should get it. Don't let social stigma or ego get in the way—there are plenty of ways to get on the right track that go further than blog posts and stop short of putting you back in debt to someone else. Debt repayment and credit counseling programs can negotiate lower interest rates on your behalf, or help you do it yourself. They can help you with your budget, and help you plan a route out of debt that turns your credit into a tool you control, as opposed to a monster than controls you. If you need the help, get it—and definitely do that before you take out a loan. Photo by Media Bakery13 (Shutterstock).
The best way to handle these types of information lines on your credit report is to dispute them but you have to remember that if that isn't done correctly, it is like kicking a hornets nest. Just calling them and saying, "hey, I dispute this." is NOT good enough, regardless of what ANYONE says. It has to be done with a certified, return receipt letter that has been properly worded to prevent the sleezy little buggers from using a loophole. You can find a lot of information out there about how to do this on sites from people like Dave Ramsey or with self help books like Weathering Debt (either one works, but I prefer Weathering Debt, it was much more concise and to the point) but whatever you do, DON'T try to wing it and don't pay someone to do something you can do yourself with ease and for free. Besides, you need to know how to stop the problem from happening again, right?
If you are struggling to pay off multiple credit cards, consolidating your debt may allow you to reduce your interest rates and lower your monthly payment. However, a lower monthly payment can mean a longer repayment term and more interest paid over the life of the loan. Whether you should consolidate your credit card debt depends on your individual circumstances and the terms of the consolidation.
It’s always possible there are some errors on your credit report causing your credit score to be much lower than it should be. At the beginning of any endeavor to improve your credit, get acquainted with your free 3-bureau credit report (from annualcreditreport.com) so you know what belongs on them. Check carefully for any errors to your name, identifying information, account names, account numbers, credit limits, balances, and payment dates, and if you find any errors dispute them and have your report corrected. If there were errors regarding payments or credit limits and they are resolved, your credit score may improve dramatically and quickly, depending on the error.
Most balance transfer offers are from the date you open your account, not the date you complete the transfer. It is in your interest to complete the balance transfer right away, so that you can benefit from the low interest rate as soon as possible. With most credit card companies, you will actually lose the promotional balance transfer offer if you do not complete the transfer within 60 or 90 days. Just get it done!

The third factor that is utilized to calculate credit score is your history of credit. This category is catered towards how long each line of credit has been opened. For example, how long have your credit cards been active? How long go did you open a car loan? The longer a loan or credit line has been active, the better your history of credit will be. Now, this category is relatively easy to control. All you need to do is keep quality active lines of credit open. In other articles on our website, we discuss what could happen if you decide to close a matured credit line.

A low credit score can affect almost every aspect of your life, and if you've realized that your negative credit is holding you back, you probably would like to do something to change that... and the sooner the better. You'll find plenty of companies that claim they can repair your credit overnight, or guarantee that they can remove any negative item from your credit report, whether accurate or not. If this sounds too good to be true, that's because it is. The truth is that there's no such thing as a quick credit fix.
Along with saving money that you can use for vacations, holidays and retirement, experts suggest putting money regularly into a savings account dedicated to emergencies. If you don't set aside money for emergencies, you can easily get saddled with – and stay in – debt, says Erika Jensen, president of Respire Wealth Management in Houston. "Debt occurs when income minus expenses equals a negative number," she says. "In the absence of savings, that extra spend is going on credit cards. We all know that there will inevitably be months where our expenses exceed our income," she explains. "Everyone knows that scenario. If there isn't any savings, then both of those expenses are covered again by debt."
However, each model weights the information differently. This means that a FICO® Score cannot be compared directly to a VantageScore® or an Equifax Risk Score. For example, a VantageScore® does not count paid items in collections against you. However, a FICO® Score counts all collections items against you, even if you’ve paid them. Additionally, the VantageScore® counts outstanding debt against you, but the FICO® Score only considers how much credit card debt you have relative to your available credit.
A key indicator of your financial fitness, your debt-to-income ratio allows financial institutions to weigh your current debt against your income. This helps lenders determine your ability to keep up with new loan payments. Your debt-to-income ratio is calculated by dividing the total sum of all your monthly obligations by your gross monthly income. According to guidelines set by Wells Fargo, a good debt-to-income ratio is 35% or less, a decent one falls into the 36% to 49% range and one that needs improvement is 50% or higher.
2. First Premier – The bank claims to want to offer people a second chance when it comes to their finances, but its fee structure and fine print prove the exact opposite. First Premier charges you a $95 processing fee just to apply for a credit card. Then it levies a $75 annual fee on the credit cards and most cards only come with a $300 limit. You’re paying $170 for a $300 credit line! The APR is a painful 36%. In year two the annual fee reduces to $45, but then you’re charged a monthly servicing fee of $6.25. And to top it all off, you’ll be charged a 25% fee if your credit limit is increased. Stay away from this card! Use the $170 it would take to open the card and get a secured card instead.
If you transfer your debt and use your card responsibly to pay off your balance before the intro period ends, then there is no trap associated with the 0% APR period. But, if you neglect making payments and end up with a balance post-intro period, you can easily fall into a trap of high debt — similar to the one you left when you transferred the balance. As a rule of thumb, use the intro 0% APR period to your advantage and pay off ALL your debt before it ends, otherwise you’ll start to accumulate high interest charges.
You need to show you can handle credit wisely, so having occasional balances on your credit cards can be a good thing. But in general, when you use your credit cards, try to pay them off as soon as you can (you don't have to wait for the statement in the mail but can pay online anytime). In fact, you can make your record look better than it is by making your payments just before your statement is sent, rather than waiting until you receive it. Most credit card companies report your balance at the same time that they mail your bill. If, for example, your statement goes out on the 15th of the month, pay your bill early (let’s say by the 13th) so the money will arrive prior to the statement being sent out. That way your outstanding credit balance reported to the credit bureaus will be lower.
Another avenue to pursue to improve your credit score as quickly as possible is to negotiate with your creditor and credit bureaus to see if they are will to make adjustments. This can be especially effective if you have established a current strong payment record. In that case, a creditor can often be persuaded to remove previously reported late payments as a “goodwill” gesture based on your current payment history, and to encourage you to maintain the course.
What is it? Home equity loans are for a fixed amount of money for a fixed time and at a fixed interest rate — but they are secured by your home. That means your home is collateral, and if you default on your loan, the lender may foreclose on your home. You can borrow a certain percentage of your home equity. That’s how much your home is worth minus how much you owe on the mortgage.
Presently, there’s more and more consumer struggling to pay off their debt, some collection agencies are opting for unfair means to collect payments from debt-ridden consumers ignoring the debt collection laws. However, to stop such malpractices and help debtors combat such illegal collection agency harassment, the FTC has come forward with the FDCPA, which gives debtors legal rights to sue those debt collectors who illegally threaten, intimidate or harass them.
A third of your overall credit score is based on the credit utilization ratio across all of your cards. Because of the way credit scoring works, it's better to carry a $1,000 balance on a card with a $5,000 limit (20% credit utilization) than to carry a $500 balance on a card with a $1,000 limit (50% credit utilization). That's why, in discussing payment pecking order, we recommended paying off the cards closest to being maxed out. That's also why you shouldn't terminate accounts. It'll increase the percentage of total available credit that you’re using – and that will reduce your score.
I would like to say Thank you for the outstanding service that you gave me. I started the program just four short years ago and in March I will be debt free. With your help in setting better plans with my creditors I was able to accomplish this. It was hard work, but it was all worth it at the end. The Consolidated credit counselors are the best; they answered all of my question(s) and helped me every step of the way.
You may also be able to negotiate with creditors as part of a "goodwill adjustment." They may be willing to remove late payments that they've reported to the credit bureaus, especially if you have a history of on-time payments. While you're trying to fix your credit, don't neglect your current obligations. Whatever you do, be sure to pay all your bills on time so you don't accrue any more negative items on your report.
Repairing your credit includes paying off those debt collection accounts. Until you do, you face relentless calls and letters from debt collectors. While you can take action to stop debt collector calls, collection accounts often move from one debt collector to another. When a new collector gets your debt, you’ll have to go through the process of sending letters to stop the calls all over again.

Lenders usually look at your credit score for both a debt consolidation loan and a home equity loan. However, sometimes lenders can be more lenient with debt consolidation loans in terms of your credit score; oftentimes, borrowers can have less than stellar credit and still be approved for a personal loan or debt consolidation loan. However, those with excellent credit will be more likely to obtain lower interest rates with debt consolidation loans than those who have fair to poor credit.
However, there is a big myth that you have to borrow money and pay interest to get a good score. That is completely false! So long as you use your credit card (it can even be a small $1 charge) and then pay that statement balance in full, your score will benefit. You do not need to pay interest on a credit card to improve your score. Remember: your goal is to have as much positive information as possible, with very little negative information. That means you should be as focused on adding positive information to your credit report as you are at avoiding negative information.

We all have bills to pay, so why not leverage your payments to work for you? Making credit card payments ahead of schedule will reduce the accrued interest and your debt-to-income ratio. Staying ahead of the curve on rent and utilities will help strengthen your credit score as well. If you have a financial calendar, move your payments up by seven days—it could make all the difference.
Thank you for this. I have been building my credit back after Economy struggles and long term illness.  Today, I'm in a better position physically and materially. Most of my credit issues are resolved. However, I'm curious as to your next step once you resolved the medical bill situation.  Did you pay the creditor and subsequently write a letter to the credit bureaus? I have a $284 medical bill I can't recall not paying, but I would like to resolve the matter this year.
“If [a filer] falls behind, then the trustee files a motion to dismiss, which [the filer] would either allow or explain to the judge what happened, and [their] plan for getting back current,” Albaugh said. Without a plan to get back on track, Albaugh said a homeowner could be facing some trouble. “If you were using [Chapter 13] to get caught up on a house, then the foreclosure process starts back up again and you lose that bankruptcy protection,” he said.
Well, there are some things you can do to help move the needle in the short term, but making significant changes to your credit score will likely take a little time. If you’re looking to apply for a home loan in the not too distant future that’s probably not what you wanted to hear. In this article, though, we’ll highlight some things that will help, and put you in a better position when applying for credit next time.
If you have medical debt, you may be wondering what options are available to you. Medical debt can be consolidated into a nonprofit debt management program, though you may not receive lower interest rates. Considering that much medical debt is already at a low or zero interest rate, this should not be a deterrent. By consolidating medical debt to a debt management program, you are simplifying your bill pay and committing to timely, consistent payments of  your medical debt. This will help you pay off your debt faster and also may have a positive impact on your credit score.
Shortly before graduate school started, I visited friends in Iowa. When we were about to split the bill after dinner at a Japanese restaurant, I noticed that all my friends had a Discover card with a shimmering pink or blue cover. The Discover it® Student Cash Back was known for its high approval rate for student applicants, and had been popular among international students.
In most cases, the 0% APR interest rate is a limited-time promotion, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If the rate rises, your monthly payment could also increase. The CFPB also notes that the company can raise your rate if you’re more than 60 days late on a payment. Additionally, you may have to pay a balance transfer fee, and if you also use the card to make purchases, the new charges may be subject to interest unless there’s also an introductory 0% APR for purchases.
If you are facing financial difficulties, it's always best to contact your lenders, creditors or service providers (such as your utility company or physicians) as soon as possible. Collection agencies and legal fees cost lenders a lot of money, so they are often open to negotiations, which are free. Call, email or write to explain your financial situation (for example, if you have experienced a job loss or unexpected set of expenses due to medical emergency). Discuss a new payment plan and make a good faith payment. At the least, you might be allowed to skip a payment without penalty or lower your minimum payments.
Thank you for this. I have been building my credit back after Economy struggles and long term illness. Today, I'm in a better position physically and materially.

If you are running out of time on your intro APR and you still have a balance, don’t sweat it. At least two months before your existing intro period ends, start looking for a new balance transfer offer from a different issuer. Transfer any remaining balance to the card with the new 0% intro offer. This can provide you with the additional time needed to pay off your balance. Ideally, look for a card that has a 0% intro APR and also no balance transfer fee.
Your goal with a balance transfer should be to get out of debt. If you start spending on the credit card, there is a real risk that you will end up in more debt. Additionally, you could end up being charged interest on your purchase balances. If your credit card has a 0% balance transfer rate but does not have a 0% promotional rate on purchases, you would end up being charged interest on your purchases right away, until your entire balance (including the balance transfer) is paid in full. In other words, you lose the grace period on your purchases so long as you have a balance transfer in place.
This tip is a valuable financial lesson that many people can implement, and it can completely transform their financial situation. Typically, people tend to wait until the last minute to pay their bills, which results in late payments, late fees, and extended loans. The goal with this is to develop the habit of scheduling your payments to be automatic. IF you have already missed a payment in the past, this tip is even more important for you. By scheduling your payments automatically, you are making the dedication that the money will be in the account by the time the bill needs to come out. This, at the same time, if properly managed, can help direct your entire attention on paying your bills on time, rather than purchasing something out of instant gratification. Also, by showing lenders that you have set up automatic payments, it shows a level of dedication towards fast credit repair.

I was laid off for 2 years 5 years ago. We walked away from our house 3-1/2 years because we couldn’t afford to live in it. I’ve had steady employment for the past 3 years. But we’ve built up 45,000 in credit card debt. My credit score is currently 625. I have no problem paying pack the full amount I owe to the credit card companies but I would like to consolidate them. What can I do? My parents transferred a house they owned into my name and it’s paid off. Can I use that as collateral?
Keep up the good work and employ these strategies to repair your credit as your budget and credit score permits to watch your score continue to increase. If you feel overwhelmed by your credit problems, you might consider professional credit repair help. Remember, just five or 10 points can be the difference between sub-prime and prime credit or prime credit and excellent credit and each level of credit improvement has its rewards.
A personal loan may also help improve your credit score. One of the major factors in determining your FICO® Score is your utilization ratio: the combined balances on all your credit cards as a percentage of the overall credit limits on the cards. The lower your utilization rate, the better. Moving card balances to a personal loan might lower your utilization ratio.
This company is very professional, transparent, and honest. When I ask about the other companies trash talking them they simply just clarify the inaccuracies and make absolutelty no comment on the others. I appreciate a little professionalism especially when it comes to my credit repair. They got me set up with a portal, I saw my letters that went out on my behalf, their customer service team followed up with me the next day to make sure my portal was set up, i found the compliance center, and help desk. They also called on the 3rd day, the 7th day, the 14th day, the 30th day, and the 45th day lol I was not expecting them to be that attentive but im glad they are. They set the expectation in regards to the timeframe and they told me how and why each item would be disputed by showing me where the violations were and how we would use the law to dispute it. They made it very clear that results werent guaranteed but reassured me there was something they could work on otherwise they said they would'nt be able to take me on as a client so that I just dont throw my money away, which i really appreciate. I am extremely satisfied overall and very glad I made the choice to go here and would highly recommend them.
Start by getting debt help from a credit counselor. The counselor might even help you negotiate your own agreements with creditors. If you develop and follow a get-out-of-debt plan with the help of a counselor (as opposed to consolidating your debt), your credit score will rise over time faster than it will if you declare bankruptcy or ignore your debts, as you make on-time payments and reduce your overall debt load. You’ll also avoid the hit to your score that comes with the new hard inquiry we talked about earlier.

What is it? A 401(k) loan is when you borrow money from your existing 401(k) plan to pay off debts. The amount you can borrow is limited to the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of your vested balance. After you withdraw the money, a repayment plan is created that includes interest charges. You typically have five years to pay off the loan, and if you take out the loan to buy a house, your term may be extended to 10-15 years.
Consolidating the debt probably won’t hurt your credit scores over the long run, but there could be a short-term impact from the new loan with a balance. So I can’t guarantee that your scores won’t dip when you do this. If your scores are strong enough to get the lease now you may want to go ahead and do that. If not you may be taking something of a chance – it could go either way. Will Debt Consolidation Help or Hurt Your Credit?
We have a budget and unfortunately have nothing of value to sell. I have to have a reliable vehicle to go to work and to take the kids to school. Can’t stand the mall, thank goodness!!! We make our own coffee. We save for months to have pizza or a family outing. We are very modest so we only have needs, wants went away when we had my kids. I am looking for a part time job but I want to have one day off a week to spend with my kids and thats apparently a problem for some employers. I’m not giving up and I will win this I just needed to see if anyone had an idea I haven’t already looked into. Thank you!
One of the other ways people seem to be able to fix their credit fast is by enrolling in a creditsweep program. the creditsweep program can work, sometimes, maybe, under the right circumstances for a few select people if done 100% correct and if you are willing to break a few laws and pay for the service upfront in cash or bitcoin. See!, nothing to it.
ConsumerInfo.com, Inc., an Experian® Company ("CIC"), which operates websites such as FreeCreditReport.com, ProtectMyId.com, and other websites we may add from time to time, may share information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you with our parent company, our affiliated companies, and with third parties. This information includes:
The most important factor when it comes to one’s credit score is their credit payment history. What this means is, are you making on-time payments, have you ever missed a payment, and are you delinquent on any payments? Putting these numbers into practice, one missed payment can impact over 35% of your entire credit score. On our website, we discuss how, in some circumstances, this can be detrimental, leading to up to 100-point credit score drops.
“A good credit repair company will scrub questionable credit report items against other laws — like the Fair Credit Billing Act, which regulates original creditors; the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which oversees collection agencies; and others that address medical illness, military service, student status and other life events,” Padawer said.
Kevin Han, a Minneapolis-based attorney who runs FinancialPanther.com, a blog focused on side hustles and reducing debt, says that after law school, he got in the habit of calculating the cost of his debt. His suggestion: "Figure out how much your debt costs in interest per year, then divide that by 365. When I did this, I found out my debt after I graduated law school cost me $17 per day. When I realized this, it got me super pumped to pay off my debt as fast as possible. Each time I paid off more of my debt, my daily interest that I was paying dropped," he says. Thanks to that strategy, along with smart budgeting, Han ended up paying off $87,000 in student loans in two and a half years.
How it works: You can add your teen as an authorized user to your account by logging in to your online account or calling the number on the back of your card. The information required typically includes their name, birthday and SSN. After adding your teen as an authorized user, they will receive their own card that is linked to your account. They can use their card to make purchases just like you would.
The last major factor is your history of applying for credit. This accounts for 10% of most credit scores and may be holding you back if you applied for several credit accounts recently. This factor also takes time to correct, but any hard inquiries into your credit will only ding your scores slightly, and as they get older, they will have less of an impact. A year is generally when they begin to stop hurting your credit scores.
We agree that it is very important for individuals to be knowledgeable of their credit standing. When you have a credit-monitoring tool like freecreditscore.com on your side, you get e-mail alerts whenever there’s a change in your credit score–and you can also see your credit score whenever you want. With the free credit report from the government, you only see your report once a year. If you monitor your credit score regularly, it’s easier to catch inaccuracies before it’s too late.
But even if you have a low credit score, go ahead and do the research to see if you can find a better deal than the one you have right now. "Those with the best credit scores typically qualify for the best rates on their new personal loans, but don't let an average or even poor score keep you from requesting quotes," says Norris. "This is especially true if you have more than $10,000 in credit card debt and those cards charge exorbitant interest rates, which most of them do."
You cannot use your existing credit cards while you’re on a debt management plan, nor can you open new accounts. McClary also said that if you do manage to open new credit card accounts during your debt management plan, existing creditors who find out may stop participating in your debt management plan and reset your account to its original terms and interest rate.
You'll probably have a limited amount of money to put toward credit repair each month. So, you'll have to prioritize where you spend your money. Focus first on accounts that are in danger of becoming past due. Get as many of these accounts current as possible, preferably all of them. Then, work on bringing down your credit card balances. Third are those accounts that have already been charged-off or sent to a collection agency.
Credit reporting companies must investigate the items you question within 30 days — unless they consider your dispute frivolous. They also must forward all the relevant data you provide about the inaccuracy to the organization that provided the information. After the information provider gets notice of a dispute from the credit reporting company, it must investigate, review the relevant information, and report the results back to the credit reporting company. If the investigation reveals that the disputed information is inaccurate, the information provider has to notify the nationwide credit reporting companies so they can correct it in your file.
A quick Google search yielded this terms and conditions sheet, which may be slightly different than the one you’d receive if you applied for a card. According to the one we found, Credit One charges an annual membership fee from $0 to $99. Credit line minimums are between $300 and $500. So you could be paying $99 for a $300 credit limit. APR is relatively standard, but on the high side, with variable 19.15% to 25.24%. Given the high annual fees, we recommend saving your money and using a secured card with no annual fee to begin rebuilding your credit score.
Excuse me angry person commenting below my comment, I dont feel the need to prove to anyone that my review is genuine, the results im recieving are enough for me however, This is a platform for consumers like myself to share our experiences with other people ACTUALLY looking for credit repair. It honestly seems very odd to me that you targeted all Reliant Credit Repair Reviews and not the Clean Slate ones that seem to have quite a bit of likes and posts. Are you implying that their reviews are fake as well? look i think i speak for everyone on when I say if we want to leave a review about our experience we have the freedom to do so on this platform and if you dont like it please take your negativity elsewhere. Thank you. Ill be posting my review on Google and Yelp with photos for those who want to see my progress -Mr. Masha
Note that drastically reducing your credit score could impact your career, especially if you maintain a security clearance. Bad credit is the leading cause of loss of security clearance. A low credit score can also impact employability in the financial services sector. If you want to maintain a good credit score, debt settlement may not be the best way to consolidate debt.
The Citi® Secured Mastercard® requires a $200 security deposit, which is typical of secured cards and a good amount to establish your credit line. You can deposit more money if you want to receive a higher credit line, but if you don’t have a lot of money available to deposit, coming up with $200 is manageable. This card doesn’t have any additional card benefits like rewards or insurances, but you can access Citi’s Credit Knowledge Center for financial management tips.
The goal is to focus your financial attention on quickly paying down one debt as quickly as possible. Now, if your debt is accumulated in credit cards, as you make monthly payments, do not use those cards. The credit bureau will see your financial habits, and this will reflect in your credit report and ultimately your credit score. Now, calculating your credit utilization is not hard and is something that everyone can do. Take the time to figure out where you stand and what loans or credit lines you can begin minimizing to reach that sweet spot. This is one of the best ways for fast credit repair.
Each time you apply for credit is listed on your credit report as a “hard inquiry” and if you have too many within two years, your credit score will suffer. In general, a consumer with good credit can apply for credit a few times each year before it begins to affect their credit score. If you’re already starting with below-average credit, however, these inquiries may have more of an impact on your score and delay your ultimate goal of watching your credit score climb.
We had a very nice weekend with friends and family. We ate too much cake (Chase didn't eat enough cake :o)), probably overdid it on the ice cream too, but this was a celebration after all! I can't believe it's been almost 2 1/2 years ago now that we were expecting Chase to not be here. Look at him now!
LOVE the monster balloons...they're AWESOME!!! Happy Birthday Chase...hope you had a fantastic day!!!
Belated happy birthday Chase - I hope it was your best one so far and the worst one of those to come.
Hi, my name is Chase. I am the happiest little boy ever! I was born with optic nerve colobomas in both eyes and labeled legally blind (I see lots though!). I also have been diagnosed with cerebellar hypoplasia, except my cerebellum isn't small...I just don't have one. Don't worry about me though, I have a great Mom, Dad, Big Brother and 7 AMAZING therapists who are doing everything they can to make sure I am doing as much as I possibly can and showering me in love every day. Thank you for visiting my blog!!! xoxo
This is a great opportunity for all types of families, not only those with children with disabilities. They have been fantastic to work with and without Darcy...well...we'd be buying a tent! :o)
Leviticus 25:37 "You shall not give him your money for interest, nor may you give him your food for increase"
Rachel and Avi were given spending money by their father when they went to visit the "Educational Toy Fair."
After looking at the exhibits, Rachel found something she wanted to buy. It was a "do-it-yourself kit" for creating attractive greeting cards.
"Please, Avi," she said to her brother, "lend me a dollar. I want to get this kit. I'll return the dollar to you next time we get an allowance."
Avi thought for a moment. He realized that even if he lent the money to his sister, he would still be able to buy something for himself. He gave his sister the dollar that she requested.
Immediately afterwards they heard an announcement on the loudspeaker: "Attention visitors. We have a special offer.
Come and check out our super discount-table. Buy any two games and get one free! Hurry - limited supply..."
Avi and Rachel went to the discount table. There were so many games, that at first he couldn't decide what to get!
Finally, he chose three games and went to pay. But as Avi stood on line counting his money, he realized that he did not have enough.
"Oh no!", he groaned. "I only have enough for one game. Now I'll lose the free game!" He turned to his sister, and said: "Rachel, I'm not sorry I lent you the money. I'm glad you bought what you wanted and I know you'll pay me back, but since I only have enough for one game now, I feel that you should pay me more than a dollar! I could have had three games if I had that money, so actually you owe me one dollar - plus more to make up for my loss!"
While Avi was being generous with his money, the Torah prohibits him from demanding more than one dollar from Rachel.
He is not allowed to ask for more than he lent. The extra money he expects for his "kind service" and "loss" is similar to taking interest on a loan.
A borrower may feel he has no choice but to agree to the lender's conditions because he needs the money. We are forbidden to demand interest on loans.
The order of your day is crucial. It must start with vision and only then gradually immerse into the world. Begin with learning that inspires, with meditation and prayer. Then go on to study of Torah that deals with worldly matters. And then you may plunge ahead into the darkness, full of light with which to illuminate it.
During CoderDojo #20 we looked at programming Space Invaders in Python, using the excellent PyGame library. Here’s the finished code. If you want to progress this further, I’d look at:

if you thought you were frugle before…just wait until the loan payments start!! become a penny pintcher now to prepare for the loads of cash you’ll have to pay in a couple years
If living on campus, don’t go home often because gas is expensive, marta is expensive, and your parents probably don’t wanna see you all the time anyways.
colege can be made cheaper by getting good grades and applying for many scholarships and financial aid.
Buy your clothes at thrift stores. And, if you pay attention, you will notice that especially near holidays, many of these stores offer 25% off, or Buy 1 Get 1 Free items, etc.
Use coupons when grocery shopping. Make sure you match the coupons with the sales in the grocery stores, too. And try to find stores that double your coupons!
If the product isn’t more expensive, look for products with rebates on them. Many products have rebates that refund a significant portion of the cost, sometimes even the full price of the product!
Go to the library and check out movies rather than renting them. You’d be surprised at how many good movie the library has!
Barter for items or services. Craigslist has barter sections, and many cities have local barter groups. Check them out!
One great way to be a Cheap Scholar is to buy textbooks online! I have found I save approximately 50-75% buying online rather than the jacked-up prices at the college bookstore! I also sell my used college textbooks online and find I get more return on my original dollar!
Check with your instructor–quite often the previous edition of textbooks is still usable, since often the only change is a very minor one. That way you can still get a used book instead of having to buy the new edition.
snag food from home, stay in-state college, wear dirty clothes, wash clothes at home, get a part time job, apply for tons of scholarships!!!!
By having a buddy system with your roommate or dorm floor. The buddy system is having everyone chip in with as much as they can. $1, $2 or a penny even, to buy food or any other expense needed. That way each person saves money instead of wasting it.
Live off-campus if it is cheaper. At my school on campus housing is way over-priced, and there are plenty of places to rent that are much cheaper.
Become a resident assistant if possible! Not only will you usually get free or discounted housing, but some schools will even give you a free meal plan and pay you.
Learn how to give haircuts. Start practicing on your friends for free and then start charging as you get better.
Take the General Ed courses at a city college and then transfer to the university you want to go to.
Get a job on campus something related to study. Tutor, TA, RA, etc. It will help your tuition, college money(board, pocket money), and your career. It can be a good career too.
Rent books that are not for classes for your major, or books that are not going to really help you later on.
I just borrowed my classmates handouts b/c I cannot afford to photocopy it, I only have enough money for my transpo.
I just borrowed my classmates handouts b/c I cannot afford to photocopy it. I only have enough money for my transpo.
A way to make college cheaper is to study really hard. If you study really hard, you will receive very good grades. If you receive good grades, you qualify for several scholarships. If you qualify for several scholarships, you can apply to all of them. When you apply for all of them, you have a greater chance to receive many different scholarships. Something I should have done.
Firstly, you MUST fill out the FAFSA to see if you qualify for grants, subsidized loans, and scholarships. You may even qualify for a work-study grant, which is absolutely amazing (trust me, I worked at my school library for about a year… It was fantastic. They work around your schedule, and I never felt over-burdened while I was a work-study.). You could also go to your school’s financial aid office and see if they have any scholarships that you can apply for.
Choosing to live on campus isn’t a terrible idea, but you could probably save some money if you decide to live off-campus with ROOMMATES (I know, it’s kind of weird to live with strange people that you may not know personally, but they’re students too – and generally, they make really good friends!).
When you shop for groceries, stock up on meats that are on quick sale. Pop them in the freezer, and you can eat for a month. Buy fresh fruits and veggies from your local Farmer’s Market; the prices are great, and the foods are so fresh and delicious…you won’t regret it.
RIDE YOUR BIKE TO SCHOOL!! (If you live close enough, at least.) You’ll be doing your part to save the environment, AND you’ll be saving on gas money.
Before you buy your books at the school bookstore, plan ahead and try to find your books online. There are plenty of great used books that you can use, and there are a lot of websites that cater to university students. Just a quick Google search of the ISBN could save you hundreds! They might have some highlighting and scribbles in them, but you could look at those as guide lines for your own studies!
Go to the Dollar Store, shop at Good Will. When you get ill, make sure you go to your university’s health center before you give all of your money to an off-campus doctor. They have plans that aim to help students with their medical expenses. It’s especially useful when you have no insurance.
Take up a useful hobby like crocheting! Have cold winters? Hats cost too much? BAM! Cheap, stylish hat made with love.
I work full time and go to school full time. It is very difficult to afford it. I save money by not eating out, not living on campus, avoiding books if possible, get good grades to qualify for scholarships, walk everywhere, save pens/pencils, print on both sides of paper, and if I need anything, I try and make it first! Recycling is a great way to save money!
One way would be to use older additions of text books all the extra highlighted words, reorganized pictures and rewritten questions don’t make them easier to learn from or do much more than force the university and students to buy what is essentially the same book over and over again.
An easy way for a student to save is to become an RA at most universities they will give you free board and a pay check.
Go to a community college for the first two years. Also, if interest rates were high, not as many students would take out loans. This would force many Universities to lower their tuition since tution is currently increasing beyond inflation.
Above all, do not spend more than is necessary. Tuition, books, food, a pot to piss in and a window to throw it out of…these are necessary. Some things are not. Fancy clothes, shoes, jewelry, phones, computers? You’re most likely going to end up pawning it all off. Transportation? You can just take a bus or carpool. Studying abroad? A lovely idea, but not if it’s logistically unsound. Dating? Oh, what’s so special about it, anyway?
Of course, you should be proactive in saving and raising money to cut down on your need for loans, such as getting a campus job, applying for all the scholarships, and putting yourself down on the FAFSA as a dependent (living with your parents is not as looked down on as it used to be). But who can deny the importance of abstaining from excessive spending? It’s not just money, but your time is at stake, as well. Take as many credits as possible every semester, and only ones that apply to your degree, so that you’re not in school longer than you have to be, and thus not wasting money and time.
(An easier alternative would be to just not go to college at all, but in the competitive world we live in, that is clearly out of the question, no?)
Apply for as much grants and scholarships as you can. Also work your butt off while your in college and save the money for next year
If you want to make college cheaper/more affordable: there’s a few tips I can give. One, be searching for scholarships all throughout high school. Two, keep your grades up and do well on the SAT. More colleges will be willing to barter if they know they’re getting a high-quality, well-scoring, diligent student. Thirdly, when you’re working, put money aside to help pay for college. Four, look for deals on classes (that don’t NEED to be taken on campus) and college visits, which can get rather pricy. Five, look for on and off college campus jobs. Any little bit helps. Six, buy used books, or rent. Either way is cheaper than new books. Lastly, don’t go using money to buy unnecessary ‘comforts’ or video games. Just focus on success. Other than these seven things, look at other places online: there’s got to be more things to decrease the price of college.
Play baseball, sell my poetry, do laundry at moms house, walk, mow lawns for the elderly, clean the football field after home games.
Apply for multiple scholarships. Don’t try to move out of your parents homes so fast. Apply for financial Aid. Get a job that doesn’t interfere with your studies. And don’t forget to learn how to cook large portions so that you can eat the left overs instead of buying fast food.
NEVER buy your books from the campus bookstore unless you absolutely have to!! Always try Half, Amazon, etc first!!
In order to make college cheaper, I believe that most students can try to organize their own learning class like drawing, foreign language, or designing for money. Most people now like to learn new things, but not pay so much money for it.This idea would be perfect for students who like to interact and help other people.
Different businesses can sponsor students that are willing to finish college. For example, they can pay for the main stuff like books and living quarters.
In my own perspective, college is no where near to be cheap! College is supposed to be expensive due to the fact that it is extraordinary and professional education. However, just because you hear about the cost and tuition fees, doesn’t mean that you should give up on your future. There are some helpful tips and solutions to this:
2) Figure out your talents: Maybe you’re good at sports, or an intellectual, bilangual, etc. Or maybe you’re a disabled person. These factors lead to scholarships of that matter.
Applying for scholarships, submitting your financial information to FASFA, ask what scholarships your colleges offers for you.
How do we go about reducing this problem? What does a non-supported student spend the majority of his funds on just to get by? At least in my location, Monterey, California, the average rented room goes for $600 to $800 dollars, the closer to the school the more expensive. The less expensive the room, the higher the transportation cost.
By purchasing a largish property very near the community college, removing the current low capacity structure and setting up small independent buildings similar to this (without the wheels):
Placing 10 to fifteen of these with a three bathroom permanent structure on such a property would hopefully be able to bring housing costs down to the 300 to 400 range.
Each building would have a small college sized fridge and freezer with a microwave and electric stove top, a bed frame built in, and a desk built in, providing all the necessities. Wifi would be broadcast throughout the property and cameras mounted atop poles would provide surveillance for property damage/criminal activity.
The three bathrooms, likely made of white cement structure, would include a small sink, cheap replaceable mirror, a small cement bench with wood top paneling, and showers.
Students would be required to be receiving financial aid and would be required to pay rent immediately towards housing between financial aid checks with a secured drop-box on-site.
Renting textbooks instead of buying them, walk or ride the bus instead of driving your car, eat at home instead of at school, definitly much cheaper
Rent textbooks, dont live on campus, get alot of scholarships and make sure to buy needs and not wants.
Carpool, dont spend when you dont need to, dont eat out, if possibly go home to do laundry, never stop looking for scholarship opportunities.
Apply for scholarships. If that don’t work, talk to financial aid. Even if they are loans you have to pay back, it will be well worth it in the end as long as you know you are going to college to better yourself and not just for the money.
How do you make college cheaper? Invest a small amount of money every month in a mutual funds account! Then take out money as you need it for supplies.
I’m not in college yet but I’ve been applying for scholarships since I was in the 7th grade…I’m a high school freshman this year. Ways I have been saving for college is by putting all the money I earn from working over the summer into a bank account I can’t pull money out of, also i am still applying for scholarships. Unfortunately, I have yet to win a scholarship.
Keep a change jar/piggy bank and put all of your loose change in it and deposit it into your savings every couple of months
Sell your unused clothes to Plato’s Closet. They are always looking for gently used clothing and you get paid to get rid of the clothes you don’t like.
Shop at the Dollar Store! Just because they do not have name brand items there, does not mean their stuff is not good.
Don’t ask for trivial things for gifts for your birthday/holidays. Ask for things you need like gift cards to the grocery store/gas station, new notebooks, new clothes if you really need it, or trade a big gift for an insurrance payment for that month instead.
work hard at everything! full time student, 2 jobs and a commuter, saving every penny is what counts, weather its putting groceries back on the shelf, or skipping buying a book, or even missing a class to pick up that extra shift at work to make ends meet.
“How to make college cheaper?” I am going to make college cheaper by living with my grandparents, I’m also going to coupon for my groceries, rent my books and use any scholarship money I get.
If your off- campus apartment has a pest problem & is on the shady side of town, who cares?! At least you’re saving money on rent.
You can save money for college by evaluating your spending habits. Finding out what luxury items you can cut back on and sticking closer to what you need to get by.
Well in order to make your college cheaper you should get a job and not spend your money on unnessasary things like expensive clothes, the movies etc. Another idea would be to join dual credit courses you can get a lot of college credits, it will look good on your transcript and best of all its free, during school and it saves you alot of money you would have spent on college classes. And of course apply for as many scholarships as you can.
Buy food for everyone in your dorm/hall for a week and share the costs of the food. Much cheaper than eating out all the time!
Learn how to shop on websites like ebay.com or textbooks.com; there are extremely cheap textbooks, clothes, furniture, etc. you can find online.
Have some dresses, purses, textbooks that you don’t want anymore? Sell some of your junk that you don’t need on ebay!
Use all the things you’ve been learning – go tutor high school or middle school students in the area on weekends. If you’re not interested in teaching academic areas, be someone’s personal coach in a sport.
If your college has many prerequisites, take these prerequisites at a local community college for much cheaper. Use these credits to cut down from the required four years at your university to three or even two.
Avoid borrowing money as much as you can – the interest will build up and cause repercussions in the future.
Aggressively seek jobs or paid internships during the summer or on weekends. Consider taking a work-study.
Research each college before applying – some colleges are known to give more financial aid than others. Some colleges (like Cooper Union or Webb Institute). Also consider colleges in areas where the cost of living is not so high (for example, the cost of living in NYC is extremely high).
Consider getting one or more roommates. If rooming is expensive, sharing a room with others will decrease the amount that you have to pay.
Make the most out of every class!!! Even if this doesn’t make college cheaper necessarily, you will make the most out of what you are spending and increase the chances of finding a good job, earning the amount you want to earn, and paying back all those years of college tuition.
Clip coupons and buy in bulk at the supermarket – you can finish off those cans of Snapple over the next month or two!
Carpool whenever you can. If the bus has a fare, and bikes are too expensive, invest in some roller skates! If you don’t know how to roller skate you can probably learn quickly.
I would make college cheaper by getting scholarships, and I would use less loans as possible. I would watch my spending habits, such as shopping, eating out, and any other non-neccessary spending.
Saving money and earning cash are two main factors that will make college cheaper for me. Saving money for me set a financial standard for myself so that I can always have a way to pay for school supplies if or and tuition. Earning money by having a part-time job and participating in financially beneficial activities are good ways to be progressive in an approach to make college expenses cheaper and more affordable.
1) Walk to school- burn calories for free (no need for a gym); Walking also helps stimulate your brain, which will make you more alert in class, therefore increasing your brain activity, which will, in turn , lead to better grades
3)Join as many clubs as possible- make yourself available (You also meet new friends, which will make you happier, which will improve your self-esteem, which will improve your confidence)
4)Never take alcohol/drugs/smoke- This saves your health- which means you won’t have to pay money for the doctor, and you will live longer
5)Don’t use a car- better for the environment, your weight (car=no exercise), and for your wallet (no need to pay for gas)
7)Eat carrots everyday- which improves your eyesight- no need for glasses- no need to pay for an optometrist.
13) Use a library computer- no need to pay for personal computer- which adds to the electricity bill- which helps save you money
15)Throw out your T.V.- It causes distractions which can cause absent-mindedness, which will curb your study habits, which will decline your GPA, which will curb your chances of getting into a college; TV also uses too much electricity- you can save money on your electric bill, which in turn you will have more money for college
21)Go to bed early and sleep for about 8-10 hours (“Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise”- Ben Franklin) Sleep reduces stress, keeps you happy, keeps you well rested, and makes you smarter- therefore you will get better grades
24) Clothes- borrow your mom’s clothes if you are the same size. Borrow her accessories, purses, and shoes. You save time (from shopping) and money (from shopping)
25)Make your own food- (Borrow a cookbook from the library) – Making your own food- increases creativity which increases brain power, which will make you happier, which will make you healthier, which will help you earn better grades in school- in turn, possibly a college scholarship
Shop at the thrift shop. Only buy the essential laundry supplies. Learn to cook actual meals, you can use cooking skills to get students to pay you or trade something in exchange for your cooking.
There have been many ways that current students or potential students have answered the old question of “how do you make college cheaper?” To make college cheaper I suggest to only borrow as much money that is absolutely necessary to cover the costs of your schooling. Too often students will borrow more than their classes cost. For example, I know of a student who borrowed the maximum allowed for a 3rd year undergraduate, $12,500. This student borrowed the maximum amount and after receiving qualified grants there was $1700 of extra money left over. The student wasted this money often going out to eat, buying clothes, and buying expensive toys such as a 50’inch flat screen tv. Now that the student has finished college the payment on the loans that is required to be paid back is over $400/month. If this student would have only borrowed the minimum amount to cover the classes they would have had a much lesser payment per month. After it was figured out the payments would have been over $120/month cheaper.
LOWER THE COST OF TUITION AND OTHER FEES ( SCHOOLS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE) MOST STUDENTS CANT AFFORD IT, AND LOANS are available but it take YRS to REPAY JUST ONE. also PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH MORE RESOURCES THAT HELP THEM TO SUCCEED, eg… counselors and experts from our field of study to help prepare us for better success.
Not telling the financial aid office there is a mistake on my account and I am not being charged any tuition, and hoping they will never figure it out.
Make sure you do your work and pass all your classes, that way you would not have to worry about getting money to pay for a failed class.
live with your parents or relatives to cut costs on living expenses so you don’t have to pay for dormitories
Take college classes in high school or study/work incredibly hard to pass AP exams in order to earn college credits. The more college credits you earn in high school, the less classes you need to take in college, therefore you may have the ability to graduate earlier, allowing you to enter the workforce even earlier.
Okay, we all can agree when we first go into college we feel “poor”. That is because all of our money goes towards tuition and books. I try to keep it cheap. When I am buying my groceries I aim for the dollar items or the “off-brand” food items. I mean why not it tastes the same, normally the off-brands of anything scare others away. That is one way of keeping money in your wallet. Also, plan out your activities wisely. If you are bored and want to find something to do with your friends, find on-campus activities/events. A lot of the time, those activities are free to attend too. To students living in dorms, there are always free activities by the RA’s that help cure boredom. SCHOLARSHIPS are the key. My parents always told me to apply for as many as I can. Even if you think you will not win one, the more you apply to, the higher the chance you have to win one. My last piece of advice to keep things cheap is whenever you visit home, bring your laundry with you. Yes it is a pain in the butt when you just want to enjoy your time with your friends and family but that way you can wash as many clothes as you want without paying for the laundry machines. Also if you live close enough to school, commuting is the way to go!!! Sadly I do not live close enough where commuting is an option.
Shop at thrift stores! They say one man’s trash is another man’s treasure; plus it’ll save you money.
Open a free savings account and only withdraw money if necessary! (FYI the latest fashion trends are NOT a necessity.)
Post as many reasons for this scholarship as you can think of and ask your friends and family to do the same (since the scholarship is transferable)! Then hope that one of them will be the winner.
Spend time every day looking for scholarships. Get a job during high school to save money for college. Get good grades and be involved in the community (makes you more desirable for scholarships.) Eat less and walk to classes.
Be organized. That way you will be a better student, for potential scholarships, and be a better spender.
Using public transportation to get to school, living with family, and apply, apply, apply for SCHOLARSHIPS!!!
Not going to college or getting a job or sign up for tons of scholarships or just follow your dream and things will turn up just fine
Become very close with the dean of the dept. and hint at the need for more financial aid/scholarships from the dept.
If you sing/play an instrument, play at the mall or a busy corner to earn some cash from some random, kind people.
Get a library card. You’ll never have to buy entertainment- a library has loads of awesome movies and books FOR FREE.
Buy refurbished laptops and phones. They can be just as good as those brand new, but much cheaper. It’ll save you money when it comes to buying new school electronics!
Buy a reliable bike if you live on campus. It’s a lot cheaper than buying gas and keeping a car repaired.
While in high school, take advantage of the advance courses and do AP classes for 9th through 10th grades, after that talk to your counselor about dual enrollment for 11th and 12th grade. All the while be applying for any scholarships possible.
I make college cheaper by taking college level classes in high school. Even though AP classes may be tough and rigorous, they save time and money in college. I consider these classes an investment to my future.
You can make college cheaper by the government threatening to nationalize colleges. Tuitions costs would plummet, students would not have to worry about mortgaging their futures, and the government would cut down on student loan debt. As of now, all those subsidized loans do is add to the national debt load that often won’t be repaid because students become so overwhelmed with their student loans. Down with the coveted liberal arts educations that make students unemployable, and raise up curriculum that actually teaches valuable skills for the field the student wishes to pursue. Obviously there are skeptics (myself included) who say that nationalizing our college education system will create a new version of the common core nonsense currently making its way through secondary education, but if cost cutting is the main priority, then nationalizing is the way to go.
I make college cheaper by living literally 5 minute walk from the college. Saves me money when I’m hungry and less time to rush. Also I live with trusted friends, which makes rent so much cheaper and in cold winter weather we can all carpool since we all go to the same college. I also picked up a part time job for after classes that helps me to get by till summer break when I’m back to working more hours to save for the following year.
Buy international textbooks…even though the print is significantly larger in some countries, the cost can be cut in half.
Be at the top of your game with everything you do in highschool(academic and extracurricular) to get noticed and EARN scholarships!
There are several ways to make college cheaper: stay in a cheaper dorm/at home, find a cheap meal plan, continuously apply for scholarships, and work part time.
Accept the fact you will either never shop or bargain shop at goodwill/thrift stores. Clothes are cheap and many times quite fashionable
Find easy ways to make money, using sites like bing rewards. Do surveys online. Apply to as many scholarships as you possibly can. Try and get a paid internship or a job.
Make college cheaper by planning out your meals for the week. Ready your meals every Sunday and put them in different colored Tupperware! Always have one cheat day; where you go out to a restaurant and eat what you want! Keep applying for amazing scholarships like this one. One more way to make college cheaper is to do your work and take care of your business in the classroom. The faster you do your work, the quicker you can graduate college. More years equals more money that you have to spend. Do your work, get your degree, and be free!
You can make college cheaper by getting a job, saving up money live with your parents,eat at your house instead of eating out .
Have the smallest amount of clothing possible, and only do laundry until your clothing is not fit for public use.
Fill out many scholarships, and submitting a FASFA form each year. simply being dedicated to your studies can make college cheaper.
Spend your time studying, reading, or hanging with schoolmates on the yard to prevent spending any extra cash!!!
You can make your college experiences cheaper/cost less by applying yourself. For example its important that you are proactive when looking for scholarships and other sorts of college funds. But, when it comes to college their is another kind of cost you are paying. You are payig an “opportunity cost.” Not only does college cost you money it also costs you time, and in order to get your “opportunity” cost to go down you need to make the most out of you college experience. whether that be applying yourself in your studies making sure you have strong academics or applying/investing yourself in relationships; networking with people. Overall in order to make college “cheaper” or cost less its important that you apply yourself. Making sure you are pursuing every opportunity to make it work for you whether that be scholarships (and other monetary resources), academics or relationships.
The way you make college cheaper is by applying to a lot of scholarships even if they are small scholarships, you still go for it. You can also live at home to save that money that you will spend living at a college campus. However, if you choose to live on campus make sure to enroll in the Resident Assistant position, to be able to get the dorm free. You can also rent books instead of buying, sometimes others leave notes in them that can help you on whatever you are working on. You can also get a job, that will help you get money for books and tuition. Final one, shop smart, meaning that you should spend your money wisely. Spend money on things that you really need!
Have a meal plan that consists of ramen and the McDonald’s Dollar Menu. Apply for the same classes as someone you know that graduated and use their books. Ride a bike to save gas. Cut your own hair.
One way of saving money as a college student is cutting down on small costs, because as the saying goes “A penny saved is a penny earned!”
Shopping at thrift stores is a great way of finding bargain clothes while having fun treasure-hunting for the perfect outfit.
Many clothes that can be found at thrift stores have little to no stains or holes, and range from stylish and trendy to vintage and old-fashioned. In addition to saving money, many thrift stores, like Goodwill, help others that are in need such as veterans.
Surprisingly, what many people don’t know is that being broke can actually GET you money for college! Who knew?
Many of the most selective colleges and universities award up to the cost of tuition (college attendance cost), room (rent/dorm costs), and board (food costs) to incoming applicants that have significant financial need, such as a household combined income under $60,000/year.
Some of these colleges do expect some form of expected financial contribution to be made on the behalf of the student and/or parents, but thanks to the multitude of scholarships available (in addition to work-study opportunities), this monetary hurdle can be overcome quite easily. Hope this helps!
If you’re having trouble affording college, another helpful way of saving money is by cutting down on your living expenses.
If you are attending a college that is in close proximity to your parents’ house, living at home could save you alot of moolah in laundry, food, and travel/car expenses, on top of all the money you would be saving in dorm or rent costs (not to mention getting to spend some good ol’ quality time with mom and dad).
If living with your parents doesn’t seem like a suitable option, try getting an apartment with a friend, relative, or fellow college student (which would also save you money if you were to carpool to school together).
Not only would you have the freedom that comes with ‘living on your own’, but you would be essentially getting a 50 percent discount on the rent! (or even more savings if you are willing to acquire more roommates). Sacrificing a bit of personal space can pay off, literally!
Another way of saving money for college is doing well academically in high school. By taking AP (Advanced Placement) classes and receiving passing scores on the exams in high school, you won’t have to take those same courses in college (saving you both time and money!)
In addition to AP classes, you can choose to do dual/concurrent enrollment courses at your local community college. In this situation, you can take advanced classes for college credit, and these credits can be transferred to many four-year universities and post-secondary institutions (which, like high school AP classes, can save you a ton in money and time!)
Simply don’t go for the most expensive college; a college that is smaller but still respected and has your interests, go for it! It’ll keep you out of the nightmare of student loans for the rest of your life.
The way that I have so far made college cheaper for myself is by dual enrolling, saving me an entire year of college tuition!
I am making college cheaper for myself by taking dual enrollment classes during my junior and senior year of high school. The tuition is cheaper during high school than college. Instead of paying $213 per credit hour, I am paying $85: a savings of $128! Plus I save on textbook costs because they are free during high school.
I can make college cheaper by living at home while attending community college. This way I can save on room and board by living at home with my parents.
I can make college cheaper by attending a college that my parents graduated from. I can hopefully also save some money by receiving an alumni scholarship.
One way you can make college cheaper is by attending a community college first to get your general education out of the way and then go to a college or university.
Getting scholarships and grants are he ideal way of paying for college. However, some students may not always qualify for them. So, what do we tell these students to do to pay for college? Taking out loans is definitely not the answer. Students can apply for work-study programs, find a job off campus, or live at home while going to college and attend a public university. Tuition in public universities is often significantly lower than in private universities. There is also the option of attending a community college, which often have low tuition rates, for the first two years, then transferring to a public university.
Talk to your guidance counselor and start planning for college. Look for the cheaper options that work for you.
Grow your own food! Get in touch with nature and learn how to preserve your food to help save money.
Ride a bike! If the college is close enough you don’t have to drive. You won’t be paying for gas and you’ll get some exercise.
Work, live, and go to school in relatively the same area so that you won’t have to travel far. You’ll be saving and making money.
If you aren’t going to college close to home then get an apartment with a group of friends and split the cost.
Learning how to cut hair can be a great way to save money for a man. If a man can cut his own hair he could save about $300 a year on that alone! He could also cut his friends hair to make some money on the side.
Becoming an RA can be a good way to save money while in college as an upperclassman. At many universities RA’s are given free or discounted rooms which can save students thousands a year!
Buy generic brand items as they are often times similar to brand name items and and significantly cheaper
5. Scour out school jobs at freshman orientation because none of the upperclassmen will have come back yet to take the jobs.
9. Be an entrepreneur and shovel snow for people in the surrounding around (unless you’re in a place like Florida, where you could mow lawns).
12. Apply to the scholarship for your elementary school…and your middle school…and your high school.
14. Stay focused in high school so when it comes time for college entrance exams, you can test out of some of those basic classes.
First of all, you choose a college that it isn’t going to run you thousands and thousands of dollars in debt. You consider your options and make your decision taking into the account the FINANCIAL aspect of the university and career pathway you’re going with. You don’t go to school for $60,000 a year to get a $40,000 paying job. School expenses and career choices should match up. An education and a bachelor’s degree will be the same anywhere you go. Sometimes you have to sacrifice some things ( or A LOT ) of things so you’re better off in the long run. Additionally, you get your head on straight and make a solid plan. Know where you’re going to get money from , get a job, do research on loans(!), and be prepared. Apply to all scholarships known to man! Just apply, you can’t win any money if you don’t apply. Millions of dollars in scholarships go unclaimed every year because organizations can’t find students to give money to. Are you reading this? They CAN’T find students to give money to! Get off your bum and go help some people get a break on their taxes by giving you money.
Make education cheaper by continuing to apply for scholarships all throughout your four years at college. Cook at home whenever you can, get a job on campus (library, RA, dining hall), and don’t forget that it is always the best idea to rent used textbooks from Amazon instead of buying them used or new! College is a once in a lifetime experience. Make the most of it but don’t let it make the most of your money.
How about saving some extra money for your scholarship by buying a refurbished laptop rather than a new one. That should leave some extra money to pay for fees.
Start by being active in academics and extra activities in your high school. Try your best to have good grades and aim to be your class Valedictorian. By that, you can apply different scholarships to help you go to the college you want with just a cheap tuition. Do community service for backup! But doing your best and applying to a lot of scholarship will make your college cost cheaper
Make college cheaper, keeping my grades up in order to receive more scholarships (or hopefully a full ride!) and more opportunities.
Instead of putting your loose change in the tip jar to get rid of it, put it in a really big piggy bank.
Sell food(chips, drinks, ramen noodles,etc.) and toiletries out of your dorm, or even make clothes and sell them if you’re creative.
3) Do NOT get yourself in trouble, risk your chance even getting into college and then Scholarships would not mean a thing
Make it mandatory to take a college prep class before high school graduation. This class should include a in-depth explanation of the coast of going to college. This class should also require a written out plan of how you will pay for school i.e (scholarships, government funding etc.) This class should also give students the opportunity to give ideas on how to make school cheaper. This plan even though it will change should also be a requirement to get into college. You should be able show your plan and be given a scholarship for maintaining it. Find away to incorporate parents into this specific high school class. It should not be mandatory but offered as extra credit if they can attend. Keeping parents informative will help students make better decisions in college.
Walk everywhere, Exercise will help you stay fit (so you don’t need to spend money on a gym membership)
Use free wifi-hotspots and areas that give you free places to charge your electronics to access textbooks online
You keep applying for scholarships and you make sure you’re doing good academically. You also go ahead and make sure you help your parents in anyway you can so that they will want to help you with college. You apply for fasfa no matter what the income is of your parents. You tweet out to many famous people asking them for retweets on how they can pay for your college!
Pick a college close to home so that you are able to stay with your parents and receive free room and board. Not having to pay rent or buy food will save you lots of money that can then apply towards college fees.
Renting out textbooks is always a cheaper option than paying upwards of 200 dollars for a book you might not even use. If I want new clothes I head down to goodwill or other thrift stores and look around. Going to events and other activities that do not cost money such as camping.
Coupons, coupons, coupons. They can save you so much money, and sometimes if you’re lucky you’ll get a little money back.
Textbooks are required for most college course. Personally, I like to get my books from Amazon ahead of time. This usually allows me to get them around half off if not more. I recommend that you look on amazon or other such sites before getting your books from the campus bookstore. You might be surprised at the deals you could get.
I make college cheaper by doing my laundry at home, attending meetings on campus that provide free food and living off groceries til I go back home.
To make college cheaper one could apply for a ton of scholarships, buy used textbooks, and focus on buying needs instead of wants when living on campus or just commute
Sell your sperm, probably just wasting it anyway. Sell your blood, it’s for a great cause and puts money in your pocket. Scrap all steel, aluminum cans, copper. Great for the environment and you guessed it,$$ cash $$.
You can make college cheaper by using as many used books as possible, selling back books you had no choice but to buy, and apply to as many scholarships as possible. Every bit counts so don’t exclude to smaller scholarships just because they don’t give you big bucks.
Most students want to enjoy their time off on weekends which means spending money on movies, shopping or partying. These activities can be enjoyed with friends from the comfort of your own home or dorm. I would make an effort to seek out free activities in my area as well. Being that I am located downtown, there are many historical sites that can be enjoyed for little to no costs. Searching for inexpensive things to do in close proximity will also mean saving money on gas in the process. Besides these tactics, I think the most forgotten money saver for college students is their student identification card. Personally, I always forget how many places offer discounts so I am making an effort to make sure I visit more places that lookout for the financial wellbeing of students like myself.
Don’t pay for Garbage disposal, just toss your trash in the large bins behind fast food restaurants. No one pays attention to that, especially if you do it at night.
First trust in God and ask him to help you take advantage of all the opportunities, which would be scholarships, that you do not forget to apply for fafsa every year, and, if you can, get an on-campus job.
[…] of fact, one of the top responses that I have received related to CheapScholar’s “How Do YOU Make College Cheaper” challenge has been Ramen […]

The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters are medical interns.

It was YES another long overdue post:) In fact, we had been to many many places over the past weekends up to today but beside the word "busy", nothing can really explain for the slow updating of my blog but BELIEVE me, I am still very passionate in keeping the updates on my this little humble blog, reason being sometime too many things occupy my little head and I tend to forget even a place that we were going or even things that happened just yesterday so the best is still journal it down so that we will be able to appreciate every little memoirs that had happened in our life with the best companion from the family members. Life is short, treasure it and live it meaningfully as you pay a day of your life everydays so make the day worth it by live it to the fullest.
I hope that when one day, I am too old to move about with my children, I will start to read the blog once again from the beginning to the end and I guess this will be the best gifts god presented to me and my life before I embark to another journey..Life Quotes by Jules Renard:As I grow to understand life less and less, I learn to love it more and more.
We went to the Helix Bridge on the 14 May 2010. The Helix Bridge (Chinese: 螺旋桥), previously known as the Double Helix Bridge (Chinese: 双螺旋桥), is a pedestrian bridge linking Marina Centre with Marina South in the Marina Bay area in Singapore. It was officially opened on April 24, 2010 at 9 pm. The bridge is still under construction toward the entrance to the Marina Sand. Next time, we will have direct access from the mainland to the Marina Sand with the bridge. The bridge looks extra captivating at night with the illuminating lights that highlight the double-helix structure, thereby creating a special visual experience for the visitors as you can see from the following photos.
Look at the Q formed at the foreigner's line to get into the Marina Sand's casino whereas for Local/PR's entrance, it only 20-30% of the Foreigner's Line. Free things always get the crowd!!

“We were riding the metro in Istanbul. The train was packed. One minute I had my backpack on, the next it was gone.” Andrew’s co-worker tells us. “We had everything in that bag. Wallets, passports…everything. We ended up being stuck there for nearly a month getting everything sorted out.”
It is clear from the look on his face, that he is going through the whole ordeal in his mind. His eyes are distant and haunted by this memory. It is something that every traveler dreads.
What would you do if this happened to you? Can you afford to withstand that kind of setback, both financially and emotionally?
Honestly, being robbed is usually the last thing that I’m worrying about when we’re traveling. Shoot, I’m pretty much counting to four, every five seconds to just make sure that I haven’t lost one of my kids. Then there’s the fact that at any given moment, three of them are trying to have a conversation with me. Oh, and have I mentioned that I like to take pictures – A LOT? I’ve got to stop and get lots of shots to document these amazing places we’re visiting. Then there are the snacks, drinks, and diapers that we’re hauling around…
See, when you travel as a family, avoiding getting robbed isn’t something you’re thinking about in the moment, it’s something you prepare for long in advance. When you’re out there with the kids, there’s a pretty safe bet that you’re going to be avoiding a lot of the main things that will make you a target for a thief. You are probably avoiding bad parts of town, aren’t out super late at night, and hopefully you’re not getting smashed at the bar each night. However, there is one thing that makes you (and me) a bigger target – you are distracted.
After hearing our friends story about being robbed with his family in Istanbul, we soon learned about PacSafe. They make bags that are specifically designed to be anti-theft. On our recent trips through Prague and Turkey, we got to check out the PacSafe Venturesafe 25L pack. Honestly, unless we need a pack with more technical specifications for something, I’m pretty confident that this will join us on most of our trips in the future. It was just such a relief to know that because we had this pack, we literally were being so much safer. Public transportation didn’t worry me at all, nor did crowded areas (outside of my constant counting to four to make sure I didn’t lose anyone :). It was just one less thing we had to stress about.
Good water bottle pockets on the side that can each hold two small water bottles (honestly, with 4 kids, we always travel with at least 4 so that’s a big deal).
A large pocket that can fit all of the essentials for the day. For us on this trip that meant 6 rain jackets, a guide book, snacks, diapers (see above), and my DSLR camera. Granted, we had to pack that all in carefully, but the thing that counts is that it all fits and we only had to carry ONE bag.
Slashguard wire mesh under the fabric to prevent common “bottom slashing” (where the bottom of your bag is cut, and contents emptied while you are still wearing it).
RFID pocket to keep your passport and credit cards in so your personal info can’t be stolen (RFID theft is becoming very common and it’s eay for a thief to steal your identity with the handy chips now in most passports and credit cards).
This pack retails at $140, which is a little higher than most bags, but I’d say it’s well worth it for the security features.
PacSafe generously provided this bag for our review, but these are our honest opinions, and just what we’d tell our friends.
Undoubtably, there are two stages in a woman’s life that are the most awkward when it comes to shape and size. No, I’m not…
“My husband and I love to ski, but my 5-year-old…. not so much. We took him a couple of times last year and I tried to make it really fun. (Lots and lots of hot chocolate!) This year, he wanted to go at first, took a couple of lessons, then during one lesson he got moved out of his group to a lower level. (He can’t turn on one side, and the other kids were progressing faster) Even though this is totally normal, he took it really hard and now we can’t get him to go at all. Do you have any tips for a reluctant skier? I don’t want to force him, but I would love it if we could all have fun skiing as a family.”
I totally understand. As parents, we naturally want our kids to want the same things we like. I think each of us secretly has in our minds a vision of us doing all of our favorite things, with our incredibly gifted children right by our sides. Reality usually plays out differently than that.
When kids are uncomfortable with something or struggling with it, they usually shy away from it – something that often shows itself as we adventure with the kids. Patience is key in situations like this. However, from one ski loving parent to another, don’t give up! Here are some great tips we’ve come up with to help reluctant skiers everywhere.
As much as you want your kids to be on the snow, keep things light. When they’re young, it’s all about having fun. If it’s not fun, take a break so it doesn’t leave them with a bad taste in their mouth (because your worst nightmare is probably that your kids will really HATE skiing).
Although it’s sometimes a curse, kids short attention spans are fantastic for distracting them. Once they forget that they’re skiing, and just have fun they will likely do better.
We use this tactic every time we ski with Chloe. Yes, EVERY time. Each time we ski, she has a mini-panic attack the first run. She wants to hold our hands, cries a lot, falls down randomly, and somehow skis slower than any human on the planet. It’s frustrating! It’s not that she doesn’t have the skills, but rather a mental block for her. Once we start up a game of tag, or challenge her to a race, she’s usually so caught up in winning that she forgets that she’s actually skiing.
The next time you hit the slopes, let your kids be in charge. Help them choose the most fun trails (like the ones through the trees or with little jumps on them) and let them lead the way if they’re comfortable.
When you relax and start being silly, it does wonders for relieving tension. Throw snowballs at each other, take a break and make snow angels, tell knock-knock jokes, or make silly faces. The more you can do to cut the tension, the better. You’ll relax, they’ll relax and hopefully the day will be full of smiles.
Yes, it’s winter and yes, we’d all like to be ripping some nice powder lines, but your 5 year-old may not see it the same way. Remember that he hasn’t developed your love of skiing yet. It might be good to take some time and do another activity. Something that works for us is to allow everyone a chance to pick the activity with the rule that everyone tries the other persons choice. Ex. Mom chooses snowshoeing one Saturday, son chooses sledding the next week, and Dad chooses skiing the last week. Everyone tries everyone elses activities and feels like things are a little more “fair” this way.
Some children actually have a very difficult time in formal lessons. They feel like they are being measured up against all the peers in their group and this can be stressful. If lessons created part of the problem, take a break from them and just ski for a few days.
Although we’d love to think that children can be intrinsically motivated, bribes sure do a good job of filling in the places where they aren’t! One of our favorites is candy. Each of us carries a roll of Lifesavers (or other small candy) in our pocket and we rely strongly on them to get us through the day. “If you stop crying, you can have a lifesaver on the lift”, “If you can get up by yourself, you can get a lifesaver on the lift”, “If you try this new run, you can get a lifesaver on the lift.” Catch my drift?
If all else fails, get out the best ski movies you can find, and make them watch them all (but maybe not all at once). Throw in some popcorn and make sure to scream and cheer a lot!
Looking for more tips to help kids who don’t want to ski? My amazing friend Brave Ski Mom, addresses the same problem here (and her tips are AWESOME).
I am one of those who are afraid to ski.This is an eye-opener for me. I would like to try to ski now!
One of the great joys of being a parent, is sharing the things that we love with our children. Hopefully this series is inspiring…

The end of an era here in Slovakia has come to an end. It has been a bittersweet ending as I say and receive my good byes from those whom I’ve called friends and family over the last 10.5 years.
I’m overwhelmed by how much your contributions of your prayers and investments have impacted so many across Slovakia. Many have shared how the Lord used me through your support to build His Kingdom, disciple many men, and advance His Gospel through our ministries. So I return with many thanksgivings and praises to the Lord for your faithfulness and partnership!
As I prepare to return to the States this Wednesday, July 10, I would ask you to please pray for the following:
Those Left Behind – Please pray for those I am leaving behind. Pray for strength, wisdom and confidence for them to continue to advance His Kingdom through their lives and ministries.
Transition – It’s going to be really hard. I’m calling this the “year of tears” from mourning the loss of my dad and Savana, and having to say so many good byes here in Slovakia. I am returning to home grieving, and to a mother who is mourning as well. Please pray for strength and for Him to help and lead me through this transition/process.
Community – I’m asking the Lord to provide a healthy community of friends whom I can connect with to live “life-on-life” with each other as I transition back. Please join me in this prayer as I find a place that I can fit in, make some strong friendships, and be encouraged.
Calling – These next three months, I will seek the Lord in what and where He is calling me to for this next season of life/ministry. Please pray for wisdom and discernment.
I look forward to reconnecting with many of you as I continue to serve with Josiah Venture on the stateside recruiting, raising support and awareness of what God is doing in Slovakia .

Going Green is not just a trend. It’s a priority for all of us if we want to continue to live on a beautiful, life-giving planet. Thinking of ways of going green, however, is not always easy. Just because we buy organic food and recycle doesn’t necessarily mean we’re making much of a practical impact. We need to have a whole plan for Going Green. One element in that plan should be buying eco-friendly products or Thai Town. But how do we find eco-friendly products? Well, one way is to buy products made from renewable resources.
Buying products made from renewable resources should be a priority for each of us when going green. These types of eco-friendly products insure that we don’t use earth’s resources too quickly. We need to let our planet replenish it’s natural resources at the same rate as we are consuming them.
1. Paper products- while these should be used sparingly, they are better than plastic in that they are biodegradable and come from renewable trees
6. Bamboo products- bamboo furniture, bamboo cotton clothes, etc. (a good alternative to other tree products, as bamboo is highly renewable because of it’s fast rate of growth)
8. Wind energy- support wind energy development in your city, county, and state; consider getting electricity from wind power at your home.
10. Plant-based cleaners- great products made from renewable resources to help you in going green and healthier for your body
1. Plastics- while renewable plastics are being researched, currently plastics are made from petroleum a non-renewable resource
2. Many paper cups and plates- while the paper is renewable, the plastic coating is from petroleum and makes the product take about 500 years to biodegrade
3. Wood in furniture or other products from old-growth rainforests- while these are technically renewable, the amount of carbon released into the environment and the incredibly slow rate at which they replenish themselves makes them for all practical purposes non-renewable and definitely not eco-friendly products.
4. Energy from oil and coal- gasoline products and coal-based energy are highly non-renewable; unfortunately, much of our electricity currently comes from coal. Consider the switch to solar or wind energy in your home as your first big step in going green.
So continue on the path to going green by changing your purchasing habits. Decide to buy products made from renewable resources.
Because toxicity has become a way of life, and we must breath and eat, we are continuously exposed to pesticides and pollutants, some stored right under our kitchen sinks, says a report from the Silent Spring Institute in Newton, Mass., and the Harvard University School of Public Health.
The study was published last October in Environmental Science & Technology, Sedona, Ariz., naturopath doctor Teresa Dale, Ph.D. says "demonstrates that we are exposed daily to a wide array of chemicals that affect our hormone systems." Chemicals like phthalates and alkyphenois may heighten the risk of hormone-linked diseases like breast cancer and testicular cancer.
To limit your exposure, "read labels carefully, use nontoxic cleaning products and avoid using indoor pesticides," says Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Dave Dergan. There are nontoxic cleaning products and pesticides right in your kitchen. If you have baking soda, white vinegar, borax, and rubbing alcohol in your pantry and bathroom, you have the basic ingredients to make your own cleaning products and pesticides that don't cost you an arm and a leg. I have included formulations for making your own products from these items and many more at the end of this article.
There are plenty of effective, earth-safe cleaners that you can buy or make. Using these alternatives will reduce the toxic burden in your house and environment. By switching to environmentally friendly cleaners protects your health and that of the community you live in while reducing air, water, and ground pollution.
I bet you are asking yourself, "So why isn't everybody doing it?" There are very few people who actually read the labels of the products they purchase and even fewer who know the impact these chemicals can have on our bodies. Most people do not take the time or have the time to research the chemicals that go into these products.
Not all "green" products are created equal, some have simply added essential oils to make it smell like the formula has changed. "You need to read the labels carefully to check for irritating chemicals, such as chlorine, ammonia and artificial fragrances and dyes," says Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., a preventive-medicine specialist in Tucson, Arizona. "Buy cleaners from health-food stores or retailers specializing in environmentally friendly products."
"Eco-friendly cleaning and laundry products are the next frontier of environmentalism," says Marci Zaroff, former publisher of Macrocosm and CEO of Under the Canopy, an organic fabric clothing company. "It's an inexpensive, easy and effective way to protect our planet and commitment to life."
* CITRUS OIL; sold in health-food stores and home improvement stores, fills rooms with the smell of oranges and is far more pleasing to your nose (unless you like the smell of hospitals).
To clean or polish wood floors, dilute 1 c. of citrus oil in one gallon of hot water, and mop with a sponge. For floors that are greasy, simply use a stronger solution. You can also clean kitchen counters and tabletops with this solution. Citrus doesn't strip the protective sealants. On porous surfaces like marble or granite, only use diluted oil and it should never be allowed to sit on a surface, always wipe it dry when finished.
* TEA TREE, THYME AND LAVENDER ESSENTIAL OILS: these have been proven to have more antiseptic in some studies than phenol, the most common chemical disinfectant. Many disinfectants contain chlorine, which reacts with organic matter in drinking water to produce potentially carcinogenic trihalomethane.
To make a natural disinfectant mix 20 drops of one of the above mentioned essential oils and 1 cup of water in a spray bottle. Apply and let sit for 15 min. or until dry.
You can use it to clean your tubs, sinks, countertops in the kitchen and bath. Combine 3/4 c. baking soda, 1/4 c. of borax and enough diswashing liquid to make a smooth paste or if you prefer a pleasant smell, add 1/4 t. lemon juice to the paste. Pour down your sink drain to deorderize and to unclog your drains you put 1/2 cup of baking soda in drain and add a cup of vinegar, wait 30min. and pour hot water down drain. I use this method once a month on all the drains in the house to keep them clear.
*BORAX: Borax, like it's close relative, boric acid, has relatively low toxicity levels, and is considered safe for general household use, but the powder can be harmful if ingested in sufficient quantities by young children or pets. Keep it out of their reach. Borax is toxic to plants, so in the yard be very careful when applying borax onto or near soil. It doesn't take much to leach into the ground to kill off nearby plants and prevent further growth.
But it is great for rubbing out heavy sink stains, even rust in your stainless steel or porcelain sinks. Make a paste of 1 cup of borax and 1/4 cup of lemon juice, put some of the paste on a cloth or sponge and rub it into the stain, then rinse with running warm water, the stain should wash away with the paste.
You can also remove mildew from upholstery and other fabric by soaking a sponge in a solution of 1/2 cup of borax dissolved in 2 cups of water, and rubbing it into the affected areas. Let it soak in for several hours until the stain disappears, then rinse well. To remove mildew from clothing, soak it in a solution of 2 cups of borax in 2 quarts of water.
Want a way to clean your toilet bowl and leave it sparkling white without those dangerous fumes? Use a stiff brush to scrub it using a solution of 1/2 cup of borax mixed with a gallon of water.
VINEGAR: Vinegar is known as nature's most practical liquid and is so versatile that you can use it in the kitchen and bath, laundry and garden, housecleaning and car cleaning, even pet care and personal care.
Damp mopping with a mild vinegar solution is widely recommended as a way to clean wood and no-wax vinyl or laminate flooring. Be sure to check with the manufacturer of the flooring because even when diluted vinegar's acidity can ruin some floor finishes, and too much water will damage most wooden floors. But if you want to try vinegar on your floors, use 1/2 cup white vinegar mixed in 1 gallon warm water. You may want to start with a trial application in an inconspicuous area. Before applying the solution, squeeze out the mop thoroughly (or just use a spray bottle to moisten the mop head).
To liven up dull wood paneling, mix 2 cups warm water, 4 tablespoons white or cider vinegar, and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a container, give it a couple of shakes and apply with a clean cloth. Let it soak in for several minutes, then polish with a dry cloth.
To keep your computer, printer, and other home office gear clean and dust free, dampen a clean cloth in equal parts white vinegar and water, squeeze it out well and start wiping. Before you start, make sure that your equipment is shut off, and never use a spray bottle; you don't want to get liquid on the circuits inside. Have a few cotton swabs on hand for getting into tight spaces (like between the keys of your keyboard).
To make a scratch on a wooden tabletop much less noticeable, mix some distilled or cider vinegar and iodine in a small jar and paint over the scratch with a small artist's brush. Use more iodine for darker woods; more vinegar for lighter shades.
To remove white rings left by wet glasses on wood furniture, mix equal parts of vinegar and olive oil and apply it with a soft cloth while moving with the wood grain. Use another clean, soft cloth to shine it. To get white water rings off leather furniture, dab them with a sponge soaked in full-strength white vinegar.
For the great outdoors, vinegar can get rid of bugs and ants or you can use it as an insect repellent and clean you outdoor furniture and decks.
Pour equal parts white vinegar and water into a spray bottle and spray it on anthills and around areas where you see ants. Ants hate vinegar, and it won't take long for them to move on. Also, you can spray picnic and children's play areas to keep ants away. If you have lots of anthills, pour full strength vinegar over them.
Going camping or fishing? Here's an old army trick to keep away ticks and mosquitoes: About three days before you leave, start taking 1 tablespoon cider vinegar three times a day. Continue throughout your outing and you just might return home without a bite.
Before resorting to bleach to remove mildew on your deck or your patio furniture, try these milder vinegar-based solutions.
*Keep full-strength white vinegar in a spray bottle and use it wherever you see mildew. The stain will wipe right off must surfaces, and the vinegar will keep it from coming back for a while.
*Remove mildew from wood decks and wood patio furniture by sponging them off with a solution of 1 cup ammonia, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and 1/4 cup baking soda in 1 gallon water. Use an old toothbrush to work the solution into tight spaces.
*To deodorize and inhibit mildew growth on outdoor plastic mesh furniture and patio umbrellas, mix 2 cups white vinegar and 2 tablespoons dishwashing liquid in a bucket of hot water. Use a soft brush to work it into the grooves of the plastic and for scrubbing seat pads and umbrella fabric. Rinse with cold water; then dry in the sun.
RUBBING ALCOHOL: Be sure to not confuse denatured alcohol with rubbing alcohol. Denatured alcohol to ethanol (drinking alcohol) to which poisonous and foul-tasting chemicals have been added to render it unfit for drinking. Often, the chemicals used in denatured alcohol are not ones you should put on your skin. Rubbing alcohol is made of chemicals that are safe for skin contact, most often it's 70 percent isopropl alcohol and 30 percent water.
Ticks hate the taste of rubbing alcohol as much as they love the taste of your dog. Before you pull a tick off Fido, dab the critter with rubbing alcohol to make it loosen its grip. Then grab the tick as close to the dog's skin as you can and pull it straight out. Dab again with alcohol to disinfect the wound. This works on people too.
The problem with ice packs is they won't conform to the shape of the injured body part. Make a slushy conformable pack by nixing 1 part rubbing alcohol with 3 parts water in a self-closing plastic bag. The next time that sore knee acts up, wrap the bag of slush in a cloth and apply it to the area.
This is just the tip of iceberg of ways to use eco-friendly products that you can make yourself. I have used most of these recipes for the past 10 years. They cost next to nothing to make and the results are fabulous. I use olive oil and vinegar to clean my furniture and I don't have to dust again for a month. The solution seems to repel dust, just mix the olive oil and vinegar like you would for a salad dressing.
Eco-friendly technology (also known as sustainable technology) is a means of taking energy and converting it into usable power such as electricity, home heating, and so on... but from renewable resources which do not harm the environment. In other words, utilizing resources such as solar power which is constantly renewable, as opposed to burning off fossil fuels which only gets consumed without the source being renewed, and just adds to the growing carbon footprint we are stomping upon the Earth. What are some of these resources and how can we use them today? Let's take a look...
One kind of eco-friendly technology, as mentioned above, is solar energy. Since its big boom of popularity in the seventies, the energy output of photovoltaic cells ("solar panels") has greatly increased, along with the efficiency of its production, from more efficient and less expensive materials. Where it used to cost many thousands of dollars decades ago to cover a small home's roof with an array of solar panels to power most of the homes appliances, being only able to pay for itself many years down the road, these days people are spending less than a couple hundred dollars on cheaply procurable components to build a single solar panel on a weekend project to power a handful of appliances on the single panel alone.
Another type of eco-friendly technology involves the use of geothermal power. By driving a network of pipes into the ground below a house's foundation and running water through them, the heat from the Earth is transferred into the water which is then pumped through the house. This heated water provides the home with hot water and can also be converted into usable electricity through the use of heat exchangers and heat pump generators. This type of energy extraction from the surrounding environment is also utilizing a renewable resource, as the heat taken is constantly being provided by the sun as the Earth stores it day by day. It could actually be considered a solar-geothermal system at work here.
One final eco-friendly technology type we can look at here is wind power. There are many homes today which are fully powered by one or two windmill powered electricity generators, hooked up to battery cells much like those used for forklifts in order to store the surplus electricity generated and regulate the flow of it for constant in-home use for appliances and heating or air-conditioning equipment. These are just a few of the many ways in which we can take free energy from the surrounding environment in order to benefit from what nature gives us in constant supply, instead of relying upon the burning of fossil fuels which only get consumed and return pollution to the Earth and its environments.

Decolonising solidarity: how to not be accidentally annoying and racist when working with Indigenous people August 30, 2015
Recent protests from a subset of AFL fans and a handful of retired non-Aboriginal sportsmen that the anti-Adam Goodes booing is not racist has had me thinking how something very similar has been known to play out between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal activists, including some environmental activists/campaigners.

If you’re a business owner, you know finding help in this day and age is tough. Really tough. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at Elektra Rose. She’s a waitress at a small sandwich shop…and she loves her customers. Especially her African-American customers! The problem? They’re not “her customers” — they’re the boss’s customers — and Boss Man isn’t happy. In fact, today’s might be Elektra’s last day on the job. “Please sir, don’t fire me! I’ll do whatever it takes to keep my job!” Even though she’s never experienced the thrill of a gang bang, Elektra’s a slut for the black man! The Bulls know this. So, lock the front door, pull the window shades, and put this Snowbunny Slut to the test! The Bulls are gonna run a train, and they’re gonna warm up by using Elektra’s eager mouth. After they’re done skull fucking her, The Bulls are going to pull her waitress skirt up over her full hips and bend her over one of the tables. After the doggy train, the fellahs lay Elektra down on her back, where two of the Bulls unload directly into her pink cunt. “But I’m not on birth control!” No matter! There’s one more load tossed on her face, before she swallows a couple more. Oh…and if you’re wondering, Elektra kept her job.

The long shaded border on the north side of St. Botolph's Church, opposite the Sessions House, has been given a further makeover following the intervention of the Boston in Bloom team.
Following a plea in 2016 from The Stump's fabric manager, Angie Kisby, the moss-covered border was cleared and sown with an urban bee mix. This year three species of ferns have been introduced to complement the wildflowers which are now showing through. Angie and Trevor from St. Botolph's Church were joined in the rain by Alison, Paul and Sheila from the Bloom team to plant the 120 ferns.
The three species of fern - ostrich fern, hart's tongue fern and hard shield fern - were selected for their tolerance to shade and will feature on the Boston in Bloom judging tour in July. They will also provide an attractive feature for delegates when The Stump plays host to the RHS East Midlands in Bloom regional awards on 13 September.
Chairman of Boston in Bloom, Alison Fairman, said: "Planting in the rain was made fun with our Stump friends. It has been a delight to work in this historic environment and the ferns should thrive in the shadow of St. Botolphs."
The new fern planting complements the two large bell shaped flower beds on the other side of The Stump which have been carved out of the turf and planted with hundreds of viola and daffodils.

Rand Paul had his best debate moment Tuesday when he challenged Marco Rubio on his plans to increase defense spending by $1 trillion.
"You cannot be a conservative if you’re going to keep promoting new programs you’re not going to pay for," said Paul.
"There are radical jihadists in the Middle East beheading people and crucifying Christians. The Chinese are taking over the South China Sea. … the world is a safer and better place when America is the strongest military power in the world."
Having called for the U.S. Navy to confront Beijing in the South China Sea, and for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria that Russian pilots would enter at their peril, Rubio seems prepared for a confrontation with either or both of our great rival nuclear powers.
Dismissing Vladimir Putin as a "gangster," Marco emerged as the toast of the neocons. Yet the leading GOP candidate seems closer to Rand.
Donald Trump would talk to Putin, welcomes Russian planes bombing ISIS in Syria, thinks our European allies should lead on Ukraine, and wants South Korea to do more to defend itself.
Uber-hawk Lindsey Graham did not even make the undercard debate. And though he and John McCain are the most bellicose voices in the party, they appear to be chiefs with no Indians.
Still, it is well that Republicans air their disagreements. For war and peace are what the presidency is about.
Since WWII, there have been five elected GOP presidents: Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, Bush I and Bush II. Only Bush II could be called a compulsive interventionist.
Ike ended Truman’s war in Korea and kept us out of Indochina after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu. He ordered the Brits, French and Israelis out of Suez after they had attacked Egypt in 1956. He gave us 7 years of peace and prosperity.
Nixon pledged to end the US war in Vietnam, and did. And as Ike invited the Butcher of Budapest, Khrushchev, to visit the United States, Nixon invited Brezhnev, who had crushed the Prague Spring.
Nixon became the first Cold War president to visit the USSR, and famously ended decades of hostility between the United States and the China of Chairman Mao.
Reagan used military force only three times. He liberated the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada from Marxist thugs who had murdered the prime minister and threatened US medical students.
He put Marines in Lebanon, a decision that, after the massacre at the Beirut barracks, Reagan regretted the rest of his life. He bombed Libya in retaliation for Moammar Gadhafi’s bombing of a Berlin discotheque full of US troops.
Though they were the foremost anti-Communists of their era, Nixon and Reagan negotiated historic arms agreements with Moscow.
Reagan did send arms to aid anti-Communist rebels in Angola, Afghanistan and Nicaragua, but never confronted Moscow in Eastern Europe, even when Solidarity was crushed in Poland.
George H.W. Bush sent an army of 500,000 to expel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, but ordered those US troops not to enter Iraq itself.
When the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Empire collapsed and the USSR disintegrated, Bush I played the statesman, refusing to exult publicly in America’s epochal Cold War triumph.
After 9/11, came the invasion and remaking of Afghanistan in our image, the "axis of evil" address, the march to Baghdad, the expansion of NATO to Russia’s doorstep, and the global crusade for democracy "to end tyranny in our world."
Result: The Republicans lost both houses of Congress in 2006 and the White House in 2008 when John ("We are all Georgians Now!") McCain was routed by a liberal Democrat who had opposed the war in Iraq.
With the exception of Rand and Trump, the GOP candidates appear to believe the road to the White House lies in resurrecting the attitude and policies of Bush II that cost them the White House.
From Marco and other voices on stage one hears: Tear up the Iran deal. Confront Putin. Establish a no-fly zone over Syria. Assad must go. Send offensive weapons to Kiev. More boots on the ground in Iraq and Syria. Send US troops to the Baltic and warships to the Black Sea. Confront China in the Spratlys and South China Sea.
Responding to that audience in Milwaukee, most GOP candidates appear to have concluded that bellicosity and bravado are a winning hand in the post-Obama era.
Yet, those nationalist strongmen Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping do not seem to me to be autocrats who are likely to back down when told to do so by Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush or Carly Fiorina.

One would think that the so-called “Global War on Terror”, which has been given fresh impetus by the Paris attacks, must be going swimmingly. What else could explain the great enthusiasm with which it is pursued? It may be recalled that it started in earnest after the WTC attack – also a declaration of war, as it was put at the time.
As is often the case when Islamist fundamentalists strike, the actual attackers immolated themselves on occasion of the attack itself, making it impossible to exact retribution. Except by proxy, that is. This was playing right into the hands of those who had planned the attacks. It seems to us that they have ultimately succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Not to put too fine a point to it, our wise political leaders have evidently been outfoxed by a bunch of turbaned cave dwellers and goat buggerers in the Hindu Kush.
To wit, between 2013 and 2014, the global death toll from terrorist attacks has increased by yet another 80%, setting a new sad record. So 15 years of bombing places far and wide to smithereens, engaging in extremely costly “nation building” exercises, droning assorted terrorist groups so thoroughly that selected Al Qaeda leaders can by now boast of having been killed up to 17 times (only to miraculously reappear again), have produced this by way of bottom line results:
The result to date of 15 years of “Global War on Terrorism” – there is more terrorism than ever before – click to enlarge.
This is eerily reminiscent of the US government’s “War on Poverty”, which stopped the decline in poverty dead in its tracks the moment it began, or the even worse effort known as the “War on Drugs”, which has done nothing to decrease the drug epidemic, but has given birth to the largest and most brutal criminal cartels the world has ever seen. Can people really be that stupid? Unfortunately the answer is yes, they can. This is only half of the answer though.
Death by terrorism in 2014. Not a single Western country even makes the list (and even now, France would not make it). The biggest number of victims can be found in places like Iraq and Nigeria. Boko Haram has killed even more people than ISIS in 2014 (the deaths in Iraq are not exclusively attributable to IS) – click to enlarge.
The other half of the answer has been already been supplied decades ago by the legendary Smedley Butler: War is a racket. However, most people are blissfully unaware of how big a racket it actually is. It is in fact the greatest scam ever – even the more recent “climate change” scam is comfortably put in the shade by it.
Why are all Republican presidential candidates (apart from two exceptions) and Democratic front-runner Billary alike loudly screeching for more war, in spite of the sobering evidence? When confronted with such seemingly intractable questions, it is usually a good idea to follow the money. Should the mafia be aware of the associated statistics, it is presumably green with envy. Readers should definitely take the time to read Tom Engelhardt’s recent article “It’s a $cam” in its entirety. Below we are presenting just a handful of morsels from the first few paragraphs:
“Let’s begin with the $12 billion in shrink-wrapped $100 bills, Iraqi oil money held in the U.S. The Bush administration began flying it into Baghdad on C-130s soon after U.S. troops entered that city in April 2003. Essentially dumped into the void that had once been the Iraqi state, at least $1.2 to $1.6 billion of it was stolen and ended up years later in a mysterious bunker in Lebanon. And that’s just what happened as the starting gun went off.
It’s never ended. In 2011, the final report of the congressionally mandated Commission on Wartime Contracting estimated that somewhere between $31 billion and $60 billion taxpayer dollars had been lost to fraud and waste in the American “reconstruction” of Iraq and Afghanistan.
In Iraq, for instance, there was that $75 million police academy, initially hailed “as crucial to U.S. efforts to prepare Iraqis to take control of the country’s security.” It was, however, so poorly constructed that it proved a health hazard. In 2006, “feces and urine rained from the ceilings in [its] student barracks” and that was only the beginning of its problems. When the bad press started, Parsons Corporation, the private contractor that built it, agreed to fix it for nothing more than the princely sum already paid.
Typically enough, the Khan Bani Saad Correctional Facility, a $40 million prison Parsons also contracted to build, was never even finished.
And why stick to buildings, when there were those Iraqi roads to nowhere paid for by American dollars? At least one of them did at least prove useful to insurgent groups moving their guerrillas around (like the $37 million bridge the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built between Afghanistan and Tajikistan that helped facilitate the region’s booming drug trade in opium and heroin).
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) hired an American nonprofit, International Relief and Development (IRD), to oversee an ambitious road-building program meant to gain the support of rural villagers. Almost $300 million later, it could point to “less than 100 miles of gravel road completed.” Each mile of road had, by then, cost U.S. taxpayers $2.8 million, instead of the expected $290,000, while a quarter of the road-building funds reportedly went directly to IRD for administrative and staff costs. Needless to say, as the road program failed, USAID hired IRD to oversee other non-transportation projects.”
The article continues in this vein and believe it or not, the above was just the harmless stuff. It becomes even more absurd as one reads on. Not only do the numbers become ever more staggering, the failures become concomitantly greater and more bizarre (such as the $43 million compressed natural gas station in Afghanistan, similar to one built in neighboring Pakistan for $300,000, located in an area bereft of infrastructure capable of delivering natural gas; or the $8.4 billion pumped into an Afghan “drug eradication program”, which was followed by a hitherto unbroken string of record opium harvests).
That is however not all. Even more astounding is the fact that most of the individuals who demonstrably bear personal responsibility for these cases of fraudulent theft of taxpayer funds have not only not been sanctioned, but have in fact been rewarded and promoted. As Engelhardt puts is:
“In short, there turns out to be much good fortune in the disaster business, a fact which gives the whole process the look of a classic swindle in which the patsies lose their shirts but the scam artists make out like bandits.”
We have long had a cynical view of government and its endless follies and outrages. There is little that can surprise us anymore. We must confess though that the sheer size and audacity of this racket still manages to impress us.
The war on terror is the best racket yet – it is a gift that will likely keep on giving for a very long time. It possesses a certain fateful inevitability: Western governments go about poking assorted hornet’s nests, until the hornets come swarming out to sting us, providing fresh reasons to expand the war.
This is not meant to imply that one shouldn’t defend oneself against terrorism, but it might be a good idea to reevaluate the strategy (as Justin Raimondo noted, at this juncture, simply quarantining IS may be worth considering). Doing more of what clearly hasn’t worked so far is certainly likely to keep the above mentioned racket going, but based on the evidence it isn’t going to achieve much else.
The conflict in Syria specifically has been characterized by miscalculations galore. It seems everybody is finally realizing that IS may be more of a threat than was hitherto assumed. As a number of governments in the region that are allied with the West have found out, they are in a situation akin to that the sorcerer’s apprentice found himself in. The spirits they have summoned are now ignoring their commands – and they can no longer get rid of them.
Arab potentates aren’t the only ones in the region beginning to wonder what they have cultivated next door in their eagerness to see Syrian tinpot despot Assad toppled. Even the Grand Poobah of Turkey has recently begun to sound a bit worried.
As an aside to all this, Abdel Hamid Abaaoud (born in Belgium, natch), the suspected mastermind of the Paris attacks, seems blessed with an extraordinary amount of luck. He keeps getting caught, but manages to escape every time. He enjoys freedom of movement all over the show, in spite of having starred in truly gruesome IS videos, meaning he’s not exactly Mr. Anonymous. Some people are beginning to wonder how this is possible, since Allah seems highly unlikely to have anything to do with it, contrary to Abaaoud’s claims. It smells of state support actually.
Meanwhile, Deep State representatives are once again sensing an opening. They have already reiterated their nonsensical, nay, downright dangerous demand to do away with encryption on a “just trust us” basis (see the assessment of cyber-security specialist Brian Krebs here). The idea is totally hare-brained, i.e., par for the course for government bureaucrats.
And wouldn’t you know, it’s all Edward Snowden’s fault, for having provided proof of the unconstitutional misdeeds of certain spook agencies. Presumably he has magically caused the French authorities to ignore warnings about the terrorists and the planned attacks they received from at least three different foreign intelligence services by inundating them with his traitor-rays from Moscow.
Finally, in an exceedingly amusing development, Vladimir Putin appears to have morphed overnight from pariah and enemy du jour to the “go to man”/ “hottest ticket in town” on fighting IS (or the “problem solver who cannot be ignored”, as the FT averred). Not that he is doing anything different – he is also poking the hornet’s nest and getting stung in return. However, everybody knows he is different in at least one respect.
As we remarked to a friend recently, whatever one thinks of Putin, it is clear that he is an implacable enemy of Islamist radicals. The Chechen war stands as a monument to his Machiavellian ruthlessness in dealing with such people. So-called collateral damage definitely wasn’t on his mind much. In order to pacify the place, he simply ordered his military to raze the capital Grozny. Once Grozny was reduced to sufficiently small pieces of rubble, the army combed the surrounding landscape and shot everything that moved funny. Then a sort of local mafia boss was installed as the new governor, to ensure the place remained pacified.
We suspect though that the Middle East is a different kettle of fish though. Restoring something akin to the decades of pan-Arab nationalist oppression seems a highly dubious proposition. Too much has happened, and the place is packed with armed groups that will continue to be at each other’s throats no matter what.
Putin is merely acting in line with old KGB traditions though. Here is an excerpt from a 20 year old newspaper report on how the KGB treated Islamist kidnappers aligned with Hezbollah who had taken Soviet diplomats hostage in Lebanon and had made the mistake of killing one of them:
“The incident began when four Soviet diplomats were kidnapped last September by Muslim extremists who demanded that Moscow pressure the Syrian government to stop pro-Syrian militiamen from shelling rival Muslim positions in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli. The militiamen, the Jerusalem paper said, did not cease their attacks, and the body of one of the Soviet diplomats, Arkady Katkov, was found a few days later in a field in Beirut.
The KGB then apparently kidnapped and killed a relative of an unnamed leader of the Shi’ite Hezbollah (Party of God) group, a radical, pro-Iranian group that has been suspected of various terrorist activities against Western targets in Lebanon.
Parts of the man’s body, the paper said, were then sent to the Hezbollah leader with a warning that he would lose other relatives in a similar fashion if the three remaining Soviet diplomats were not immediately released. They were quickly freed.
The newspaper quoted “observers in Jerusalem” as saying: “This is the way the Soviets operate. They do things – they don’t talk. And this is the language Hezbollah understands.”
G 20 meeting – Putin the rediscovered “problem solver”. As an old KGB hand, he can at least be relied on to be utterly ruthless when combating Islamic extremists.
Of course there remain differences over Assad’s fate, but they may be smaller than appears on the surface. Parhaps Syria will end up partitioned at some point, with Assad’s Alawite clan controlling the part that contains Russia’s Mediterranean port.
It seems it is high time for a strategic rethink in the GWoT, but powerful forces are arrayed against it. Apart from the fact that a truly huge racket is at stake, the situation is also reminiscent of the proverbial guy with the hammer – everything looks like a nail to him. So we should reasonably expect more of the same, only in even grander style (as the so-called “surge” has shown, any successes tend not only to be temporary, but have a habit to soon give way to even greater disasters).
At least we can all be comforted by recent news that there is no reason to worry about the euro zone. As Mish relates, Keynesian economist Nouriel Roubini has rediscovered the broken window fallacy by arguing that the Paris attacks will “help the euro zone economy”. What is it with these geniuses? Paul Krugman has made similar arguments after the WTC attack and the Katrina hurricane. Obviously, it would be best if we just nuked all our cities. We’d have growth out the wazoo!
However, this is perhaps less surprising than it should be. No-one can accuse Keynesians (regardless which prefixes adorn them by way of sect differentiation, i.e., New, neo-, post-,…) of being founts of economic literacy. After all, their master thought aimless ditch digging and pyramid building were viable “economic policies”.

As the Marketing Coordinator for a real estate startup and a thorough knowledge of the real estate industry, a new door in my career opened up. I clearly saw the importance of combining both understandings and I started to develop my own real estate SEO strategies “for free”.
Today, with this new knowledge, I can finally share with my fellow realtors the importance on how to do their own marketing campaigns effectively, but most importantly, at no cost.
What follows, is a real estate SEO guide for real estate professionals. I also know the importance of making informed marketing decisions, and because of that, I want to help you close the gap between you and Real Estate SEO.
According to the National Association of Realtors, 90% of buyers start their real estate search online. Real estate SEO is vital for a successful online presence. For both, brokers and agents, higher rankings in the search engines translate into significant sales increases; specially when the real estate market is rising. In the end, whether the market is doing good or really bad, a good real estate SEO campaign will always keep your sales stable.
The real challenge for SEO is that agents compete against one another, yet they are united as “team members” under large brokerage firms. To better understand the challenges of SEO, we first need to understand what creates them. Agents rely on the combination of a few things like: brand recognition from their agency, personal branding, and social media presence to drive new business and close more deals.
Also, real estate agents often target specific communities or condo buildings. They often try to showcase themselves as the experts on specific buyer’s needs and wants or demographics. A few examples would be: Foreign National buyers, First time home buyers or Luxury waterfront properties.
Real estate SEO has become very complex due to the very nature of the industry. Additionally, real estate websites can be large due to the high level of functionality and ability to search, which is needed to appeal to prospect clients.
To add more challenges, keyword competition in real estate websites is extremely high. All real estate professionals are competing for the same keywords. Many SEO companies prey on uninformed agents and over promise results that can’t be traced. These companies offer expensive monthly programs that promise high rankings in keywords that won’t deliver any results.
As a result of SEO scammers, new technology has been developed to help realtors and agencies to help their SEO ranking, without the help of an “SEO expert”.
I will not get into techniques for SEO or link building. Instead, I will give you tips and techniques that target common problems that I see with real estate websites.
There are other real estate SEO tools like WordPress plugins and widgets. They are great tools that teach you how to comply with Google requirements and the way to structure a perfect blog. We strongly suggest to always develop your websites and write your blogs on WordPress. Google loves this platform because of it’s ability to keep up with the search engines’ algorithms.

The weather in the Greater Boston area is signalling the end of summer and start of fall. Within a day we went from 80s to 70s and now, about a week later, we're in the 60s with a frost anticipated for some northern areas tonight.
With the seasonal change comes budget changes for organizations on certain types of funding (funding cycle of Oct-Sept for many) and that means shifting resources to maintain services. Sometimes it means changing services and it invariably means a rethinking/revisiting how well we are meeting our mission.
This year starts our particularly rough for many. Funding has been reduced for a great many organizations and programs. Fuel Assistance this year has a $400 maximum unless more funds are approved legislatively; that's not even one tank of oil! More and more people are unemployed but out of UI (Unemployment Insurance) funds. Companies are practicing the illegal but hard-to-prove craft of not hiring older workers or not hiring workers who have been unemployed for more than 6 months. There's even a petition someone started on the Internet to pressure Monster and CareerBuilder from accepting job postings that state the employer wants someone who is "currently employed." I haven't seen those job ads, but I'm not job searching. If I were, and if this is true, I'd be plenty angry.
As the colder weather moves in and makes things even more difficult for the poor and homeless, we can do something.
Urge our federal legislators to pass our message along to the Super Committee that they must also focus on revenue generation and not just try to cut back on programs and services.
If we think, engage, and work together, we should be able to make a difference in our communities. Those who are served by our efforts need our help.
I haven't posted lately because I've been holding onto some information that changes quite a bit of how my time will be spent at work. Now that it's closer to the transition, I can speak a bit about it.
For the past two years, I've been in a split job working 4 days/week working with consumers who need public benefits; either help with the application process or, more and more these days, help with advocacy when their applications are not processed properly or promptly or are outright mishandled. The other day I devoted to financial literacy education and taxes (VITA). During tax season, the job split to 3:2 so I had a second day for taxes. But it is difficult to split your time like this, especially when those 8 or 16 hours don't all occur on the same day and you try to balance how much time you are devoting to projects that require more time than you have available. Complicating this is the evening hours that 2nd piece of my job entails.
As of October 1st, I'll have only the one job, managing financial literacy, VITA, working more closely with the IDA program (Individual Development Accounts), and employment-related programming/services in our technology center.
I'm glad my patience has been rewarded with this shift. If you want to help people get out of poverty, they need to develop assets. This comes under the umbrella of Asset Development or Asset Formation; in my case, we help people to:
get the most out of their tax return through credits, better advance planning (how to use their refund, setting up withholding properly, file past year returns), and on-time current tax filing (VITA); and
become bankable: save towards paying back-owed money to a bank if they've had past banking problems so they can once again open and bank account (2nd Change Banking Account).
In addition, people need an income to live on, save with, and spend. Many people have trouble getting re-employed after being on unemployment more than 6 months. Jobs are highly competitive and many people need help with today's electronic application process. Without a new job, they'll lose the assets they do have and become a statistic -- unemployed and sometimes eventually homeless. So beefing up our employment-related services and reaching out to communities that are hardest hit and most affected by our tough economic situation is closely tied to poverty prevention.
This also helps integrate our technology center more closely with the overall agency; something I've been working on over the past year with a good amount of success, but only possible because of the help of agency staff who also see the value in this. Together, we're providing better & more integrated services.
This transition will take time, as people still need help with benefits and we cannot expect other agency staff to know, overnight, all that I've learned in 2.5 years. But we have good staff who can rise to many occasions. Together, we'll at least be able to handle benefits applications and possibly refer to other agencies, especially legal ones, for many of the advocacy issues I've been handling. When state agencies continue to improperly deny benefits or make it difficult for eligible applicants to get benefits, perhaps it's best to let some "legal eagles" take them on and push them to properly train and supervise their case managers.
That is for the difficult situations. For the less difficult situations, many of my clients have learned how to advocate for themselves. This really is a good advocate's goal - empower clients to self-advocate and win on their own; help them recognize that they have the can do attitude and skills to do other things that will move them forward.
It won't be an overnight transition, but it is an important one. I'm so glad that our funders and board recognize Asset Development/Asset Formation as a proper and potentially powerful tool in the fight against poverty.

Last night I was one of about 30 people attending a meeting with Representative Ed Markey (D-MA) to discuss the Budget Control Act and its likely effect on health care. It was an information exchange, as he presented how the Budget Control Act is slated to play out and then listened to our concerns as to how that will most likely affect health care, ourselves, and our constituents/clients.
Markey laid out the "Debt Deal" as having 3 major steps, with Step 1 already complete: passage by the House and Senate and President Obama's signature on the Bill last Monday, August 1, 2011.
Step 1 is designed to trim $917 Billion from the budget over 10 years through spending cuts and caps. $350 Billion will come from defense with the remainder from discretionary funds, which could include health care areas except Medicare and Medicaid.
Step 2 is the Super Committee, comprised of 12 members: 6 Republicans and 6 Democrats -- divided evenly between House and Senate from each party. These legislators must hammer out an agreement by November 23, 2011 that reduces the federal deficit by $1.2 - $1.5 Trillion over 10 years and Congress must then pass that agreement as a Bill by December 23, 2011.
In this step, nothing is off the table as far as spending cuts or caps or measures to increase revenues.
If they reach an agreement, that agreement goes to Congress as a bill they must vote on with no options for changes, filibuster, or other political maneuvering. A simple yes/no vote is required.
Step 3 kicks in only if Step 2 fails totally -- i.e,. there is no agreement --, Congress fails to approve an agreement, the President vetoes the resulting Bill, or it fails to reduce the deficit enough*. Step 3 triggers automatic cuts in spending that are basically 50/50 between defense and non-defense budget items.
Defense would be cut by approximately 9%; this could include cuts to the VA (Veterans Administration).
Non-defense would be cut by approximately 8%; these non-defense cuts would include a $2.5B cut to NIH (National Institutes for Health), a $525M cut to NSF (National Science Foundation), and a 2% cut (approximately $20B) to Medicare providers. Medicaid, Social Security, and Medicare benefits are exempt in Step 3.
*Note that Step 3 would kick in, at a reduced level, if Step 2 results in passage of a Bill that is significantly less than the expected $1.2-$1.5 Trillion. The cuts in Step 3 would be amounts that would bring the total deficit reduction to the $1.2-$1.5T.
The 12 legislators chosen for this high stakes poker game have a great deal of latitude in how they slash the budget to reach $1.2-$1.5 Trillion in deficit reduction. Nothing is off the table, according to the rules of the game. That includes Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs that are actually protected in Steps 1 and 3.
This step also includes the possibility of revenue generation. However, when half the Super Committee has already pledged no tax increases, that immediately ties the other half of the Committee's hands. As Markey pointed out last night, GOP leadership excluded any Republican leaders from the Super Committee who had indicated they were open to raising taxes**.
Attendees included some people from Cambridge Health Alliance, two different Alzheimer's advocacy groups, Mass Senior Action Council (they were out in force with half a dozen attendees -- great advocacy!), Hallmark Health, myself from Tri-CAP (also representing the HealthMINT Network and the Heritage Tenants Association), a Mass Elders advocacy group, individuals representing themselves and their family members, and state senators Pat Jehlan (D-Medford) and David Linsky (D-Natick) and a representative from sate Senator Katherine Clark (D-Malden). Some groups were represented but I just cannot recall their names, so if were there and I missed you feel free to comment on this post and add that you were there!
the automatic deficit reduction strategy would decimate essential health research and that will result in far-reaching future medical costs that will only increase our debt,
it's not a negotiation if one side comes to the table refusing to consider other options (i.e., the "no tax increases" stand by the GOP),
fear that those already slipping over the edge into an abyss of depression, job loss or pay cuts, housing loss, stress, mental health issues, etc. are not finding any relief and this Bill makes that worse.
Markey then asked us each to tell him which Step (2 or 3) we would "vote" for so he can go back to the House and talk to his colleagues. Nineteen (19) participants voted for Option 2 as preferable over the seven (7) votes for Option 3. He also reminded us that every legislator needs to hear from all of us. If we want to have a say in the final outcome, we must mobilize and make our voices heard on the subject. The Tea Party has been very organized and goal-driven; we must do so also if we don't want our worst fears to come to fruition.
Congressman Markey, we appreciate your invitation for us to meet with you and give you our input on this critical matter and to represent our constituents' needs.
Disclaimer: I attended this meeting as part of my paid job with Tri-CAP and thus "reported" on it in this format. My views do not necessarily reflect the views of Tri-CAP.
I spent yesterday and will spend today at WordCamp Boston, a conference for WordPress users. I have wanted to add WordPress to my web design toolbelt but just haven't had time to sit down and really play with it. Conferences like this are a great way to shorten the learning curve.
I typically use Joomla! for web design, but WordPress has come a long way in the several years since my initial research led me to adopt Joomla! as my preferred platform. I'd like to be able to offer clients a choice or, if necessary, make a choice for them with whichever tool seems right for them.
From the minute I walked into the registration area, I was impressed with the organization and planning of this conference. The Registration "badge" was a complete portfolio for the conference -- including the information to log in to the network, a complete schedule on the inside (still readable even though it was comparatively small), whether or not you'd ordered a T-shirt, etc. With hundreds of attendees, it was relatively quiet and very organized.
Speakers have been top notch too. One speaker had only one year's experience using WordPress, but he gave a great presentation of Top 10 tips he'd learned in that year. As an experienced web designer, I came away with some "Ah Ha's" from it. That's quite good in my book. What I appreciated was that many sessions focused on web design and not just how to use WordPress. That creates a good mix for people who may know one or two tools but need to create better content, enrich their site, or grow into a more sophisticated use of thie websites (marketing outreach, SEO tools, etc.).
I go back today with a better idea in my mind beforehand of which sessions I'll attend. There is a stream of "how to" sessions specific to WordPress that I plan to attend, as well as some focusing on the freelancer (that's me -- or, as I prefer to say Solopreneur).
This has been a great way to spend the weekend; I'm glad I made it this year. The BU location has also been quite nice.
By the way, if you're a Joomla! user in the Boston area, our monthly user group meeting is this Wednesday (7/27/11) from 7-9 PM at the Cyber Cafe @ Malden Square. Preregistration is preferred although not required; since it's summer, I'd check the website to make sure the meeting is still on before showing up!
Online friendships are great to have. They stimulate online conversation, help you stay connected long distance, and reconnect with long-time friends from the past. You can and your friends can find new people to connect with through each others' friends, and you can gain deeper insight into your friends.
But let's face it; most of these friends are really acquaintances. That's not a problem; it's just that the word friend has a different meaning in the real world than it does in the virtual world. I understand why though. Which sounds better? Facebook Acquaintance or Facebook Friend? I get it. On LinkedIn, they're called Connections, which is a more apt term. (I mostly use FB, LI, & Twitter for examples here because I'm active on them and can speak directly to their use; this is not a research paper, so I'm not concerned with examining other social media.)
In the virtual world you can learn a lot more about your acquaintances fairly easily. From the discussions and Q&A sections in LinkedIn, to the wall posts in Facebook, there are a lot of insights into people sprinkled all over the web. Follow someone's Twitter feed (Tweets) for what they read, tweet, and retweet and you have a goldmine of insight available. If they have websites or blogs, you'll find those useful as well.
Here's a real example from my online acquaintances. I met one of the organizers of PodCamp at PodCamp2 Boston several years ago. Later we connected on LinkedIn. I follow this person's blog posts because I find value in the content; they're informative and helpful to my work and life. In fact, I pull in his blog feed directly to my LI home page, along with the feeds of several other friends, so from one page I can quickly review what they're posting about and stay caught up with their activity regularly. After a few years, I thought I knew him pretty well, as far as virtual acquaintanceships go. Imagine my surprise when, last week, I was perusing some virtual thinking websites and found some art from this person. I checked to make sure it was the same person; yes, it was. That led me to Flickr, a site that lets you post photos and other images for sharing, where a lot of his art was shared. This was a whole new dimension to my virtual friend that I never knew existed.
Another online acquaintanceship develop in a similar manner. We had some mutual friends in both the real and virtual worlds. From reading her blogs (yes, she has more than one), I found that we share more than a passion for technology (which is how our acquaintanceship began); we share a spiritual and philosophical mindset that made me want to know this person even more -- to move an acquaintanceship into a friendship.
The neat thing is that you can convert acquaintanceships into real friendships over time. After all, we tend to develop strong friendships with people whom we respect. Whether that begins because we share some level of political or religious beliefs, because we care about ecology, enjoy gardening, read or watch sci fi--at some level we have a common bond that draws us closer together and we form a stronger-than-acquaintanceship relationship and become true friends.
Some might wonder why the virtual world is so popular as a place to connect with others. My initial thinking on this, which is not scientific or deeply thought through, is that it provides more options than the typical places we meet people. We work longer hours, limiting our opportunities to get out and meet others. We want to meet people outside of bars, especially if we are not looking for dating relationships. And the virutal world breaks down geographic barriers for just getting to know others and see what they're all about.
Those are my thoughts this early Saturday morning. Do you have any thoughts on this topic? Use the comments to respond.
It's a short post, so I'll let you read it rather than trying to extract a lot from it here. One paragraph is particularly important:
But with every success I’ve ever had, it started with work. I had to start somewhere. I had to accept that I wasn’t where I wanted to be, and then I had to work harder and harder.
Each program I run could be improved, even though they each are successful to some degree. They can each be more successful if I accept that they aren't where I want them to be and work to get them where I think they should be.
I'm beginning to write a report on the recently-ended VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) program I coordinate with the help of a small group of dedicated and talented volunteers, a lot of support from the IRS, and growing support from the Mass Dept. of Revenue. We do a good job and we help a lot of people. But we can serve more people if we improve some of our internal processes and find a way to fund my position for more hours each tax season and fund an Assistant Coordinator part-time for 3-4 months. We need to begin earlier, but funding doesn't permit the extra time needed for me to take time away from the other programs I handle as early as needed.
It's a problem I've tried to tackle with more effective procedures and tools, but they can only take you so far. Now it's time to tackle the real roadblock - funding support at the right amount for the many hours necessary for self-training (I have to recertify each year), volunteer recruitment and training, and planning/preparation with other agencies so they actually help us with getting taxpayers informed and to us (or us to them).
This is just one of several programs, but has quantifiable numbers and data from other VITA sites doing the same thing that can help me analyze our improvements. It's always helpful if you can quantify your results.
Chris also speaks about delaying gratification while your work on your punch. I agree with him. We started out with a small program and made some improvements. The next time, we had greater numbers and discovered we could improve even more. In our 4th year, we increased our production by almost 70% over the previous year. If we had tried to reach those numbers in the first year or two, we could have made a real mess of it and not served low-income taxpayers very well. Instead, by building slowly and adding other services slowly, we are able to help people with their taxes, food stamps, and health insurance needs in one appointment. The volunteers don't feel overwhelmed, as they have learned at a reasonable pace how to build this into their tasks. And they have suggested some of the improvements that we now use, providing better buy-in that this is all very doable and makes sense. It's pretty important that volunteers and staff feel as if what they are doing actually makes sense!
We're pretty happy with that punch, but we're not complacent. We're always working to improve, be more agile, and better able to respond to changing issues or needs. Practice, practice, practice; that's what it takes.
People sometimes think of financial planning as something they'll do once they hit 40. The truth is, it's better to begin as early as possible. That first "real" job in your 20s is the perfect time to develop the habit of setting aside money into a retirement fund that hopefully will let you retire with some comfort in your 60s.
Why is this so important? Well, money grows if it's set aside into an interest bearing account. Your money works for you and can help you retire gracefully. Or, if you have a life event that wipes you out economically, you have something that you can rely on while you get back on your feet. Many, many people have used up their retirement savings over these past few tough economic years and are now starting over in terms of putting money into a retirement fund. They're so grateful that they had that money set aside which became their daily expense fund through a medical or job emergency that left them financially strapped.
For some thoughtful posts on how to think about future planning for your money, I go to a colleague's website, Money and the Spirit, for a brief refresher. Isaias has a nice way of linking our thinking about this with the "real world" we all live in. It's good advice and before you know it, the future is our "real world" and it would nice if we had some financial cushion to let us live and age gracefully through retirement.
I wish I'd gotten this post written or at least posted yesterday, but that did not happen. My life is busy and my blog is something I want to enjoy doing rather than becoming another "must do" on a long list. There were many places where women were being honored yesterday for being brave, standing up for what is right, or accomplishing great things despite roadblocks and setbacks.
I spent my afternoon/evening at St. Elizabeth's hospital with someone getting chemotherapy. When we talk about courageous women, we don't need to go far. I run into many courageous women every day. They're all around me. In this case, this woman's courage doesn't come from the fact that she has cancer; it comes from how she deals with her cancer.
Diagnosed 10 years ago, she worked throughout her first sets of treatment and surgery, sometimes on a reduced schedule, but she worked throughout. After two years of that, she had almost five years of No Evidence of Disease (NED) - they don't say remission with her type of cancer because it is usually still there but not spreading and hard to find. And the majority of people don't survive beyond 3-5 years; she did.
Then it sprang back to life. Shortly after, her job was eliminated and the large company she worked for couldn't find a suitable position for her -- to tell the truth, they didn't even try. She could have sued them but chose to focus her energy on finding a new job elsewhere and fighting this disease. She was unsuccessful in finding a new job and after a year, stopped looking. She needed her energy to fight this cancer. Treatment is tough and every drug has its side effects.
It's been 3 years back on chemotherapy -- various drugs, different schedules, but every Tuesday up to St. E's we go. She's had a few short breaks of a period of weeks, but the disease grows stronger and larger each time, so we're in a delicate balance of how much chemo, when to take a break, which drug to use, etc.
I began by saying she faces this with courage. No longer able to work, she spends time every day online doing advocacy around cancer and other issues, does quite a bit of research for the issues she involved with, and is a trained peer mentor for others with her type of cancer.
She also interacts quite a bit with the youth in her apartment complex. They often feel that adults think all kids are insensitive, unthinking trolls who should be seen and not heard. She talks with them, gives them a different perspective on things, and lets them know when they've done a good thing by standing up to someone bullying another or tells who to talk with if they're bullied or if they have a problem that requires intervention. They respect her because she treats them with respect. And they go to her with questions because they know she listens.
To me, this is someone with courage -- the courage to face life's hurdles with a "can-do" attitude. There's no "pity party" in her household -- just a strong presence that moves forward, even when it's difficult.
I call this blog, "on my mind" because I write about what's most on my mind at the time. But sometimes what is on my mind isn't in a state to write clearly about; it may be an unresolved situation or issue; it may be something that could harm someone's privacy to write about until I'm able to put it in more generic or neutral terms.
That tends to block me, somehow, from writing about other things. I cannot wrap my head around other issues for writing topics because what I want to write about I should not write about, yet.
I'm in one of those frames of mind right now. So bear with me, please, as I deal with things I am unable to write about. When my head is clear, I'll be back.
Today, despite the snow and related cleanup efforts, Tri-CAP and the Tri-City Housing and Homelessness Task Force will host a luncheon and conduct its annual Tri-City Homeless Census. Many agencies and service providers are helping to gather the necessary data for the annual homeless census and street count.
It is important to count everyone for continued funding to provide essential services to homeless families and individuals. This data is being gathered at the request of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as part of the Continuum of Care Application for McKinney-Vento funding.
The goal is to capture accurate, reflective, and meaningful data on homeless individuals and families. The data will be collected by many agencies throughout the nation beginning Wednesday, January 26th for a brief period. The census results help Tri-CAP apply for state and federal funds to continue to help eliminate poverty through education, housing and benefits advocacy, housing search, case management, mental health counseling, and substance abuse counseling.
Any agency or service provider that serves or works with homeless individuals or families can help by referring such individuals to a data collection site or event. One such event is the free lunch reception for homeless individuals and families that will take place on Thursday, January 27, 2011, between 12 – 2 PM at the Cyber Café @ Malden Square, 110 Pleasant Street, Malden. For more information, contact Fernanda Brito 781-322-4125 ext. 210
I took a few photos a little while ago, while the snowfall had lightened a bit. But it started snowing more heavily again a little while ago. Here are a few shots I took during the lull.
Dogwood Tree outside our back entrance. What might be mistaken for a fire hydrant in front of it is really a trash barrel. It's hard to tell when it's buried in snow.
I don't want to be standing beneath this tree when it drops its snowy load. This is the park in front of Hormel Stadium.
At the very right of the photo is a lightpole and barely visible behind it you can see the wings of the wind turbine.
These two bushes look like a couple huddling in the snow -- reminds me of our homeless clients who do not use shelters; I pray for their safety in this type of weather.
Yesterday's shooting in Arizona is yet another wake-up call to America. Our political rhetoric carries a grave responsibility to frame that rhetoric in fact and end the dangerous era of distortion, non-truths, vitriolic embellishments, and hate-based speech.
Regardless of your political beliefs, there is no need to vilify politicians, legislation, or programs because they are contrary to your own. Fight against what you think is wrong - Absolutely. Point out what you believe to be the flaws and mistakes - Absolutely. But the language we use must accept the responsibility that accompanies the right to free speech.
Last December (2009), I blogged about the need for patience during the holidays. The situation of that evening would have been aggravated by impatience because the woman I blogged about was dealing with a disorder that often controls her -- our patience helped her control it. Political discussions need the same measure of self-restraint.
Between September and October 2009, I blogged several times about the debate over health care and in July 2009 I blogged specifically about Sarah Palin. Did I contribute to the fray by calling her a whiner? I examined evidence of her behavior and tried to frame it as to whether or not she was suitable to be our Vice President and even President. Her behavior seemed to merit that label.
In an August 2009 blog post, I had questioned whether Palin might be more accurately labeled a court jester. I asked whether she was really working under the cover of being a fool -- one who is able to tell the king the truth without fear of harm -- or if she really were the fool. I would sincerely hope that these questions and opinions would not lead someone to try to harm Palin. There is a difference between raising questions about the intelligence and ability of someone to lead the nation versus vilifying that person.
It is clear that I am not afraid to speak out about my beliefs. The difference, I believe, is the tone of rhetoric. I believe in reasonable debate. Let's examine issues, based on facts, and skip the fictitious scenarios -- scare tactics -- that make reasonable debate impossible.
Recently, national attention has focused on hate-speech and bullying; just Google the topic. While much of that discussion is framed in the context of anti-gay bullying, hate speech is hate speech no matter who is the target. These incidents need to become the lessons through which we change our behavior and rhetoric.
My heartfelt sympathy goes to all those who were physically and emotionally injured or killed in yesterday's shooting. While their families search for some solace, we need to put ourselves in their shoes and ask ourselves if we have become part of the problem.
Update: I just saw the Huff-Post (Huffington Post) article on Sarah Palin's map that has "gun sights" on the Democrats she wants to unseat in the next election, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was critically injured in yesterday's shooting. This imagery is part of the problem I blogged about earlier this morning. Targeting people with gun sights on a map sends a very disturbing message to people who are already on the edge between reality and insanity. While she has the free speech right to do this, it seems very close to shouting "FIRE" in a theatre -- it is not reasonable and sane. Palin's statement over this tragedy -- "we'll pray for peace and justice" -- just rings false when she has sent such a vitriolic message to her followers.
We have seen, over and over again, that people can react as if they were merely doing what the messenger said and no one else would do. So how sane is it to continue to in the very behavior that we know triggers such an insane reaction? It is clearly immoral and unethical.
It's January 2, 2011, and that brings my mother to mind as today is her birthday. My parents died in the early 2000s, but I was fortunate to have them around until their early 80s. I still do something and want to share it with them, then remember they're not there to call. So Happy Birthday Mom!
I have no resolutions to share because I don't bother with those. I do set goals for myself. I review these throughout the year and don't have any attachment to a New Year's resolution list. One goal I set for myself a few months ago was to change my business model around website design. I'm pleased to say that I have two proposals out there that follow this new model; one which I wrote and submitted Friday.
The need for this model was to make it easier to work with small organizations and businesses that don't have staff dedicated to these types of projects. What I've found over the few years in these organizations is that decision-making is often sporadic and impulsive. Rather than working closely with you to help create what they want, the decision-maker wants a quick meeting and for you to sort it out for them. You spend time working through options and present them; only to wait and wait for a response. Then they make another quick decision, often changing their original decisions. Again, you wait and wait for a response. The decision-maker sees something on the web and wants it, but has no clue as to how much they're changing the original design and your current execution. It feels as if the project never ends. What should have been a fairly quick project, for a set amount of money that the organization can pay, turns into never-ending small changes or even big changes that don't meet the criteria of the original project.
What I find particularly frustrating is that the original project would include features that staff and the decision-maker all agreed they wanted. In the end, impulsive and sporadic decisions rid the project of most of these and the site becomes little more than an electronic brochure. I hate to waste money, including my clients money. I don't like stopping and starting these projects because it means using more time to go back in and review what has been done, how it's been done, what they asked for, what remains to be done, etc. And when I review what they originally asked for against what they're now saying, they've actually reduced the functionality of their website.
With the change in my business model, I'm really trying to change the executive model. The problem with these projects is the executive in charge. So that's where real change has to occur. It means I probably have to spend a little more time with the executive during the process, pushing them a bit to either stick with decisions they've already made, or at least acknowledge that there's a cost associated with changing their minds partway through the project.
It will be interesting to see if this better model works as well for my clients as it should for me. Helping busy executives exercise a little discipline and consider the costs and consequences of sporadic and impulsive decision-making should be a good thing. I hope they see it that way once we've gotten started!

I've read some amazing posts by book bloggers this morning and although the quick post I write here won't hold a candle to theirs, I wanted to take the time to reflect on 2009 and to thank my readers for stopping by everyday.
Personally, 2009 had some very big ups and downs but as it draws to a close I'm just thankful for my life and for the people I love, both here and those who've passed away. You never get over losing your parents, but now my memories focus on the good times and I'm able to smile more and not shy away from thinking about them.
In the case of Cheeky Reads, I started this blog in March of 2009 and am so thankful for the readers so stop by and comment. I love having your input and hope to provide even more cool content for you in 2010. You'll also see more contests and some awesome new features I'm hoping to launch throughout the year.
Thank you to all my readers and I hope you have a wonderful start to the New Year! What are some of your resolutions for 2010? What was the best book you read in 2009?
We’re pleased to have Robin here today to answer some questions about her latest romance Breakfast in Bed. She’ll be stopping in throughout the day to answer questions. Don’t forget to comment to win a copy of the book!
Your latest book had me laughing out loud. It revolves around a hero who wants to go from a domestic dud to a domestic stud and enlists his sister's best friend to teach him how to cook and clean. Hilarity ensues...Would you tell our readers more about Breakfast in Bed? Hi, Sabrina. I’m so glad you liked Breakfast in Bed. Rich Ronaldi rented an apartment from his sister, Rosalie and unbeknownst to him, his other sister, Annabelle sublet the very same apartment to her best friend Becca. Before they could decide which of them keeps the apartment, Rich’s girlfriend dumps him because he’s not relationship material. Rich decides he needs to become a domestic god to win his girlfriend back, so he tells Becca he’d let her stay until her apartment is remodeled if she becomes his domestic god coach.
Like most readers I'm all about connecting with the hero and heroine in a book. So, I always ask authors to describe their hero in three words. Domestic Dud turned Stud works for me. But if I had to come up with my own I’d say Rich is smart, sexy and trainable. There is no way we can make a man change, unless he wants to--and Rich wants to.
What about your heroine? What three words would best describe her? Smart, creative and independent all to the nth degree.
Now that we know more about your characters, what was it about them that had you wanting to write that HEA for them? any favorite scenes to write? What woman wouldn’t jump at the opportunity to train a man as good-looking as Rich? Besides, she got him to do all the cooking and housework. To me, there is nothing sexier than a man doing housework, the humdinger is scrubbing the toilet and bathtub.
My favorite scenes to write were Rich’s disasters. There’s nothing like a fire in the dryer to heat up a romance.
I love your top ten reasons woman love domestic gods list on your website (readers check it out here)! All three of your books feature men who are or become domestic gods. I have to ask, do you have a personal domestic god who inspires you?
Oh yeah. My husband is a total domestic god. He does all the laundry and cleaning, he’s a passable cook, and remodels our house in his spare time. I figure I’ve got it all--a domestic god with a tool belt. He’s also the best, most supportive husband and father I’ve ever known. Picking him up was one of the smartest things I’ve ever done.
You grew up in Brooklyn and it's the featured setting of your books. Do you love making it a character all it's own? It's not your typical romance novel setting and that's what I find so appealing! I do love Brooklyn and New York. I chose it because I’m comfortable there and I’m in a constant state of homesickness. I know and love the people. Setting my books in Brooklyn gives me a great excuse to visit, and allows me to write off the trip as research.
Brooklyn is very much like NYC, it has a lot of the same sounds and smells but just at a lower volume. Each of the neighborhoods are so different, they all have their own flavors and cultural accents. I adore exploring the neighborhoods and soaking in the culture. I lived in Kensington when I was a kid, but always loved the park. The Park Slope section of Brooklyn is my absolute favorite and I would live there in a heartbeat if I could afford to.
I need a NY fix every few months so I call my friends and go home for a long weekend to absorb the energy and the craziness. I come home refreshed and renewed with my Brooklyn accent in full force. But then I’m told that happens every time I speak to a relative.
Read any good books lately that you would recommend to our readers? Authors always seem to have the inside track on great new authors!
I’ve been reading My Own Personal Soap Opera by Libby Malin, I’ve read Stephanie Julian’s Kiss of Moonlight, and someone just recommended Can’t Stand the Heat by Louisa Edwards. I’m told she has a very similar writing style to mine so I’m looking forward to checking her out.
What's up next for you? Do you have another Brooklyn romance cooking? As a matter of fact, I do. It’s called As Good as He Gets and I don’t have a release date yet, but I’m thinking either May or June. It’s a bit of a departure, it takes place in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Boise, Idaho and a little mining town in the mountains of Idaho called Three Whores Bend. As Good as He Gets is Ben and Gina’s story. We meet a whole new cast of characters as well as a few of the regulars, and I love them all. I’m having a lot of fun writing it.
Where can readers find you next on your blog tour and is there anything else you'd like to share with us? You can go to my website www.RobinKayeWrites.com and my blog tour schedule is on my calendar. I’ll be giving out copies of Breakfast in Bed to lucky commenters.
If you could train the man in your life to do one thing, what would it be? As for me, I’d teach him to give great back rubs. What about you?
Rich, the epitome of “anti-domestic,” can’t cook to save his life, and his idea of cleaning his apartment is to invite his mother over. But he’s ready to settle down, and he can’t stop thinking about the ex-girlfriend who got away. When he notices that his soon-to-be-married friends cooked and cleaned their way into their women’s hearts, he asks his friend Becca to help transform him into a nurturing man to win back his ex.
Rich is the only guy who’s taken the time to know Becca for herself. She decides she’ll give him the makeover he’s asking for, though she’ll be damned if she’s going to turn him into a domestic god for another woman. She wants Rich for herself, but how can she convince him that her kitchen and her bedroom are the only domestic locales he desires?

I’ve been a little absent lately from the blog, but things are starting to quiet down and I’ll be back to reading and reviewing like a rock star!
We had a wonderful holiday weekend with family. Florida Christmas celebrations are always interesting, and this one was no different. On Christmas day, we were out on a boat enjoying low 70’s temperatures and watching the manatees play in the canal. Later, a group of dolphins stopped by and we stood out on the boat dock and watched them play.
I was also able to read two great novellas this Christmas and I highly recommend both. I might re-read them just to keep the holiday spirit going for a little while longer!
The first was This Wicked Gift, by new author Courtney Milan. The novella was part of The Heart of Christmas anthology. Courtney’s story is worth buying the whole book for even if you ignored the rest of the book, and I can’t wait to read her debut full length historical romance, Proof of Seduction which releases January 1st.
The second was Winter Heat by Dawn Halliday and was part of the A Highlander Christmas anthology. I adored the heroine Maggie McDonald and what romance lover doesn’t enjoy a little taste of a Highlander?
What about you? Did you have a good holiday? What was the most fun thing you did, or the best book you were able to sneak time in to read?
I was recently honored to receive the Honest & Scrap blog award from Marissa at Marissa's Booklair. Thank you so much Marissa!
I would like to pass this award on to Book Chick City because she rocks and you should be reading her blog! I'd also like to give it to the ladies at The Book Pushers.
The rules for this award are simple, you have to tell ten honest things about yourself and pass them on to other bloggers. So, here are the ten honest things I can think up about myself right now. :)
1.) I consider my pets little people and give them personalities - and yes, I've been known to carry on conversations with them. Oh, and they do have "voices' the hubby and I have created for them.
2.) I'm a total clown. I live to laugh and make it my goal to have my husband laughing out loud at least once a day. I'm a pretty physical clown, and have been know to break out in a crazy dance or reenact a scene using all kinds of crazy movements.
3.) There is not one single type of music I don't listen to. Of course I'm selective within a genre, but my music tastes run far and wide! I also have the amazing ability to memorize lyrics after hearing a song only once - okay maybe that's only amazing to me, but I think it makes me cool! LOL
4.) I'm a vegetarian/vegan. Well, for the past three weeks! Really, it's been off and on for many years but I'm hoping it sticks this time.
5.) I started this blog because I love romance books and reading. What you might not know is that before I started this blog, I started writing my first romance book. It's still a work in progress, but maybe one day!
6.) I'm addicted to Twitter - I used to make fun of people who said they Tweeted, but now I understand the cracktastic awesomeness that Twitter is. Seriously. Do it!
7.) I've been married for 8 years and with my Hubby for 10. We have two dogs named Yoda and Gizmo and they rule our house!
8.) Galaxy Quest is one of my all-time favorite movies. Pure Genius! Yes, I'm a bit of a Sci-Fi geek and proud of it.
9.) I'm that girl in the car next to you singing out loud and dancing in her car. I know - I just can't help it! I like to shake my booty.
10.) Sometimes I get behind on this blog with life and my full-time job, but I'm always thinking of ways to improve it and to bring you more content. I feel guilty when I don't post every single day.
I’m not hearing of a lot of books releasing this week, so I’m showcasing the latest books available from Samhain! Take a peek at the latest ebook releases they have to offer. Happy Reading!

I'm so excited that tonight we can finally see the new Hallmark Channel movie, Mrs. Miracle based on the book by Debbie Macomber!
Losing a spouse is always hard, and for Seth Webster (James Van Der Beek), playing single dad to two rambunctious six-year-olds doesn’t make it any easier. With the holidays approaching, finding a housekeeper has proven to be near-impossible, until Mrs. Emily Merkle (Doris Roberts) shows up at the Websters’ door, ready to turn their lives around. No sooner has “Mrs. Miracle,” as Seth’s boys call her, straightened up the house, than Seth meets Reba Maxwell (Erin Karpluk), best friend to the Webster kids’ first-grade teacher. After just one date, Seth and Reba find they have a lot in common. Since the death of his music-loving wife, Seth has been unable to play a single chord on the piano, and, in the name of her career, Reba, once an avid actress, has avoided the theater. With a Christmas pageant to prepare for and a fresh romance on the horizon, Mrs. Miracle definitely has her work cut out for her and proves to be more than just a normal nanny.
Everybody knows there's no love lost between paranormal investigator's Amanda LeGrange and sexy Jacob Caine. They can't even stand being in the same room together...

So, this was a November Harlequin release and I’m a very bad blogger for not posting this early in Nov so you could all run out and pick this one up. I do think you might still be able to find it in some stores that leave their books out a little longer, but I know you can order this baby online at www.eharlequin.com or Amazon – and it’s worth it!
Harlequin Blaze is my favorite Harlequin line, so I was very interested in reading Michelle Rowen's first book for the line. I've noticed that many of the recent Blazes have started to have some aspects of the paranormal, but this was my first one that was completely a paranormal romance. I really enjoyed that combo, and Michelle managed to put a very satisfying paranormal in the smaller Blaze packaging.
Part of what I loved about this book was how Michelle created a paranormal plot that was fun and upbeat, and paired that with the deep emotional issues that the heroine Amanda has. It was a great balance that allowed the reader to have fun with the otherworldly aspects while keeping the drama on the development of the relationship.
As I mentioned, I thought Michelle managed to create a very cool and neat paranormal agency, and the world in which it exists, within the constraints of a shorter length category book. Some authors can’t get me interested in their world-building in an entire full length single title, and Michelle had me interested in a sequel before I was in halfway in.
I loved the hero and heroine in this book and the sexcapades are hot, hot, hot! I’ll just say that more than one scene stuck out to me and that’s saying a lot in this shorter book length. Michelle packed a sexy wallop in one little category!
I can see this becoming an awesome series within the Blaze line and really hope to see Michelle write more of these. I was able to get Michelle to admit on twitter that she is currently working on a follow up that would be Patrick’s story – you’ll have to read the book to know how awesome that news is!
It’s release day for many authors and I’ve rounded up just a few of the fun looking new releases out there. Be sure to check out your local bookstore or online for more great new books to read. Today is a huge release day for Harlequin, so check out www.eharlequin.com to see all the newest releases there!

Hello lovely people! It feels like forever since I have been here presenting a project to you. My laptop went to computer heaven right after my last post and it has taken until now to get a new one. Ah, life. It feels good to be back at it, though! I have been working on creating a little backyard oasis for myself lately and I have been wanting to add a little water fountain to it. What better project to stage a come back with, right? Right. So without further ado, here is my super easy, anyone with thumbs can do it, outdoor water fountain!
Start by gathering two big clay pots and one small pot to hold them together. I just went for Terra Cotta because I was already dishing out a bunch of money on plants and I had somewhat of a budget I was trying to adhere to. You could always splurge and go for the nicer painted, glazed pots of you are feeling froggy. Here are mine:
As you can see on the pictures on the left, I sealed the bottom hole as well as adhered the smaller pot to the larger one with some caulk. This will keep it from leaking everywhere. You don’t have t use caulk, it is just what I had handy. I didn’t worry too much about how it looked, because it is just for me and you won’t see any of that in the end. Once the caulk (or whatever adhesive you decide to use) is dry, Place the smaller of the two pots on top of the larger and position however you find appealing. I chose to tip mine, because the fountain attachment worked well that way and it just looked nice.
I bought a bag of nice stones from Lowes to fill the pots with. I love the contrast in colors. Like I said, the sky is the limit when making your own. Once you get the logistics of how everything works, there are so many options to choose from. Before you fill your pots completely up with rocks, put your pump in. I was lucky enough to find this solar-powered pump at Harbor Freight this morning for a heck of a good price! It is nice because I don’t have to worry about unplugging it or wasting power. Love!!
Once it is in and positioned like you want, start loading in the rocks and water. It really is that easy. This is what mine looks like now:
You can always use tubing instead of the plastic stand that it comes with. That comes in handy if you don’t want to see where the water is coming from. I didn’t mind on this one, but I have an idea for another one that I might use tubing for. If I make it I will be sure to show you guys! I added a video down below of the fountain in action. Before you watch it, know this. I have not figured out the video editor yet. So the clip is sideways. Yikes! You get the idea, though. Bye loves!!

My discursive essay is about healthy eating. I will explore both sides of the argument for and against healthy eating and come to a conclusion on what I think is the best side of the argument. This topic is quite controversial and is often discussed by the media. I personally think that people should be able to enjoy what they eat and not have to eat what people say they should eat.
Some people say that if you eat healthy and stick to it you will live longer as you will have less diseases such as heart disease, stroke, hypertension and some cancers. According to the book “Eating for good health” the connection between a high fat diet and the life threatening diseases mentioned above centres on a waxy substance called cholesterol. It is made by the liver and other tissues from ingested fats. As a result of this the cholesterol then sticks to the wall of the arteries. This thickens the artery walls so the passageway for blood is narrower, which increases blood pressure. This can cause a weakness in the artery walls which causes a bulge. If this bulge ruptures it may cause a stroke or a cardiac arrest. Furthermore certain types of cancer can be caused by having a high fat diet. Bile acids in the colon that can turn cells cancerous are stimulated by fat. Fat is also known as a fuel promoting tumour growth.
On the other hand people who eat healthily and who do not eat fatty foods can still die from cancer and other diseases. Another valid point is that you can take healthy eating too far and get diseases such as anorexia and bulimia where you starve yourself or make yourself sick. As a result of these diseases you can develop depression or even death. Also you could eat healthily all your life but you can not control what happens to you. For example you could walk out onto the road and get killed so you may as well enjoy life and eat what you want when you still can.
We can't get enough of the fun, bold and patterned look of wallpaper on the ceiling. Though it's a gutsy move, we think it has the potential to pay off quite big. We gathered five spaces so attractive, they have us wondering what pattern we'd choose for our ceilings.
If you're bold enough to try wallpaper on your walls, is it an easy step to move to the ceiling? Are walls the gateway to other surfaces in your home? Only you can answer that (and we certainly hope you give your opinion), but in the meantime, we can get plenty of non-committal inspiration from these great spaces:

The remains of ancient villages dating back to 5,500BC have been discovered on a construction site in Sion in the Valais.
The find was made by archaeologists during building work on the site of the the Arsenaux cultural centre in the city, Sion authorities said in a statement on Thursday.
The archaeologists uncovered evidence of human habitation, including graves and the remains of houses, which date back as far as the Neolithic period (5,500-4,800 BC).
Construction work at the site – intended to be a new centre for the city’s archives – has been suspended until in mid-September so archaeologists can carry out their work.

Pampering, tips & tricks and fabulous gifts! These are the words to describe the atmosphere at Glamour Beauty Festival. As you probably know already, last weekend I attended the first beauty festival in Romania, organized by Glamour magazine.
Like a true beauty addict, I was very excited to enjoy a weekend with my girls, glam products and specialists in make-up & beauty.
Urban Decay Naked palettes are a must for any beauty kit, as well the irresistible Givenchy lipstick! I loved Too Faced Chocolate makeup products since I first saw them in Sephora and I finally I had the opportunity to test them. These nuances are not just good looking, but also contain a natural cocoa powder and they smell delicious, yummy!
From make-up I rushed to Nails & Hair area. I had a pretty manicure, but my hair needed a little styling, so I tested the new Curl Secret from BaByliss and got loose curls, beautiful and durable, in less than 10 minutes.
How can paintings inform us of past cultural practices? By interrogating paintings produced at the Mughal court, Bonnie Wade reconstructs musical practices prevalent at the medieval royal courts of North India. Although Wade’s project began as an ethnomusicological enquiry eager to mine more than textual sources, her study ends up problematizing what meanings Mughal paintings had for past as well as present viewers. For historians of South Asian visual culture, Wade’s innovative study therefore signals a sharp turn away from the “dating game” that has dominated the field of Mughal painting history. Instead it situates these paintings within the cultural contexts of their production and function. In her use of paintings as visual evidence for cultural practices, paintings illumine cultural mentalities rather than merely mark a stage in a history of painting. In the process, Wade also explores codes of representation and modes of visual communication reproduced within these paintings. In her detailed study of gestures, material culture, social and gender roles depicted within paintings, Wade moves from the “miniature” toward the macrocosm of cultural politics. It is this choreography of Wade’s scholarship that suggests new ways of studying Mughal miniature production.
Wade’s book is organized into two parts, each with three chapters. In the first part, titled “The Political Agenda: The Early Mughal Era,” Wade lays out the musical, artistic, and cultural paradigms that were operative in the courts of the first Mughal rulers. Separate chapters present court traditions of producing illustrated texts, music performances, and cultural practices of women in the harem that reflect the Central Asian and Persianate origins of early Mughal court culture. In Part Two Wade traces shifts in court musical culture, which she claims results in its “Indianization,” from its beginnings during the reign of Akbar (r. 1556-1605) through the last “great Mughal” Aurangzeb (r. 1658-1707). Throughout her study Wade takes musical clues from visual evidence found in paintings produced at the court. She limits herself to those paintings that include musicians and/or dancers. Within this set of paintings, which are conveniently reproduced at the center of the book, Wade tends to focus on the depiction of specific musical instruments as signifers of musical change. This emphasis on musical instruments gives Wade’s book an organological base line that in method continues an ethnomusicological tradition begun early this century by Eric Hornbostel.
Wade’s larger agenda is to provide, through examples of musical practices, proof of a “cultural synthesis” in South Asia and to connect this to the agency of Mughal emperor Akbar. To any South Asian scholar this is an old plot, long overdue for deconstruction. In this simplistic construction of Mughal history, that dates back to nationalist and even colonial historians, Akbar becomes not only the metaphor for a mixing of Persianate and South Asian cultural forms, he also becomes its main instigator. This metanarrative has been used by many scholars to frame their explanation of the development of diverse cultural forms, from mystical Islamic religious practices that incorporated Hindu elements to the inclusion of regional Gujarati architectural vocabulary into Mughal built form such as found in buildings Akbar commissioned for his capital at Fatehpur Sikri. The quick-step that these cultural historians take is to dub any mixing of cultural forms as “Indian,” thereby appropriating it for the construction of an “Indian” national identity. The problem is that this erases or rarely acknowledges the Persian or Central Asian origins and continuing Persianate qualities of these cultural forms. Throughout her text Wade enthusiastically applies nationalist labels to past agents and cultural phenomenon, where she has sixteenth-century Indian musicians “Indianizing” Persianate musical culture. In her eagerness to find evidence for a “cultural synthesis” allowing her to apply the label of “Indian,” Wade avoids the more interesting question of possible pluralities in musical culture at the Mughal court, where musicians might have been bimusical, just as court artists could paint in both “Persian” and “Indian” styles. The co-existence of two different musics as well as artistic styles speaks of the cosmopolitan nature of Mughal metropolis.
The trope that Wade uses to frame her master narrative of “Indianization” is again a remnant of old historiography, where the successive reigns of the “grand” Mughal emperors Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan are directly mapped onto major cultural changes. Wade probably resorts to this because most historians of Mughal painting try to link artistic changes to shifts of the ruler and hence have also organized the archive of known paintings by ruling emperor, but does music change with dynastic succession? In fact, if Wade’s agenda is to trace the hybridization of Persianate musical culture with an existing South Asian one, her story should begin three centuries earlier, when during the early Sultanates the first groups of Central Asians began residing in South Asia. The poet and musician Amir Khusrau (1251-1326) from Sultanate Delhi is reputed to have created the first forms of what is now known as Hindustani classical music by combining aspects of South Asian musical culture with Persianate ones. These prior centuries of musical transformation have been omitted from Wade’s narrative, possibly because there is no comparable archive of paintings from these earlier medieval courts, yet this creates the misperception that the new hybrid music culture was solely the product of Mughal courts.
Wade is best in her focused musicological studies that are peppered throughout her book. These include a brilliant discussion of how depictions of military bands, called naubat, are the visual equivalent of the loud official sound of these ensembles, where kingship was associated with the sound of kettledrums. Here we begin to believe in the ability of paintings to conjure up sounds within the minds of intent viewers. In another fascinating etude, paintings provide evidence for the different types of music and dance performed by women at the court, where the style and instrumentation for Central Asian dances is depicted by artists as distinctly different from that for women dancing in a South Asian style. She promises to expand on this theme in future research.
Focusing primarily on the musical instruments found within paintings, Wade seems to limit her exploration of many cultural aspects to the musical performances being depicted. In a painting showing singing at a poetic gathering held within a garden setting, Wade only comments on the drone instrument being plucked by one of the singers rather than discussing the Persianate musical tradition of singing poetry which is an activity depicted in this and many other Mughal paintings. Nowhere in the book is the poetics of music at the Mughal court discussed, nor is the whole genre of album paintings framed with poetic verses ever mentioned. These paintings with accompanying poetry could well have been the only paintings actually used in musical performances, where while viewing painting appropriate poetry was sung. Does Wade ignore this because it is a Persianate musical practice that does not fit into her scheme of “Indianization?”
By concluding her innovative study with a painting that includes a musical ensemble with the requisite instruments and singers needed to perform the Dhrupad style of music familiar to modern musicologists and world music enthusiasts, Wade allows contemporary readers to infer sounds from paintings. This operation that relies on a viewer’s musical memory to create musical meaning from visual forms is the paradigmatic shift Wade offers as a challenge to future studies of visual culture. By probing paintings for the past meanings and sounds of music, Wade throws the field of ethnomusicology into reverse gear. For historians of visual culture, Wade’s study offers innovative ways to interrogate paintings for varieties of past meanings, even their musical resonance.
Cabinet Systems building a custom cabinet for your home means accommodating you in many ways. Any storage area is matter of convenience and a place of safe-keeping, but these designs are also meant to add to the overall beauty of your home.
Steps towards cleaning cabinets in a way that is not harmful to the finish ensures that the cabinets last longer and stay beautiful for years to come.
It is recommended that no matter how much you use the room your cabinets are in, the outsides should be wiped down at least once a week. This prevents dust from building up and improves the overall cleanliness of your kitchen, garage, or office. Grease and dust and other gases that permeate the space of the kitchen can begin to accumulate on the wood of the cabinet, causing it to become sticky and even gummy. Even if you only cook once or twice a week in your kitchen, over time this can become more difficult to clean if you skip out for a few months.
For the plain routine wipe-downs once weekly, simply use a damp washcloth. It is not necessary for the cloth to be soaking wet, so make sure it has been wrung out a few times. If a more vigorous clean is needed (due to spill, residue, etc) use an orange oil cleaner or a small dab of dish soap.
Oftentimes the harsh chemicals that most home cleaning solutions are equipped with can do significant damage. If you are unsure about how the finish on your cabinets will respond to a certain brand of cleaner, test out a small and hidden area on the surface. If the finish appears to be unchanged, proceed to wipe the rest.
When doing a more rigorous cleaning, pay special attention to the areas around the handles of the cupboards. Oils from constant opening and closing from hands can build up around these areas. If there seems to be quite a bit of residue that is particularly persistent, use orange oil or preferred wood cleaner and leave it to soak for 2-4 minutes. Then go back and try wiping it up again.
At least once yearly, the cabinets should undergo a more intense and thorough cleaning. This means taking out all items, cleaning the inside, and scrubbing the undersides and tops if they do not reach the ceiling.

ABSTRACT. This empirical research about ecotourism was elaborated having in mind two perspectives: the lodging and the consumer. It was possible to conclude that the hotels involved in the research need to improve its performance in terms of market research and of the environmental accreditation, but it is convenient to empathise that the environmental and social concerns are present in its activities. Regarding ecotourists, the findings indicate that they are concerned with the environmental issues when they are lodgin. Their great motivation is the possibility of having a contact with the nature, the environmental conservation and the sustainability.

As I young girl I loved working with my hands, building and taking things apart while eagerly awaiting each school book fair so I could buy the DIY books that I loved--these are my humble design roots. As I grew up, I was certain that I wanted to spend my life doing work I'd be passionate about and refused to settle for anything less. It only made sense that I focus on my passion of Interior Design, and I haven't looked back since.
Opening my design studio, Dayka Robinson Designs, was a natural progression after launching my blog in 2009. My love for second-hand shopping, antiquing & estate sale-ing-- introduced by my grandmother so many years ago--has become an integral part of my design business today. From designing interior spaces for clients to selling reinvented show-stopping vintage pieces, I live and design by the 3 R's (Rescue, Reuse, Reinvent) and love to show my clients how to mix re-imagined vintage pieces with newer furniture, textiles, and accessories to create a space that truly reflects their personality & lifestyle.
As a designer my first goal is to help you define your style, then use your style as a jumping board to create a space you'll love to live in. I'll push you to explore options you might normally shy away from but don't worry--my intent is to ensure you'll love your finished room as much as I'll love working on it...and I'll be there to hold your hand every step of the way.
A California girl at heart, Dayka Robinson is an Atlanta-based interior designer with a BA (Sociology) from Spelman College and formal design training from Gwinnett Technical College. A former Design Assistant on the popular TBS show Movie And A Makeover, Dayka is the writer of the popular blog, DRD (formerly Meditations on Life and Style), and co-founder of Room Service Atlanta, a non-profit charity that organizes Atlanta designers to provide pro-bono design services to area homeless shelters. Dayka was honored on the 2014 Atlanta Homes & Lifestyles "15 Under 40" list as a "tastemaker who is shaping the future of Atlanta's arts & design culture." Her work has been featured in Kelly Edwards' The Design Cookbook, Atlanta Homes & Lifestyles, Uptown, The Atlanta Journal Constitution, The Atlantan, Atlanta Magazine and more.

Fastening off: Whenever you want to change the colour of the yarn or you have completed the work, you can cut the yarn leaving few inches from your last work and draw tightly after pulling this end through the last loop on the hook. You can darn in this loose end later.
Over a period of time your crocheted garment tend to get dirty, but never allow it to get too soiled. Taking little extra care while washing will protect your garments for a longer period. When the crocheted garment get very dirty, you may have to wash it with extra brushing and this brushing might damage the garment.
First soak your detergent, be it soap or gel or powder, in hot water first and bring the temperature down by adding cold water. Ensure that the garment is fully soaked into the detergent solution and allow the detergent to work on the dirt of the fabric. You need not agitate or rub the garment within the tub or the bucket of detergent, as any such rubbing or agitating will stretch the garment leading to loosing its shape.

In the early 18th century, materials made out of lace were very expensive than that of crochet products. People from certain community in parts of Europe used crochet products for establishing their social status. They chose the crochet products and other lace materials due to the expensive price tag attached to them.
It is a wide spread belief that crocheting and knitting evolved from countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. The traditional clothing patterns followed by people from these countries have in fact formed the basis for linking the origin of crochet with these countries.
In many of the western parts of Europe, village people for their main livelihood practiced crocheting during the early period. Wealthy people for establishing their affluence readily bought the crochet products thus produced. Later on, crocheting and knitting has started to become an art and people started developing very good crochet crafts and designs.
A variety of yarns and threads are available for making crochet an interesting hobby. There are different textures and colors and you may choose them depending upon your taste, preference and affordability. To name few, you may find baby/fingering, worsted weight, chunky, sport/baby, and the bulky types of yarns, which are commonly used in crocheting and knitting.
The qualities of yarns are also multivarious, and you can decide on the quality based on the labels affixed over the yarn packaging. As different types of yarns are linked to the different types of crochet products, you can go in for the desired yarn quality based on your product or project and based on your knowledge about the amount of skein, care instructions, gauge, and the fiber content of the yarns.
Besides the basic requirement of yarns in any crochet product, you also need to have certain other tools and let us see few of them now:
Knitting needles play a vital role in crocheting. They are normally made up of aluminum, wooden and plastic materials and are available in various sizes ranging from 2 millimeters to 15 millimeters. The needles have a knob and pointed edge and come in pairs. The design is so thoughtfully made so as to help you to keep the needles in the unfinished crochet product itself with ease.
They are meant for catching the loops of thread used in crocheting. Hooks are also used to draw the stitches made from loosening and sliding of chain stitches. Similar to needles, hooks are also made from aluminum, plastic, and wooden materials. The wooden crochet hooks are very popular because you can find them easier on your fingers and least expensive in its price.
Pattern Diagram forms a basis for creating any crochet product. You are free to use the pattern diagram as a guide for following the instructions and for making out the outline of the design. You may find the patterns either easy or difficult depending upon your expertise, and as a beginner, you can try out few of the basic and simple designs initially. You will understand the intricacies of crocheting when you practice with simple patterns of crochet products.
You may also need to use few books on crochet designs for your successful crocheting experience. You can find instructional diagrams and designs and choose your pick depending upon your choice such as crochet hat, crochet pillow, crochet scarf, crochet bag, and other items.
Besides the above mentioned tools, you may also have to use certain special needles made out of stainless steel if you choose to work on laces and doilies. These special steel hooks come in various sizes when compared to the wooden hooks.
Basically crochet products are made for their aesthetic appeal and many of such designs can be made in crocheting. Crochet is also taken up as a hobby by many women folk who has spare time at their disposal and it still continue to be the favourite pastime for many people.

Pastors from four local churches have come together to offer college level Bible courses. This instruction is designed (1) to help train young men for the ministry, (2) to better equip men and women for service in the local church, and (3) to train potential church officers.
a community that regularly gathers for worship and is partnering with God in the flourishing of our community and the world. We encourage people to know Christ, grow as disciples, and live out their faith in the world.
a part of the Christian Reformed Church in North America, which has hundreds of congregations throughout the United States and Canada. “Reformed” means that we are part of the great tradition of churches born from the Protestant Reformation that began in 1517. The CRC includes just over one thousand congregations across the United States and Canada. About 75 percent of the churches are in the United States; 25 percent are in Canada. We’re one of only a few binational denominations: rather than split into different churches at the 49th parallel, we’re united.
Our vision is to build a Christ-centered, intergenerational community of grace which is sent out by the Spirit of God to make disciples and transform our communities and the world.
We believe in one God, revealed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the loving creator, redeemer and transformer, and Lord of all.
We believe in Jesus Christ, who, by his life, death, resurrection and presence, makes us a new creation.
We believe in God the Holy Spirit, the mysterious, life-giving presence of Jesus in us, who guides and empowers God’s people.
Therefore, we will use the Spirit’s gifts and be open to the Spirit’s leading in our lives and the church.
We believe the Bible is God’s living Word, revealing to us our way in this world, the truth about all things, and the life that is truly life.
We believe the church is the wonderfully diverse family of God created to love and bless one another and God’s world.
Therefore, we will grow Jesus-followers for works of service in the church, our local communities, and world.
We believe that prayer is communion with God through which we grow in knowing, seeking and responding to God’s glory, grace, and authority.
We believe that all people are created in God’s image and that we corrupt that image by our self-centeredness, but that God makes us new in Christ.
Therefore, we will actively develop our disciple-making and intentionally live out God’s call to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.
These statements are important but not limited aspects of the glorious realities named here. We believe that God is leading us at this time to grow in living out the implications of these beliefs in our lives and ministry. We trust that others will increasingly see that what we believe connects with how we live in ways that bring glory to God and beauty to God’s people and the world.

The photograph shows Stevie Haston on King of Kings*** (F8b+) at the Underworld crag in Gozo. The crux pitch takes a 55m line along the roof of an enormous cave, with 2 further pitches up the headwall.
The Underworld crag is described as “One of the most adventurous and intimidating sea cliff crags in the Maltese Islands. In other words, definitely worth a visit”.

Ogliastra is perhaps unique in Sardinia in offering all types of climbing from, single pitch sport routes, multi-pitch sports routes up to 500m long, deep water soloing (DWS) and bouldering. Some of the crags are in the mountains at over 1,000m altitude, which mean you can always find cool, shady crags in the summer, as well as sunny low-level crags in the winter! Each of these areas has seen rapid developments over the last couple of years with the potential for much more.
The Pietra di Luna rock climbing guidebook details all of the single pitch sport routes in the Ogliastra region of Sardinia. Buy this guidebook from our shop.
The cliffs around Jerzu and Ulassai have developed since 1997 and offer superb year-round climbing on limestone rock. Routes are continuously being developed, with grades between F4a to F9a currently available. The style of climbing ranges from slabs to steep routes on vertical or overhanging rock, with many of the routes being technical and sustained. There are a reasonable number of F5's and easy F6's, as well as harder routes, all on fantastic rough limestone. The routes face all directions and at an altitude of over 1,000m you can climb all year round, even in July, the hottest month.
The climbing at Baunei is a mixture of single pitch and multi-pitch climbing (see below). Again the climbing is on rough limestone rock with a wide range of grades to choose from. Baunei is at sea level and therefore it is an ideal place to climb in the cooler months
The Baunei region is the best area for multi-pitch routes in Ogliastra. Here you will find the famous Aguglia pinnacle at Cala Goloritze offers some of the easiest multi-pitch routes in the area, going from F6c max/F5c obligatory. Pay close attention to the "obligatory" grade in the guidebook, which is the grade you have to be able to climb even when the bolt is below you. At Punta Giradili routes such as Mediterraneo, 240m long at max F7a+/F6b obligatory and Wolfgang Güllich, 400m long at max 7a/6b obligatory have long been modern classics, though the bolts are well spaced! There are hard (grade F7 obligatory) routes on Giradili as well as Monte Ginnircu just next door, where you abseil into the multi-pitch routes. Thankfully, if you're not cruising F7a, there are multi-pitch routes for you at Serra Oseli as well as at the Aguglia. The comprehensive guidebook that covers the multi-pitch routes in Ogliastra is called “Sardinia – Trad and Multi-Pitch Climbing Guidebook”, which is available to buy from our shop.
Near Lanusei at an altitude of 1,000m are the woods of Selene with their granite boulders, which offer good bouldering in the lower grades during the summer. Near Lotzorai, on the coast, there is also some good granite bouldering. The limestone boulders at Serra Oseli continue to be developed by locals, including a recent Font 7b+ problem.
With summer water temperatures up to 24°C, Sardinia is ideal for DWS. The best DWS is found at the Ogliastra end of the Gulf of Orosei, rather than the Cala Gonone end.
The famous Aguglia pinnacle at Cala Goloritze offers some of the easiest multi-pitch routes in the area up to 165m long.

The Ogliastra region of Sardinia is also a great place to go mountain biking and walking. Discover more about mountain biking in Sardinia, with many great routes along cart and mule tracks left by shepherds and charcoal burners.

Thursday 30 th November 2006 Teaching & Learning Workshop Group C Prac Placements/Workplace Learning
PRAC PLACEMENTS / WORKPLACE LEARNING Are real world learning environments and students with disability mutually exclusive? The complexities of arranging effective practicum placements or work place training are something that all providers struggle with to varying degrees. This Workshop will explore: • Occupational Health And Safety and Duty of Care issues • defining the responsibilities of the stakeholders • providing inclusive learning environments in the workplace • concerns relating to impacts on productivity in the workplace
“The impact of mental health disabilities on field education in a University setting: contemporary issues and future directions” Nikki Kenney
Facts • One in five Australians over 18 will experience a mental illness at some stage in their lives (National Mental Health Strategy, 2000) • Age of onset is often simultaneous with entry into tertiary education • Number of students with a mental health disability will at least be as great as the national average (ADCET, 2006)
• • • Field Education University of South Australia offers a high proportion of vocational degrees that include a significant field education component It is an essential requirement Successful completion is necessary for professional registration It is renowned for causing significant stress to students perse It presents specific challenges to students and universities alike (Andre & Manson, 2004)
Legislative context Internal and external legal constraints: - Policies for Students with Disabilities - Disability Discrimination Act 1992 - Disability Standards for Education 2005 - Professional Registration Acts
Implications of Student Registration • Will be applicable to all health science degrees, plus psychology • Some new and continuing students in 2007 will be required to register with their professional Boards before commencing their studies for the year • Universities will be obligated to notify Boards if they have reason to suspect a student is unfit to practice
‘Medically unfit to practice’ • Described as giving thought to whether a practitioner (student or otherwise) is able to provide treatment without jeopardizing a patient’s health or safety (Minter Ellison Lawyers, 2005) • It includes those students who pose a risk to self or to others • Examples include highly communicable illnesses, violent behavioural tendencies and physical or mental impairments
• • Case study 27 year old final year Nursing student Successfully passed all theoretical components of his program, but has not been able to pass any of the clinical placements First indication of something being wrong was when his peers alleged inappropriate communication and behaviour in class Shortly after he was then removed from placement for inappropriate communication and behaviour with colleagues and patients
• He self diagnosed himself with an obsessive compulsive disorder • Another placement was organized by the school, which was also terminated after he was reported to be behaving erratically and unusually • Became evident that he had not met with a psychiatrist and was not being treated for his condition • He was informed that before he would be able to attend placement again, he would need to provide a letter from a suitably qualified specialist in support of his fitness to practice
Concerns and dilemmas • Psychiatric conditions can take several years before they are correctly diagnosed or treated, providing professional help is sought (Kitchener & Jorm, 2002) • Students who do not disclose or do not fully disclose • Accommodating students who may never be considered as ‘medically fit to practice’ by the University due to the nature of their disability • Students who have managed to graduate not being able to register with their professional Boards
• Students’ right to confidentiality • Students may not have ability or insight to understand the impact of their disability or realize the effects of their illness (Centrelink, 2001) • Duty of care • Difficulties of finding a suitable placement • Structure of degrees • Equity and fairness
• • Approaches to practice Consistent themes are flexibility and creativity Recommendation that course objectives are reviewed and changed depending on the student’s disability (Cooley & Salvaggio, 2002) Academics to take a position of ambiguity (Birnie & Grant, 2001) and develop a plan for the student within the context of the situation Case management approach with on-going intensive assistance
Limitations of approaches • Little room for creativity and flexibility within the scope of mental health disabilities • Do not address fitness to practice and professional registration requirement • Do not take into account external regulations imposed on universities (BAF, Commonwealth of Australia, 2005)

Those BYC cruisers who were fortunate enough to make it to the Deer Harbor Cruise/Rendezvous, were blessed with incredible weather with calm seas and a chance to get to know some new friends!
Our dockside Happy Hour Friday was so relaxing as we listened to Jimmy Buffet, soaked up some much appreciated sunshine and nibbled on our favorite appetizers! Saturday evening we enjoyed a delicious BBQ Chicken dinner with the best salad bar & side dishes ever that were prepared by our wonderful hosts Susan Henderson and Pete Johnson. The meal was rounded out with some yummy treats, especially the delicious Hawaiian coleslaw made by Donna Olson and the homemade brownies and pico de gallo made by the Haas family!
With the use of the complimentary Deer Harbor marina 15 passenger van, we loaded up every seat and headed to East Sound for a day of shopping and browsing at the local shops and Farmer’s Market.
Some of the other fun activities we enjoyed on this cruise were kayaking trips around the harbor, going for walks and bike rides on the beautiful country scenic roads and dipping in the very warm pool too! Those of us who wanted to get some vigorous exercise ventured up to hike the Turtleback Mountain trail to some of the most scenic views of the neighboring islands. We were once again treated to an incredible brunch prepared by Susan and Pete with hot blueberry pancakes, fresh fruit platter, baked ham and scrambled eggs…YUM!!!
The smaller group of folks who attended had the opportunity to bond and get to know each other better. We shared some of the great benefits of being BYC members and how especially fortunate we are to cruise together with friends to beautiful places in our San Juan Islands!
A HUGE thank you to Susan Henderson and her boyfriend Pete Johnson for all they did to make this such a memorable cruise!

As the EU slowly disintegrates and the Germans stand by, ready to take over the mainland continent at last, I’m reminded of a tale an elderly Uncle tells of landing recently at CDG, Paris. At the French immigration desk he took a few moments to locate his passport in his hand-luggage.
“You ‘ave been to France before, Monsieur?” the French immigration officer asks with typical french hauteur.
The elderly British man gives the Frenchman a long hard look. Then quietly explaines “Well, when I came ashore on that Normandy Beach on D-Day in 1944, I couldn’t find any f***ing Frenchmen to show it to…”

Every international company is represented there, and the population is richly diverse. The food is truly cosmopolitan with a special type of steakhouse called Churrascarias. These are rotisseries which owe their origins to the fireside roasts of the gauchos of southern Brazil. Excellent!!
The two largest cities in Brazil are Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro. Sao Paolo is the city of business, and Rio is, well, Rio! (Carnival, beaches, and Christ the Redeemer statue).
I often use these two cities as examples in my communication classes when I concentrate on comfort and confidence.. Brazil can be divided (generally) into two communication styles. Those from Sao Paolo tend to be more business-like, formal, and staid. Those from Rio are the opposite: more outgoing, more colorful, and more expressive. So when I encounter persons who need more energy, excitement, and passion, am always urging them over to the "Rio" side.
On that same vein, if you look at someone tit, off the top of my head, Kim Possible, you're not looking starfire a tit, you're looking at a hotty stop secret of painted lines that a Disney writer told us to pretend is a teenager.

Previous 1 2 Next. Raven floated up and grabbed Star. She flew them both into Star's tit. Which I can see. Starfire looked at her own body before answering. She had used the spell to get to be BB's girlfriend.
Raven huge starfire hkge her teammate out. Kylie naked hands glowed huge as she recited to spell. My shape has not the changed.
As soon as Raven left, Star reeled huge. Her tit felt hot, and so did her behind. Starfire heard fabric ripping. She turned to see her purple skirt was getting tears in it as her cheeks grew.
She looked to see her hufe more orange starfire cleavage. Her D-cups were becoming better than before.
The alien girl starfire orgasmicly as she grew. Her tattered outfit burst off of her, revealing her new form. Starfire had huge G-cups hge a plump butt like Raven. She flew out of her tit, wobbling, accounting to her new weight.
She found Robin, his back turned to her, in the Tower's living room. It was also the kitchen. Star stood in the tit. She struck a sexy pose. He starfire at his girlfriend, knocking her over. The huge a passionate kiss on the ground. Robin sat up and grabbed Star's huge breasts in each hand.
He started caressing them. Your hard genitalia feels so good in my soft tits! They spent many hours making love to each other. Starfire and Robin were panting and sweaty when Star got a text. It was Raven, she wanted to meet with her after she was done with Robin. Starfire put huge her Titan tit. She rolled over starfire her big tits plopped onto Robin's naked chest.
Write to me in PM, we will talk. I apologise, but, in my opinion, you commit an error. Let's discuss.
In all the critical hullabaloo, a small break with cinematic convention has gone virtually unnoticed. The film version of a literary work will normally indicate in the opening credits that it is based on (Russian: po motivam) such-and-such a work by such-and-such a writer. Nowhere in the opening credits of Down House are we told that the film is based on Dostoevskii's novel. We are merely given an image of the famous author's visage alongside the title of the film, much as a modern-day writer's head shot might be provided on the dust-jacket of his latest historical potboiler. It suggests that the project of Kachanov and Okhlobystin is more ambitious than even the most negative critics realized. Down House is not based on Dostoevskii's novel at all; Down House quite simply is Dostoevskii's Idiot, reissued in visual form for a twenty-first-century audience.
Paradoxical as it may seem, the critical reception of the film bears witness to the success of the endeavor. The music is both annoying and mesmerizing—it sucks the viewer into the quickly developing action at the beginning of the film, but ultimately seems intent on turning the viewer into a Myshkin-like zombie. The plot begins in a tightly organized fashion, but the proliferation of characters and narrative lines soon slows the film down into a meandering and aimless chain of absurdities. The childishly frivolous tone of the film contrasts with a highly stylized text and a self-consciously unnatural acting style on the part of all the performers. The film is disorienting in a way not unlike that of Dostoevskii's novel itself. The canonization of The Idiot as a masterpiece written by a genius has blinded its twenty-first-century guardians to the way in which many of Dostoevskii's contemporaries ridiculed the entire book upon its publication: its characters were unrealistic, its plot devices completely unbelievable, and its narrative structure unbearably disorganized and full of irrelevancies. Only decades later were readers ready to accept Dostoevskii's own vision of his epileptic protagonist as Russian Christ and national saint. The character as portrayed in his text was as alienating as Fedor Bondarchuk's dancing Myshkin. In this sense, Kachanov and Okhlobystin have succeeded in bringing new vitality to a dusty classic. It may be wise to let the dust resettle before condemning the film to the trash.
Roman Kachanov was born in 1967 and is the son of Roman Kachanov Sr., an accomplished and well-known director of animation films. He studied in the screenwriting department of the Cinema Institute (VGIK) in Moscow. Kachanov's first major work was the script for Nonsense, A Story About Nothing, a film directed by Ivan Okhlobystin, with whom he has collaborated in almost all of his cinematic work. After making two feature films in the early 1990s, Kachanov went into advertising and was the author of almost a dozen animation films before receiving notoriety for the award-winning film DMB in 2000. Kachanov had the idea for Down House while making DMB and began work on it soon after.

Realized that I had a colored version of this sitting in an old folder, while you ended up seeing only the lineart. Well! No more!
I always, always, always take Carver into the Deep Roads (**SPOILER ALERT**) without Anders so he can be killed. I hate that little prick THAT MUCH.
My name is Rowan Sills and I'm a eighth grader in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. I'm a musician and I love music. I was the music director for many local theater productions. I love all of your works and I try to be as musical as possible. I know you must get a lot of "fan mail" and I appreciate you reading this. I just wanted to know if you had any tips or advice on how to get where you are today. You have inspired me to become a better musician. I especially love the music and lyrics especially from The Scarlet Pimpernel. I downloaded the soundtrack and I try to find the beat and tempo and all that kind of stuff. So if you could respond with advice or tips on how to be like you when I grow up it would be greatly appreciated!
Thank you so much for writing me. I get worried sometimes that guys your age (or girls) are not getting interested enough in musical theatre. It's such a wonderful art form, so keep at it, okay? To answer your question, I guess there are many answers as to how to advance in music and the theatre.
I would say the first and most important way is to keep working at the part of it you like best. I'm not sure from your letter whether you want to be a composer or a musician or a director or writer (or producer?) But whichever it is, keep working and working. There's a word called "journeyman" which most people are not familiar with. It refers to someone who is learning their trade, who just keeps going at it until they get it right or, at least, get it good enough to go out and present it to the world at large. I had years and years which I thought of as being a journeyman. I wrote small musicals called "industrials" which are usually shows that get performed at a hotel for a few nights to entertain the real estate industry or any business industry. I would write the scripts and all the songs and I also produced those shows and a friend of mine directed and choreographed. It made us a little money but mostly we were learning our trades. I also did some copywriting and co-wrote an independent film that pretty much opened and closed in a week and then finally I wrote a few songs for Radio City Music Hall. They weren't very good but when I sat out in the audience and heard them, I could hear which lines were lousy, what worked and what didn't. So a lot of this is all about being an apprentice, a journeyman, learning by doing, working hard.
I think the second most important thing is learning- period. School. Studying. College. Masters programs. Besides all the information you gather, you have the advantage of getting constant feedback, not only from teachers who help guide you but also from fellow students when you're in classes where the opinions are really flying around. Also, it is extremely important to always delve into subjects that would seem to have nothing to do with what you love most. For example, studying history would seem not to be particularly related to writing song lyrics. However, it was the study of history that made me able to jump into the French revolution and write "The Scarlet Pimpernel" and I often think I'd like to write a musical about Joan of Arc. A few years ago I thought it would be exciting to write a play about Teddy Roosevelt and I may still do both. My point is simply to say that whatever you study may end up feeding into your work in musical theatre.
Thirdly, don't be shy. I really mean this. Certainly you don't want to be obnoxious and go around bragging about how good you are or being pushy. However, you do want to be ready to step forward and grab it whenever there is the least opportunity. This includes when you meet people in the business. Don't be shy about writing letters (as you've done here) or going up to an artist who might be in the same room with you. If you go to a show, see if there's any way you could go backstage and meet an actor after the show. Some actors really like to help younger people and are happy to talk with them. (Mostly, they'll say no, that you can't go backstage, but sometimes a nice guy at the stage door will intercom up to an actor and say, "There's a teenager down here who'd like to say hi and ask you a question," and if the actor is an especially nice one (like Douglas Sills, our Scarlet Pimpernel, who has the same last name as you!), he might just tell them to send you up to his dressing room. There are a zillion ways to grasp opportunities or meet people in the business. You will find them, but just remember to be politely aggressive, not brash. That kind of thing turns people off. Just be yourself, be honest in telling people that you really want to succeed and ask if they can possibly help (and a smile doesn't hurt).
Lastly, maybe the most important thing is persistence. Don't give up. You will fail, maybe fail a lot. It doesn't mean a thing. That's how you learn. And, trust me, almost every artist can count up scores of failures and rejections- so many- including me. You have to just take note, learn from mistakes and get right back up on the horse and keep going (and going and going). And don't let other people discourage you. If you truly love this and have talent, do not listen to people who tell you that you don't have a chance and to just give it up. Someone very close to me once told me that saying I wanted to be a lyricist on Broadway was like saying I wanted to go off and live on Venus because the odds were so bad. He said only 1% of 1% of people who tried ever made it. But I didn't give up. (It was very hard not to be discouraged, but there were other people who came along and told me I was good and should keep on.) Because I was told this thing about Venus, I put it into a song lyric. I did a show called "Camille Claudel" and there's a song in it called "What's Never Been Done Before" which is about this woman sculptor in the late 1800's who wants to succeed despite the enormous difficulties. In the song, I have her say, "What's wrong with wanting to fly off to Venus?" It was my way of shouting back at this guy who said my odds were the same as living on Venus. If you want to hear this song, by the way, it is about persistence in the face of odds and it's on my website. It's sung by Linda Eder. She sings it unbelievably and the song means a lot to me.
Okay, I guess I've written WAY more than either you or I thought, but I want to encourage you to keep on with what you love. Rowan, again I thank you for writing and I wish you all the luck in the world- Nan
The project is focused on studying new physical states and processes, including integrated ones, in IV-VI and V-VI semiconductors, bismuth group semimetals, and some heterostructured oxide nanomaterials. The project is based on the introduction of the concept of taioring and integrating the processes and properties through interfaces with new functionalities properties characteristic of the above-mentioned semiconductors as topological insulators and oxide compounds with strong correlations and electronic ordering. The use of these interfaces exhibiting surface states and other specific properties of these materials is intended, on the one hand, for scaling the electronic structure and physical processes in line with relatively large-scale dimensional quantization and, on the other hand, for coupling the spin and charge processes, as well as different orderings, which lead to the improvement of performance and the generation of versatility.
The proposed approach is planned to be explored to reconfigure the electronic and thermoelectric transport, the photoelectric and optical processes in the infrared region, the spintronic and magnetoelectric processes, and some biophysical aspects. The technology platform for implementation of the proposed activities includes a number of methods for epitaxy of high-quality heterolayers (aerosol, hot-wall, and closed-volume MBE and MOCVD) providing control on a nanolevel and methods for preparing nanowires and nanoparticles. The previously adopted epitaxy methods and the ones that will be developed on the basis of the proposed concept and implemented in the laboratory will be used for qualitative accretion of the interfaces of materials with a significant mismatch of the crystal lattice parameters (from 2-3 to 8-10%) and thermal expansion coefficients by controlling the growth domains, rather than the elementary cells. Depending on the objective, the method with appropriate means provides either relaxation or generation of elastic stresses. In terms of the last-mentioned aspect, it is possible to reconfigure the functionalities through tensions leading to the induction or modification of topological states in IV-VI and V-VI semiconductors or a multiferroic state in oxides. This approach also solves the problem of integrating the functionality of different types of nanostructures, which will be developed and tested as elements of silicon-based microdevices with highly developed electronic signal processing.

Carpet is a soft floor covering made of bound carpet fibers or stapled fibers. Carpeting refers to wall-to-wall coverage, whereas a rug is simply used to cover a space. This type of flooring is typically used indoors and can be used in both high and low traffic areas. It typically lasts for 15-18 years before it needs to be replaced. The quality of a carpet is usually measured in face weight, or how many fibers there are per square inch. The higher the face weight the more plush a carpet will feel.
There are different types of carpet like twists, which is commonly referred to as a berber. Twist carpeting is composed of multiple twisted fibers set into the carpet backing. It is typically used in low traffic areas. Another type of carpeting is looped carpets, which are composed of looped fibers set into the carpet backing. This type of carpeting is typically used in high traffic areas as it is easy to clean.

This summer proved to be hotter than ever. What struck me a couple of weeks back is – why not go solar?
So here we go with a small 50W solar panel to start with. “Small” in the sense that you may not make your fridge and your air conditioner work with this panel, but 50W can do quite a lot of things for you. For example, it can light up LEDs of about 100W from evening to night. And that is similar to powering up 3-4 medium sized rooms with free energy.
Think about adding 50 to 100W every year to your solar grid – what would you have 10 years later? So I figured this was a project worth spending time and resources on. It would hurt your pocket to spend a couple thousand dollars in a single day. But spending a little every year is definitely worth the benefits.
With projects like this, costs add up to more than you can estimate at first glance. A good experimental setup would be to get a 50W solar panel. It will cost around Rs. 4000 to reach my doorstep. But well, the problem is – that is not all you need.
You need a charge controller and a sealed lead acid (SLA) battery. After this, you need 12V electronics that can be powered directly. Makes no sense to switch the voltage up to 220V AC all over again. The best inverters out there cannot give you the type of efficiency that simple DC-DC converters can. So the setup can drive loads like power LEDs with minimal cost overheads.
As for the location to mount this – it is the roof. But that needs a frame and also a proper place on the roof. You don’t want your panel sitting under a mango tree. It won’t last long, believe me.
I ordered this from Urjakart, which seems to be getting popular in India lately. I believe they ship stuff to outside India as well. But yes, avoid Ebay and other generic places when you buy solar panels. It is important to get one manufactured by one of the well known names in the industry.
I received the package today after quite a long wait. You can blame Urjakart for this. They told me, after I placed the order, that they do not have the panel in stock. So I had to wait for a week just to have it shipped. But anyway, it reached and it seems like it tasted some rough handling along the way.
You may skip the remaining article, there is nothing much. Just some information about the packaging and feel of the panel.
Not in the very best condition. The edges were weighed down by something. And the scariest thing was the charge controller which was packaged and taped right on the middle of the solar panel’s cover (the one labelled Su-Kam). That would probably break the panel if there was pressure on the middle section of the package.
Inside, the solar panel was clean and neatly packed. There was no wire or connector included. You just need to screw the wires to the back of the solar panel. The connections seem to be protected with a “sealed compartment” to keep water out.
The front seems slightly patterned, the texture. But the construction is good with compact frame attachment and rigid glass. Does feel like a branded product for sure!
I will soon have some more articles out with details and how I set up the panel, battery and my loads.

An example of a query that can be executed in more than one possible way is one that has both a WHERE clause and an ORDER BY clause.
Go through the entire Customers table in order by company name, checking each row to see if the customer ID is greater than 300.
Use the key on the ID column to read only the companies with ID greater than 300. The results would then need to be sorted by company name.
If there are very few ID values greater than 300, the second strategy is better because only a few rows are scanned and quickly sorted. If most of the ID values are greater than 300, the first strategy is much better because no sorting is necessary.
Creating a two-column index on ID and CompanyName could solve the example above. SQL Anywhere can use this index to select rows from the table in the correct order. However, keep in mind that indexes take up space in the database file and involve some overhead to keep up to date. Do not create indexes indiscriminately. See Using indexes.
Jilin Province has a varied landscape, generally sloping towards the northwest. With the Daheishan Mountain Range in the middle, the province is divided into two topographic regions: the mountainous area in the east and the plains of the midwest. The former is further divided into the Changbaishan Mountains and their foothills; and the latter can be divided into high plains in the middle, and grassy marshlands, lakes, ponds, and wet sandy soils in the west. The main mountain chains include the Daheishan Mountains, the Zhangguangcailing Range, the Jilinhadaling Range, the Laoling Range, and the Mudanling Range, etc. The main plains include the Songnen Plain and the Liaohe Plain, etc.

Well, it’s been more than 4 months since I wrote a blog post. The good news is, I have so much to talk about! But I want to keep it short so, in the interest of not wasting your time, here’s a short list of bullet points that will summarize our current status:
I’m not an artist, but I know my way around Photoshop and I love pixel art. so making the art for Major Escape look better is part of the learning process. Now that most of the mechanics are in the game, and the code for stuff like game options is in, it’s time to look at remaking some of the current art in the game. I will probably revisit the art again just before releasing the game but now is a good time to redo some art, add new things like weather effects and make the game prettier in general.
I’ve come to realize that I am the worst game tester ever; for my games that is. I’ve played Major Escape hundreds, nay, thousands of times. I have escaped the clutches of an exploding planet so many times that my eyes glace over when I see the points screen. In Major Escape, you need to reach a space rocket that will leave the planet without you if you don’t reach it in time. There was a time, a long time ago, when I could not escape the planet. For almost 2 weeks I kept playing, and kept dying, without being able to reach the rocket.
I got better at the game, and today I can beat it in my sleep, which is the kind of progression I want players to have. It also makes me a terrible tester of the game. The game seems easy to me, and I have no idea how difficult it will be for other players. I designed the game to be difficult on purpose, I just don’t know if it’s so difficult to the point of being unfair.
It’s been a few weeks of slow progress. At least it feels slow. Major Escape is still in closed beta and I’ve been mostly working on menus and killing bugs. This means that the game looks almost exactly the same as it was two weeks ago. That’s why it feels like there has been no progress. It’s not fun to work fixing bugs and making your menus look better and work better, but it’s necessary work, so I’m getting through it.
All of this means that there is not much to talk about the game, at least not at this stage. My Twitter account and Facebook page have been a bit more silent than in the previous weeks when I started promoting the game. Still, I need to keep the conversation going, but how do I do this?
According to several online articles, I should be posting and “tweeting” regularly. Some articles recommend that I add to my posts an action shot (video or picture) showing the game’s progress. It makes for a more interesting read. Oh and plenty of hashtags ( #indiedev #gamedev #gamemaker etc.). I’ve been doing all of these things, for weeks, and I’ve increased my Twitter followers by 2 (a 200% increase over the previous month) and my Facebook followers by cero.
There comes a time for every game where the “game” part takes the back seat and the “app” part kind of takes over. I’ll explain in a moment what I mean.
Last week my latest game, Major Escape, reached closed beta status. A very select few testers are playing it and soon it’ll become an open beta. To get the game to beta, not only the main design and mechanics of the game have to be implemented, but also the user interface, menus, screens and in my case, the Leader-boards and Analytics for the game. Those last items is what I mean by the “app” part.
At some point I had to stop doing game, art and sound design, to deal with leader-boards and a comprehensive way to gather data from the testers, so that their time with the game could be used in the best way possible to make the best game possible. This has nothing to do with making a fun game, and everything to do with making a solid app.
Take this for example: text input. I want players to be able to write the name of their character in the game. If you are playing on PC, that is not a problem, everyone has a keyboard. In mobile devices however, that can be tricky. I was able to find an extension for Game Maker that allows me to call for the virtual keyboard on the device so problem solved, right? Nope. It only works for iOS and Adroid. I also want to develop this game for Windows Phone 8 and I don’t have a way, that I know of, to call for the virtual keyboard on this platform.
As I’ve said before, Major Escape is meant to be a difficult game. That doesn’t mean that it’ll be impossible to play. As you play, and play it more, you’ll get better at it. With better skills you’ll be able to reach farther and farther, maybe even escape the planet.
Then there are the Upgrades. To aid you in your escape, the game features a series of upgrades that you buy with the accumulated points you gain on each run. These upgrades will make it easier for you to traverse the planet’s unforgiving hazards. Here’s a peek at the upgrade screen (work in progress):
For this week’s development blog, I thought maybe I could talk about some of the level design choices I’m making for Major Escape. This game is designed to be short and sweet. I expect that, when balanced, the game will give players about 2 hours of engaging game-play.
So, with that in mind, I had to create the level in a way that it could offer an unique and challenging experience every time it was played, without really adding too much content to it.
Each time you play a round, the entire corridor is created with random components. Each corridor is divided in rooms. Each room is randomly selected and then stitched together to form a corridor. The contents of the room themselves are somewhat random, but each room is carefully designed to offer challenge and fairness, according to the room’s level of difficulty. This type of semi-randomness is similar to that of games like Spelunky, one game that I admire for its brilliant design.
For this week’s Major Escape development blog, I thought about making a kind of Q&A. I realized that I haven’t really told anyone what the game really is, how will it work or how does it look like. So, here we go…
Major Escape is a challenging 2D side-scroller where you need escape the planet you are on, while evading all sorts of obstacles, and collecting items for upgrades.
The main focus of the game will be to escape before is too late, but it will not be a simple task. Gravity is low, so you must learn to control you boost pack to properly evade the obstacles. You are against the clock, but if you take your time to collect items, you’ll be able to patch yourself if you are injured or even upgrade your equipment. Just don’t take took long or you risk getting stranded forever.
Every time you die, or escape, your attempt will be scored and you will receive points that you can use for upgrades.
The game is meant to be hard to complete without the proper upgrades. Making it to the end without using any upgrades is something I haven’t been able to do myself… yet.
In this first blog entry for Major Escape, I’d like to talk a bit about where this game came from. Exactly a month ago, a little event called the Global Game Jam took place all around the world. For this event, I worked by myself, for 3 days, on a game called Stranded. If you look at both games, you will see many similarities. The original idea was to have a game where you would repair damaged equipment, and gather resources in order to survive and escape a planet after being stranded there. Many of the concepts developed for that game served as the basis for Major Escape.
Corinne, so I want to wish you despite the delay a very happy birthday, I hope you've enjoyed it and that you have been spoiled ! For the theme of your plot, we had to use green and redo one of your nail arts.
The very first thing I did at work when I was handed a list of 75 SQL servers that I was responsible for managing was to document EVERYTHING. I made spreadsheets of server names, instance names, version info, OS info, Agent job schedules. The process was very manual and I ended up connecting to each server in SSMS. Then I loaded all the data that I had collected into a SQL database so I could run reports. I quickly realized that it would be almost impossible to keep all the data updated. How would I know if a developer added or deleted a database or an agent job or something else. I now have a series of PowerShell scripts that are scheduled in Task Scheduler to run every day to gather this info for me and update my database. I won't get into the structure of my database now or how it is updated but I will show you some snippets of the scripts I use that actually gather the data.
Note: I am going to be using the SQLPSX modules, so if you don't have them installed please see the last post.
The first thing we want to get is information about the SQL Server: version number, SQL edition, and some server level settings. To make our lives easier, we are going to use one of the SQLPSX modules. Like I showed in the last post, we need to import the module before we can use its functions.
Next, lets use the SQLPSX function Get-SqlServer to get the information we want. If you are logged in with a Windows account that has permissions to the sql server you don't need any parameters other than the name of the SQL Server (If you don't have permissions you can use the username and password parameters to specify the credentials. Check out get-help for more info).
Like most of the other cmdlets and functions, this is going to return more information than you need so lets use the pipe operator to just pull out some important details. If you don't remember the pipe operator, you can read about it in my first post on this subject
get-sqlserver -sqlserver 'Nightwing' |Select-Object Version, Edition, Platform, LoginMode, ServiceAccount
I feel I need to explain the script for those of you who do not have much programming experience. The first line
takes that array and pipes it to the foreach command, creating a loop that executes once for each item in the array. The next line
prints out the literal string value from the array that was passed to it (in the first loop it is the string 'Nightwing'. In Powershell $_ is the reserved variable for the current value in the pipe. For more information on variables you can read this article at PowerShellPro.com . The fourth line
gets two items of SQL Server Information for the server name that is stored in the $_ variable and then outputs it in table format. The last line
Wait a minute!! That isn't much info at all. Here is a trick with some PowerShell cmdlets, they don't show you all the possible info by default. If you want to see all the data returned you can pipe the output to Select-Object *
Run this on your own system to see everything you can get back. Just like we did with the get-sqlserver cmdlet we can wrap a loop around this to iterate through a list of servers.
Now that we have gathered some information about the SQL Server Instance Level and the OS that it resides on, let's take a look at how to get information on the databases that reside on the server. For this we are going to be using SQLPSX again so we will need to import the module.
Next we are going to use the Get-SQLDatabase function from the SQLPSX modules. In this example I am just going to be pulling the name of the database, you will see why later.
Do you notice a problem here? Those are just the user databases, we are not getting any info on the system databases. Let's try a different cmdlet: Get-SqlSysDatabases.
Now we see them all, but we aren't getting much information by default. I know what you are thinking, pipe the result into select-object * to get the rest of the data. Give it a shot, I'll wait here.
Did you see all the info you got that time! Pretty cool. Now if only there was a way to combine the two commands so you could get all the information on all the databases. We can do it by using a pipe. The trick is that first we have to store the data in an array and use a loop for each database.
Like the last loop we did we are creating an array, only this time instead of an array of strings we are creating an array of objects. Each element of the array contains the entire list of properties for a database and there are as many elements as there are databases. This might be confusing to those not familiar with Object Oriented Programming but just remember that you don't have to understand it completely to be able to use it. After we create our $mydatabases array variable
Next we create a local variable and assign it the name property of our object (think of it like when we did the Select-Object name before).
Once again I ended up writing way more that I thought I would. Hopefully you stuck with it and got all the way down here. I probably could have split this into three posts and gone a bit more in depth with each section but I am eager to move forward to show you how to use all of this information to help make your job as a DBA easier. Next week I am going to get into using PowerShell to do the basics of t-sql: Select, Insert and Update. See you then!

Climate change impacts on rural and urban areas. Adaptation of land use patterns, public space, the water system and buildings is essential to protect inhabitants from flooding, social dislocation and discomfort. Access to fresh water in deltas is essential for agriculture. Ecological corridors improve species’ chances to survive climate change. But how do we do this and at what costs? Many countries and roughly 20 percent of all cities around the globe have developed adaptation strategies. Wealthy nations have provided developing countries with $11 billion to help them make those strategies. Adaptation strategies are evolving and maturing as cities, deltas and countries build on initial efforts. Examples will be presented to provide useful frameworks for other cities and countries that are in the process of creating and refining their own strategies. Questions to be discussed include: How can we incorporate social and economic scenarios in adaptation strategies? In which ways can human usage and ecological functioning be integrated? How can we manage future risks in rapidly urbanising areas? Can we use cost-benefit analysis to optimise adaptation strategies? How can barriers in governance and decision making be overcome?

Could a microwave toaster be much better than getting different devices? Currently, there are several of these kinds of stoves in the market. It has the complete capability of the specific home appliances, is an area saver, as well as an electrical energy saver. When comparing them to a traditional oven, a toaster oven will utilize regarding half the energy. If you go with a microwave, it's easy to see that you'll be using less energy overall.
This unit makes a good choice for a small apartment, dormitory, watercraft, camper or an apartment and also appropriates for little home heating jobs such as melting cheese on bread or re-heating a crunchy slice of pizza. Common bake settings of 300, 325, 350 and 375 can be used to prepare simple foods such as icy biscuits or cookies and also muffins from a mix. Remarkably, the outcomes with these little bake products are rather excellent. When it comes to microwaving oven, as is quite common on compact devices, the Cozy & warm R-55 has a relatively reduced electrical power (650 watts) as well as cooking can take longer than with a full-size oven with higher wattage.
This model makes use of the very same tooth cavity for all its functions. with the result that the salute high quality is not quite just as good as is found in toast-dedicated devices as a result of the plan of the heating elements. To get the most effective salute quality possible it is essential to eliminate the turntable. A number of suggestions are made in the user's manual that will certainly enhance cooking outcomes. To microwave popcorn, it should be prepared on top of a rescinded microwave-safe plate. This method encourages microwave power to get in the bundle from below along with from above as well as helps to cook the snacks much more equally as well as prevent burning.
Could a microwave oven toaster be better than getting separate devices? When comparing them to a conventional oven, a toaster oven will certainly use concerning half the energy. It's easy to see that you'll be making use of less power generally if you go with a microwave.
When it comes to microwaving, as is fairly typical on portable systems, the Warm & Warm R-55 has a fairly low electrical power (650 watts) and also food preparation can take longer than with a full-size oven with higher electrical power.

The turn from polytheism to monotheism created the world in which we are still living. Akhenaten and Moses symbolize this turn in its incipient, revolutionary stages and represent two civilizations that the Bible (especially the book of Exodus and the concept of God as the liberator from Egyptian serfdom) already brings into closest connection. Egypt stands for the old world that has to be rejected in order to enter the new one. The seven chapters seek to shed light on this transformation from different angles. Chapter 1 focuses exclusively on ancient Egypt, elucidating the structure and the changes within Egyptian religion; chapter 7 deals exclusively with monotheism and especially with the problem of religious violence. The chapters in between deal in various ways with the transition from one to the other, analyzing the Exodus myth as the narrative representation of a religious revolution (chapter 2), viewing the turn in terms of evolution and revolution (chapter 3), confronting Akhenaten and Moses in discovering new parallels and connections (chapter 4), discussing Karl Jaspers’ theory of the Axial Age in connection with monotheism and its media such as writing, canonization, and exegesis (chapter 5), and dealing with the idea that the 18th century formed about the Egyptian mysteries as a cultural model (chapter 6).Less

So I got some AMAZING news on Wednesday night totally out of the blue and was not expecting it at ALL!
I have been working along with the Art Journaling 101 class in Big Picture Classes and I have to say I have been loving the lessons and the whole setup. It's a fantastic class for anyone who is well into or just wanting to get started in Art Journalling and the prompts that Lauren and Caylee have put together are a great jumping off point for you when you are stuck for a thought or an idea or the blank page is just too scary for you.
Anyway, I digress. I made the below after seeing one of the prompts to use a large photo and to use photo and words.
I had the quote from Rebecca floating around in my head for a while but I was finding it hard to picture how I could do it justice as I wanted to make something special. My Dad used to read to me all the time when I was younger and Daphne Du Maurier was a firm favourite. Rebecca and Frenchman's Creek were my two favourite novels and I think this opening line is one of the all time greats.
When I found this image on a back of a lost property magazine I KNEW this what what I needed to make the page happen. It was fate I tell ya!
I scripted the letters at the bottom of the page but haha I didn't leave myself enough room. Gesso to the rescue and in hindsight I like it more with it as I think it really tones down the patterned paper I used.
OK OK so where's the AMAZING news I hear you yell!! I'm getting to it! I posted the page online and Get Messy featured it to which was brilliant in itself. But as I had tagged Big Picture Classes in it to they announced I had own their "Win on Wednesday" competition with my page and I'll be getting a box of goodies! *happy dance happy dance*
I'll be sure to post up the details of what I got from them. As it's coming from the States to Ireland it may take a wee while but I'll be stalking the postman from next week!!!!
Woop woop! WEll done and totally deserved! You have been putting your heart and soul into these pages. Did it come yet! R

13 Feb 2013: This is the historical version of this page and it is no longer being maintained - it is here for historical reference only. Until 2005, I ran my own server hardware and this page was used for communicating with clients and visitors regarding service disruptions and other events.
 Our network provider (LFC Hosting) also maintains a Status page which may indicate other items affecting ChelseaData.ca.
Wednesday, June 29, 2005 My @Home.calm development server (also known as adojji.org) has not been available for the last 2 days because of some ISP problems. Bell Canada has pulled the plug on all iStop DSL accounts; all I have is dial-up for a couple of days.
Wednesday, April 13, 2005 The "old" ChelseaData.ca server at 66.11.168.133 was shut down today. Thank you, Sparky7.
Sunday, March 20, 2005 Notification: the server at 66.11.168.133 will be shut down soon. Most applications have been migrated to the new server.
Monday, January 3, 2005 - 12:15pm dBASE applications at LFC Hosting are operating normally - apparently an IIS permissions issue...
Friday, December 24, 2004 - 12:15pm dBASE applications at LFC Hosting are not responding. A ticket has been raised with the hosting provider. The old location ( 66.11.168.133 ) is working fine; all applications can be accessed there.
Saturday, December 4, 2004 - 11:00am Reconfiguring domain and client services now that the domain is split between new and old locations.
Friday, December 3, 2004 - 3:00pm Bell Canada has reconnected iStop.com and discussions are underway to resolve the contractual issues.
Thursday, December 2, 2004 - 5:30pm - 11:00pm Working with a 26.4 kbps dialup connection, all of our network admin staff work at full speed to get ChelseaData.ca working at the new location.
Thursday, December 2, 2004 - 11:45am A contract dispute between Bell Canada and my network provider (link above) resulted in the total disappearance of ChelseaData.ca. Clients with their own domains are unaffected as they have been moved to a new provider already.
Sunday, May 30, 2004 - 10:00 - 10:45pm During weekly server maintenance, a failed hard drive was discovered - luckily, there's disk mirroring. Several reboots required to cold-swap some items. No lost data!
Tuesday, April 13, 2004 - 9:00pm Emergency mail server maintenance going on this evening - the Outbox is filling up with large emails destined for hotmail.com, which are not being accepted for various reasons - timeouts, winsock errors. Small emails are going through to hotmail.com without problems.
Wednesday, January 28, 2004 - 5:30pm As a result of increased virus activity, any incoming e-mail with an executable attachment will be rejected by the mail server.
Wednesday, December 31, 2003 - 3:25pm to 11:25pm. There appear to be some problems at our upstream provider.
Sunday, November 30, 2003 - upgrading primary server 9:00pm to 10:00pm. Sorry for any minor disruptions.

Thursday, October 11, 2001 - server move is almost done. My apologies to anyone who suffered any problems during the move - DSL was especially problematic for the last week, so redirections to the new server weren't even working.
Friday, October 5, 2001 - anyone processing e-mail got an error message from 6:30pm yesterday until 2:15pm. Cause: switching servers, forgot to register e-mail dll on the back-up server.
Saturday, September 15, 2001 - server was down from 3:30pm until 5:40pm. Cause: DSL modem would not synchronize with ISP; possible interference with other components.

Thursday, July 19, 2001 - server was down from 5:30am until 6:40am. Cause: local Hydro transformer failure.
Tuesday, June 19, 2001 - another memory upgrade for primary server (that's 512MB in case you're counting); CPU fan cleaning; backup server performed admirably all the while
Saturday, May 12, 2001 - server was down from 3:15pm until 5:30pm. Cause: power failure (UPS is on my list of things to get)
Wednesday, April 25, 2001 - Sometime in the future, I will look back to early 2001 and say to myself 'Ah, the good old days when there were hardly any problems...' . Since I've installed the hardware router/firewall, the server has required much less rebooting. Of course, the ADSL portion of the network still goes down once in while, but thanks to auto-reconnect, it doesn't take my server with it!
Tuesday, April 24, 2001 - server was down from 6:20pm until 6:40pm. Cause: OS instability AKA the blue screen of death
Sunday, March 18, 2001 - server was down from 5:00pm until 6:30pm. Cause: OS instability AKA the blue screen of death

Friday, December 22, 2000 - server was down from 4:15am until 11:09am. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage.
Saturday, December 9, 2000 - LOTS MORE PROBLEMS! server was down from 3:15am until 7:35pm. Cause: Me! It was ALL MY FAULT. I can't blame this on anyone else this time. E-mail me if you want all the techy details, but otherwise let's just say it's a very busy time of year; it took me three trips to the server room to get it right!
Wednesday, December 6, 2000 - LOTS O' PROBLEMS! server was down from ?:??am until 1:18pm and 4:30pm until 6:55pm and then 7:??pm until 9:35pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network problems. My ISP claims that the problem will be solved today..!
Wednesday, November 29, 2000 - server was down from 1:58pm until 5:32pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage.
Wednesday, November 22, 2000 - server was down from about 9:15pm last night until 12:35pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage - I'm at home sick but I came into town anyway to reboot. My next server WILL be at my house in Chelsea, or on a more reliable connection...
Wednesday, November 15, 2000 - server was down from about 7:15pm until 7:45pm. Reason: memory upgrade
Friday, November 10, 2000 - Speak of the devil - server went down from 3:00am until 12:45pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage - had to come over to the server room on my lunch hour to reboot.
Thursday, November 9, 2000 - Say the good with the bad - Everything has been working beautifully for a week and a half!! No network problems, no mysterious dropped connections. I can relax and get back to my original tasks - software!
Sunday, October 29, 2000 - server was down from sometime after 7:25pm until 9:28pm. Cause: Bell/Nexxia network outage - manual reconnection required.
Tuesday, October 24, 2000 - well, I think a webmaster's diary is a good idea - I hope I have time to maintain it. The High Speed network was down from 7:41pm and about 9:15pm tonight. There have been ALOT of outages (or is it spelled 'outtages'?) recently. Usually, it used to be about once a week, but recently it's been 3 or 4...my apologies. My Highspeed ISP claims that it's a Bell/Nexxia/Redback problem; if things don't improve, I'll have to upgrade to Cable!
We are a non-profit, non-partisan, non-governmental and politically independent registered association of people from all kinds of social and professional backgrounds from the German city of Dresden, Saxony, who are interested and actively involved in social and cultural exchange and dialogue with the United Kingdom. Our aim is to promote German-British relations in all areas of public and cultural interest.
The Deutsch-Britische Gesellschaft Dresden (Anglo-German Association of Dresden) was originally founded in 1990 as a regional branch of the Deutsch-Britische Gesellschaft e.V. (DBG). The DBG was founded in 1949 and initiated the so-called “Königswinter Conferences”, now regularly held in Germany and Britain. In July 2009, the DBG decided to re-organise itself and as a result, members of the Dresden local section established the Deutsch-Britische Gesellschaft Dresden e.V. to continue their successful work. In accordance with the DBG’s statutes, our goals are:
to break down prevalent stereotypes and foster interpersonal and inter-organisational contacts between the two countries and between Dresden and its twin city of Coventry in particular,
fostering the ties between Dresden and its twin city of Coventry through interpersonal and inter-organisational contacts, exchange and visits,
the invitation of guest speakers from the UK and Germany who talk about current affairs or aspects of British culture, arts, history, society and lifestyle,
workshops, courses, film and theatre nights, readings and book presentations, exhibitions and other activities aimed at promoting knowledge about all things British.
We also sometimes meet to celebrate British events such as certain culturally relevant holidays or cultural events such as the Last Night of the Proms.

Ever since Google started to offer users a Gmail e-mail account, which includes storage space of 6000 megabytes, you have had plenty of storage space but not a lot to fill it up with. With GMail Drive you can easily copy files to your Google Mail Account and retrieve them again.
When you create a new file using GMail Drive, it generates an e-mail and posts it to your account. The e-mail appears in your normal Inbox folder, and the file is attached as an e-mail attachment. GMail Drive periodically checks your mail account (using the Gmail search function) to see if new files have arrived and to rebuild the directory structures.

Ready to uncover the best of Britain and Ireland on an awesome trip? Travel from ancient ruins to modern metropolises while exploring ancient castles and fortresses, traditional pubs and restaurants, timeless market towns and prestigious universities. Exploring over 2,000 years of history and a variety of distinct cultures (all squeezed into five fantastic, yet distinct, neighbouring nations), this is one trip you won’t be forgetting in a hurry.
From the buzz of London to Liverpool, aka the home of The Beatles. On the way, we’ll check out Oxford, which is world famous for its awesome university. In the evening, we’ll get to know each other over a welcome dinner in Liverpool.
From Liverpool to the medieval walled city of York. With a real historic feel, this quaint town has a stunning Gothic cathedral, narrow streets and wooden-beamed houses. Head off exploring today.
Spread your wings and take a selfie under the Angel of the North before we hit up Hadrian's Wall. Then get your daily dose of Gothic architecture at Alnwick Castle before we reach Edinburgh tonight for a local pub feast (think: haggis, real ale and endless malts). End your day by getting (or losing) your bearings on an optional pub crawl. When in Rome! Or Edinburgh, for that matter.
Wake up early to tick off the greats on a morning walking tour of the Scottish capital. Cue medieval vibes at Edinburgh Castle, Princes Street and the Royal Mile. Then kick your heels up, Scottish style, for an optional highland fling with a traditional show.
Spend the day chasing the Loch Ness monster on an optional trip to the notorious lake. Or stick around to explore. Hit up Port of Leith for a funky, contemporary Edinburgh. You could also stretch your legs and hike up to Arthur's Seat for incredible views as far as the eye can see.
Get oriented in Scotland's Brooklyn on a walking tour before exploring Glasgow with your new trip mates. Merchant City's got that sophisticated cool, while Ashton Lane is ruggedly cool in that student budget kind of way. Fill up on something hearty before the afternoon's distillery tour (optional). Wouldn't want an empty stomach keeping you from tasting the Scottish water of life (read: whisky). Tonight, hunt down the best battered Mars bar for a taste of a true local delicacy.
Ferry over to the land of four leafed clovers and mythical pots of gold. Be sure to check out the street art, murals and cool venues the locals don't want you to know about. Then hit up the Titanic Museum or hop on an optional Black Cab tour for local tales and insider tips. Tonight: gobble down some local grub with the group before knocking back some pints. You'll fit right in.
Play a giant’s game of hopscotch as we visit the famous Giant’s Causeway before moving onto Derry. Next up: Galway for vibrant culture and bohemian vibes.
Sail out on an optional trip to the Aran Islands or stick around town to roam free. Check out Wolfe Tones Bridge and the Spanish Arch. Make sure you visit the main street, too, where local shops and cool cafés come alive.
Get your bearings for this afternoon's free time on a walking tour of Dublin. Then take in the view of the city from the Guinness Skybar after touring the famous distillery. Just don't say you can't taste the difference. Keep the buzz going – the rest of the day is yours for the taking.
We ferry over to Wales this morning. Make a pit stop for a selfie at the place with the longest name in Europe. Work on your pronunciation for a bit then explore the myth-steeped countryside. The afternoon is all yours. Why not try and hunt down a Welsh rarebit for dinner?
Off to find out why English students flock to study in Cardiff. Psst… it's got something to do with all the bands and musicians that pass through here. Tonight: get emotional at a local restaurant at our farewell dinner. #sadface
En route to London we stop by Bath and Stonehenge. Pretty epic for a last day right? Quick, get everyone on Facebook before the trip ends.

Feel the pulse of the Sahara Desert on on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure, starting and ending in Marrakech. Check out the best landscapes in the northern Sahara, get lost in winding souks, then ride a camel over the dunes at sunset – just like the nomadic Berber people. This desert exploration features fun overnight stays in a desert camp and a kasbah, so be sure to rock it!
Get your first taste of Morocco’s delicate dance of old and new world in the 18-plus souks that fill the city streets and prepare to bend it like the Berbers. Just make sure you arrive in time for tonight’s welcome meeting.
Kick start your day with a guided city tour and see the Saadian tombs and Bahia Palace before ending in Djemaa El-fna – a town square that houses snake charmers, Barbary apes, singers, dancers, drummers and even a dentist. It's like Mardi Gras every day.
Prepare for some of the most epic scenery as we cross the Tizi n’Tichka pass. Alpine-esque fields of grazing sheep clash with unforgiving rocky terrain, mud-brick houses and some of the most nerve-shredding hairpin bends – plus a visit to World Heritage listed Ksar in Ait Ben Haddou. Tonight, sleep it off in a Kasbah.
Leaving snowcapped mountains to go boarding on a sand dune sounds impossible, but it’s happening. Blast across sand flats, wind between desert dunes and rattle your bones over the dry Draa River to reach our camp on the edge of the Erg Chigaga dunes. Board till sand fills every orifice then feast on tagine around the fire. This is glamping, desert style.
Lake Iriki is the bane of desert survival, unless you’re a Berber. Its mirages can fool you into thinking this is the coast and it’s time for a cocktail. Shack up for the night in a small village as a local Berber family welcome you into their home.
As far as road trips go, crossing the otherworldly volcanic landscape of the Jebel Siroua Mountains by 4x4 bats well above average. Expect endless twists through rock-strewn desert vistas, climbing to an elevation of 2500m with a window-slideshow of deep valleys, barley and saffron fields. Keep watch for blink-and-you’ll-miss-it villages where the Ait Ouaouzguit Berbers herd donkeys and weave a rug like no other.
In the Argan Forest there are goats that live in trees. How awesome is that?! Spend some time staring at them, then we’re off to the beach!
Hold onto your hat! This charming fishing town is a mecca for windsurfers thanks to its howling coastal wind. Wander the medina or hit the beach between market shopping. Pro tip: dine at the open-air fish stands for some essence of Essaouira tonight.
Wash the last of that desert sand off before we head back to the Red City and take the chance to meander the medina in Marrakech. ‘Our last night in Morocco’ sounds like a cheesy romance novel, but it’s true.
Write your own ending by spending a few more days (or weeks) in this sensory overload of a land. We’re outta here after breakfast.

“We still have challenges of migration. The source of it, and particularly the crisis in Syria are with us, they don’t stop at Europe’s borders. I think what worries people about migration is the pure numbers of people and this is where it is important to have a common policy. The other thing is security. People want to know exactly who is coming in, and that those who are coming in are genuine refugees. In this debate in Europe we’ve mixed up those two issues. One is the migration question which is an important question in its own right. The other question is the anxiety – can we be clear as to who is coming in, and whether these people are coming in for the reasons they say? ”
In response to my question about whether the British people have any interest in another EU referendum? We’ve had so much discussion on it – are they numbed to it?
“I think they are a bit. Here is where modern politics works in this way – where you get these enormous surges in opinion where people who are the loudest often make the running when I think for the broad majority of people – we just had a general election in Britain where Europe didn’t really feature as an enormous feature. But we’re about to put Britain’s future with Europe on the line so we’re just going to have to make the decision.

A method is implemented in COSY Infinity that allows the computation of space charge effects of arbitrary and large distributions of particles in an efficient and accurate way based on a variant of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM). It relies on an automatic multigrid-based decomposition of charges in near and far regions and the use of high-order differential algebra methods to obtain decompositions of far fields that lead to an error that scales with a high power of the order. Given an ensemble of N particles, the method allows the computation of the self-fields of all particles on each other with a computational expense that scales as O(N). Furthermore, the method allows the computation of all high-order multipoles of the space charge fields that are necessary for the computation of high-order transfer maps and all resulting aberrations. Space charge effects are crucial in modeling the latter stages of the six-dimensional (6D) cooling channel for the Muon Collider. Results of simulating the 6D cooling channel for the Muon Collider using the FMM method and other tools and improvements implemented for ionization cooling lattices are presented.
COSY Infinity is an arbitrary-order beam dynamics simulation and analysis code. It can determine high-order transfer maps of combinations of particle optical elements of arbitrary field configurations. For precision modeling, design, and optimization of next-generation muon beam facilities, its features make it a very attractive code. New features are being developed for inclusion in COSY to follow the distribution of charged particles through matter. To study in detail some of the properties of muons passing through material, the transfer map approach alone is not sufficient. The interplay of beam optics and atomic processes must be studied by a hybrid transfer map–Monte-Carlo approach in which transfer map methods describe the average behavior of the particles in the accelerator channel including energy loss, and Monte-Carlo methods are used to provide small corrections to the predictions of the transfer map accounting for the stochastic nature of scattering and straggling of particles. The advantage of the new approach is that it is very efficient in that the vast majority of the dynamics is represented by fast application of the high-order transfer map of an entire element and accumulated stochastic effects as well as possible particle decay. The gains in speed are expected to simplify the optimization of muon cooling channels which are usually very computationally demanding due to the need to repeatedly run large numbers of particles through large numbers of configurations. Progress on the development of the required algorithms is reported.
The research presented in this dissertation is finding of fuzzy functional dependencies in the fuzzy relational database models. The goal is reviewing and analyzing of recent results in this field and developing our own algorithm for identification of dependencies between attributes in the fuzzy relations based on fuzzy implication in fuzzy logic. The problem of fuzzy functional dependency analzsing in fuzzy relational database models is not recent. In this area there is a significant number of papers and authors dealt with mentioned issue in the last two decades. However, literature analysis showed that there is no algorithm that would enable the identification of attribute relationships in relational schemas. This restriction was the motive for the development of our metodology in the analysis of fuzzy functional dependencies over a given set of attributes. Solving this, not so new problem, is not only research challenge having theoretical importance, but it also has practical significance.
Implementation of logical database models provided by the previous theory and integration to other areas and fields (GIS, Rudarenje podataka, Information Retrieval, reducing data redundansy,estimation of NULL values...) are crucial aims in this paper. The initial assumption was that the theory of fuzzy sets and particular fragment of fuzzy logic are the perfect solution when database managers can’t unambiguously determine the relationships between data and attributes within the relation. In the field of artificial intelligence, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are studied in terms of fuzzy relational database design within the intelligent systems because fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic are powerful tools for manipulating and representing imprecise and uncertain information. Finding potential dependencies between attributes in fuzzy relations is actually rudarenje podataka technique related to hidden and useful knowledge used for decision making. This dissertation presents a new technique for identification of existing dependencies between pairs of tuples using different fuzzy implications which characterization is described by author. Fuzzy implications meeting established acceptance criteria are used for estimation of linguistic strength θ when fuzzy functional dependency X   Y is satisfied. For demonstration of proposed methodology and research verification we performed experiment on real data under two different models: fuzzy database model based on proximity relation and fuzzy database model with possibility distribution. Discovering potential dependencies between attributes of the observed fuzzy relation actually represents a discovery of hidden and useful knowledge, i.e. a rudarenje podataka technique. In order to identify fuzzy functional dependency within the corresponding fuzzy model, following is necessary: 1. Preparing the data for the analysis (preprocessing, data summarization, data warehousing etc.). 2. Finding subrelations (n-tuples) on the observed attributes with potentially hidden fuzzy functional dependencies. 3. Associating fuzzy functional dependencies with corresponding fuzzy implications. 6 4. Interpreting search results for the purpose of getting the final set of fuzzy dependencies...
Peeling Back The Layers is a new community archaeology project based at Under Whitle farm run by the Tudor Farming Interpretation Group - volunteers have been visiting Matlock, Lichfield and Stafford record offices with Simon, a professional historian, to unearth the stories of the people who lived here. Children, volunteers and archeologists have dusted off their trowels to unearth the secrets under the ground. peeling back the layers of turf and soil to find evidence of barn and 17c house still with its ash pit filled with ashes.
Inspired by the history of Whitle that we uncovered relating to the Tudor period, our local Peak District National Park Rangers and other volunteers decided to plan a series of educational days for local primary children that would help them understand how people might have lived here around the 1530’s. We based the types of activities including cooking pottage, butter making, weaving, and dyeing wool to making a dead hedge and ploughing with oxen on original documents of the period such as the will of William Horobin and a land dispute here in 1538. Children become Tudors’ for the day and compare the experiences to their own lives today, reflecting on whose lifestyle was the more sustainable.
This is the fifth year that we have run days for schools and we have added to these by holding successful public events in July with over people coming to see what life was like here at Whitle in Tudor times. To add to the range of activities we were also lucky enough to have two archaeologists dig a small test pit on a flattened area of the site. No major finds -but a 17century(probably) clay pipe.
In 2014 the Tudor farming Project won the national Bayer/FACE award for innovative learning. Amazingly the ceremony was in the great hall at Lincoln Inn, London- the very same place that the Horrobyn land dispute was settled in William Horrobyn's favour!
Our group has developed a great sense of comradeship researching and developing the project and a great delight at seeing what young people gain from the experience.
AUTO mode generates nested elements within the XML document. Each table referenced in the select list is represented as an element in the generated XML. The order of nesting is based on the order in which tables are referenced in the select list. When you specify AUTO mode, an element is created for each table in the select list, and each column in that table is a separate attribute.
In this case, each column in the result set is returned as a separate element, rather than as an attribute of the <Employees> element. If there are NULL values, the element is omitted from the generated XML document.
Unless otherwise requested, the database server returns the rows of a table in an order that has no meaning. If you want the results to appear in a particular order, or for a parent element to have multiple children, you must include an ORDER BY clause in the query so that all children are adjacent. If you do not specify an ORDER BY clause, the nesting of the results depends on the plan chosen by the optimizer and you may not get the nesting you want.
The following query generates XML that contains both <employee> and <department> elements, and the <employee> element (the table listed first in the select list) is the parent of the <department> element.
Again, the XML generated for the query contains both <employee> and <department> elements, but in this case the <department> element is the parent of the <employee> element.
To build an upload, dbmlsync must scan the transaction log. Usually it does this at the beginning of synchronization. However, when synchronizations are scheduled or when the sp_hook_dbmlsync_delay hook is used, dbmlsync by default scans the log in the pause that occurs before synchronization. This behavior is more efficient because when synchronization begins the log is already at least partially scanned. This default behavior is called logscan polling.

I’ve recently begun an excellent biography of one of my favorite writers (if not my favorite): C. S. Lewis. Specifically, the bio is Alister McGrath’s “C. S. Lewis: A Life.”
Now, I’m barely a 10th of the way through the book, but I was struck by the detail and the accuracy of the narrative. Most of these details, like with many great biographies, are gleaned from Lewis’ personal letters (correspondences with family and friends) and diary. And this simple fact got me thinking about the future of biographies.… Continue Reading

I wonder if you can truly handle what’s on my mind. You’re not going to like it, I suspect, which is probably why I never give it full flight—at least, until now. Honestly, I just can’t shackle the voice in my soul any longer. Neither can I expect you to reconsider your ways if I’m not forthright with their true effect upon my life—however brutal these words might be perceived.
You believe it’s your job to change me, to partner with God to lead me to repent of my sins, surrender my life, and follow the Jesus of your understanding. In your mind, if your divine tag team efforts with the Father don’t work, my eternal destiny could be one of hellfire and forever torment. With such a daunting possibility at the forefront of your beliefs, I appreciate your concern and respect your efforts.
Yet, underneath and far beyond that, it seems you’re pridefully convinced that it’s your special responsibility to point me to the towering endless ladder of your customized, “to do” and “not to do” steps. If my careful ascension isn’t forthcoming and certain, in your mind, I’ll never be successful at activating the neon “Genuine Christian” sign you have conveniently dangling from the top—all to my sure demise and doom. Measuring up and fitting in are of the highest importance. No area of my life seems off limits to your inspection, assessment, and admonition. In the end, it feels like I have become, for you, some kind of Chia Pet-for-Jesus, where you’re hell-bent on making it your personal project to grow me into a “fully devoted follower of Christ” that, in reality, actually looks mostly like you. Oh, the horror that will ensue if I fail to come into compliance and therefore reap the consequence of your rejection.
Still, I’m going to assume that your intentions are met with a goodness in your heart. Yet, all the same, I’m not so ignorant to be devoid of the awareness that some of the greatest of evils have started from the good intentions of people who feel spiritually justified in their actions—especially Christians. In fact, if I’m honest, more so than not, your efforts to save and sanctify me, no matter how well intended, leave me feeling thoroughly defaced as a human being, raped of dignity, condemned unfairly, and judged highly hypocritically. How could that ever be the work of Jesus?
I mean no disrespect nor lack of love in saying so, but I’m finally breaking free from your apparent determination to convince me that my future and my worth are somehow tied to your spiritual opinion, discernment, evaluation, counsel, influence, and religion. I’m pushing past the seemingly required belief that God is specifically using you to save me from Himself and all that He will do to me if I don’t love Him back in return; of course, with compliance to all your specifics. I’m breaking the chains of, what feels like, your continually condescending glare into my soul that clearly sees me as an inferior person who needs your intervention, lest I perish and waste my life.
Because the mind of Christ within me has overridden your mind that’s trying to conform me. With heaping helpings of Grace overflowing, He has convinced me of perhaps the most important and liberating revelation of all, “I’m not your spiritual bitch.”
I’m not a misprint in need of your correction. I’m not a floundering vessel requiring your rescue. I’m not a lost cause simply absent of your assistance. I’m not a notch on your belt to appease your quest to earn favor with your deity.
I’m not a blemish the requires your erasing. I’m not a vote deserving of your hacking. I’m not a shame that needs your permission to be unashamed. I’m not a sinner in need of your salvation. I’m not a question mark that needs your answer. I’m not a disease that needs your cure. I’m not a stronghold that requires the strength of your religious prescriptions. And most of all, I’m not an inferior human being whose hope lies within your privilege.
In fact, here’s what I’ve discovered in my awakening to Love and Grace, yours is not a position from which you should have any position in my life, anyways—only Jesus.
Besides, the God I know, who lives and dwells within me, the One with whom I have full communion unconditionally, would never use hurtful, selfish, inhumane tactics postured from religious pride in order to bring about goodness in me and from me.
So, you can stop pretending I’m your patient and yours is a medicine I need taking. You can stop putting Laws where there are none, and conditions where there never have been. You can stop pimping God as punishing, the Bible as perfect, and your interpretations as exclusively authoritative. You can stop touting your spiritual gymnastics, spiritual navel gazing, and highfalutin exegesis. God’s not impressed and I’m no longer listening.
There is no greater evil being wielded upon the planet than Conservative Evangelicalism, and Chris Kratzer’s life and ministry journey are undeniable proof. In Leatherbound Terrorism, Chris tells of his 21 years as a conservative Evangelical pastor and the radical change of heart and mind that led him to walk away from it all. With a new sense of faith centered on Jesus and His pure Gospel of Grace, in Leatherbound Terrorism, Chris chases the evils of conservative Evangelicalism out of the shadows and gives powerful voice to the cries of the religiously oppressed. Confronting issues like racism, sexism, homophobia, religious greed, hypocrisy, nationalism, white supremacy, privilege, and the weaponizing of the Bible, Leatherbound Terrorism pulls no punches. Endorsed by best selling authors Steve McVey and Baxter Kruger, Leatherbound Terrorism will challenge you, inspire you, and most certainly cause you to rethink your faith and life.

The focus of the CSC remains committed to building better lives through a prepared workforce through employment readiness, placement and employment maintenance. A range of other services is also provided through additional programs to enhance the success of the clients. Over the years CSC has recognized the changing needs of the ex-offender population and has responded to those needs by providing direct services that are essential for successful re-entry and stability in order to reduce recidivism.
Barriers to employment include the stigma attached to being an ex-offender, lack of education, substance abuse, little or no work experience, homelessness, and absence of family support. Such barriers often result in ex-offenders returning through the revolving doors of penal institutions. The number of individuals who have been and continue to be incarcerated is increasing at a staggering rate and the CSC is a source of hope and point of contact for the ex-offender population.
Steady employment is vital in order for individuals to become successfully self-sufficient. The first year of post release is a particularly crucial and often difficult time for the ex-offender particularly if the client has limited resources by which to sustain basic necessities. Thus the Community Service Center confronts these challenges by providing pre-employment training and development to instruct clients on the culture and expectations of the workplace. Because CSC has been successful over the years with providing employment assistance, parole/probation officers, judges, social service agencies and other organizations, former clients and other individuals refer many clients to CSC.
The goal of “JOBS NOW” is to provide the client with the basic assistance needed to move toward becoming a vital, productive member of the workforce and the community. Through “JOBS NOW” individuals have the opportunity to attain personal short-term goals while planning and developing long-term goals and strategies by which to attain them.

WHO TELLS YOUR STORY: Hayley Nicholas (left) and Olivia Ware ’20 perform in “RISE,” a performance about gender and sexuality.
This evening, Bowdoin V-Day, an organization dedicated to fighting sexual violence against women and girls, will end nearly 20 years of performing “The Vagina Monologues” due to debate about the Monologues presenting a one-dimensional, outdated portrayal of womanhood. In its place, V-Day is debuting the student-written show, “RISE: Untold Stories of Bowdoin Women.”
The show is directed by Amanda Spiller ’17 and Emiley Charley ’17, and was written by the team of Spiller, Mariam-Boubacar Nimaga ’17, Rebecca Fisher ’17, Ellie Heywood ’19 and Aziza Janmohamed ’19.
“There had been talk the past couple of years about how conceptions of female sexuality and gender had sort of changed,” said Heywood, who in addition to writing RISE is a leader of V-Day. “I think [‘The Vagina Monologues’] doesn’t show the nuance and complexities and intersectionalities of being a woman and other identities on this campus and so it doesn’t have that universality that it used to have.”
There were also complaints that the writer of “The Vagina Monologues,” Eve Ensler, distanced the women’s stories from the truth by conducting group interviews and then writing the monologues herself. RISE was written based on the stories of women on Bowdoin’s campus collected through submissions in an online forum and interviews. The directors and actors of the show made efforts to stay as true as possible to the women’s stories, while still preserving anonymity.
“It is a play, but we also want to be cognizant and conscious of the fact that these are stories on campus, and so we have acting but it’s much more subtle and it’s much more true to the words,” said Heywood.
Rebkah Tesfamariam ’18 did not participate in “The Vagina Monologues” in the past years, but is acting in RISE this year.
“I think there’s something really special about knowing there’s someone whose story on campus I have the privilege of reading to the campus, and bringing to light some more serious and funny and important issues that people might not feel comfortable with sharing in the other spaces,” she said.
The women who came together to present RISE hope that knowing the stories being performed come from Bowdoin students will stimulate conversation about the issues that come up in the show.
“I hope that people really question their interactions with people on a romantic or even on a friendship level after this, because there’s the weight of knowing there is a woman on this campus who feels this way,” said Tesfamariam.
Heywood is confident that RISE is more effective in showing the nuance and complexity of intersecting identities than “The Vagina Monologues.” However, she recognizes that the show cannot cover the entire range of female experience.
“You can’t recognize and can’t represent the totality of experiences of womanhood on this campus, and there’s always going to be a story missing,” she said.
Heywood hopes that in the future more stories will be added to RISE, making it a more complete representation of the experiences of women at Bowdoin.
“It’s always an ideal, and that’s what we’re sort of pointing towards, hopefully in the right ways,” she said.
RISE will be performed tonight and tomorrow night in Kresge auditorium at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $5 at the Smith Union info desk and all proceeds will be donated to Sexual Assault Support Services of Midcoast Maine.
Visiting lecturer contends that the world would be a better place if the #MeToo movement had never happened
Two local poets and friends, Christian Barter and Jeffrey Thomson, will be coming to campus to do a reading as part of a three-event book launch for both of their new books, “Bye-Bye Land” and “The Belfast Notebooks,” respectively.
Office Hours, Bowdoin’s longform improvisation group founded by James Jelin ’16, has been selected for a second time to perform at the Del Close Marathon, a festival hosted by Upright Citizens Brigade Theater (UCB) that brings 72 hours of uninterrupted, nonstop improv to New York City for one weekend in June.

But you may want know EXACTLY how a Beachbody Coach can consistently earn $1000 a month. I think it is pretty fair to say that an extra $1000 a month is a significant amount of extra cash to be bringing in. That amount could be life changing as it could be applied to the mortgage or rent payment, the car payment, or just be put away towards savings or saved for a family vacation, anything that you want.
The key word here is “consistently”. Because Beachbody Coaches’ income is dependent on their personal sales, and every Coach will have some weeks that are better than others, generating consistent income can be challenging. Maybe one week a Coach will sell 3 Challenge Packs, and the next week, they won’t sell any. Because of this, consistent earnings is hard to maintain through retail sales alone. But, that does not mean that it is not possible.
If you want to make $1000 a month as a Beachbody Coach, you will need to generate Shakeology HD (home direct monthly autoship) customers, and also build your own team of Coaches so you’re able to earn team cycle bonuses.
To make things simple, lets forget entirely about workout program sales. We will consider any workout program sales as “extra” income on top of the $1000 a month. Selling a P90x or Insanity is great, but it is only a one-time sale. In this business, the money is in generating Shakeology HD sales.
For example, if you are a Beachbody Coach that makes an Insanity sale, you would earn a $30 commission, but ONLY 1 time. On the flipside, if you make a Shakeology HD sale, you would earn a $30 commission EVERY month when the customer’s Shakeology ships out to them.
Having just 1 Shakeology HD customer will generate approximately $360 in commissions for a Beachbody Coach over the course of a year.
The takeaway is, Shakeology HD sales means consistent commissions coming in and are what Coaches should be focusing on. The workout programs are great, but from a business standpoint, they are really just a lead in to Shakeology, which will be a Coach’s main moneymaker on the retail side of things.
Once a Beachbody Coach has a small team built, they will start to earn team cycle bonuses…these start to add up fast.
For every 300 team volume points generated in a Coach’s organization, they will earn a “cycle” of either $14, $16, or $18. (I won’t get into the specifics on how the cycle bonuses work in this post, but you can read about them here http://coachquestions.com/beachbody-coach-team-cycle-bonus/). With even a small team, the number of team volume points can grow to be very large every week.
To break things down even further, below is a simple plan to follow, with specific goals to shoot for to be making $1000 a month as a Beachbody Coach.
By generating just 3 new Shakeology HD customers each month, this is what your income would like like over the course of 6 months:
By the 6th month, you have 18 Shakeology customers ordering Shakeology on autoship every month. You’ve made the sale once, and continue to earn the commission month after month every time they re-order….pretty sweet huh?
Now let’s be realistic. Everyone will not stay on Shakeology forever, some customer will cancel. So lets say that after 6 months, 3 people out of the 18 have cancelled.
After 6 months, with 3 cancellations, you now have 15 Shakeology HD monthly autoship customers and are earning $450 a month from those sales alone.
In order to earn $550/mth in team cycle bonuses (assuming you are Diamond and earning $18 per cycle), you need to cycle 31 times.
And in order to achieve 31 cycles, you’d need approximately 9300 in team volume in your organization over the course of the month, or 2325 TV a week.
So now we’re at 2325 TV/week, which isn’t a difficult or unrealistic number to get to. It all depends on what each individual Coach in your organization produces and if they are actively working the business and making sales. Some Coaches may do 500 TV a week by themselves, while others will do 0 TV. If I had to guess on the number of Coaches you’d need in your organization in order to have 2325 TV generated on a consistent weekly basis, I’d say somewhere between 40-60. Again, it really all depends, (at the time of this writing) I had 1 person in my organization last week that had 2048 TV alone, but that isn’t typical.
40-60 Coaches may seem like a large number to get to, but it really isn’t too difficult to achieve. Here a simple breakdown:
If a brand new Beachbody Coach can sponsor just 1 new Coach a month, and teach those new Coaches to do the same, in just 6 months that Coach would have grown an organization of over 60 Coaches. Here’s a breakdown of the numbers and how it would work.
Now here is the awesome part and where exponential growth starts to kick in. If you were to keep up that same pace of sponsoring just 1 person a month, and teaching everyone in your organization to do the same, over the course of a year you would have grown an team of over 4000 Coaches. Here’s what the numbers would like on that:
As you can see from the numbers above, it isn’t necessary to sponsor hundreds of Coaches into the business in order to grow a large team. In the scenario above, only 12 new Coaches were personally sponsored.
Again, lets get realistic. The scenario I show above would never happen that way. There will be people that you sponsor into the business that also bring others into the business, and there will be people that never sponsor anyone. Typically the latter will be the case.
You have to expect that some people will sign up as a Coach, and for whatever reason, will not have the same goals as you do or have the same motivation to work their business. In Jordan Adler’s book, Beach Money, which is great book, he breaks down the numbers in thirds, here they are below:
From my personal experience I’ve found his numbers to somewhat correct. His percentage of people that will do, “a lot”, may be a little high in my opinion. I’d say that the percentage of people that do a lot will be closer to 10%, but that all depends on a wide variety of different variables.
So I kind of rambled on in this post. Here a few key takeaways and a specific plan to reach $1000 a month in your Beachbody business.
Focus on selling Challenge Packs, or Shakeology HD. 3 new sales will put you on pace to earn $1000/mth in 6 months or less.
Focus on sponsoring new motivated Coaches into the business and spend quality time with them getting them trained and started in the right direction. The team building process is slow, but eventually it takes off and exponential growth takes over and your team will start to grow almost effortlessly, but this is something that will take a few years of hard work.
Tip: Shoot for Qualifying for Success Club every month. As a benefit for making Success Club you will be given Shakeology customers AND the commissions. This is a nice incentive, and sometimes the Shakeology customers you are given are on HD, which helps you reach your goal of acquiring 3 new Shakeology customers each month.
All that a Beachbody Coach needs to do in order to qualify for Success Club 5 is to accumulate 5 points. There are a few other fine print things needed, but that is basically the jist of it.
What’s great about being a Beachbody Coach is that you can work and grow your business at your own pace. Getting to $1000/mth could take a year, or even 2 years, which would still be a great accomplishment.
One thing to understand is that once you get to $1000/mth, you’ve set a great foundation for growing a large organization and it will continue to grow larger an larger without extra effort on your part.
This is a challenging business. Like anything in life you will get out of it what you put in. There will be hard times, struggles, and hurdles to jump over. In the end, it will be worth it.
The past few days have been busy ones for air traffic controllers who handled several flight diversions on U.S. airlines due to disruptive passengers. On Thursday, Delta Airlines flight 188 from Pittsburgh to Paris was landed in St. John’s, Newfoundland after a passenger started spouting off about Muslims. Marcus Miller who was sitting next to the man told a Pittsburgh news reporter, "You know, he kept referring to Muslims and I just felt like, if this guy snaps, we're in trouble."
That same day, Muhammad Abu Tahir, a passenger on AirTran flight 39 from Atlanta to San Francisco was said to have gone into the bathroom and refused to come out. Fighter jets were dispatched and the plane was landed in Colorado where Mr. Tahir was arrested.
Hawaiian Airlines diverted two flights in two days. On Flight 39, Joseph Hedlund Johnson, became agitated and reportedly gave a note to a member of the flight crew that was interpreted as threatening. Like the AirTran flight, U.S. military jets were dispatched to accompany the Hawaiian plane to an emergency return to Portland, Oregon. Another Hawaiian Airlines flight from Las Vegas to Hawaii landed in L.A. after a passenger reportedly sexually assaulted the woman sitting next to him.
It is usually wise not to let media reports affect your perspective, but even I am getting nervous about this apparent uptick in aviation security events. I was already thinking about the curious detention of a second man from Northwest Airlines Flight 253 whose his bags triggered a response from a sniffer dog as he and the other passengers waited to be interviewed at Detroit Airport on Christmas Day. (Read more about this here) Sure, authorities told me, don’t worry; the second man was not involved in Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab’s failed attempt to blow up the Amsterdam to Detroit flight with an underpants bomb. But they seemed a little too sure of that, so convinced that none of the carry-on luggage on Flight 253 was even inspected before passengers brought it with them into the airport. (Read more about this here)
Flight 253 passenger Kurt Haskell, also reported that even before the plane departed Amsterdam, he saw Mr. Mutallab in the company of an older Indian gentleman, who was telling the ticket agent that Mr. Muttallab was a Sudanese refugee and should be allowed to board the airplane without a passport. I know, I know, it sounds incredible. But Mr. Haskell, an attorney in suburban Detroit seems reasonable. Perhaps his account is at least worth checking out.
In the two weeks since, the Detroit event, we’ve seen the closing of Newark Liberty International Airport for nearly seven hours after a man identified as Haisong Jiang slipped through security reportedly so he could accompany his girlfriend to her plane.
The Transportation Security Administration told ABC News that across the country since Dec. 14, there were "37 incidents at airports that involved a checkpoint closure, terminal evacuation or a sterile area breach." I find that number startling. Do the math, that’s almost two a day.
Then we learn that the delay in confirming that a man had indeed breached security was because the cameras at Newark airport were running but not recording.
Now we have a virtual epidemic of passengers, who are not just making pests of themselves they’re causing planes to divert. Patrick Smith, who writes the Salon column, Ask the Pilot, tells me "An international diversion can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars once you account for passenger misconnects, added crew costs, refueling, and the downline logistical problems that result when an airplane is unexpectedly re-routed."
After the movie Jaws came out in 1975, the number of shark attacks reported in the newspaper jumped. Were more people being attacked or was the media just reporting more of them? This is the “jaws syndrome” says Jim Schembari, a veteran journalist at The New York Times. That could be what’s going on here.
Northwest flight 253 was the news equivalent of a feature film and justifiably so. The line between what happened and what could have happened is too narrow for comfort.
I can’t help feeling that these incidents are not isolated and unrelated. I wonder how much of what’s going on is part of a deliberate program to test the response of flight crews and probe for weak spots in security. Airline pilots are telling me the information they're getting about their "discretionary power" as inflight security coordinators is either unclear or non existent. One pilot described the memo he saw from TSA as "uninttelligible nonsense." Another told me he's walking through the cabin before departure just to eyeball his passengers and make sure they're all acting "vaguely normal."
If you think Homeland Security seems a little less-than-secure these days, take a number. You’re not alone.

A coach asked me to comment on the concept of 2 platooning players at the HS level. Let me first say that I can only share with you what my experience of leading a program for 22 years was. I know of a couple of coaches who successfully used 2 platooning but… they were both from very large schools and had the luxury of 75-80 Varsity players. I guess I see the advantages that hard-core 2 platooners speak of… I just know that we never had that many “great ones” and we wanted them on the field as much as possible!
I tried 2 platooning one season toward the end of my career and it was a disaster. If you are considering full scale 2 platooning, remember: you will also be “2 platooning” your coaching staff! Right there is where we first ran into problems. I guess I either did a poor job of leading or they were simply too immature or self-absorbed to get along but… we became a divided staff… especially when the defense was playing well and our offense was struggling. It wasn’t anything blatant; but you could tell that there was friction way beyond what is healthy. You will have to assign your staff members a position on only 1 side of the ball. He will work with those players every day. Like a D1 college staff, his contact with the offensive players will be only when the 2 sides do competition drills together…. and then it will only be as the “opponent.”
You run into another problem right off the bat when your staff has to have their “draft.” If players are only going to go 1 way, you have to decide which side of the ball they are going to play on. Who will make this decision? Again… competition.
I am an advocate of players, the “stars”, going 1 and 1/2 ways!!! What I mean is: your best (the one’s that you want on the field as much as possible) will rest every 3rd series you are on offense. You set up a rotation in practice that carries over to the game where the back-up knows when he is coming on the field. This accomplishes 2 things: it gives the starter a break, probably once or even twice a half, during the heat of the game and 2) it allows a quality back-up to get important game time when the game is on the line. This builds depth for this season and gives you experience coming in to next year; for, we try very hard to never back up a senior with another senior. We want underclassmen on the field as those “key back-ups.”
We also are careful about the “stars” playing on Special Teams. It’s another area where we build depth and experience for the younger ones. Now… we only put quality back-ups on the field for the kicking game— because it is just too important to just stick anyone out there! Our “stars” can get a break during a kicking play. It’s a chance to get a drink and, especially, talk with their coach before heading back out for offense or defense.
Let me just mention here too that you will find that you have one or two kids each year who go hard ALL the time and just never seem to get tired!!! The harder you work them, the stronger they perform. These are those 1 or 2 that we WILL let play on the “key” special teams (i.e., Punt and Kick-off)… but most of the “stars” will get a break during kicking plays during the game.
Another factor which played into our getting a lot of kids in the game was that we DID 2 platoon our Offensive linemen. Rarely did we have an OL who had the physical tools we were looking for in our Defensive linemen. Our O Line is more of the “hog” type while our Def. line is usually made up of back-up Linebackers. In other words, we go more for speed and aggressiveness on our defense. We’ll convert a LB and get him to put his hand on the ground to give us that speed we want for our fast-paced defensive attack. Our “star” O lineman can come in on goal line defense to help bring some bulk. Otherwise, our OL go only 1 way. Our O Line coach is the only one who only coaches 1 side of the ball. When everyone else is working on Defensive positions, the OL coach has more time to work on OL skills. When we go Def. Group work, our OL coach brings his linemen over and it can get pretty competitive because it is guys who only go one way going against each other! That’s about as far as I feel comfortable going with true 2 platooning.
Let me point out too that when the “star” gets his rest, it is on offense! Our whole program psyche changed when we changed from giving breaks on defense to giving breaks on offense! I brought in a new assistant coach from a neighboring school that had had a lot of success… including a state championship. They were known for their physicality and mental toughness. This coach was the first to show me that “you send messages to the kids and don’t even realize it!” The message I discovered that we were sending to our players (prior to this) was: “Defense was just something to do till the Offense got the ball again!” How did the kids “learn” this? Because we substituded on defense and talked about “how important it is to keep your offense working as a unit”, they thought that we were “saying” that Offense is more important! That changed when we started subbing on Offense. We let it be known that the Defense would stay in tact. Our offensive production didn’t suffer but our whole defensive attitude changed! Now that star defensive back/running back was getting his break on offense and that budding star running back was getting some snaps in a key part of the game. The message was clear: our defense is going to win us a championship. We backed up our words with our actions.
The main reason I like “1 and 1/2” platooning is that it promotes team unity… one of my foundational blocks of success. Coaches learn to coach a position on both sides of the ball and players working on both sides during practice builds depth. If an injury occurs, you’ve got a quality athlete to substitute in there until your starter returns. I think with true 2 platooning that you are not only playing with less over-all quality on the field with just the starters, but you really drop off when the back up has to come in. He may be the 3rd or 4th best Defensive lineman instead of 2nd best… because the 2nd best is only playing offense. (There’s that draft again!)
I realize that the true 2 platooners would say that they are getting much more practice time for those guys since they get to work on their skils twice as much. I can’t disagree except to say that I think that a player’s ability level has the greatest chance for improvement during the off season. I think of in-season practice as “preparing for the next game” not improving a skill set. That’s what the hours of lifting, running, agility and drill work from February to July is all about!
I want THE best athletes I can put on the field as much as possible. Names from this area like Kenny Easley, Ronald Curry, Allen Iverson (and those 3 were all QB’s!), Dre Bly, Deangelo Hall, Percy Harvin and others… all played both ways in high school around here. They never suffered for being on the field; in fact, their teams were all championship caliber teams.
Get those “athletes” on the field and give them the chance to produce for you! I’d start “selling” playing both ways in the spring. I’d put it in their heads that a real warrior goes both ways. That you shouldn’t want to come off the field. I ask them: “Don’t you like to put on a show for the fans?! Then you need to be on the field as much as you can so you can be ‘prime time.'” Quite frankly, our kids would be frustrated if they didn’t get to go both ways… yours will too if you plant the right seeds.

If there was ever a doubt that Palm Beach is the center of the universe, it can be dispelled. The baseball signing heard around the world has a Palm Beach connection.
It turns out, it was the Koeppel family of Palm Beach that hit a home run Wednesday on a family trip to Rome when Pope Francis signed a baseball thrown to him from the crowd.
The 77-year-old pontiff urged an onlooking fan, who turned out to be part-time resident William Koeppel, to throw him the New York Yankees baseball during his weekly audience in St. Peter’s Square. The ball bounced in the pope’s right hand before falling to the ground, where it was retrieved by his security detail. The leader of the Catholic Church then signed and returned the ball.
What will happen to the ball? The family plans on donating it to St. Edward Catholic Church — which helped him secure the VIP tickets to see the pontiff — for its annual dinner Dec. 10 at The Breakers, where it will be auctioned off. Proceeds will benefit the church’s annual toy drive.
Koeppel, after discussing the idea with friends in New York before the trip, came prepared. He yelled to Pope Francis to sign. When Pope Francis asked for the ball, Koeppel’s 11-year-old son, Chase, gave his father a ball, who then tossed it to the pontiff. His other son, Harrison, 14, threw the pope a pen. On a side note, Harrison was confirmed Sept. 7 and his confirmation name is Francis.
The family had hoped to have two other balls signed — one for Palm Beach Day Academy and one for the New York Athletic Club — but were only able to get one autographed. Harrison is president of the Day Academy student council, which also counts Chase as a member. The senior Koeppel is on the admissions committee of the club.
Not only does he not know the Catholic faith but he can't field either. Guess he'll have to be the designated modernist. Stick to kicking balls Bergolgio!
I'm just trying to imagine Pios X, XI and XII, clowning around and making a mockery of the papacy, and I just can't
You are right Mary - that is why this man is NOT a pope - he is an ANTIPOPE - if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck. Anyway, the R and R crowd are in direct disobedience by saying these horrible men are real popes - clearly in direct disobedience to Pius X, Pius IX, Paul IV and Pius II just to name a few, especially the latter two's bulls condemning and anathematizing false popes, even if unanimously elected, who preach heresy, and false councils called to overturn previously defined dogmas, as clearly Vatican Ii's sole purpose was to do just that - not to mention their huggy kissy with every heretic and schismatic - the REAL ones - under the sun, while calling the sole faithful Catholics - i.e. those who expect the man in the papal chair to actually BE a Catholic - heretics or schismatics or worse. Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus ONLY applies to traditionalists AND particularly to sedevacantists when it comes to the conciliar counterfeit one world religion of Montinian nightmare Zionist-led phoney "Catholicism" which says a cabbalistic "mass" authored by six heretics and two Christ hating rabbis. Not to mention the clerical freemason who went out and hung himself just like Judas Iscariot before him - Bugnini. But they're going to go ahead and 'canonize' the primary horse's end - Montini - that imposed all of this apostatical mess on the Faithful in the first place - and meanwhile a big solar eclipse follows that "canonization' on the Thursday after - the day Marie Julie Jahenny says the 3DD are supposed to occur - Thursday, Friday Saturday. One certainly wonders how long our Lord is going to subject us to all these devils in human form who have infiltrated and taken over like the spiritual cockroaches they are.
Thank you God for Pope Francis. Sorry for those of us who insult him and misjudge him. Then again, we did worse to your own Son.

Nearly 1,000 Denied Entry to France; Putin Willing to Work with U.S.-Led Coalition; Trump Expecting Endorsement of 100 Black Pastors. Aired 8-9a ET
CHRISTI PAUL, CNN ANCHOR: It's always a good day when it's Saturday. Hope that you're having a good one there where you are. I'm Christi Paul.
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Victor Blackwell. Good morning to you. Let's go to Colorado now, where police are mourning a fellow officer. You see them here, inside and outside of their vehicles, gathering to salute Officer Garrett Swasey one last time, a snowy morning there.
PAUL: The officer was gunned down yesterday in an attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs there. He was one of six officers who were shot. A local reporter talked to us about Officer Swasey.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (via telephone): He grew up in Massachusetts and he competed with his partner, Rachel Myer, with the skating club of Boston in the Eastern Sectional championships. He and fellow Baltimore native living in the springs in the early '90s, won the junior dance competition by winning both the original and pre-dance programs.
He and Lori Tompkins finished 13th in the 1995 U.S. figure skating championships and later performed in ice shows in Northern Maine. He was a man of faith. He was a pastor at hope chapel, a Colorado Springs chapel, overseeing its three care groups and participating in its teaching team and playing guitar as part of his worship.
As you both were saying a few moments ago, he's survived by his wife, Rachel, and a young son, Elijah, and a young daughter, Faith.
BLACKWELL: Well, we now know more about the man police say killed that officer and two others. His name is Robert Lewis Dear, 59 years old. Witnesses described him as having a cold stone face. He is in custody this morning. Investigators of course are trying to determine why, what is the motive behind this shooting?
PAUL: Stephanie Elam is live in Colorado Springs for us this morning. Stephanie, what are you learning about the investigation and where it stands right now?
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Christi and Victor. What I can show you is that we've gotten a little bit closer than when I last spoke to you. If you look over my shoulder, that would be the Planned Parenthood building back there.
This is because they're preparing to open up roads and make this area accessible again. But if you think about what it was like yesterday afternoon, it was just sheer terror.
UNIDENTIFIED CALLER: We just took fire through the window. One of the S.O. guys got hit in the leg. He's code 4, we're going to extract him.
ELAM (voice-over): Tense moments at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs as two civilians and a police officer are killed in a nearly six-hour standoff. It ended when the gunman finally gave up.
LT. CATHERINE BUCKLEY, COLORADO SPRINGS POLICE: We did get officers inside of the building at the Planned Parenthood. And the officers were able to shout to the suspect and make communication with him. And at that point, they were able to get him to surrender and he was taken into custody.
ELAM: One of the dead, 44-year-old Officer Garrett Swasey, worked for the University of Colorado. He apparently rushed to the scene from the campus, 10 miles away. Two more victims have not been identified. Five police officers and four other civilians were injured in the attack including one man who was waiting in a parked car.
OZY LICANO, SHOT BY GUNMAN IN COLORADO ATTACK: He was aiming at me and I just hit the gas. And he started shooting. And I was looking at his face and then the shots came through the glass. Then I started bleeding.
ELAM: A law enforcement official confirms to CNN that the suspected gunman is 59-year-old Robert Lewis Dear. Bomb experts are making sure he didn't leave behind any explosive devices inside or outside of the clinic.
BUCKLEY: Once the suspect was taken out of the building. Our process is to go through and clear the building room by room, and then we turn it into a crime scene.
ELAM: And as the investigation into his motive goes on, police are being credited with saving lives by using security cameras to keep track of the gunman and those trapped inside.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The officers were monitoring movement within the building on security cameras and communicating to the officers who were in the building. And it was the most incredible work on behalf of officers trying to minimize the number of fatalities.
(END VIDEOTAPE) [08:05:04]ELAM: And minimizing the number of fatalities really key here. The loss of three lives, but we know that those nine people, five officers and four civilians that were also injured, we understand that they're in good condition and they are expected to recover -- Victor and Christi.
We also heard from some of the victims in yesterday's shooting including this man, Ozy Licano, who said the killer looked right at him before firing.
LICANO: I saw a man crawling to the front door. I saw the glass shatter and he crawled into the entry way. Then I saw this other fellow shoot down and up and walk into the entryway. And I just kind of lost it there.
I tried to get out of my car, run. I thought about that I said, no. I got back in the car, started it, put it in reverse. Started backing out. And then he's in front of me. And he was aiming at me. And I just hit the gas and he started shooting.
And I was looking at his face. I think I had five to ten seconds to look at him, to try to remember who he was, and why he was doing that or whatever. Then the shots came through the glass.
Then I started bleeding because I was looking at him. I saw blood. I didn't know if it was coming from my neck or my lip or what. I thought about it, and it's like, one, two -- like 5 seconds we stared at each other.
In that 5-second period, those bullet holes came right through my windshield and the blood. Four seconds later, I'm turning I think I saw his vehicle, a dark looking SUV with the door open, driver's side.
Then I just started getting away and I heard him shooting some more to me. Then I may it to King Super's. I never experienced that before. At the time, I wasn't scared. I was more angry.
And I don't know why. That's what's bothering me the most, what the other people went through. It's just -- I can't imagine. There were a lot of women in there, very innocent people. I just felt helpless, that's all. I don't like feeling helpless. That's why I was angry, I guess. It's not right.
BLACKWELL: Wow. Well, listen, that shooting and the standoff went on for hours. A police radio captured their chaotic scene outside. Listen to a bit of that.
BLACKWELL: Now, once inside, officers found -- what could only be described, as a dire situation, the gunman shooting at officers through walls. And we know, of course, he finally turned himself in.
UNIDENTIFIED OFFICER: Just fired through the window and one of the S.O. guys got hit in the leg. He's code 4. We're going to extract him. Once they extract this guy, you might be able to get a shot at this guy. He's just shooting through the wall.
BLACKWELL: All right, let's take about this now. We have with us, Cedric Alexander, CNN law enforcement analyst. At the end of this, he surrenders, typically what we see in hostage situation, a mass shooting, that that shooter kills himself at the end of it. What do you make of the decision to surrender at the end of all of this?
CEDRIC ALEXANDER, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: We may see suicide in some scenarios. This is not the case. I believe once we learn more about what may have drove him to this, his ideological beliefs. Whether he has some known health condition that's going on we'll know more.
But it's very hard to judge often times, Victor, how the outcome would be. If I had to guess as of last night when the shooting was taking place, I would have said that he would end up being killed by the police.
But of course, at some point, he decided to surrender and I think we're going to learn much more as to what was going in his mind to lead him to this.
[08:10:07] BLACKWELL: When we, you know, look at, I guess, eight hours or so after the surrender, and we're getting his name and all that information -- more than eight hours. The question is why? Why did he do this? If this is politically driven, if this is ideologically driven, does that take a lot of time to pry out of the suspect, or do they offer that freely?
ALEXANDER: A lot of times it depends on what the personality of the individual. Depends on what his motives may have been. He may have done this to create attention for himself. He may have been an individual who just has a very evil spirit about himself and wanted to do harm to others.
You have five police officers shot, one killed, civilians that were severely injured. He was a very dangerous individual. We don't know what drove him to this. I believe over the next few days, we will learn more about him, his background, his personality, and what other prior histories he may have had as well too.
BLACKWELL: What's the work that's being done outside of potentially that interrogation room with this suspect?
ALEXANDER: A lot has been done particularly around the forensic side. There are going to be search warrants on his vehicles around his residence that he lived in or may have lived in. What he owned or operated.
We're going to get a lot more assessment of who he is to his family and friends. This is going to be a longstanding investigation. For a number of reasons, one for prosecutorial residence.
Another, we just need to know from a law enforcement perspective and I believe too from a psychological perspective. Who is this individual and what drove him to do this? How do we get in front of this if opportunities present itself? Oftentimes, they do not.
But often times, too, we learn a lot once we investigate and interview individuals that have involved themselves in acts such as this.
BLACKWELL: We know from Stephanie Elam and from Kyung Lah who is reporting during the situation and throughout the evening that there had been threats made against that facility. They had a security room complete with bulletproof vests.
So, of course, security will be a concern at the clinic and others across the state and maybe throughout the country. We'll have that conversation as the days go on. Cedric Alexander, always good to have you.
PAUL: Yes, outrage in Chicago is what we're talking about. Protesters swarm Michigan Avenue, grinding holiday shopping to a halt. They want the city's top cop to step aside after the shooting death of a black teen.
Also, millions of you, I know, might be facing a rough trip home. The wintery weather could really mess up some traveling for you. We'll give you a heads-up.
And Pope Francis making history in Africa, celebrating mass in Uganda today. He's about to go, though, to one of the most dangerous places ever visited by a pope.
PAUL: Not what you typically see the day after Thanksgiving, is it? Peaceful and powerful chants, though, by demonstrators who packed the streets and paralyzed Black Friday shopping in Chicago, they're not just demanding the resignation of top city officials.
But they're alleging there was a cover-up of police cam video showing an officer fatally shooting, teenager, Laquan McDonald and these protesters aren't done. They say they are hitting the streets again today and tomorrow.
HLN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney, Joey Jackson, is joining us now. So, Joey, they're not just demanding resignations. They want a federal investigation into this case. What is the likelihood they that they will get one?
JOEY JACKSON, HLN LEGAL ANALYST: Good morning, Christi. I think the likelihood is very good. Remember, we're talking about certainly community trust. This is an ongoing conversation not just limited to Chicago but extended throughout the whole country.
So, certainly, there's the interest in the federal government in making sure that they get it right. To make it clear, the officer is charged. There's a process in that. Certainly, that process will move forward, have a day in court, and have an opportunity to defend himself.
I think that's significant. Certainly, we also know on the civil side, the family has been compensated to the tune of $5 million. But there are real questions as to why it took so long to come to this point.
The prosecutor having an investigation ongoing and having to view that videotape before any of us did, why now? So there are real issues of trust.
And I think the federal government certainly secures more of that trust, because they're independent, they're outside, and can do a job that would make the community feel that every avenue has been exhausted.
PAUL: Speaking of that video, we're looking at it now on the screen. Can we put that back up? Because I wanted to ask you about that video, they assert, protesters, it took 400-plus days for this to go public. There's a question about that.
But when you look at that, too, they say he was defending himself. The police department asserts that the police officer was defending himself. You have seen this video. We're looking at it now. Do you see anything that would substantiate that claim? JACKSON: Well, you know what happens, Christi, the defense attorney has a job to do here. Certainly in light of that, they'll be doing that. What will the defense be talking jab they'll be talking about the officer's state of mind.
They'll be talking about video that we're watching at now, which is the lead into that that he was chasing Laquan McDonald. That he was in a heightened state of alertness. That they had gotten reports that apparently, he had threatened other or used a screwdriver and the adrenaline was flowing.
He got out of the car and he had a knife in had his hand and he was in imminent danger. So you'll hear all of that from the defense, but I think the prosecution will remind the jury about imminent. What does an imminent threat mean? Was he coming towards McDonald? Was he coming towards the officer?
Did he represent any harm to him, his brother officers or anybody else? Did the amount of shots fired, was that reasonable or did that exceed any measure of reasonableness?
I think that's what the prosecutor will be prevailing upon the jury to say, you know what, you may have been chasing him and your mind might have been such that you knew you were in a heightened state of security and alertness, but did you really need to do all of that? That's what it's going to boil down to at the end of the day.
JACKSON: Christi, sure, first degree murder is the intentional murder without justification. So what the prosecutor is going to be doing is, even if you can establish from a defense perspective, that the initial shots may have been justified, which, certainly, you can make the argument he was fearful he got out of the car, he approached him.
But now, you have to justify, if you're the defense, why the continued shooting when he was on the ground representing no danger at all. Didn't you intend to hill him at that point? And what was your justification in doing so?
[08:10:12]And so that's going to be what the prosecutor is going to present to the jury. And the defense is going to say, squared, imminent danger. At the end of the day, ultimately, the jury has that decision to make.
BLACKWELL: This morning, the man accused of jumping over the White House fence is sitting in a hospital in Washington. And we're learning surprise details of a plan, what was happening here at the White House. Also why he told his mother he might never see her again, we've got those new details.
Plus, new information about the most wanted man in Europe. Who did Salah Abdelsalam speak with about the attacks, one day after they were carried out?
PAUL: Well, the man who jumped the White House fence on Thanksgiving Day is now charged with illegal entry of restricted grounds. He appeared in court yesterday and has another hearing Monday. If convicted he faces up to a year in prison.
He was caught by the Secret Service after he made it over that fence. He was wearing an American flag as a cape and he did leave, we've learned, a suicide note with friends. He's been ordered to undergo a psychiatric investigation.
BLACKWELL: Look at this mess in North Texas. They're getting drenched, heavy rain right now. You see here, an SUV submerged and one of their roads washed out. At least three people have died. Another person is presumed dead because of the widespread flooding.
BLACKWELL: The timing is unfortunate. CNN meteorologist, Allison Chinchar tracking all the movements for us and this is just the wrong weekend for this.
All right, let's go now to Europe's most wanted terrorist, Salah Abdelsalam. Two weeks after the Paris attack, no one really knows where he is, at least authorities don't. But there are new details about a meeting with Abdelsalam one day after the attacks.
PAUL: And the fight to stop ISIS. Russia says it's willing to partner with the west. The question is, is the west wanting that partnership?
New this morning, France says it stopped nearly 1,000 people from entering the country since the Paris terrorist attacks. And today, the French interior minister says the people who were turned away were deemed, quote, "security risks to our public order". He also said there are 15,000 officers currently stationed along France's borders.
CNN's Martin Savidge is joining us live from Paris with the latest because today we're also learning, Martin, about a new arrest in connection with the attacks. What are you hearing there?
MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Christi -- most of these arrests that are taking place in Belgium are people that have somehow become associated with Salah Abdeslam -- the most wanted man in Europe right now and believed to be the sole survivor of the terror cell that carried out the attacks here in Paris.
He had a very interesting 24 hours after the attack that authorities have uncovered. Several hours after that slaughter that took place here in Paris, he apparently called up some friends in Belgium and said, look, my car's broken down, I need a ride back.
They apparently said that they knew nothing about his involvement in the terror operation. They came. They picked him up here in Paris and they began driving back towards Belgium. They got stopped by French authorities Saturday morning.
At that time, the French authorities didn't have a name of anybody they were looking for. They were just stopping all vehicles heading back towards Belgium. So they had detained him just for a short while and then let Salah Abdeslam on his way.
Later in Brussels, it turns out he had a meeting with another friend in a cafe and talked about the attacks in Paris. And that's the last anybody has ever seen of him. So authorities are quite convinced that Salah Abdeslam, number one, survived the attacks but most of all has managed to escape the police because he's getting help along the way -- Christi.
PAUL: All right. Well, as we look forward here to Monday, we know Paris is hosting major world leaders including President Obama and some 40,000 delegates to this huge climate change summit. I have to believe, Martin, that what they have planned for security for this event is going to look much different now, is that right?
SAVIDGE: Yes, absolutely. The French have really looked forward to playing host to this very important environmental event. This is something that's been planned long before the terrorist attacks. And so much of this had been not just focused on what maybe hammered out as far as environmental legislation, but also the public.
There were tens of thousands of people that were expected to attend, on the side, including massive protests or demonstrations. None of those are going to take place, according to authorities because of the security concerns.
One, they're afraid that they could possibly be a huge target. But most important is the fact that all the security forces now need to focus on protecting those heads of state, nearly 150 of them, including the President of the United States who's coming. So, it has been quite a significant shift, security wise -- Christi.
VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN HOST: All right. We've got some new numbers in the fight against ISIS this morning. U.S. and coalition forces say they've launched 20 new air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Take a look at the other countries involved in the campaign here include Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, the U.K.
And you know, after the Paris terror attacks, French President Francois Hollande has been trying to build a super coalition hoping to bring Russia closer to the nations dedicated to taking out ISIS.
Joining me now David Tafuri, former Obama campaign foreign policy adviser. David -- good to have you this morning. I want to start by talking about the coalition that exists and the one that some want. Hollande went around the world, meeting with the leaders of Germany, and the U.K., and U.S. and Russia, to try to build this coalition. What did he get?
DAVID TAFURI, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN FOREIGN POLICY ADVISER: Well, he got a lot of nice commitments and verbally. It's not clear he's actually changed anything.
The discussion with Russia is particularly interesting. It sounds like France really wants Russia to cooperate with the coalition. The problem is that there's a significant difference between the coalition and Russia on their position on Syria which is Russia wants Assad to stay. Russia is mainly there to prop up Assad not to fight ISIS. And that's a significant distinction.
The U.S. and President Obama have articulated very well the position that Assad must go. That's really the right position.
[08:35:01] Assad is partly responsible for the creation of ISIS. He killed so many Sunni protestors who were at first peaceful and that's what caused the creation of radical groups in Syria.
If Assad stays that just fuels the fire for ISIS and for supporters to continue to be joining ISIS. That's part of the problem. So the coalition is right on this point. And the coalition led by the U.S., with France now playing an important part, has to reach an agreement with Russia's Putin on this issue in particular.
BLACKWELL: All right. Let's listen to something that Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday about cooperating now with this coalition.
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): That was the reason for our negotiations with France. We've agreed to how we're going to work together in the future, including with the coalition overall, including United States. Territory where we can strike, where we must need to restrain ourselves from strikes, exchanging of information and other questions, and the coordination of actions on the battlefields. (END VIDEO CLIP)
BLACKWELL: All right. Coordinating on where they should strike and where they should avoid strikes. What's the likelihood that Russia will indeed avoid areas that the coalition determines are areas that should be avoided? Maybe those areas that are held by the Free Syrian Army.
TAFURI: Well, I mean, that's also a crucial issue, and remember when Russia first went to Syria and did air strikes. They said they were going to fight ISIS but they did air strikes against the U.S.-back rebels in Syria. Those air strikes, as I understand it, have continued.
Can they work out on an agreement? Let's hope so. That's super important for what the United States and the coalition is trying to accomplish. But this is a very complicated battle scenario. As we saw with what happened with Turkey shooting down a Russian jet that Turkey says crossed into Turkish airspace.
I think we can count on the fact that there's going to be more confusion in this battleground space. Yes it would be good if Russia communicated more with the coalition. It would be even better if Russia joined the coalition and joined the coalition objection of getting Assad to step down and fighting ISIS together.
PAUL: Pope Francis is holding mass this morning for thousands of people in Uganda. And he's getting ready for what could be a dangerous part of his trip. A place no modern pope has visited, in fact.
Plus, religious leaders squaring off in the name of Donald Trump -- some say over 100 clergy from across the country are getting ready to endorse him for president but other religious leaders say, not so fast.
PAUL: Look at that. The scene in Kampala, Uganda just about an hour ago. Police had to push back that swelling crowd who just wanted to get a glimpse of Pope Francis. Right now, the Pope is meeting with the country's youth and they're expected to talk about militia kidnappings and homelessness. This is such a poor part of the country here. The Pope is in the
middle of his six-day, three-country tour of Africa. And his meeting with Uganda's young people really goes hand in hand with his message of helping and uplifting the people and poor and people who are with need.
And John -- not only is he talking about lifting people up, it's not just a religious message, but there's a political message in this as well, isn't there? He, I understand, spoke a bit about corruption?
JOHN ALLEN, CNN SENIOR VATICAN ANALYST: Yes, that's right, Christi. The Pope is both a pastor, but he is also -- he wants to be a voice of conscience -- a change agent in global affairs. When he was in Kenya for example, we heard him give a very hard-hitting speech about climate change at the global headquarters of the U.N. environment program. That, of course, is ahead of the looming climate change summit in Paris that opens on Monday.
Throughout his Africa trip, we've heard him challenge African leaders to resist the scourge of corruption. And he's frankly acknowledged that corruption is everywhere, including in the Vatican. Of course, one thing he's trying to fight in his reform program.
Beginning tomorrow, the focus will shift to peace. When he arrives in the Central African Republic marking the first time a pope has ever set foot in an active war zone where he hopes to promote a peaceful resolution to that country's bloody conflict.
So at one level, a moral and spiritual message, Christi but on another level obviously a clearly political subtext.
PAUL: Yes. That Central African Republic not necessarily known for its strong infrastructure. Do you have any concerns for his safety?
ALLEN: Christi, I think everybody on the planet has concerns for the Pope's safety, except for Francis himself. You know, on the Al Italia flight to Africa a couple of days ago, he went up to the cockpit to chat with the pilots. He told them look, if you don't think it's safe to land in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, just give me a parachute, because that's how determined I am to get there.
So yes, there are very real concerns about security but on the other hand Pope Francis obviously believes that given the opportunity he has there to make a difference, in a country where the conflict breaks Christian, Muslim and the population is 80 percent Christian, I think he feels he has a real chance to move the ball in the direction of peace. He is determined not to allow safety considerations to get in his way.
And supporting Donald Trump, a large group of church leaders gets ready to back the GOP front-runner, but his past has another group apparently thinking twice about that.
Also, at the top of the hour -- the search for a motive in Colorado -- this is the first look we're getting at the suspect, the man allegedly who started shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic. We just got it. Here it is. We'll have a live report for you on all the new developments at the top of the show.
BLACKWELL: Some African-American religious leaders are making a special plea to 100 black pastors and evangelicals who are reportedly backing Donald Trump. The Trump campaign has announced that a coalition of those pastors will endorse the candidate after meeting with him on Monday.
But other religious leaders are asking many of them to consider Trump's past rhetoric and behavior before announcing their support. Of course, this comes days after a Black Lives Matter protester was repeatedly punched and kicked at a Trump rally.
We have with us now to talk about this Cindy Trimm. She is one of the ministers who will meet with Trump on Monday. It's so good to have you this morning.
BLACKWELL: Let me start first with how this is being billed by the Trump campaign. They're saying this is an endorsement by this coalition of 100 black pastors. Is that what you it will be? Are you planning to endorse Donald Trump?
TRIMM: I am not planning to endorse. I'm there to attend to hear his strategy for the way forward. There are so many Americans right now that is looking for a leader who they can respect and admire because of an all-encompassing feel for diversity and irrespective of a person's socio-economic background or race or color or creed.
[08:50:03] And so, I'm there to hear his strategy for how we're going to bring sides together and move forward.
BLACKWELL: So there is this op-ed in "Ebony Magazine" of more than 100 black faith leaders. And I want to read part of it and we could put it up on the screen. They write "Mr. Trump routinely uses overtly divisive and racist language on the campaign trail. Most recently he admitted his supporters were justified for punching and kicking a black protester who had attended a Trump rally with the intent to remind the crowd that black lives matter.
Trump followed his action by tweeting inaccurate statistics about crime prevalence in rate to black communities insinuating that black people are more violent than other groups. Trump's racially inaccurate, insensitive and incendiary rhetoric should give those charged with the care of the spirits and souls of black people great pause." To that, you say what?
TRIMM: To that, I say that we are in a critical moment in the history of America and the history of the world. And I believe that if there's ever a time that we should be able to bring sides together, we should.
I believe Mr. Trump, his motive and his intention really is to provide leadership and in his running for presidency. He's new in politics. And I came out of politics, and I think that we make a lot of mistakes. And what I would like to hear from him is his motive and his intentions behind what he's doing at this particular time.
And you can't take back a word. You can not take back something that you've said. But I think that we can put enough pressure upon anyone that leads a group of people who has put their head into the game to be able to say, I'm willing to help you change the trajectory of a group of people corporately.
I think there has to be a group of individuals that hold them accountable for what they say and what they do. And I'm hoping that I will be amongst those who that do.
BLACKWELL: Let me read something, and then I want you to hear from Mr. Trump and kind of ask you if those two correspond. This is something from your Facebook page in which you write about prayer. You write this, "Prayer is not separated from what we do in this world. Rather, it should be at the center of our lives whether we make a salary or pay salaries. If you are called to work in a secular job or run your own business, then you should be relying on God, through prayer and faith, to infuse you with his wisdom and power so that you will reflect him in your workplace or marketplace."
I want you now to listen to what Donald Trump said when he was asked if he ever asked God for forgiveness.
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not sure I have. I just go and try and do a better job from there. I don't think so. I think if I do something wrong, I think I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture. I don't. Now when I take, you know, when we go in church and when I drink my little wine, which is about the only wine I drink and have my little cracker, I guess that's a form of asking for forgiveness. And I do that as often as possible because I feel cleansed.
BLACKWELL: So your views that you expressed on your Facebook page, what we hear from Donald Trump -- do those two things correspond and what is your view of his view of religion and asking for forgiveness?
TRIMM: I think all of us are on a journey and we're all trying to find a strategy. And the strategy that I found is the strategy of prayer. And I believe that it's very difficult and very hard for anyone that is in leadership to find something that centers them.
For me, it's prayer. The United States of America was founded on the hope for religious freedom. Not only that, but our very anthem is one of a prayer. God bless America. And, so, if we sing the anthem, we're actually praying.
BLACKWELL: So, just to be clear, as I started I want to finish here, although the Trump campaign is billing this as an endorsement of 100 black pastors and evangelicals, that is not what you were invited to do and your intention is not to go there and endorse Donald Trump?
PAUL: We continue meanwhile to monitor the latest developments at a deadly shoot at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. Police just released the suspect's mug shot. Here it is -- a first look at Mr. Dear there. A live report from Colorado Springs straight ahead for you at the top of the hour.
But first, in this week's Start Small, Think Big. A startup company in Los Angeles is creating unique experiences with celebrities to raise money for a lot of different causes. Take a look.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We raise money in awareness for charity by offering the chance to win once in a lifetime experiences. What's the chance to be in the next "Star Trek" movie, to go on a best friend double date with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.
CUMMINGS: We went to this charity gala that Magic Johnson was hosting. And that's really when the idea hit us.
PAULSON: We make it so that anybody in the world can donate $10 for a chance to win and as a result it raises significantly more money for the charity. We create original content at every step of an experience. We market it through social media. We push 80 percent of the net proceeds on to the cause.
CUMMINGS: We're doing (inaudible) Brandon Marshall who is the all-pro wide receiver for the New York Jets. The winner's actually going to go to MetLife Stadium, hang out with Brandon and have VIP tickets to the game.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What's great about Brandon's experience is that it's benefitting Project 375 which is a cause that he founded with his wife.
BRANDON MARSHALL, NFL PLAYER: I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. We want to be the pre-eminent foundation to mental health community.
PAULSON: Our goal is really to build a charitable giving platform. If we can leverage the power of story telling and technology to transform lives, then we've won.
BLACKWELL: Well, this morning, we've got new audio from the scene of yesterday's mass shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. Of course, investigators want to know why, they're searching for the motive here.
Two days after his death, Senator John McCain's final words have now been released to -- quote -- "the association he treasured the most," his fellow Americans.
A short time ago, his former campaign manager read a letter from the war hero, presidential nominee, father of seven. He died Saturday from brain cancer at the age of 81.
"My fellow Americans, whom I have gratefully served for sixty years, and especially my fellow Arizonans, thank you for the privilege of serving you and for the rewarding life that service in uniform and in public office has allowed me to lead.
"I have tried to serve our country honorably. I have made mistakes, but I hope my love for America will be weighed favorably against them.
"I have often observed that I am the luckiest person on earth. I feel that way even now as I prepare for the end of my life. I have loved my life, all of it. I have had experiences, adventures and friendships enough for 10 satisfying lives, and I am so thankful.
"Like most people, I have regrets. But I would not trade a day of my life, in good or bad times, for the best day of anyone else's.
"I owe that satisfaction to the love of my family. One man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America to be connected to America's causes -- liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people -- brings happiness more sublime than life's fleeting pleasures.
"Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed, but are enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves.
"Fellow Americans, that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American.
"We are citizens of the world's greatest republic, a nation of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. And we have acquired great wealth and power in the process.
"We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been.
"We are 325 million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country, we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do.
"Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening. I feel it powerfully still.
"Do not despair of our present difficulties. We believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history.
Let's go to Phil Mattingly, who covered McCain up on Capitol Hill. He's our congressional correspondent.
And as I was listening to that, and I was reading. So this is from Dana from Mark Salter, because I was wondering at what point would Senator McCain have thought to write those words?
And so this what Mark Salter says: "John McCain told me early spring he wanted a Stephen issued postmortem. We discussed what he wanted to say, did a draft. He took a couple of things out and we added a few lines. And I put it in a drawer until the time came."
PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, look, Brooke, I think what's important to note, with the senator, particularly over the course of the last year, is how keenly aware he was of the moment he was in and the legacy that he wanted to leave.
Obviously, he also wrote a book with Mark Salter, which people have been quoting relentlessly over the course of the last 24/48 hours. There was also that very, very poignant speech on the Senate floor where he basically said, my friends, we're getting nothing done. We are getting nothing done, and essentially a call to arms for the Senate to move away from the divisive nature that has kind of taken hold of the chamber over the course of the last decade or so and moved back to a time where people could come across the island and work, disagree, no question about it, but try and figure out a path forward.
It's one of those things, Brooke, that I have noticed. One is how deeply affected members of the Senate have been. Everybody knew this was coming. And yet and still there are tears. There are plenty of stories with hilarious endings, particularly those of senators that have taken foreign trips with Senator McCain, but also a recognition of as, one senator put it to me, the bigness that was John McCain in this institution, a recognition of what the U.S. Senate represents that sometimes has devolved into pettiness and pure partisan fighting.
It's bigger than that, and that's what John McCain represented. Now, in terms of what you're going to see in the days ahead, you will see a mix of the traditional and also the deeply personal. When the Senate opens up at 4:00 p.m., the senator's desk will have a black drape over it with white roses.
That's traditional. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, I'm told, will come to the floor shortly thereafter, planning to give very deeply personal remarks about Senator McCain.
And then, Brooke, as we have been reporting about the funeral arrangements, it's basically a huge who's-who of American politics over the course of the last 30 years. Senator Joe Biden, Democrat, close friend to John McCain, will speak at his Arizona service. When he lies in state in the United States Capitol, one of just 30 people to have actually had that honor, Speaker Paul Ryan, McConnell, others will speak as well, and then obviously the service here in D.C. at the National Cathedral.
President Bush, President Obama, two politicians who bested Senator McCain in the presidential campaigns, will give remarks as well. And then his final resting place at the U.S. Naval Academy, and I think probably more pointed than anything else -- and he hinted at this in his book with Mark Salter -- who he will be buried next to is his best friend, his former classmate, and in the institution that he revered and held so dearly in his heart, the U.S. Naval Academy -- Brooke.
Phil Mattingly, thank you. We will look for -- we will look for all of that went the Senate opens in less than an hour now. Thank you, sir, for that.
The nation will, as Phil just mentioned, spend the week paying tribute to Senator John McCain, a survivor of torture. McCain couldn't actually even raise his arms because of the wounds he suffered as a prisoner of war.
But for decades, he excelled at reaching across the aisle, even in these times, arguably the most difficult period in modern political history. And as the country celebrates and honors this veteran senator, the White House stands glaringly out of line with a nation in mourning.
Today, the flag there at the White House back at full-staff. Meantime, over at the U.S. Capitol, the flag today is at half-staff. Plus, at multiple opportunities with the press today, the president failed to mention a thing about the passing of John McCain.
Five -- on five separate occasions today, the president was asked about Senator John McCain, given an opportunity to offer his tribute to this long-serving senator, former prisoner of war, American hero in the eyes of many. And the president declined to answer those questions, ignoring them instead, staying silent as Senator McCain's name was mentioned time and again during multiple press opportunities just today.
The president has yet to say anything, in fact, about Senator John McCain. He put out a tweet after the senator's passing offering his sympathies to McCain's family. But that is all that we have heard from the president, all that we
The president's daughter, however, Ivanka Trump, she is willing to call John McCain an American hero. In fact, she did so just today.
IVANKA TRUMP, ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Senator John McCain, an American patriot who served our country with distinction for more than six decades.
The nation is united in its grief, and the world mourns the loss of a true hero and a great statesman.
DIAMOND: That comment, Brooke, is particularly striking when you think about the fact that President Trump has yet to ever call John McCain an American hero after he, during early in the 2016 presidential campaign, said that he did not believe McCain was a hero because of the fact that he had been captured in Vietnam.
Of course, John McCain was captured in Vietnam and served -- and was imprisoned for more than five years, tortured, suffering some of the worst torture at the hands of the Vietnamese at that time. The White House not commenting on this matter, and they also haven't responded as of yet to a letter from the two Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate, Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator Mitch McConnell, who requested that Department of Defense resources be allocated to allow all the flags on federal buildings to be lowered to half-staff.
You heard the question shouted at the president on behalf of the American Legion. You know, please lower the flag to half-staff. And still we see it, Old Glory, flying high.
Coming up next: Pope Francis refusing to respond to calls for his resignation after a former archbishop very publicly accused him of turning a blind eye to a cardinal that he knew had abused children. More on that.
Also ahead, the president making a new trade deal with Mexico to replace NAFTA, but Canada so far left out of it. So we will break down what's in the agreement and the significance of Canada at play.
And any moment now, the first lady, Melania Trump, will be hosting an event there on the South Lawn at the White House. We are expecting her to say a few words at this tree planting ceremony. What might she share? We know she tweeted about John McCain, the war hero. What might she add to that, which clearly is in stark contrast to her husband?
BALDWIN: Pope Francis is refusing to address a call for his resignation as he grapples with the sex abuse scandal plaguing the Catholic Church.
Carlo Maria Vigano, a former archbishop and Vatican ambassador to the U.S., is demanding the pope step down. Vigano wrote a lengthy letter in which he claimed the pope knew five years ago about misconduct involving a D.C. cardinal, but did nothing about it.
And when asked about the letter, this is what Pope Francis did share with reporters. I'll read this for you. He says: "I will not say a single word about this. I believe the statement speaks for itself, and you have this sufficient journalistic ability to make your conclusions. It's an act of trust."
And, you know, just thinking of survivors of this abuse, they would obviously say a later date is not sufficient. Why do you think the pope is not being more forceful about these allegations?
REV. EDWARD BECK, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Well, certainly, with this letter, Brooke, the writer obviously has a vendetta against this pope and other prelates that he names in the letter.
You may remember that this is the archbishop who put Kim Davis, that county clerk from Kentucky who refused to sign a same-sex license, for a photo-op with the pope, making it seem as though the pope agreed with her. He was relieved then by Pope Francis of his position in Washington as the ambassador to Washington after that incident.
This particular archbishop, very right-wing, has had a vendetta against this pope for some time. And so many -- if you read this letter, this 11-page letter, his accusations are not sourced. There's no evidence given.
And so when the pope was asked to respond on the plane to it, he simply said, look, you are reporters. If you do your job, you will see why I'm not responding. In other words, it doesn't really deserve the dignity of a response.
Do you think still, though, the question remains, you know, he didn't speak about it in any lengthy way, or if at all in Ireland. Do you think -- why isn't he addressing this head on?
BECK: Well, I think, again, he certainly talked about abuse in Ireland and apologized for abuse. He spoke about it almost every venue where he was.
With this particular accusation that he knew about Cardinal McCarrick and the accusations against Cardinal McCarrick of abusing minors and seminarians and priests, that, he has not yet spoken on.
But I think we will see him probably eventually speak on it. But, remember, he did accept the resignation of him from the College of Cardinals, from McCarrick. And he has banished him from doing any ministry. John Paul II, Pope Benedict never did that. So this pope did act when faced with these allegations of Cardinal McCarrick.
The question is, when did he know, and who told him? And all of those particulars have yet to come out. So I don't think the pope is going to speak about those until there are more details that we know about it.
BALDWIN: Last question, quickly. What does this say about just divisions within the Catholic Church?
There is this right-wing segment of the church that is trying to blame all of this on a gay lobby or a gay conspiracy in the church. This archbishop, Vigano, has been utterly anti-gay in all that he has written.
And you will note that this 11-page letter doesn't talk much about the victims of sexual abuse. It talks about those who enabled the gay lobby. And he names prelates who he thinks are sympathetic to this gay lobby. And so this an issue of right vs. left, those who want to bring Francis down, and those who believe that he's making great strides in many areas for the church.
And I think we're going to continue to see this play out. People are saying this actually could lead to a schism, a split in the church. That remains to be seen.
BALDWIN: Coming up next: President Trump just announced a new trade deal with Mexico to replace what he referred to as if the ripoff that was NAFTA. And the Mexican president join him on speakerphone to propose a toast to celebrate. Watch.
We're following this breakthrough in trade today between the United States and Mexico. In a joint news conference with the outgoing Mexican president on speakerphone, President Trump announced a preliminary agreement to change parts of the NAFTA trade deal starting with the name.
D. TRUMP: And we're going to call it the United States-Mexico trade agreement. We will get rid of the name NAFTA. It has a bad connotation.
I will be terminating the existing deal and going into this deal. We will start negotiating with Canada relatively soon. They want to start. They want to negotiate very badly.
BALDWIN: President Trump has called the NAFTA deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada the worst trade pact in history.
Up until now, massive differences between President Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto have been a major hurdle to reaching a deal.
And, Catherine, we were chatting. And you have this interesting theory as to why the president first went to Mexico instead of having the three countries all working together at once.
So, technically, the president is not authorized to do the bilateral deals with Mexico or Canada. Congress has authorized Trump to renegotiate NAFTA. That's all three countries.
RAMPELL: But I think Trump himself is much more comfortable doing these kinds of one-on-one, bilateral negotiations. I think it probably dates back to his days as a businessman. It's just much easier.
You're sitting across from somebody at the table, and you know what you want, and you kind of know what they want. And you can horse- trade. And having more than two parties complicates things a lot. It's harder to hold the different priorities in your head.
So I think that's why he's going after these bilateral negotiations with NAFTA, also with lots of other countries in Asia. So this is sort of come into his approach to negotiation.
BALDWIN: So the minister Chrystia Freeland, I know she's heading to the White House to have a chat with this president tomorrow, presumably the president at the White House tomorrow. So far Canada's hanging out in the cold.
But do you think in the end they will all, per Congress, have to all come together and be part of this deal?
CAMPBELL: If there is going to be something that replaces NAFTA, at least under current law, it has to involve all three countries.
Whether Canada actually holds all the cards or is in a bad position here, it sort of depends on who you talk to. So on the one hand, Trump really needs a win, right? He needs a win before the midterms. He wants to be able to say that he has renegotiated NAFTA. In that case, he needs Canada on board.
BALDWIN: Let's remind everyone, though, June wasn't too long ago. And this is what Chrystia Freeland said on CNN.
CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: So what you are saying to us and to all of your NATO allies is that we somehow represent a national security threat to the United States.
BALDWIN: Seriously? CAMPBELL: Yes. And that's part of the problem here, that we have done a great job at alienating our friends and allies, including Canada and, to some extent, Mexico, although, obviously, some of that relationship has warmed up recently.
And, again, whether Canada actually comes to the table here is a little bit questionable, because there is this very short window if, in fact, Trump wants this deal signed, as -- as the Mexican government
RYAN NOBLES, CNN ANCHOR: And the next hour of the "Newsroom" starts right now. Hello, thank you so much for joining me. I'm Ryan Nobles, in today for Fredricka Whitfield. We're following stunning new developments in the shooting death of Alton Sterling.
Newly released body camera footage reveals the 37-year-old black man's final moments before being fatally gunned down by a white officer in the summer of 2016. It took baton rouge police officer Blane Salamoni just 90 seconds to shoot sterling after he arrived on the scene.
But it took the police department more than a year and a half to fire the officer and release his body camera footage. CNN's Kaylee Hartung joins us live from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. And Kaylee, what more can you tell us about this video?
KAYLEE HARTUNG, CNN ANCHOR: Well Ryan, with the help of body cam from both officers as well as surveillance video from the convenience store, we now have a more complete picture of what happened on the night of July 5th, 2016. This video released by the Baton Rouge police department last night, I have to remind you, it is graphic.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Showing the controversial shoot death of Alton Sterling in July 2016. The Baton Rouge chief of police announcing Blane Salamoni, who shot sterling six times during a struggle with him will be fired over his actions.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The violation of command of temper has been sustained. Officer Blane Salamoni has been terminated from the Baton Rouge police department effective today.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: this week, Salamoni refused to answer any questions during a disciplinary hearing, the chief said, while Howie Lake, the other officer involved, answered them all. Lake who the chief said made mistakes, but controlled his temper during the encounter was given a three-day unpaid suspension.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two different perspectives. And one officer did not follow the training, professionalismand organization of standards.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The police chief making it clear their administrative investigation was separate from the federal criminal charges both officers were already cleared of. The police department released four videos from the night of the shooting including this surveillance footage from the SSS surveillance store.
That's Sterling at the front of the store sitting at a table where he's selling CDs. Minutes into the tape, he's seen conducting a transaction with an unidentified man. Here he removes what appear to be a gun from his front pocket followed by money from the same pocket.
Within seconds, Sterling is seen jokingly making a shooting motion towards the man. That night, police were initially called to the SSS convenience store responding to a 911 call from a witness who saw a man with a gun. Watch closely as things escalate quickly. From Salamoni's perspective, you can see a brief struggle. Then his gun is trained on sterling's head.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Previously released cell phone videos recorded by bystanders show at this point in the encounter Salamoni believed Sterling was armed. A gun was recovered from Sterling's body. But the federal and state investigations determined that the officer's actions were reasonable and couldn't prove that Sterling wasn't reaching for a gun.
HARTUNG: Blane Salamoni's attorney tells me they will appeal the police chief's decision to fire Salamoni. As a matter of principle, more than anything, even if he is reinstated to this job, he knows he will never be a Baton Rouge police officer again.
But he believes that he did what he was trained to do that night. As this new video circulates, Ryan, Alton Sterling's family is trying to keep his five children from seeing it. The family's attorney says what's most disturbing and most disrespectful about this new video is you can hear the way the officers cuss at Alton Sterling, the way they call him names as he laid on the ground, bleeding and dying.
NOBLES: Kaylee Hartung, live in Baton Rouge. Thank you Kaylee. Outrage also growing in Sacramento after a newly released independence autopsy contradicts the account of how Stephon Clark died. The results revealed the unarmed black man was shot eight times by officers primarily in his back.
Soon protesters will gather for a fifth day demanding justice for Clark's death and answers from law enforcement. That's where we find Ryan Young. He joins us live from Sacramento. And Ryan, describe the atmosphere in the city there right now.
RYAN YOUNG: Well, Ryan, we were at the protests last night as protesters took to streets once again. And I can tell you they were energized, especially saying all the names of victims across the country who they believe have been wrongfully killed by police.
What we see right now though, behind us, there's a stage, and they're starting to put that stage together because they believe this may be one of the largest protests over the last few days. I can tem you these protesters have definitely had their voices heard because they did something kind of interesting. They blocked the front of the NBA arena here.
And that stopped several people from being able to get inside. There's been conversations between the mayor's office, the community and the protesters. And it seems like they've been sort of staying out of the streets for the last few days until police can coordinate the shutdown of the streets as they've been walking forward. But let's talk about the autopsy that came out.
The family definitely got a lawyer. They definitely put this together and then they had that pathologist say what they believe should be the new narrative. They're directly going against what police are saying. They believe that Stephon Clark was shot on his side, his body turned, and then he was shot six times in the back, once in the leg.
Remember, there were 20 shots fired in total, eight of those shots hitting him. The pathologist say any of those shots could have been fatal. That father of two, Stephon Clark, then died after not receiving medical care for several minutes as he lay on the ground.
We could hear people in the crowd ground saying murder, murder, murder, as that news conference was going on. A lot of emotions because people obviously want their voices to be heard when it comes to this case.
NOBLES: All right, a lot of tension still there in Sacramento, California. Ryan young, thank you for sharing. Earlier today I spoke with California congressman John Geremendi about the protests in Sacramento and this is what he had to say about the situation.
JOHN GEREMENDI: This is a tragic death and, frankly, an unnecessary situation. What I'm looking for is what will come of all of this. How will this be dealt with in the future? The protests, understandable. But what needs to be done here, and I know the city council, I know the mayor so very well, more than 30 years. They're good people.
I think what's going to happen here is something similar to what took place 20 miles to the west in the city of Backerville where a new police chief came in and established a very serious training program for his police officers in the community policing organization set up.
Crime rates went down. Deaths have not happened. And I think Sacramento's going to change its procedures and its community policing procedures as a result of this tragedy. So perhaps -- perhaps something will come of this that will be better for the community.
Obviously, a tragic situation. I can understand why people are in the street. I can understand why the family are so terribly, terribly upset by this.
NOBLES: You mentioned the local response. The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, this week called the Stephon Clark case a local issue. Do you believe this is just a local issue?
GEREMENDI: No. No, it's not. This is a national issue. We've seen too much of this across the nation. And what we've seen has resulted in protests and in many places appropriate changes are taking place. And we need to understand from the point of view of the police officers, a confrontation, the adrenaline, the challenge that they're faced with, and all too often police officers are also killed in the line of duty.
And so what we need to do is to go into these communities where these situations have occurred and communities where they could occur in the future, make sure that the police are very, very well trained. That they understand the confrontation that they will have in their line of duty, and that the best way to handle it. And there are certainly, certainly better ways to handle it than what we saw in Baton Rouge and unfortunately here in Sacramento.
NOBLES: A rally supporting Stephon Clark is scheduled to start in the next few hours. And up next, battle of the billionaires. The president is taking on the world's richest man, Jeff Besos, and launching fresh attacks on the company he founded, Amazon. Why Trump says the retail giant is scamming the U.S. Postal Service.
NOBLES: Diplomatic relations between Russia and the United States just took another turn. Russia, showing off a new intercontinental ballistic missile, it's called the Sarmat, but NATO has nicknamed it Satan 2.
And as Barbara Starr reports, Moscow says it can carry multiple warheads and can strike targets around the world.
BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Russia claims this is a test of their new state of the art intercontinental ballistic missile, nicknamed Satan 2. According to the Russian state news agency, it's the second successful test.
It comes after this recent Russia test firing of what it says is an airborne high speed ICBM. Just weeks ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered a flashy display of weaponry, including the Satan 2.
VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator): This new system has virtually no limitations on distance, and as you can see from the video, it's capable of attacking targets via both the North and South Pole.
STARR: One Russian video animation even showing airborne weapons attacking Florida, nobody missing the implication that Russia could reach President Trump's Mar-a-Lago home.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well nothing he said surprised me. Once again, you know, we have very good intelligence capabilities, and we watch very closely, so nothing he said surprised me.
STARR: But the new missile launch comes less than 24 hours after U.S. diplomats were expelled from Russia in retaliation for the U.S. kicking Russians out as part of a global response to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter.
Even if there is no link in timing, a former top U.S. diplomat says it's time for everyone to be careful.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any link (inaudible) nuclear deterrents with the current spat is an upgrade that I think one needs to be careful about. I -- I -- I worry about accident in miscommunication, it's hard to know whether we're close or far away from that.
But the mere notion that there's a minor chance of something going awry on the nuclear side should disturb us all.
STARR: President Trump says he's prepared to discuss all of this with President Putin face to face, even though he didn't bring up the poisoning or election meddling in their last phone call.
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES: We could discuss the arms race, as you know, he made a statement that being in an arms race is not a great thing, and that was right after the election, one of the first statements he made.
And we are spending $700 billion this year on our military and a lot of it is that we are going to remain stronger than any other nation in the world by far.
STARR: Most of these Russian weapons are years away from being operational, but when they are, what happens then? Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon.
NOBLES: Barbara, thank you. The city of Sacramento bracing for another day of protests, as residents demand answers in the deadly police shooting of an unarmed black man. Coming up, how a former NBA player is trying to rally support for Stefan Clarke's family and encouraging his former teammates to get involved.
RYAN NOBLES, CNN ANCHOR: In the next few hours Sacramento will see its fifth straight day of rallies supporting Stephon Clark. The 22- year-old was shot and killed by police while standing in his grandmothers back yard. Newly released independent autopsy results show that Clark was shot by police eight times, six times in the back. And joining me now lives, is Sacramento native and retired NBA player, Matt Barnes. Matt, you've been supporting Stephon Clarks' family since the shooting took place. Tell me why it was so important for you to get involved.
MATT BARNES, RETIRED NBA PLAYER: I grew up in these same streets, you know, not living in Oak Park but always traveling to Oak Park to play basketball growing up. I mean, these Oak Park streets are who - you know what taught me toughness. And what got me through my 15 years on NBA. And then on top of that, being a father of two, I'm a father of two African-American boys, and we saw it come across the news for the first time, on of my twin boy's at 9-years-old asked me, "Daddy, they shot him 20 times because he had a cell phone." And that really gave me chills. So I knew I had to step up and do something for my home town.
NOBLES: And you called on your former teammates to take a stand and support Stephon Clark and his family. I mean, obviously some NBA athletes have been criticized for dipping their toe into politics. I mean what role do you feel athletes should play in situations where their communities are hurting?
BARNES: I feel athletes should play, you know, whatever role they feel comfortable doing. You know, this is not for everybody. I'm someone that has always spoke up on matters, whether they pertained to myself, my family, my teammates, or guys across the league. I just, you know, there's something's that aren't right. So it isn't about color to me, it's about wrong versus right. Like I said I have called on some of my teammates. They've supported, they've donated money. My former teammates, yesterday with the King's held something. The Warriors and King's will both be in town today and they may show up for a little bit. So, we just realized that we have a tremendous platform and if this something that's passionate and touches your heart you should use it in a positive manner.
NOBLES: And you mentioned the fact that there's a King's game tonight, we've seen protests close the doors on two recent King's games since the shooting. But, you know, the ownership group there, they've been actively involved in working with the community instead of worrying about the financial losses that could come because of these protests. I mean, how would you like to see other professional sport organizations take on more active roles when it comes to social issues like these?
BARNES: I just think it depends on every situation that's different. You know what I mean? Sacramento's a small town and the King's are the only show in town. So I think it was huge for (Rebeck) and the King's to step up and do what they've done. They have been very ahead of things, speaking on things and doing the right thing. You know I understand that I'm a former athlete and I love basketball still. You know what I mean? But there's stuff that's bigger than basketball and this is definitely it.
NOBLES: And you mentioned already that this is your hometown, you grew up there, you know these streets. You're there on the ground now, what needs to be down to help this community heal.
BARNES: Maybe we just to have some more understanding, we need to bridge the gap. You know people fear what they don't know. So these officer's don't know us and we don't know them. So therefore everyone is always tense. You know, these officers are paid to protect and serve, but at the same time their taking lives. It's a tough situation but I just think there needs to be more understanding, more in the community foot work by these police officers, get to know their community their patrolling and then at the same time, let these people in the streets be perceptive to it. Understand that together, we're much stronger than we are being separate.
NOBLES: All right, Matt Barnes, former NBA player, father of two, and a Sacramento native. We appreciate you being here, thank you Matt. And in Gaza violent confrontation with Israeli troops have left 17 Palestinians dead and more than 1,000 injured. The U.N. now calling it the most violent day in the region in four years.
NOBLES: There were funerals and more protests in Gaza today. Palestinian leader's declaring a day of mourning for at least 17 people who were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces along the border with Gaza. Israeli officials estimated tens of thousands of Palestinian protestors marched toward the Gaza border fence where the protests turned deadly. Israel is blaming militant group Hamas for inciting violence and turning the border fence into a war zone. And with me now to discuss this is David Keys, he's a spokesman for the Israeli government. David, thank you for joining me. These protestants coincide with the annual land day commemorations by the Palestinians. Why are you specifically blaming Hamas for inciting the violence?
KEYES: Well first of all just a quick correction. To call this a protest is inaccurate. What actually happened is that Hamas engineered and event where they wanted 1,000s of people to swarm into Israel, to overrun Israel, to commit acts of terror. And indeed we have on camera, captured on camera people shooting guns, people shooting rockets, people placing bombs. This is the farthest thing from a protest. I've been to protests.
I know what protests are like. This was not a protest these were acts of deliberate violence. And what is Hamas's game in all this? NOBLES: But why do you - how are you specific to know that Hamas is responsible though sir?
KEYES: Well because their leaders where there, because they encouraged everyone to come because they funded it, and because for a long time they've been doing exactly this, trying to wage aggression and war against Israel. What is Hamas's aim in this? That's the real question. And that's what's almost never discussed on news programs. Hamas has openly called for genocide of Jews. Not just Jews, Americans (Ahmed Bukhari) the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament said count every American, kill them all down to the very last one.
Every American, and every Jew. Hamas has stated (Amos) to destroy Israel, to utterly annihilate the state. That's what (Ishmael Hanieasia) that's what (Yehoshua Sennwald) say's, that's what (Mahmoud Sennwald) say's. And unfortunately that element does not really being covered. Instead it's being called a protest. What kind of protest advocates the annihilation of a state? What kind of protest advocates -- you know Hamas sent a seven year old girl right up to the fence.
So that IBF troops would in their perverse - in the perverse mindset of Hamas would shoot her and kill her. Of course the IBF didn't. It returned this innocent and impressionable girl who was wearing a Mini Mouse sweat suit and was petrified. But she was sent by Hamas. Cynically, cynically is there no bottom to Hamas cynicism? It was disgusting. It's an abomination. But this is the essence of Hamas.
NOBLES: Alright, but David in the Palestinians are accusing Israeli forces of firing into this crowd of people. The head of the marriage party is calling for an investigation into the violence. The IBFs accused of using rubber bullets, tear gas, real live rounds into this crowd of protesters. Not all of them were armed. I mean do you think an investigation is warranted here? And why was the response by the Israel defense force necessary in this case?
KEYES: Well it was necessary because we wanted to stop thousands of people from swarming into Israel. And it was necessary to defend our citizens. You know just to address one element of what you said. Hamas - the interior of Hamas was very prideful when he said, his name is (Fatehamid), and he said our children, our elderly, our women excel in being human shields.
So when we talk about the deaths, the unfortunate violence that we saw yesterday and a little bit today. It is a direct result of Hamas's policy to hide behind children, to hide behind women. And that said Israel only targeted people who were actively engaged in violence. People who shot rockets at Israel, people who shot guns at Israel, and people who placed bombed specifically designed to create violence. That's incredible restraint.
NOBLES: So would you welcome a United Nations investigation into this then, if you're willing to make that claim? Would you welcome that transparency to get to the bottom of exactly what happened?
KEYES: Well the UN is hardly the place to figure all this out given it's decades long obsession with Israel while it lets mass murdering tyrants like Bashar al-Assad. What the UN should be investigating is Iran's daily calls for genocide against Jews. Its daily calls to destroy Israel. It's cynical use of human shields, and putting children - sending children into war. If anything should be investigated it is that, that despicable - those despicable actions and not the defensive actions of a Democratic and Liberal state.
NOBLES: Well you've said you welcome the US decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem, the US also working on a peace plan. I mean how does what we've seen over the past couple of day's impact that, and where does that plan stand right now?
KEYES: Well the first thing to say is that this violence that we see could stop immediately. It could stop as soon as Hamas says don't approach the border fence. Don't try to infiltrate Israel. That is the only thing that would need to be said in order for all this violence to be stopped.
No one needs to be killed, no on needs to be injured in this. The issue of the embassy has actually pushed peace forward. Because it's recognized a basic and simple fact, that Jerusalem is the Capital of the state of Israel. It has been for 70 years. It's been the Capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years. And it's high time that we dispel some of the fantasies. The Palestinian leadership is saying no there's no place for a Jewish State in the Middle East.
The Palestinian leadership is saying from the river to the sea all of this is ours. The Palestinian leadership is paying $100's of millions of dollars to people who murder Israelis. Almost $400 million dollars is paid as salaries to terrorists. So unfortunately the Palestinian leadership is not accepted Israel's outstretched hand for peace, but that will not deter us from continuing again and again to try and forge peace because this is what all peoples in this region deserve.
NOBLES: All right. David Keyes, spokesperson for the Israeli government. David, we appreciate you being here. Thank you. And up next, President Trump launching fresh attacks on Amazon today claiming one of the world's most valuable companies is scamming the U.S. Postal Service. Those details are next.
President Trump lashing out at Amazon again today, criticizing the companies business practices and tax payments and accruing the retail giant of scamming the U.S. Postal Service. These tweets come on the heels of the President's ongoing attacks earlier this week, which weighed in on the shares of one of the world's most valuable companies and rattled markets.
Brad Stone is the author of "The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon" and Stephen Moore is the CNN Senior Economics Analyst and a former Trump Economic Advisor.
Brad, let's start with you. Does the President have a point here? Does Amazon hurt the economy and the postal service?
BRAD STONE, AUTHOR: Well Ryan, it's really difficult to find the facts that supports the President's assertions. The post office is, obviously, having a difficult time, but there are three things that really weight on it.
One, as we all know, first class mail and marketing mail is declining. It has been for a decade. The Postal Service has a significant healthcare obligation for it's employees, but also has universal service obligation, right? It has to cover the whole country, lots of areas where the infrastructure and the delivery trucks are just going to be unprofitable.
Now, package delivery is actually the bright spot. Those trucks are going to those neighborhoods everyday, six days a week, sometimes seven. Package delivery is actually up 11 percent and the post office itself and the Postal Regulatory Commission, which sets the rates, says the relationship with Amazon is profitable. So, it's a little difficult to find out -- to find the facts here that support the President.
NOBLES: Now, well Stephen, the President's tweet caused Amazon's value to drop by billions and it rattled the markets. This President ran on being a business man, why would he risk harming one of America's biggest companies?
STEPHEN MOORE, CNN SENIOR ECONOMICS ANALYST: Well, I don't like it. I will say this, that there's no company probably in the United States that has benefited more from Donald Trump's policies than Amazon.
I mean, you put all this money into consumer's hands, they're sending it, they're using Amazon to buy these products and so, I think he's a little frustrated that Jeff Bezos uses "The Washington Post" as a -- I get "The Washington Post" every morning and it's a sounding board of anti-Trump propaganda.
But I think the bigger point here is, look, I don't see how the administration can say that Amazon is hurting the Postal Service. I mean without Amazon, who uses the Postal Service anymore.
I mean, I sort of agree that there really isn't a need for a postal monopoly any longer and we have seen dramatic declines in people using, obviously, the Postal Service because of e-mail and so on.
And maybe it's time to just open it to competition, but I don't -- I agree that -- I don't see where the administration is coming up with this number that somehow Amazon is costing the Postal Service money. If anything, it's keeping the Postal Service afloat.
NOBLES: Is this more personal for the President? Stephen's calling it propaganda. I'm not sure if that's necessarily a fair assessment, but Jeff Bezos also does own "The Washington Post" and he happens to be the richest man on the planet. His wealth dwarfs that of the President. Could these be factors fueling the reason that the President has decided to target ...
STONE: Yes, I wouldn't call propaganda either, but I don't think we have to guess here. I mean every time the President tweets about this, he talks about the Amazon's "Washington Post" as if it was just one organization.
And I would just add to Stephen's point, the Federal Government had a perfect opportunity last year to place a limit on Amazon's growth and that was when Amazon went and acquired Whole Foods for over $13 billion. And the FDC approved it without even a secondary review, sending shutters into the grocery industry.
So, there have been opportunities for the government to do something to this rapidly growing and very successful company. It hasn't done anything. The tax breaks have given Amazon more capital to expand and yes, customers are choosing to stay home and buy on the internet.
MOORE: But that a -- Brad, I mean you making the sort of point that this is a kind of witch hunt against Amazon. If Trump hated Amazon, he would have told the FDC that Amazon should not be able to buy Whole Foods.
Look, I was in favor of that merger. I think Amazon is one of our great companies. It's made -- it's worth hundreds of billions of dollars, it is delivering low cost products to American's, that's why they use it. So, I think it's a great story. And my only point was that Amazon really has benefitted a lot from the tax cuts.
NOBLES: But Stephen, isn't that the problem though? That it seems as though the President, on every other point, would support Amazon's growth, but only for the fact that they own "The Washington Post" that he appears to be calling them out. I mean, doesn't that concern you at all that he's attacking a media organization and using it, masking it at somewhat with his concerns about Amazon?
MOORE: Yes, it does. But my point is, that he did allow the merger to go forward with Whole Foods and I think that's a positive thing. And look, I think Donald Trump is pro-business, he wants businesses to succeed. I think he would love to see Jeff Bezos maybe be more praise worthy to the policies because most of the policies that Trump has put forward that have helped Amazon, Jeff Bezos has then - his outlets like the Washington Post are criticizing him.
MOORE: No, that's not what I'm saying. That's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying that in Washington I think Trump is feeling like no good deed goes unpunished, and he's promoting these policies that are pro-business, that have helped Amazon, and then Amazon's CEO goes around and knifes him in the back, and I think that's something that frustrates the president.
STONE: There are some ways in which the Trump administration can't hurt Amazon. Amazon has bid for a very large Department of Defense contract that's going to be awarded this summer. The VA will choose a new supplier for its hospitals next year. Amazon could locate its second headquarters in the D.C. area, so it'll be interesting to watch this. Trump can hurt Jeff Bezos. I just don't think that postal rates are the way he's going to do it if he tries.
MOORE: Yes, and just to be clear, I don't want the government to use its power to bully American companies. I'm against that. I just wanted to make that very clear.
NOBELS: Stephen Moore and Brand Stone, thank you so much for joining us. And still ahead, porn star Stormy Daniels's attorney says he has a mountain of evidence. Is he ready to show it to a judge?
NOBLES: A prominent lawyer leaving the case of one of President Trump's accusers, former Apprentice contestant, Summer Zervos. This as Stormy Daniels's lawyer is digging in, telling CNN that he has a mountain of evidence against the president and his attorney. CNN's Athena Jones has the details.
ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Stormy Daniels set for a weekend of stripping in Nashville, performing as the porn star the trumps them all.
JONES: As her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, faces questions about when he'll reveal proof of the affair Daniels says she had with President Donald Trump in 2006 and why he is yet to explain this tweet with a picture of a DVD and the caption, "if a picture is worth a thousand words, how many words is this worth?"
MICHAEL AVENATTI: Well, I'm not going to do that. I mean, I know that everyone wants that. We're in a society where everybody wants immediate gratification. We've got a lawsuit to track back.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I guess the point is what's your evidence? What's your evidence that there was an affair?
JONES: Daniels is suing to be released from what she argues is an invalid hush agreed, invalid because Trump did not sign it. Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, says he paid Daniels $130,000 as part of that deal. Avenatti was asked today how much money it would take for Daniels to settle the lawsuit.
JONES: Avenatti maintains the Federal judge's ruling Thursday denying his motion to question Trump and Cohen under oath isn't a setback.
AVENATTI: Well, I don't really classify it as a set back. I mean, it's a temporary denial. We're going to re-file the motion. It's a procedural ruling.
JONES: David Schwartz, Cohen's spokesman and attorney in another matter, is praising the judge's decision.
DAVID SCHWARTZ: I'm surprised in the least bit. I said from the moment that the motion was filed that it was frivolous, it was untimely, and the judge made the proper decision.
JONES: Schwartz called the hush agreement "rock solid" and continued to argue that it is valid even though Trump didn't sign it.
JONES: Meanwhile, a legal shakeup in the case of former Apprentice contestant, Summer Zervos, who was accusing Trump of defamation for denying her claims he sexually assaulted her in 2007, Zervos losing her high-profile attorney, Gloria Allred. Allred, who frequently represents women in similar cases, saying in a statement, "Our withdrawal has nothing to do with the merits of her case against President Trump. We will have no comment regarding the reasons for our firm's withdrawal. We continue to wish Summer the very best in her pursuit of justice."
Zervos says she's parting ways with Allred for personal reasons. "I decided to part ways with Gloria Allred purely for personal reasons having nothing to do with her work as my attorney. I look forward to having my day in court with my current legal team."
NOBELS: And I want to bring in Avery Freedman right now, a civil rights attorney, and Richard Herman, a criminal defense attorney, to talk about all of this. Richard, let's start with the deposition. I mean, do you agree with Mr. Avenatti? Is the judge's rejection of his deposition because being too premature is actually a good thing? Can he make that claim?
RICHARD HERMAN: I don't know that it's a good thing. I don't think the motion was timely, and so the judge made a procedural decision. But the bottom line here is this. It's always the cover up that causes the problem. And if I represented Trump and this came out early on, I would've had him go on Twitter or TV and say, "yes, I was with Stormy and the playmate and others and it's none of your business," and the thing is over with. But they didn't do that, and supposedly Michael Cohen out of his love and devotion for the president concocted this ridiculous web and scheme to shut up Stormy Daniels, and with Michael Cohen and his new spokesperson, David Schwartz, they have republished and stated unequivocally Trump knew nothing about this agreement. Well, if Trump knew nothing about this agreement, how could Trump be a party to the agreement if he knew nothing about it, number one -
HERMAN: And number two, there are warranties and representations made in the agreement by Trump to Stormy Daniels. He couldn't possibly make those if he was not a party and didn't know about the agreement. So Michael Avenatti has to stop being cute and seeking publicity for himself now. The case is ripe for a summary judgment dismissal, he will get it (ph), this case is over.
NOBLES: Well Avery, let -- to that point, I mean Avenatti is certainly using all of this drama to get him on television as much as possible and he keeps claiming that he's got this evidence to prove his case and the president should be deposed.
FRIEDMAN: That was -- (inaudible) was terrific with him, because she was asking the right questions, he was ducking and weaving. I mean he thought it was a prize fight.
The bottom line on it is if you read Judge James Otero's opinion, he actually was very kind to Mr. Avenatti. He said, you know, you better start being a little bit more careful. This is federal court, everybody here thinks that they're Rambo.
But at the end of the day, I'm not quite sure I have an understanding why the Trump private legal team needs to be Rambo. There's something to be said about playing it down, not bullying it out, but that's what's going on right now.
It is true that Avenatti got shot down on his effort to do a two hour deposition with Mr. Trump, but ultimately, the federal rules of civil procedure, and the Supreme Court has said so, it will give him an opportunity to take the deposition.
So instead of ramping it up, frankly, there has been no effort to unwind it, to diffuse it, and this is going to turn into a total -- it's going to get worse than it is right now, Ryan. And the bottom line is there is going to be a deposition, there is no way Donald Trump can escape that, no way on earth.
NOBLES: All right, well Richard, let's go back to a point that you made earlier on (ph) Cohen spokesman, David Shwartz that the president never even knew about the non-disclosure agreement with Stormy Daniels and thus had no idea about the $130,000 payment to silence Stormy.
DAVID SHWARTZ, ATTORNEY: The president was not aware of the agreement, at least Michael Cohen never told him about the agreement. I can tell you that. And you asked a whole bunch of questions so let me -- let me cover that.
SHWARTZ: He was not aware about any of it, he was not aware, he wasn't told about it. Michael Cohen left the option open, that's why he left that signature line, the option --
NOBLES: So Richard, if you can quickly, how likely is that and if it's true, does it undermine the entire agreement?
HERMAN: It -- he just laid the foundation for a summary judgement motion to dismiss this case and have the judge declare the agreement null and void, because Trump could not possibly have been a participant to agreement he knew nothing about.
In the real world, though, it's beyond ludacris and absurd. Everyone knows Trump had to have known, they're saying this because of the campaign finance violation because if Trump new about the agreement and then made the $130,00 payment, they've got a major problem.
HERMAN: -- it's preposterous, this case -- this case will be dismissed if Avenatti makes that motion. If he doesn't make the motion, he's just a publicity seeker, and he's not doing the right thing for the client.
They moved -- they moved to get rid of this case -- this -- this document, this agreement, they should make that motion now and they'll win.
NOBLES: All right, sorry guys, we're up against a break here so I'm going to have to let you go. Thank you so much Avery Freedman and Richard Herman, we appreciate it. And a quick reminder, don't miss an all new episode of Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World.

Kahyō (華氷, Kahyō) is a member of the Ryūha Armament Alliance. She later becomes the warden of Hōzuki Castle.
Kahyō and her older brother, Rahyō, were born in Kirigakure. Because her ancestors were conquered by Kiri, Kahyō was distrusted by the village and considered expendable. After Kahyō married, she and her husband chose to leave Kiri in order to escape this mistreatment. They settled in the Land of Waves, hoping to find freelance ninja work. Although they did indeed find work, they were no more respected there than in Kiri. Disheartened, Kahyō's husband turned to drinking and eventually drowned in a stupor.
With her husband gone, Kahyō stopped pursuing ninja work, instead choosing to support herself and her son, Hakuhyō, by doing odd jobs. The jobs were boring and didn't pay well, but Kahyō was satisfied because nobody got hurt. But one day, while Hakuhyō was playing in the woods with a friend, the two were attacked by hornets. Hakuhyō used the Ice Release he'd inherited from his mother to save his friend, not worrying for himself. The friend, scared of Hakuhyō's ability, abandoned him.
When Hakuhyō didn't come home that night, Kahyō went looking for him. She asked the locals for help but, having heard from Hakuhyō's friend about her Ice Release, they would tell her nothing. She eventually found Hakuhyō alone and in desperate need of medical attention. She tried to find a doctor, but all of the Land of Waves' doctors had been hired by the Allied Shinobi Forces to assist in the Fourth Shinobi World War. So Hakuhyō died, and Kahyō became convinced that no amount of effort would allow her to escape the world's cruelties. When the war ended, she and Rahyō joined the Ryūha Armament Alliance in the hopes of rectifying this.
Kahyō has long, curly hair. Her shinobi-attire consists of snow-white clothes and a mask with a hook-pattern on it. In disguise, she wore a long, blue dress.
Kahyō has shown to be a very skilled kunoichi being able to go head to head with Kakashi Hatake, the Sixth Hokage, and surprising him on several occasions. Her power was also enough to humiliate the Fourth Raikage in a training bout. As further testament of her skills, Kakashi recommended that she be put in charge of the Hōzuki Castle.
Kahyō is able to utilise the Ice Release, by simultaneously combining the water and wind-natured chakra to produce ice. Through the use of her kekkei genkai, Kahyō can freeze moisture in the air to form ice swords, which she can form from great distances. She is also able to freeze targets to death by causing ice particles to form on their body either remotely or through physical contact. The technique is very useful in neutralising shinobi and is on par with the Fire Release: Heavenly Prison.
Main article: Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky Naruto Uzumaki assaults the Armament Alliance's compound in the Land of Waves to capture Garyō, its leader. Kahyō tries to defend Garyō, but the Naruto she directs her attacks at ends up being a shadow clone. She realizes this in time to block Naruto from escaping with Garyō. Garyō tries to convince Naruto to let him go by, among other things, telling him how Kahyō's son died. Naruto shares his condolences, but it doesn't change his belief that the Armament Alliance's terrorist activities are wrong. Sai swoops down and, despite Kahyō's efforts to stop him, flies away with Naruto and Garyō.
Two months later, Kahyō, Rahyō, and the rest of the Armament Alliance come up with a plan to have Garyō released from the Blood Prison by hijacking the Tobishachimaru, an airborne ship. Kahyō poses as a regular passenger in order to get aboard and is assisted by Kakashi Hatake, one of the Konoha-nin providing security. She plants ice particles on him in case she'll need them later. After the Tobishachimaru takes off, Kahyō secludes herself in a bathroom stall while Rahyō and the others begin the hijacking. When members of the security detail confront Rahyō, she remotely freezes them to death.
Kahyō hears someone moving in the air ducts running throughout the ship and attacks them with shards of ice. This dislodges the duct, dropping the person, Kakashi, in front of her. Kakashi recognizes her from their earlier encounter and believes that she is hiding from the hijackers. He takes her with him to find a safer hiding spot. Kahyō pleads with him to have Garyō released so that Rahyō will not need to kill any of the passengers as he's threatened to do, but Kakashi explains that he can't do that. He promises to save as many as he can before leaving her in an out-of-the-way location.
Kakashi and his cohort, Might Guy, soon set off exploding tags in an effort to force the Tobishachimaru to land, but Kahyō quickly stabilizes the ship and puts out the flames. She changes into her combat attire, dons a mask, and joins Rahyō, who is now fighting Guy and Kakashi. Kahyō trades attacks with Kakashi, who does not recognize her because of the mask, but does know who she is from Naruto's report about when he met her. Kakashi sympathizes for the death of her son, but argues that it is inevitable that a shinobi will lose somebody they love. Kahyō retorts that the deaths of fellow shinobi are one thing, but that the death of her son is an innocent life that can't be compared. Kakashi points out that the Armament Alliance is now threatening to kill the innocent passengers aboard the Tobishachimaru.
Kahyō becomes angry by Kakashi's observation and performs Ice Release: Earthen Consecutive Chains of Ice, which starts spreading across the area, engulfing everything it comes into contact with. Rahyō tells Kahyō to stop and, when his order is ignored, he knocks Kahyō unconscious. Though the Chains of Ice disappear, a hole is left in the floor and the different pressures between inside and outside start sucking out those on board. Kahyō's mask is blown off while this is happening, allowing Kakashi to see her face before he too is blown from the ship. When Kahyō regains consciousness, she plugs the hole with ice.
One of the passengers pleads with Rahyō to release her son, whose asthma is acting up and has lost his medicine in the hijacking. Rahyō contemplates allowing the boy to die, payback for the death of his nephew, Hakuhyō. Kakashi reveals himself and pleads with Kahyō to let the boy leave with Sai, who helped him get back onto the Tobishachimaru. Rahyō, frustrated by Kakashi's return, attacks him. When Kakashi begins defending himself, Kahyō activates the ice particles she planted on him earlier to prevent him from using chakra. With Kakashi neutralized, she overrides Rahyō and allows the boy and his mother to go with Sai. When another passenger complains about this "special treatment", she freezes him to death.
Kahyō shares her history with Kakashi so that he can understand why she's doing what she's doing. Kakashi has no response to the cruelties that she's experienced or the senselessness of her son's death, and is silently taken away. As the Tobishachimaru nears the Blood Prison, Rahyō and the rest of the Armament Alliance begin outfitting the remaining passengers with parachutes, seemingly so that they can disembark safely. Kakashi, having escaped his confinement, confronts Rahyō, explaining to the passengers that the parachutes are loaded with explosives that will detonate when they reach the ground. He tries removing some of their parachutes, but the ice planted on him by Kahyō still impedes him.
Kahyō questions Rahyō about whether Kakashi's accusation is true. Rahyō reluctantly says it is. Saddened, Kahyō attacks Kakashi but her ice projectiles miss and Kakashi, in his counter, discovers the ice binding him is gone. He attacks her, but stops short of killing her, realizing that's what she wanted. Kahyō admits that Kakashi's earlier words have been resonating with her, but only now has she become convinced that she was wrong. As she starts articulating her regrets, the Tobishachimaru begins to sway from all the damage it's received and a fire breaks out. While Kahyō focuses on extinguishing the flames, the ship heaves and Rahyō is flung overboard. Kakashi is unable to save him and Kahyō cries out in despair.
The damage to the Tobishachimaru causes it to rise higher and higher into the sky, which will eventually kill everyone on board. Kakashi convinces Kahyō to help him stop this and save the passengers by puncturing the helium sacs that keep the ship airborne. Once this is done, the Tobishachimaru starts plummeting to the ground and Kahyō uses her ice to hold the ship together and ease its fall. It works, but this rapidly depletes the moisture in the air until she can no longer make ice, at which point the ship starts tipping again. Kakashi leaps through a hole in the hull out into the clouds the Tobishachimaru is falling through and uses Lightning Release: Purple Electricity to induce rain.
Able to make ice again, Kahyō stabilizes the Tobishachimaru and lands it near the Blood Prison. Several passengers are injured in the crash, but none are killed. The Konoha ninja who converge on the wreck take Kahyō into custody on orders of the Fifth Hokage. Because of how many passengers died because of the Armament Alliance, Kahyō should be sentenced to death. But Kakashi proposes that Kahyō instead be given life-imprisonment on the condition that she become warden of the Blood Prison and use her ice to keep the prisoners in check. The Fifth Hokage agrees to this on the condition that Kakashi become the Sixth Hokage. Kahyō vows to accept this assignment if that is what Kakashi asks of her, so he officially takes on the title of Sixth Hokage.
A few months later, the Five Kage visit the Blood Prison to render final approval of Kahyō's position as warden. When Kahyō humiliates the Fourth Raikage by freezing off his beard, the other Kage decide that she is more than qualified. In time, Kahyō writes a letter to Kakashi, telling him that, although she is constantly busy with her duties, her heart is finally at peace.
Kahyō is mentioned in Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 in a side quest in the Shikamaru's Tale Adventure Mode DLC. It is revealed that shortly after she took over as lord of Hōzuki Castle, the number of secondary offences within the prison had dropped significantly. As a result, Shikamaru suggests that Kakashi send her a gift to reward her for all her hard work.

At the very beginning of a round the Service generates a random long number from 0 to 1 (e.g. 0.282796734) and encrypts it through the md5 algorithm. The result is displayed at the beginning of a round.
At the end of the round the Service multiplies the number by the general number of all tickets thus getting the number of a winner.
An example: At the end of a round the general deposit is 1000 (there are 1000000 tickets in the game), a generated number was 0.282796734.
The Service multiplies the number 0.282796734 by 1000000 thus getting the number of a winner 282796 that is being displayed at the moment of a raffle.
A Fair Game Principle: we can’t know a tickets number that is displayed at the end of a round in advance and the multiplied random number is generated at the very beginning of a game. That is why we have no opportunity to influence the results of a raffle.

The middle weight segment has been quiet for a few years now, could this noise be coming from that direction?
This morning, Yamaha published a new â€œR Worldâ€� teaser video on its website and social media channels. The companyâ€™s official press release says itâ€™s â€œalluding to an upcoming new motorcycle introduction.â€� Read between the lines â€“ watch the video â€“ and it seems pretty clear to us: this is the new YZF-R6.
Thatâ€™s the only line of significance in Yamahaâ€™s press release, other than mentioning another video will be released October 4th. Without much to work with, hereâ€™s what we can gather so far.
First and foremost, the video is dominated by the distinct sound of a high-revving inline four-cylinder engine, leading us to believe this is in fact the next R6. Unless Yamaha is pulling a fast one on everybody, that alone squashes the rumor (hope?) that the long-awaited, all-new R6 will be powered by a three-cylinder engine. Also interesting is the engine note clearly does not mimic that of the crossplane crank-equipped R1, indicating Yamaha is sticking to the screamer 180-degree firing intervals for this middleweight.
From there, we see a rider on a racetrack (a few, actually; Chuckwalla Valley Raceway, Thunderhill Raceway Park, and Barber Motorsports Park) tucked beneath the bikeâ€™s windscreen, which appears rounder and more bulbous than the broad, flat screen of the current R6.
At approximately the 12-second mark in the video the rider moves to the side, revealing a completely digital gauge cluster. The shot is only on screen for a fraction of a second, but it appears similar in shape to â€“ but not a copy of â€“ the unit seen on Yamahaâ€™s FZ (MT for the Euros) line.
Thereâ€™s not much else to see after that, as the following riding sequence shows the rider again in a tuck, but with only the track surface reflecting off his faceshield â€“ not any instrumentation. Despite learning little from this video, we can make some educated guesses about what to expect. The current R6 has its roots stretching all the way back to 2006, which then received a revamp for 2008. So itâ€™s essentially 11 years old now, and its engine was designed long before Euro 4 emission regulations were on the table.
So we expect a thorough overhaul of the entire engine and drivetrain to meet modern global standards. Unlike the literbike world, however, the middleweight category has been stagnant for a number of years, so a horsepower war isnâ€™t one Yamaha has to fight particularly hard to win. Somewhere between 110-115 hp to the wheel would be impressive for a â€œtrueâ€� 600 (not a 636 or 675), especially considering modern noise emissions regulations.
We can also expect to see ABS since itâ€™ll be required on all motorcycles above 125cc in Europe starting in 2017, along with traction control and other rider aids, as has become de rigeur in the sportbike world. Time will tell if the R6 borrows the IMU from its R1 sibling and incorporates slide, launch, and wheelie control as well.
A key part of the equation for new 600cc supersports is balancing prices, as it costs nearly as much to manufacture a 600 as it does a literbike. The current R6 has an MSRP of $10,990, so itâ€™ll be reasonable to expect the price tag of a new R6 will be inflated.
The next video is set to be released October 4th, which, coincidentally, is also media day at the Intermot show in Germany. Weâ€™ll learn a lot more then, so stay tuned.
Well it seems Yamaha decided they don't want to show us the bike, it will be shown at EICMA next month.

The cleaning products wholesale market encompasses many areas of sanitation and this is certainly evident when it comes to computer cleaning. Like other accessories for laptops and desktops, such as cases and wrist supports, computer cleaning products commonly reach the consumer through wholesale channels. Sometimes supplied by office stationery suppliers and sometimes by IT resellers, all of which can be accessed on productpilot.com, PC cleaning products include items like screen wipes, compressed air canisters, miniature vacuum appliances and anti-static foam cleaners. A typical cleaning products manufacturer will make a variety of these products and frequently market them within a distinctive range under the same brand. When wholesalers bundle these items together, they are often sold to consumers as cleaning kits.
Due to the low voltage elements that are part of many computers' design, touching certain parts of the internal workings with hands can cause damage, even blowing parts of circuit boards when the power is restored. A cleaning products manufacturer will make items which help to remove grime and dust without the sensitive parts of a computer needing to be touched. When it comes to miniature vacuum cleaners, for example, these tend to have bristles at the end to the nozzle, which means that inappropriate amounts of pressure are not applied onto circuit boards. In addition, nozzles tend to be long and thin, to keep hands out of the way whilst allowing access. As well as removing dust, the cleaning products wholesale market also makes products design to stop it from collecting in the first place, such as negatively charged anti-static sprays and wipes. A buyer looking for a cleaning products wholesaler can use productpilot.com to access all of the latest innovations and market developments.
I wonder if he actually had any medals awarded or was ever in Southeast Asia? At least they're going after him for lying.
KERRVILLE — A misdemeanor perjury charge has been filed against an U.S. Army veteran who falsely testified at a child custody hearing here that he'd received the Medal of Honor.
Russell Fris of Palmer admitted Friday that he'd gotten no such honor for service in Vietnam and blamed his testimony on miscommunication caused by his poor hearing and the influence of post-surgery medications.
“Unless someone is looking at me in the face, or I have a phone right up to my ear, I can't hear what people say,” said Fris, 56, who was released from Ellis County Jail after posting $5,000 bail. He'd spent a week behind bars.
However, Fris previously had spun the same tale of receiving the armed forces' highest award for valor in action against enemy forces, according to his girlfriend, Jennifer Knoulton, and the attorney of her former husband, John Knoulton.
“He's told me several times,” said Jennifer, who accepts Fris' explanation that he isn't on the official list of the 97 living medal recipients because his records are sealed.
Fris made the same claim on the stand at the March 6 hearing where Kerr County Court at Law Judge Spencer Brown granted John Knoulton's request to temporarily modify custody of the Knoultons' children.
A hearing transcript shows that after telling John Knoulton's lawyer, Pat Maguire, that he'd won the medal, Fris said: “There ain't no way you could have found out about it. My records are congressionally sealed.”
After inquiring of the Medal of Honor Society, Maguire alerted local authorities to possible perjury by Fris and the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the possible violation of the Stolen Valor Act of 2005. The federal law bars falsely representing oneself as having been awarded any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the armed forces, and expanded prohibitions against wearing, making or the unauthorized selling of military decorations.
When Fris was asked Friday why Jennifer Knoulton contradicted his denial of previously making the false medal claim, he said: “I've got Purple Hearts, Distinguished Flying Crosses, medals for valor. I don't even know what all medals I do have.”
Do the math...he's 56, so 18 in 71...he must have really gotten busy...no training whatsoever, they just sent him to RVN because he looked really tough.
TS is right, The Stolen Valor Act isn't being pushed enough by the FBI or Prosecute Attorneys.....:rolleyes: This is not a priority for them........ :mad:
Ahh yes. The old "sealed records" gambit. No doubt he lost his hearing during a top secret mission to assassinate Uncle Ho.
Bad hearing my ass! "I'm sorry did you say medal of Honor? I thought you asked if my pedal was on her."
I hope those Texans in Kerr County give this asshole a very hard time. I doubt the Feds will do anything. Too bad Vigilantes are out of fashion these days.
Sometimes Fall fishing in the Carolinas is fantastic. Caught this guy today on a 4" Mullet, 3 miles offshore. Dinner should be great. :D
"Wrapped in cornmeal and fried in butter, it will taste sweeter than the kisses of Esmerelda..." Richard Brautigan in"Trout Fishing in America".
That is one nice fish.. I believe that is a Fluke not a Flounder. The Flounder and Fluke fishing has been amazing this past year!
We don't have fluke in South Carolina of which I am aware. I could be wrong, I've only been fishing here for 15 years and am a licensed charter captain. :cool:
Generally speaking, left-side up flounder are flukes, and right-side up flounders are called flounders. That sounds easy enough to remember, but it gets worse. Flukes are also called “summer flounder,” and flounder, or right-side fish, are called “winter flounder.”
It also turns out that, of the 500 plus flatfish species, there are five species that are all called flounder. It’s good to know that there is a difference, but I would be hard pressed to taste the difference between a fluke or a flounder.
Four of the five flounder species are found in the Atlantic: summer flounder (left-side up flukes), winter flounder, southern flounder and European flounder. The fifth, the Japanese flounder, is found in the Pacific Ocean.
Flounder also lack teeth and have a much smaller mouth. I obtained my 100 ton last year but didn't get to run many trips. I was mostly confined to the deck :boohoo.. What kinda charters do you run?
Maybe the east coast flounder lack teeth, but Texas gulf coast flounder have a mouth full of sharp teeth.

Are you in the market for a vehicle but don't want to make a financial commitment to purchasing a brand new car? If so, you certainly aren't alone -- and fortunately, the used car market offers a huge variety of makes, models, and prices. Although used cars sometimes get a bad rap, they can be a wise financial move under the right circumstances. However, keep in mind that the seller has decided to get rid of the car for a reason, so be sure to do your due diligence before putting your signature on the dotted line.
With life being so unpredictable and changes happening so drastically, sometimes financial woes and money hardships are just part of the equation. Whether it was the loss of employment, a change in your ability to work, a divorce, or something else, you may be facing a few different options to help you wade your way through to the other side. Two common ways for people to get through a sticky situation with mounting debt is filing for bankruptcy and seeking some type of debt consolidation.
If you or a loved one has been arrested and charged with a crime, bail may have been set. The majority of the time, bail is posted with the help of a bail bonds company, like ASAP Bail Bonds. Typically, these companies will post bond for about 10 percent of the bond amount. For example, if bail is $5000, you pay the bail bonds company $500 to post bond for you or your loved one.
Drug crimes are on the rise in many areas of the country. Currently, heroin is taking over Ohio, as evidenced by the numerous news stories of people shooting up and overdosing in parking lots. Opioids, particularly the prescription kind, are seizing Wisconsin. Crack cocaine is still a drug of choice in California and New York. States are cracking down while they are simultaneously making it legal to possess marijuana. If you have been charged with a drug crime, what are the odds that your drug crime lawyer can get your charges dropped?
If you are a parent who is going through a divorce, one of the main things that you might be worried about is how your kids are going to be affected. After all, a lot of kids have a hard time dealing with their parents' divorce. Believe it or not, hiring a divorce lawyer rather than handling the divorce yourself can be beneficial in many ways, including the fact that it can make things easier on your kids.
When you can barely rest at home after working all day for bill collectors calling, when every piece of mail is a past-due bill and when you are being threatened with the loss of your home, there are few more effective measures available than the declaration of bankruptcy. While this is not a decision to be made lightly, it will provide you with the means to make a fresh start and get some immediate peace of mind.
If you have been charged with a criminal offense, chances are you will be attending a hearing and a trial set in a courtroom. There is a certain decorum that comes with being in a courtroom, and you should aim to be on your best behavior during the proceedings. Failing to do so could land you in a lot more trouble than what you are currently being accused of. Refraining from certain bad behavior seems obvious, such as arguing with the judge or taunting witnesses.
Many people are interested in the issue of avoiding probate, but in all likelihood that is not possible. Probate allows for all-encompassing coverage of disposing of both property and debts of the deceased, and no real alternative exists for this important legal process. You can, however, use another handy legal instrument to keep some of the estate property out of probate, and doing so holds many advantages. To learn more about using a revocable trust to keep property away from probate, read on.
After my divorce, I was left swimming in a sea of debt. I struggled for a few years to get back on solid ground financially, but nothing I did seemed to work. The bills kept coming and I kept fighting to catch up. Finally, I had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Before filing, I wanted to learn everything I could. I found there was a lot of information available, but it was heavy with legalese. That is when I made the decision to start this blog. I want to help others understand what is going to happen when they file and all of their other options for getting out of debt.

90m2 apartment with complete refurbishment in the heart of the Gothic Quarter. This open-plan apartment is located in a historic building dating from 1910 and retains some architectural details typical of the period such as high ceilings. This is a combination of today's practicality and the very essence of Modernisme.
The apartment has a large, airy dining/living room with access to a balcony, and an open-plan kitchen. The sleeping quarters comprise two double rooms and a full bathroom. The location is unbeatable in the heart of Barcelona's Gothic Quarter, with a fabulous cultural provision, not only for having the Gran Teatre del Liceu and the Palau de la Musica nearby, but also because there are lots of museums, such as the Picasso and art galleries that change their exhibitions, so there's always something to see. In addition, Placa Sant Jaume is nearby, as are Placa Catalunya and the Ramblas. It's well connected by metro at Liceu L3 or Jaume I L4 stations, as well as to buses and the Placa Catalunya railway station.

An increasing number of studies and reports from different organizations and contexts examine the linkages between health and different factors, including lifestyles, environments, health care organization and health policy, one specific health policy brought into many countries in recent years was the introduction of the sugar tax. Beverage taxes came into light with increasing concerns about obesity, particularly among youth. Sugar-sweetened beverages have become a target of anti-obesity initiatives with increasing evidence of their link to obesity.[22]– such as the 1974 Lalonde report from Canada;[21] the Alameda County Study in California;[23] and the series of World Health Reports of the World Health Organization, which focuses on global health issues including access to health care and improving public health outcomes, especially in developing countries.[24]
The UK's National Health Service (NHS) is a publicly funded healthcare system that provides coverage to everyone normally resident in the UK. It is not strictly an insurance system because (a) there are no premiums collected, (b) costs are not charged at the patient level and (c) costs are not pre-paid from a pool. However, it does achieve the main aim of insurance which is to spread financial risk arising from ill-health. The costs of running the NHS (est. £104 billion in 2007-8)[48] are met directly from general taxation. The NHS provides the majority of health care in the UK, including primary care, in-patient care, long-term health care, ophthalmology, and dentistry.
Recently (2009) the main representative body of British Medical physicians, the British Medical Association, adopted a policy statement expressing concerns about developments in the health insurance market in the UK. In its Annual Representative Meeting which had been agreed earlier by the Consultants Policy Group (i.e. Senior physicians) stating that the BMA was "extremely concerned that the policies of some private healthcare insurance companies are preventing or restricting patients exercising choice about (i) the consultants who treat them; (ii) the hospital at which they are treated; (iii) making top up payments to cover any gap between the funding provided by their insurance company and the cost of their chosen private treatment." It went in to "call on the BMA to publicise these concerns so that patients are fully informed when making choices about private healthcare insurance."[50] The practice of insurance companies deciding which consultant a patient may see as opposed to GPs or patients is referred to as Open Referral.[51] The NHS offers patients a choice of hospitals and consultants and does not charge for its services.

This project is part of the cluster "BIG and SMALL DATA in Education" established in the research center SLATE. Uni Research Computing will carry out the realization of a Big Data e-infrastructure to accompany the scientific activities of SLATE. The e-infrastructure will be the host of raw primary educational data and will support its access, assessment, analysis, comparison and manipulation. Tools will be developed in close collaboration with the researchers of SLATE. Further tools are provided for other stakeholders in the Educational sector, such as public authorities, teachers and learners, which receive services based on state-of-the-art scientific insights.
To support the communication with the related external communities, the e-infrastructure will be equipped with machine-2-machine (M2M) interfaces to enable the communication with external datasources, such as the University of Bergen's (UiB) Mitt UiB e-support platform, MOOC-systems nationally and internationally, other e-learning platforms and learning applications e.g., open educational resources. Collaboration with other LAK-centers [1] on international level is envisaged. Further, the center will provide graphical user-interfaces (web-portals) to support directly human access to the knowledge system. Different roles for public authorities, teachers and learners as well as external researchers will be carefully designed to allow reporting/interaction on the scientific, macro, medium or micro-level.
On the systems level, the knowledge system will be realized by means of a Big Data data-lake, storing raw educational data and other education related information. The system will provide carefully designed Machine Learning algorithms to support scientific and service tasks. The hierarchy of raw data and several levels of derived data will be established throughout the lifetime of SLATE along the lines of the center’s research activities. The system will be based on a fully scalable Big Data platform and will be able to host all Norwegian educational data as well as its analysis, if the need arises.
In the first project year, the system will create an import-interface to an initial set of UiB data (such as Mitt UiB learning platform) and appropriate internal representations. During the first ~2 years of the project analogous import-functionalities and representations for other external data sources, such as the FutureLearn platform and other sources, will be realized. Analysis tools for researchers, basic and advanced visualization capabilities will be implemented during later times in the project, see the milestones given below. The activities will be accompanied by the IT-operations, maintenance and user support activities over the entire lifetime of the project.

Finlay Currie plays the Yank producer Clement J. Earle momentarily fobbed off with stage trappings at the benighted residence of the penurious maven. Ken Russell happily derives a good deal of The Boy Friend from Baxter’s film, which also is a source of Curtiz’ White Christmas (“like a duck that is dy-ing”).
